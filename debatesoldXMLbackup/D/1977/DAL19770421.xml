      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>When I reported progress on this Bill yesterday I had said almost everything that I felt was necessary. When I left off I was referring to the power in section 2 of the Bill which allows a judge to ask the Government through the Minister for Justice for permission to transfer from one area to another.  I suggest to the Minister that he should try to get a <i>quid pro quo</i> in relation to this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I assume that when a judge is appointed he must consent to that appointment and the position is not forced upon him by the Government. Justices of the District Court and judges of the Circuit Court are appointed to given areas.  As I see it, section 2 gives the right to a judge to seek a transfer from one circuit to another or from one district to another. On the other hand the Government do not reserve to themselves that right. Yesterday the Minister conveyed by way of interjection that a provision of that kind would take away from the independence of the judge and take <Col N="1234" /> away the guarantee of no political interference.</P>
    <P>I am conscious of occasions when some district justice may not be performing his functions as the Government would wish and I am not talking about the straightforward party political content.  I am talking about the national interest.  Human nature being what it is, it is possible that one judge out of 59 may carry on in a manner which may not be in the national interest. I am not saying we have judges who are doing so.  I am not making any insinuations of that kind.  I am saying that it is not right for the Government to tie themselves down to such an extent, in their anxiety to be strictly impartial and to keep the law independent of party political influence, that they run the risk of having one of the judges administering the law in an improper manner.  The Minister may reply that there is a safeguard because, if he is convinced that a judge is not performing his duties and functions properly and if he can convince the Opposition of that, then the Oireachtas have the power with a two-thirds majority to dispense with the services of that judge.  The Minister should seriously consider this aspect before he finishes with this Bill.  He should seek the approval of the Oireachtas for giving the Government the right in specific instances to assign a judge from one district to another without the necessity for his consent.</P>
    <P>The Government should have this power, even if the judge or justice takes offence or takes it as a rap on the knuckles.  We have this type of operation in the Garda Síochána. Sometimes there is an adverse reaction when a commissioner decides that a garda is to be transferred from one division to another and often the press become involved.  We have had experience of this in the last couple of years.  The rules are such that a garda under the terms of his appointment can be assigned automatically to any area or division.  It is assumed that in 95 per cent of cases this does not happen.  Unfortunately, arising from this, when such a transfer takes place it is taken as a disciplinary measure.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1235" /> When the Minister made his intervention yesterday on this it was in regard to a re-assignment of a Circuit Court judge or a transfer of a district justice being taken as arising only from some sort of reprimand because of the judge or justice not carrying on his duties in the proper manner. We have the transfer arrangement and practice but always on the basis of the application of the Circuit Court judge or district justice himself, never from the point of view of pressure from the Government.  This is why I was drawing attention to the phraseology of section 4, but we can deal with that on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>On the Courts Bill one of the things I have been endeavouring to be careful about in my comments is not to earn for myself the tag of being anti-law and order.  It is extremely important in what we say in relation to our judges and justices that we be seen and heard to uphold the law of the land.  Sometimes the conduct of judges in courts can undermine confidence in or respect for them.  As Deputies have said previously, history shows that the administration of justice by our judges can truthfully be said to be second to none.  Public representatives all over the country will tell of approaches from various directions.  I suppose not a week passes without my being approached by some fellow who has been caught on a drunken driving charge or is going before the courts on any sort of charge and asked by him if I will go and see District Justice so-and-so or Judge so-and-so or, at a lower level, a superintendent or sergeant.  This is the pattern.  Good politics does not always demand that you tell the fellow to go to blazes, but I have found that it has never been politically improper for me to explain to each and every one of those people, either the offenders themselves or their representatives, that there is one thing a public representative could not and should not do and that is approach a judge or endeavour to influence a judge or district justice.  I can truthfully say that, apart from meeting some High Court judges and being introduced to them as Minister at official functions <Col N="1236" /> somewhere, I have never spoken to one of them in my life.  I have not known any of them personally before their appointments, and it might be no harm to put that on record in relation to the influence of Government Ministers in the past in the appointment of judges. The matter of respect brings me to an article in this morning's paper in connection with a young solicitor being rebuked by a district justice for not wearing a tie.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry to interrupt Deputy Lalor, but there is a convention in this House that Members neither make a charge against nor discuss the conduct or action of judges or justices, and the Chair is bound to adhere to that ruling.  I would prefer if the Deputy did not refer to a specific case or refer to a judge or a member of the judiciary in such a way that he may be identified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry.  I said yesterday that we were talking in terms of appointing 59 nameless people.  The case I referred to this morning is only one of many.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like now to comment on something the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach said yesterday in his contribution on this.  The Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach never goes wrong and is never unparliamentary, but he talked about the comments on the wearing of wigs and particular dress in court.  It is something that has been handed down. We ourselves in this Chamber feel&mdash; and I think you yourself, a Cheann Chomhairle, are most conscious of it, we should in our dress respect the House irrespective of what heat is generated.  On the other hand, I remember some time ago during a strike in a winter period general permission was given from the Chair for Deputies to come into this House wearing overcoats in specific cold conditions.  We have endeavoured to adopt a pattern, a certain decorum, in this regard.  I recall the Ceann Comhairle having occasion within the last 12 months to send messages to Deputies through the Whips when we were inclined to dispense with the wearing of ties, something that can <Col N="1237" /> happen in district courts on occasion. There is no rule in this regard but we are asked to treat the House with respect.  I compare that decision of yours, a Cheann Chomhairle, with comments that are sometimes made by judges, and particularly district justices.</P>
    <P>None of us wants to be brought before a judge.  Some people in civil cases seek occasion when they have a neighbour to take a case against that neighbour, but even the plaintiff in that context is 51 per cent happier to be able to settle the case out of court if he can so do.  I fully accept that a certain decorum be maintained.  I am referring to courts at district justice level.  Most ordinary people who may have to appear before a court for an ordinary misdemeanour such as no light on a bicycle are very nervous and their nervousness would be accentuated by a district justice commenting on their dress.  There is no rule whereby gardaí, solicitors or defendants must wear a tie in court.  Unfortunately, sometimes a fine is greater simply because the defendant is not wearing a tie.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Cooney) Patrick M. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Cooney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have never yet heard of a district justice criticising a defendant's dress. The remarks to which the Deputy refers were addressed to an officer of the court, a solicitor.  To say that a court would punish a person heavier because of his dress or lack of dress is quite outrageously wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I must again ask Deputies to keep off particular cases.  We must speak generally.  There must be no references to a particular case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>I introduced a case and I am sorry but I am trying to make a point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I have applied my remarks to the Minister as much as the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>I plead guilty to the fact that I raised the question.  I must remind the Minister that I was talking about the effect of a defendant. Assuming a district justice draws a solicitor's attention to the fact that he <Col N="1238" /> is not properly attired and subsequently the defendant arrives in court without a tie&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no question of that as far as a defendant is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister says that there is no question of that.  Does that mean that the Minister agrees that here is a law as far as solicitors are concerned?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not saying that either.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that there should be a type of decorum but in such circumstances judges should take the matter up privately with the solicitor or firm of solicitors involved or with the Incorporated Law Society and not refer to it in open court.  If the Ceann Comhairle in Dáil Éireann named certain Deputies from this side of the House referring to the fact that they had no ties, I would be very annoyed. I would consider it very indiscreet.  I would prefer if the Ceann Comhairle approached me on the matter and I would put it right.  The Ceann Comhairle should communicate with all the Whips and with the Independent Deputies to draw attention to such matters.  There is no written law in connection with the wearing of a tie but I accept that that is general practice. The same format should be followed by the judiciary.</P>
      <P>I take it that the Minister has heard my remarks and will refer to them when he is replying.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>I will give the ordinary person's point of view in relation to this Bill and I hope it will be taken as a reflection of what the ordinary people feel about the courts.  I get a distinct impression that the members of the legal profession are far too near to see the reality of the situation and the Minister who is also a member of the legal profession is somewhat at a disadvantage because he has inherited certain norms which he considers must be adhered to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During this debate it has been pointed out pretty often that individual judges are not to be criticised.  That is an extraordinary situation because individual politicians are not above <Col N="1239" /> criticism and the people have the advantage of being in a position to remove a politician at election times.  I have examined the position closely and have come to the conclusion that it is almost impossible to remove a judge. We would need a two-thirds majority in this House and because of the political affiliations of the occupants of the different benches it would be impossible to get a two-thirds majority for this purpose.  It is extraordinary that judges cannot be criticised lest they be identified by the people who represent the country here who are the subject of every criticism that everyone can throw at them.</P>
    <P>In many cases the decisions given by judges run contrary to common sense. This should not be so.  I realise there has been a great delay in getting cases to the High Court or even listed for hearing and I accept there is need to hurry things up because in many cases great hardship is caused by delay. Ideally we should have an instant type of justice.  I understand the difficulties in the preparation of cases but it might be a good idea to examine the situation to find out what hours judges work at all.</P>
    <P>The case has been made that judges find it necessary to spend a good deal of time at home in their libraries looking up law books and searching for precedents for individual cases, precedents which might ultimately affect their decisions but this whole situation of the work range of judges needs to be examined.  However, I would impress on the Minister that in the event of such an examination taking place, the task should not be left solely to the members of the legal profession because at that stage the ordinary person's point of view might be helpful also.</P>
    <P>There is need, too, for a change in our attitude to juvenile crime and to the juvenile courts.  I agree with much that has been written in this regard. It has been suggested that it would be helpful and less inhibiting to the young people appearing in those courts if ordinary garb were donned by the justices and others concerned.  If it can be proved that this is true, the practice <Col N="1240" /> might profitably be extended to the other courts.</P>
    <P>Deputy Briscoe referred to the delay in bringing people before the courts. In regard to young offenders it might be worthwhile having a night court&mdash; a cúirt an mheán oíche.  This would be the ideal situation for the dispensing of speedy justice.  Cases could be dealt with while they were still fresh in the minds of the offenders.  It would be a matter of associating the punishment with the crime because it would not be removed too far chronologically from the punishment.</P>
    <P>In effect the Bill provides for the appointment of one extra judge and for the permanent appointment of those who are operating in a temporary capacity.  It is a measure that might be regarded as the last parting shot of the Coalition, a Bill to round off the greatest political patronage spree ever embarked on by any political party anywhere.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I detect a note of envy in that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>So well might the Minister smile.  He has achieved what his party set out to achieve and nowhere is this more exemplified than in the appointment of judges at all levels.  I have retained a copy of <i>Hibernia</i> in which there appeared a fairly lengthy article concerning the political patronage shown in the courts by this Government.  The article pointed, too, to some instances of political patronage on the part of this party while in office but Fine Gael may be said to have out-Heroded Herod in this regard. Unfortunately, I was not able to find that article this morning in my overcrowded desk at home but I recall it clearly.  The conclusion to be drawn from it is that whether the appointment be that of Chief Justice, of Attorney General or of a judge at any level, the over-riding prerequisite was to have been attached to Fine Gael and to have been rejected by the electorate.  It would appear that the more often one was rejected by the electorate, the better was one's chance of securing a position on the bench.  Because of their attitude to the just society policy, some people may have withdrawn from politics but so far as the appointment <Col N="1241" /> of judges at all levels is concerned, all in the past four years have been political hacks of Fine Gael.  They can now languish in regal luxury in their new appointments.  In addition, they can cut themselves adrift from the politics they espoused.  As dispensers of justice they must do that but perhaps that suits their game now.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will have heard my earlier rulings on this matter when I referred to possible reflections on members of the judiciary. I would ask the Deputy to choose his words more carefully in that regard lest he cast reflections on existing members of the bench.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>My intention is to cast reflection on the appointment and on the method of appointment of those existing members.  That is what the people who sent me here would wish me to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I must point out that it is the convention that members may neither make a charge against nor discuss the conduct or actions of judges or justices.  If a specific charge is to be made against a judge it can be made only by way of the tabling of a substantive motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>The charge I make is that those who were appointed by the Coalition to be judges at all levels were members of Fine Gael and had offered themselves for election.  The Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach indicated that once judges were appointed politics did not enter into their decisions.  Perhaps I could agree with that but he was so adamant in making that point as to give the impression that he had had a doubt in his mind in this regard but that the doubt had been dispelled.  It is my contention that a political animal does not change his spots on becoming a judge and that while his decisions might not be unduly political they would be coloured by his political thinking and his approach to life up to the time of his appointment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would doubt the calibre of those who have been appointed judges.  Some of them may not have been very <Col N="1242" /> successful in their own profession and their appointments may have been merely a way of finding handy jobs for them.  The only tribute I would pay them is that they were good judges in choosing the political party most likely to offer them the best perks afterwards.</P>
    <P>This Bill is a perpetuation of the policy embarked on by the Coalition since 1973 and it reflects strongly and strangely the guarantees given in the Coalition's manifesto, better known as the 14-point plan, in which they promised to help transform Ireland into a successful progressive society based on social justice.  That, they said, is what Fine Gael in Government would mean.  I would say to them that their actions have besmirched the concept of justice in so far as the appointment of judges is concerned, rendering it difficult for the ordinary person to have credence in the courts.  The previous speaker told us that it would be his desire to stay as far away as possible from courts.  He said that the general consensus of opinion is that there is no guarantee of achieving justice in a court.  This is due partly to the ramifications of the law.  In many instances the decisions given are so dreadful that they undermine the credence of the ordinary person in regard to the dispensing of justice.  In what other profession could one find so many of the decisions arrived at by people who supposedly are competent being reversed, appealed to a higher court, perhaps appealed again and rejected again in a still higher court? If, say, a doctor, a carpenter or a person in any other profession were to differ to the extent that members of the legal profession differ, I think they would be struck off if there was a body to strike them off.</P>
    <P>The ordinary person has no great faith in the justice being meted out in the courts.  I have seen the case of a man sentenced for rape or attempted carnal knowledge and subsequently this sentence was quashed and the culprit went scot free.  This is no help in the restoration of the faith of the ordinary person in justice.  It is well known that individual judges have their little idiosyncracies and pet aversions and <Col N="1243" /> pet tolerances and a clever solicitor will arrange that it is possible that a particular appeal or case will come before the particular judge most likely to be lenient with the crime his client is accused of.  Because of this, morale in the Garda has gone very low.  Their good work is being set at nought by judges with particular minds of their own.  We have seen instances of gardaí, who have done their duty to the best of their capacity and the limit of the resources allowed to them, coming to court and there finding themselves in the unusual situation that they are the ones being abused by the judge in reaching his decision.</P>
    <P>There has been a lot of talk about law and order.  I am sorry to say that we have witnessed a rapid erosion of order.  People are attacked and robbed and the most glaring offences go unpunished. Deputy Esmonde mentioned yesterday that garage attendants were no longer being coshed.  This is because the culprits are now after bigger game, postmistresses, bank managers and pay clerks.  They are calling to houses openly in daytime stripping them of their contents and never being caught.  A bank raid or a robbery every day is now commonplace. The solution, as all the members of our party who have spoken on this believe, is to appoint more gardaí, have more men on the beat and have more help for gardaí.  Our party are committed to this, to provide money for it and to restore the security people once knew in this country.</P>
    <P>Our intention in Government would be to work towards this and give every help financial and otherwise to restore the morale and confidence of the gardaí and assist them in every way to carry out their work.  From my limited knowledge and from what people tell me, I believe a complete overhaul of the court system is needed. The archaic garb that we have, the bewigged and sometimes bemused judges have no place in the 20th century and I do not think that it helps the cause of justice to have the principal participants in the drama in fancy dress.  Legal people will say they do not understand this view.  I <Col N="1244" /> do not understand how a closed shop like the legal profession should assume that they are the sole repository of all that is good for the people.  Their outlook is very fusty and musty.  With the passage of time many members of the legal profession have become so constipated with their own regulations that they are unable to fulfil their primary function of seeing that justice is meted out and letting this be clearly seen.  A change in our courts system is long overdue.</P>
    <P>References have been made in the debate to the attitude to punishment, corporal and other types of punishment. Our attitude in this regard has become clouded by the contributions of thin-skinned humanitarians who may be well intentioned but in many cases are ill-advised.  The sweeping statement was recently made in the House that corporal punishment has proved not to be a deterrent to crime. It has not been proved to my satisfaction. I notice that there is a motion of long-standing on the Order Paper in the names of certain Deputies regarding the complete removal of corporal punishment from our schools. It amazes me that some of the Deputies who have added their names to this motion are bachelor Deputies who have no knowledge of what goes on in schools other than in the dim and distant days when they were at school themselves.  I am not aware that they have shown any great interest in education up to now but they probably think that this is a bandwagon to step on.  In the Isle of Man it has been proved that corporal punishment has been a deterrent for criminals and wrongdoers.  I think the birch has been retained and it has been shown that in an island subjected for most of the year to an influx of visitors and people likely to be highspirited and well-loaded from many points of view and likely to be wrongdoers people are deterred from misbehaving by the very law that has been retained there.  Perhaps corporal punishment is the answer to some of the animal-like antics of the hooligans, vandals and bully boys we read about daily.</P>
    <P>These are not just my thoughts <Col N="1245" /> alone.  As I said earlier, they represent opinions expressed to me by sensible men and women old enough to remember a way of life that was different. Perhaps it was physically harder but it had its rewards in the absence of much of the badness that we accept as the norm today.  I have given my impressions as an ordinary person about the courts.  It seems that we have laws galore but a sad lack of order. I have instanced what I see as a complete breakdown of law and order in the last few years.  I do not say it began in February or March, 1973; it is something that has been happening but it has accelerated in the past few years and we must give immediate attention to it.  Action is now needed to restore some measure of confidence in the courts as dispensers of justice and to give added strength to the gardaí to maintain that justice and ensure that a much higher percentage of wrongdoers are brought to justice. The cold facts that emerge possibly two years late when we see the crime statistics should cause much soulsearching among those concerned with the dispensation of justice.  In many cases well over half the people who commit crimes go free.  The Garda have reached the stage with their forces so stretched and thin on the ground and with the added work given to them that they are no longer able to deal with the ordinary crime that they would have dealt with as routine. Because of the time lag, the lack of resources and the lack of numbers unless a crime is very serious they cannot give much attention to it.  It is our duty to ensure that they will get the backing of the courts and that we use our resources to improve the strength of the Garda.  The Minister has indicated to me in answering parliamentary questions that it is not his function to reprimand members of the court.  It should be somebody's function.  Once these judges are appointed they cannot be above criticism all the time. It should be conveyed to them that we are not satisfied with the type of justice being meted out by them, and that they have a duty to back up the Garda when they bring cases to court and ensure that the majority of wrongdoers realise that crime does not pay.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ruairí Brugha</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill before the Dáil to increase the membership in some categories of our judicial system is welcome.  Anybody who has some information about the problems in the courts nowadays&mdash;and I have got a lot &mdash;will understand that we cannot deal with the backlog unless we appoint people to do the work.  Unfortunately, an increase in court personnel, in judges and district justices, as proposed here, can easily be justified by the actual increase in the level of crime. One could say it is a criticism of the modern State in recent years that the level of crime has been increasing more rapidly than the gross national product has been increasing.  Perhaps one of the causes for the increase in the level of crime may be the increase in the possession of this world's goods on the part of a large number of people creating a greater degree of envy and dissatisfaction on the part of those who have not yet achieved that status.</P>
      <P>If the situation is explained to them the public will support this measure, as this side of the House will, and if they believe it will lead to a reduction in the level of crime.  It is natural to query &mdash;as I have heard it queried in the past few weeks&mdash;why it is necessary to make the appointments of five district justices permanent.  There is a suspicion in the minds of people that this may relate to the fact that this is an election year.  I have been reading some of the debate of yesterday which I did not have time to attend and I note comments on both sides about political appointments.  It is commonplace for people to believe legal appointments are always based on the political attitude of the persons appointed.  I know this is not always necessarily the case. Certainly on a number of occasions in the period of the last Administration people who were quite obviously not supporters of the Fianna Fáil Party were appointed.  One would hope both sides of the House would begin to approach this question from the point of view of appointment on merit and ability.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But the criticism I have heard about appointments made over the past four years is that they tended to be largely appointments of persons whose sympathies would be with one or other of <Col N="1247" /> the parties in the Coalition.  Leaving aside entirely any question of criticism of the people appointed, I presume they have ability&mdash;the danger I see is&mdash;and you sense this and hear it in casual conversations; it is nothing you will see written, nothing you will hear normally from public platforms, but what you will hear in ordinary pub talk; the kind of cynicism which is encouraged by the suspicion in people's minds about legal appointments being political.</P>
    <P>There is great public concern and a tremendous feeling of frustration on all sides in our community, and a feeling of mystification at what people, using their own short-term judgement, regard as extraordinary leniency in some cases and also the frequency with which cases of a relatively serious nature in connection with petty crime, burglary, and so on, are dismissed on technicalities. I am not engaging in criticism of our judicial system so much as in trying to convey what people are saying and feeling.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that, to a considerable extent, the operation of our legal system is in grave danger of coming into public contempt and lack of confidence.  Those of us who are as busy as I am in politics and other areas have not got time to investigate and examine cases, but one hears of too many cases of people on remand on bail being charged again for offences committed while on bail, offences similar to those for which they were remanded.  Yesterday speakers on both sides of the House dealt with the extraordinary delays in dealing with cases.  Of course, if this is due to a shortage of judges and district justices, the Bill is all the more welcome.  Indeed, one questions whether the numbers involved here, whether temporary or permanent, are sufficient if the backlog is anything like what has been mentioned in this House.</P>
    <P>One wonders whether it is the judges or justices who are the cause of the delays or whether the machinery itself is getting knotted up.  Naturally one does not want to advocate taking short cuts in dealing with justice and prosecutions for crimes.  From what I hear, laymen and women want to know why <Col N="1248" /> so many people are able to get bail&mdash; I know what the legal reasons are&mdash; and are relatively free to commit further crimes.</P>
    <P>Another question which comes up in connection with the whole situation regarding prosecutions in the courts is the attitude of the Garda to their jobs in recent years.  There seems to be a considerable lowering of morale and possibly even a growing indifference. Perhaps it is due to too many petty regulations and shortage of personnel. The whole question of the level of morale of the Garda is, first of all, the responsibility of the Government in office.  Secondly, it may be attributed to the personnel and human relations situation obtaining from time to time in such a large organisation as the Garda Síochána.  Although, perhaps, inevitable that type of lowering of the level of morale may be the result of too great an emphasis being placed on hours, regulations and discipline and too little on the public service aspect of their work.</P>
    <P>One hears daily&mdash;and indeed in this House at Question Time&mdash;stories of the shortage of manpower not alone for dealing with cases in the courts but in the investigation of petty crime. Unfortunately, from what I have learned in the past couple of months it is quite clear that gardaí and detective officers are unable to keep up with the increasing number of burglaries and petty crimes of one type or another. Judging from what I hear, some gardaí reach the situation fairly quickly in which they feel it is not really worthwhile getting down to the job of investigating some minor offence, such as damage to a motor car or burglary of a house because they believe they will not have time, that they will be called to another immediately.  Criticism in this area can be levelled on several grounds.  One is the insufficiency of gardaí.  Its consequences mean that, certainly in this city, it is becoming dangerous for people to go out late in the evening.  A more recent development is that it is even becoming dangerous to stay in one's own home.  It is not sufficient to point to this sort of thing as a criticism of the Government without, at the same time, pinpointing some of the basic causes <Col N="1249" /> of the problem.  One of which we are aware is the need to have such a large number of gardaí on security duties, particularly on the Border, in order to deal with breaches of law by any one of the para-military elements engaging in illegal activities in this country.</P>

      <P>I am sure the Minister will not fault me if I endeavour to deal with some of these items.  I shall be very brief.  In connection with court work and the partial break-down of law we have here, it is necessary to point to the contrast in people's minds of the situation obtaining on Saturday last when there were approximately 750 gardaí on security duty and the fact that one can park one's car somewhere, come back a couple of hours later and find it has been broken into but that nobody is going to do anything about it.  That is a critical comment on how things are going.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is fairly obvious that there is a major backlog of work in the courts all of us would wish to see cleared. I find it difficult not to refer to the <Col N="1250" /> situation obtaining in the country&mdash;I am not speaking of the political situation but the general situation relating to crime&mdash;because I believe that some responsibility lies on all of us and particularly on the Government to ensure that the general standard is raised.  For example, there is the matter of the social consequences and the responsibility we all have for them, creating a large number of criminal, as distinct from civil, cases in the courts.  I believe that the level of petty crime is rising to such an extent that it may be necessary for the Government to consider additional measures for getting a greater degree of public co-operation with the Garda in this area.  I do not mean that people are not prepared to co-operate with the Garda.  The real problem is that they do not know how.  All they know is that when something goes wrong they should complain and, having complained, if nothing happens they become somewhat cynical.  In relation to the overall situation, it might be useful were the Minister to consider some means of creating a more active type of co-operation between the Garda and citizens&mdash;even on temporary grounds&mdash;in an endeavour to raise the level generally and re-inject confidence in our Administration, the Garda and the courts system generally.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Dublin Central) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Dublin Central)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> I should like to make a few brief comments on this Bill and its contents.  Any Bill dealing with such an important institution of State must be taken seriously by this House.  We must protect our various institutions, from the President, the Judiciary, the Executive to the Oireachtas, all of them being important to the society in which we live and on which we depend.  It is vitally important that they function.  How they function also must be important to us in this House and, of course, to every citizen.  From time to time, naturally, we hear criticism of various functions.  That is a natural, human failing; none of us is perfect.  If there is any criticism levelled at the judiciary I suppose we in this House can share a measure of the blame.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1251" /> During the years we had some excellent men on the bench and I for one would not attempt to weaken that institution in any way because of the importance of ensuring that the people can see that justice is being done.  If at any time this situation does not apply in any case, the Minister for Justice could use his influence diplomatically. I have heard criticism of various decisions, but generally the judiciary have carried out their job in a reasonable and fair fashion.</P>
    <P>The Bill is welcome because of its purpose to speed up litigation.  We have had complaints about back-logs. The Bill will increase the number of judges by one and make permanent some of the justices who are already there.  From the point of view of what it does the Bill does not seem to be all that urgent and one wonders if there is an ulterior motive in it.  Of far more importance is the strengthening of our security, particularly the matter of law and order in our cities and larger towns.  The breakdown in law and order and the increased criminal rate, particularly in the past eight years, has been referred to by other Deputies.  Our main attention should be directed to improving this situation because we cannot permit the slide of the past eight or nine years to continue unchecked.  It is a major problem already and it should involve all of us, the judiciary, the Garda and civilians&mdash; all should combine to check the break-down of law and order and render our cities and larger towns safe for our people.</P>
    <P>I had not time to listen to the debate but I have read statements by Deputies about the frustration of the Garda when people found guilty of serious crimes of robbery with violence and of violence against the person are released on bail. Two nights ago I was at a meeting at which this question was raised and, of course, this applies to the whole city of Dublin as well as to Dublin Central. Sometimes people convicted of numerous crimes of violence and theft are released on bail and are back in the city streets the same evening.  This is frustrating not only for the Garda who <Col N="1252" /> have brought them to justice but for the people among whom they live. Positive steps will have to be taken in this matter because allowing such people free is only licensing them to repeat their crimes.  The Government will have to look seriously at the position. I do not think that a sentence of three or four months in Mountjoy is a deterrent to those people.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> I am expressing the opinion that I do not think that a sentence of four or five months is a deterrent to such people.  Most of them are unemployed, and a far better deterrent would be to put them to work and get them back to prison at weekends. People who do damage to property or injury to the person should be hit in their livelihoods.  They should be made to compensate their victims.  A far greater penalty than a short period in prison would be to have damages deducted from their incomes.  As I have said, they should be put out to work and brought back to prison at weekends.</P>

        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> Not to the extent that I should like it to happen.  If those people were made to pay £200 or £300 or £400 it would serve as a much greater punishment.  The Minister said he intends to increase the number of gardaí, particularly in the larger cities and towns.  The sooner this is done the better because in my constituency we are experiencing an astronomical increase in crime.  It is not enough to put 500 or even 1,000 extra gardaí on duty.  The whole process of the administration of justice will have to be speeded up because the public are seriously concerned about their own safety and the safety of their children. This trend must be checked no matter what it costs.  It exists in the centre of the city and has spread to the suburbs. We do not wish to reach a situation like that which obtains in large cities in Europe and America.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> I accept the ruling of the Chair in regard to this and I assure the Chair that it is not my intention to delay the House to any great extent or go outside the scope of the Bill but the matters I have mentioned are causing concern.  The whole question of litigation is causing concern to many people.  Everybody is concerned about the cumbersome method of litigation in civil cases.  I cannot understand that complicated method or why it takes so long for a case to be heard in the High Court and why the cost is so high.  There must be a simpler method.  The existing method deters a lot of people from pursuing cases.  People find they must brief a barrister, are then told a senior counsel is necessary and then must wait a long time before the case is heard.  When the case comes to trial they must spend two to three days in the court and then pay huge fees. Many people wonder then if it was all worth while.  It must be possible to devise a more simplified and less costly procedure.  The average citizen can never understand why it costs so much to bring a case to court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been a lot of criticism about appointing people to the bench. I am not sure if any other system has been investigated or whether the appointments should be taken out of the political arena.  In my view the appointment of a person to the bench should always be on merit.  I hope that will be the practice in future.  If it happens, there will not be any criticism of future appointments.  Fianna Fáil appointed people to the bench who were not members of that party and they made excellent judges.  If judges are appointed on merit, there will be more respect for our judiciary. It is of vital importance that people can trust our courts.  Too many people do not respect our courts and we do not want to encourage any more.  We must also increase the number of gardaí and promote co-operation between the judiciary and <Col N="1254" /> the police force.  They have a difficult job.  It can happen that in bringing people before a court there might be a slight omission but I do not think policemen should be criticised for such omissions.  The judiciary and the police force are playing an important role in removing the cancer which is prevailing in our society.  People think they can rob and damage our system and get away with it and we must all contribute to eliminating that attitude.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Cooney) Patrick M. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Cooney)</NameTxt>
      <P>The main purpose of the Bill is, as I indicated in my opening speech, to provide for two extra judges in the complement of the High Court.  I took advantage of the Bill to regularise the position with regard to temporary members of the Circuit and District Courts.  The debate has strayed into many byways which would have some connection with the courts in a general debate on crime, policing and sentencing but I do not propose to follow the debate down those byways because I would be out of order having regard to the rulings of the Chair in the course of the debate.  Therefore, Deputies will understand if I do not make reference to such contributions.  The increase in the number of High Court judges is sought for one reason only, to ensure the expeditious disposal of the business of that court.  In my opening speech I indicated the rate of growth of business in the High Court.  It is substantial.  I also indicated that when I took office in 1973 the time-lag between the setting down of a jury action and the hearing of that jury action was about 12 months.  That, of course, was an extraordinary long delay and to cure that position we sought and were given power by the Dáil in 1973 to increase the number of High Court judges from six to seven.  That comparatively small increase did have the effect of bringing down the time-lag in the case of jury trials from 12 months to five months in mid-1975.  That was not an unreasonable delay because very often the parties would require that length of time to do their final preparation for a hearing and it is unlikely parties would be ready any sooner than that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position remained satisfactory for some time but in the last 18 months <Col N="1255" /> the time-lag has begun to expand and at the moment it is now ten months. That is too long because the trend is unfavourable.  If we do not take remedial action now, this time-lag will become wider and that would be unjust and lead to injustices.  We are asking the Oireachtas for the power to appoint two extra judges to the High Court to ensure that cases will come for a speedy trial and that there will not be an unreasonable delay between the setting down and the taking place of the trial. As I indicated, there has to be some delay because the parties require an interval between the setting down and the hearing of a case to do the final preparations. If the interval mentioned was the only thing involved in bringing a case to court one might say that a number of months is not unreasonable.</P>
    <P>Perhaps it would be as well if I explained the actual process.  When a person wants to go to law he gives instructions to his solicitor and then the legal process is put in motion. Deputies have quite rightly said it is a cumbersome process and a slow process. However, before a matter comes to the stage of setting down an immense amount of work has to be done behind the scenes.  That work can take varying lengths of time, depending on the complexity of the case, the efficiency of those concerned and the ease with which they can accumulate the information to process the case through its various stages. There are always two sides&mdash;two solicitors' offices, two sets of barristers &mdash;and it is not just a question of the efficiency of one side but the efficiency of perhaps five, six or more lawyers all busy in various ways.  In addition, and I would be the first to admit this, it is a somewhat cumbersome process because before a case comes to be set down there must be a substantial lapse of time, avoidable or unavoidable, and in all fairness I would say sometimes avoidable.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick queried the cumbersome machine and asked why this litigious process has to be so complex and so much of a mystery to the layman affected by it.  The idea is <Col N="1256" /> clearly to isolate the issues for trial in an exchange of documents so that each party will know precisely what is facing him and there will be no question of ploys or subterfuges or surprises being sprung at the last minute which a party would not have time to consider and deal with.  There is a valid reason for the delay in the pretrial pleading stage.  It is designed to isolate the issues and make sure they are presented in proper fashion so that each side is fully aware of what is involved.</P>
    <P>That process must take place before a case comes for trial and it can be a pretty lengthy process in many instances.  It can be anything from a year to 18 months or two years in the High Court.  If you add to that the time-lag between the setting down and the actual hearing of a further 12 months, and that is the position at the moment, then the delay is very long.  All I can do as Minister for Justice is to ensure that that part of the process from the setting down to the actual hearing is kept as short as possible, and that is the purpose of asking here for extra judges.  The appointment of an extra judge in 1973 had the effect of reducing the time-lag and I am hopeful that the extra judges being appointed now will have the same effect and bring the time-lag back down to a reasonable interval again.</P>
    <P>On the subject of the pretrial process, the pleadings process, I should tell the House there is a Bill at an advanced stage of preparation which will make considerable changes in the pretrial process.  Most of these arise out of recommendations of the Committee on Court Practice and Procedure.  The jurisdiction of the Master of the High Court will be enhanced.  Certain preliminary hearings will be done away with and agreement on professional reports will be made on matters which will be formally pleaded and ruled on by the trial court.  I hope the Bill will give power to agree professional reports because this will remedy a difficulty Deputy O'Kennedy and other speakers mentioned.  I refer to the difficulty of professional witnesses having to spend a day or two waiting around in the <Col N="1257" /> Four Courts because the case in which they are involved does not come to hearing as soon as expected.  In the Bill I hope it will be possible to provide for agreement on professional matters so that the presence of professional witnesses will not be necessary and the position of the litigants and their solicitors and lawyers will be eased.  I agree with Deputy O'Kennedy and others who said there is a tendency to settle when parties are frustrated because of delay and they are under pressure from surgeons, engineers and other professional people who cannot be hanging around the Four Courts.  It is hoped that pressure will be removed completely by the proposed new procedure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>There will be enhanced jurisdiction for the Master of the High Court and there will be various provisions designed to speed up the pleadings part of litigation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the fixing of the list, this is not, as Members will be aware, a matter in which I have any say.  It is a matter within the jurisdiction of the presidents of the various courts.  A certain number of cases is put into the list for a particular day but there can be no guarantee they will be heard on that particular day.  The alternative would be to fix only one case.  That is the only way in which there could be certainty.  Many things can happen. Cases may be settled.  Cases may be adjourned for some good and proper reason.  Cases may commence and be settled half way through or perhaps dismissed half way through.  If only one case were listed and any of these eventualities occurred valuable judicial time would be wasted.  More than one case must be listed and, if the first case being heard continues for a couple of days, then those involved in the later cases listed may have to keep returning to court for two or three days in a row before their case is called.  That is unavoidable.  To ease the position it is now the practice for <Col N="1258" /> the High Court to go out on circuit for jury actions in various provincial centres&mdash;Cork, Galway, Limerick, I think Sligo&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>And Kilkenny.  This is a very commendable development because it is easier for litigants to attend and have their professional advisers. They have greater certainty of a quick hearing and the delays which were encountered in the Four Courts are obviated by this procedure.</P>
      <P>Internal matters relating to the day-to-day administration of the courts are matters for the presidents concerned. They do not concern me as Minister for Justice.  I am concerned to ensure that the presidents have enough personnel available to them and that is why I am asking for sanction for two extra judges to ensure speedy justice.</P>
      <P>The opportunity is being taken in this Bill to regularise the position of judges and justices serving in a temporary capacity and to make their appointments permanent.  For the last decade or so it has invariably happened that when a vacancy among the permanent judges or justices arose it was filled automatically by the appointment of the senior serving temporary justice.  This happened automatically irrespective of what Administration was in office.  The suggestion by some Members of the Opposition that the real motive behind the power here is to ensure that, should there be a change of Government, then the present temporary judges will be permanent one way or the other.  I reject that because the history of both Administrations show that there is no substance whatever in that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know.  All I can do is speak for this Administration. The vacancies for permanent judges were filled by this Administration strictly on the seniority of the temporary justices without reference to what administration appointed them, and I would like to think that that would continue to be the pattern. <Col N="1259" /> So far as I am concerned I am satisfied that it will be the pattern.  The suggestion from the other side that the power to make the present corps of temporary justices permanent was to ensure that there would be no change in their status is unreal.  I have no fear that there will be any change in their status in the event, albeit most unlikely, of a change of Administration in the years to come or, indeed, in the year to come.  The position is that for some years past temporary judges, when appointed, have served continuously without a break in their service. I think it is a very long time, possibly more than a decade, since a person went back to practise from the bench.  The Bill is recognising the reality of the situation and is making those men permanent.  In addition, they have been prejudiced in their pension rights, because their temporary service had not been reckoned for pension purposes.  Even though they had served full time, part of their service had to be disregarded, and this of course was an injustice to them.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Kennedy raised the question of arrears in the Circuit Court.  I have dealt with the question of arrears in the High Court.  The arrears situation in the High Court was becoming serious in relation to jury actions; there is no problem in regard to non-jury actions.  I hope the remedial measures proposed in the Bill will be successful this time as they were the last time in assessing the position in regard to jury actions.  The position in regard to the Circuit Court is also unsatisfactory both in relation to civil and criminal business.  Deputy O'Kennedy's figure of 10,000 civil cases awaiting hearing is not accurate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I was about to make that point that we are speaking only of the Dublin Circuit Court.  With one possible exception in the provincial circuit&mdash;and it would be invidious to mention it&mdash;there are no arrears in the Circuit Court throughout the country. The only circuit where there is any <Col N="1260" /> difficulty in that regard is the Dublin Circuit Court.</P>
      <P>My information is that the return of cases undisposed of at 31st December, 1976, under the heading of civil actions was 880 and the approximate lapse of time between the date of setting down and listing is eight months, which is of course considerably less than the present lapse of time in the High Court.  That is a large figure but of that 880 regard must be had to the fact that a sizeable proportion of them will never come to hearing at all; that they are far on is part of the tactics of litigation.</P>
      <P>The other type of case where there is a large number awaiting hearing is malicious injury applications, with a figure of 6,800, and the waiting period there for corporation cases is six months.  I have a note &ldquo;15 months others&rdquo;; what the others can be I do not know but possibly county council cases come into it.  However, corporation cases would be the vast bulk of them and a waiting period of six months is not excessive.  Again I would hope to see legislation some time which would speed up malicious injury cases. In practice the parties now have them speeded up as far as possible by agreeing damages, and I think possibly unofficially agreeing there is no contest on the question of malice.  Therefore the only cases that are contested are those where there is a serious disagreement on the amount of the damage&mdash;and they are rare&mdash;or where there is not an admission of malice by the respondent. While the figure is high the waiting period is comparatively short, and these cases can be dealt with speedily.</P>

    <P>The most unsatisfactory aspect of the Dublin Circuit Court is with regard to criminal work both by way of appeal from the District Court and by way of hearing indictable cases before a jury.  There are 820 criminal cases on indictment awaiting hearing, and there can be a lapse of 24 months before they come for hearing.  That is the maximum period.  There were 1,602 District Court appeals undisposed of at 31st December, 1976.  The interval for hearing them in non-road traffic cases was about seven months.  In road traffic cases the interval for hearing them <Col N="1261" /> could be up to 15 months, but in the non-road traffic cases, which would be the more urgent ones, there is an interval of about seven months.</P>
    <P>The Deputies opposite made the point that there are no extra judges being provided for the Circuit Court. I take that point, and, in view of the figures I was given, I suppose there is added point to the question being raised opposite.  However, there is a serious physical difficulty, namely, accommodation.  Even if we had more Circuit Court judges to deal with the more urgent cases, which would be criminal cases involving a jury, there would have to be courts with jury facilities available, and unfortunately they are just not available.  Deputies will know that the Four Courts Hotel has been purchased, and by using the extra space it provides for us, we will be able to get more accommodation in the Four Courts and the Four Courts Hotel site itself.  When there are more jury rooms available extra judges may then have to be appointed perhaps on a temporary basis&mdash;because the power to appoint temporary judges has not been repealed; it is still on the Statute Book&mdash;to deal with the backlog.</P>
    <P>That obviously is long-term, but there was a shorter term hope in the sense that accommodation has been obtained adjacent to the Four Courts and it is intended that this accommodation will be used to house Circuit Court staff from within the Four Courts building itself.  As a result the space within the Four Courts building will become available for a new Circuit Court jury room within the next nine to 12 months.  In the meantime, arrangements have been made between the presidents that should there be any idle High Court jury facilities they will be available for Circuit Court work.  Again arrangements are made with the general corps of Circuit Court judges that, should there be a slack period on a circuit, the particular judge will be available to come to Dublin to assist in clearing the backlog.</P>
    <P>The position with regard to the Dublin Circuit Court is that we are constrained in what we can do by lack of court accomodation.  That is being compensated for in two ways: first, by <Col N="1262" /> making the fullest use of existing High Court accommodation when available and, as the High Court goes out from time to time to hear jury actions in provincial centres, there will be more spare High Court space available.  It will be used by utilising the services of country Circuit Court judges.  The second way in which the arrears are being tackled is by the provision of an extra permanent Circuit Court jury court in the Four Courts complex.  I would hope that the arrears in the Circuit Court in Dublin will be obviated completely but it is important to emphasise that this is in Dublin only.</P>
    <P>We are providing extra court space for cases involving family law.  There will be two new courts provided, one for the High Court and its exercise in that jurisdiction and the other for the District Court in exercising its functions under the recent Family Law (Maintenance of Spouses and Children) Act and the Family Home Protection Act.  This is very desirable because I am aware of the unsatisfactory position mentioned by Deputy O'Kennedy where these sensitive cases have to be heard in the District Court.  The parties involved in the case may be in an emotional state and they have to appear publicly awaiting the hearing of their case.  We are providing accommodation in a new office block adjacent to the Four Courts and work has started to provide court rooms, waiting rooms and consulting rooms so that the parties involved in these family law cases will have a certain amount of privacy in their affairs.  The same will apply for the parties involved in High Court family law cases.  They will have a separate suite of offices, consulting rooms and a court in the same building.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Kennedy raised the point that in cases of this type, particularly cases held in chambers involving children, wigs and gowns should be dispensed with, that the presence of those paraphernalia, if I might use that word, with regard to barristers' dress&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;could inhibit the parties from expressing themselves completely and fully and make the proceedings slightly rigid, that somehow less than full justice would be done and the feelings of the people involved would not be fully satisfactory. I take the point and I would be inclined to agree with it.  I can see the arguments in favour of a certain solemnity in our courts.  Our courts should have a certain solemnity and formality about their proceedings so that the proceedings themselves and the judges are respected and the orders and rules are fully obeyed.  That should be the general climate of opinion with regard to our courts because they are the places where citizens arbitrate between each other and where the State and the citizen can come in contact and have their disputes arbitrated also.  If one were to remove wigs and gowns in one court because they have this effect then, logically, their removal in other courts should be considered.  This is a subject on which I should like to see a debate develop.  It was brave of Deputy O'Kennedy, coming from his profession, to let in the thin end of that wedge.  I can see many good reasons why the wigs and gowns should be done away with and I can see good reasons why they should be retained. I should welcome a debate, particularly with contributions from the members of the profession.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>This is one which I can imagine continuing for a long time, with no great urgency on the part of anybody to bring it to a conclusion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position in the District Court is satisfactory so far as arrears are concerned. The number of justices was substantially increased some years ago. The number of temporary justices was increased from one to five because at that time there were a large number of justices suffering from illness.  We have retained those persons in a temporary capacity because it has led to a more expeditious despatch of the <Col N="1264" /> business of the District Court.  Again, this is a Dublin problem.  The President of the High Court is making available the High Court during vacation periods for District Court business and we will also be using part of the Four Courts Hotel premises as the District Court, pending the total development of that area. There are no arrears of the type we have in the Dublin Circuit Court.</P>
    <P>Deputy Callanan raised a question about the length of a judge's working day.  That is something which varies from court to court and from judge to judge and justice to justice.  Generally speaking, judges and justices work as hard as the number of cases before them requires.  The High Court sits at 11 o'clock until 1 o'clock, rises for an hour or possibly less, and then sits until 4 o'clock or 4.30 on five days a week.  The provincial Circuit Court usually sits on a Tuesday from 11 o'clock until 1 o'clock, then from 2 o'clock until possibly 4.30 or 5 o'clock. It is becoming more and more common in provincial areas for the Circuit Court to sit until 7 o'clock or 8 o'clock at night.  This is becoming quite a regular occurrence, and if the parties and the practitioners wish it the judges have made themselves available to sit on and finish the list. The number of hours a court sits will depend on the demand from the parties and will also depend on the complexities of a case which the judge is hearing or the jury listening to.  If judges sit for too long and ask juries to sit for too long, attention may wander and the sharp attention that cases may need may not be given to them.  While the hours in some instances might appear short there is very often a good reason for that.  I am satisfied that where extra hours are needed they will be provided by the courts.</P>
    <P>The question of the vacations of the court is another matter and I think it is now time to look at this.  In the summer there is the long vacation.  I recollect from my study of legal history as a student that the basis for the long vacation was that in medieval times judges had to have a long vacation at that time in order to get in <Col N="1265" /> their crops.  I think we can agree that that situation no longer applies and the number of judges involved in getting in their crops would be few indeed. The length of that vacation may have to be considered.</P>
    <P>From things I hear in moving around it would be conceded widely that it is somewhat long, and valuable extra time might be got there.  There is no unwillingness on the part of the vast majority of members of the judiciary to work as hard as has to be worked to ensure dealing with the cases.  Judges from the country circuits have indicated that whenever their circuits are short of work they will be available to come to Dublin and relieve the backlog there.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>There might be a counter-suggestion from that source that the long vacation here is also a little bit extreme.  We will have to watch that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>One has to consider the relative value of the two institutions. People might be relieved that we go on a long vacation.  I think it was Deputy O'Kennedy who raised the question of the age of majority and mentioned the anomalous situation that you can have a jury with jurors of 18 and under 21 years of age on it assessing cases where the parties would be of a similar age but unable to bring proceedings in their own name.  I agree that that must be looked at.  It is being examined by the Law Reform Commission. They have seized on this problem as one of their first measures. I do not know when, but I expect that there will be a recommendation from them fairly soon.  I cannot anticipate what the recommendation will be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An odd thing during the debate was the criticism of the method of appointment of the judiciary.  Deputy O'Kennedy did not make this criticism but other speakers on his side did.  It was said that patronage appointments had been made by the Government, and the method was criticised from both sides.  It was criticised from this side even now, and it was criticised when this side were over there and it is now being criticised from over there. We all agree that the method of <Col N="1266" /> appointment is bad, but it is odd that both sides agree that the appointments have been excellent and that we are very lucky with the judiciary we have. We do have an excellent judiciary who are known and seen to be impartial. The important thing is that the tradition of the impartiality of the Bar inspires a tradition of impartiality of the judiciary which of course is underwritten by the constitutional provision. A large and basic part of our establishment structures is that this is inviolable and cannot be shaken and the method of appointment does not have any adverse effect whatever in that regard. In any event, in a small society such as ours to devise an alternative method of appointment would lead to great practical difficulties.  If you are to have an expert impulse, so to speak, into an appointment system you might be excluding from consideration the people you might want to appoint by having them there as assessors.  It is no harm too that a person or group outside the scene, so to speak, would have the final say.  While the system could be criticised from the point of view of the principle involved, it can be commended in so far as the results it has achieved are concerned.</P>
    <P>Deputy Toal was anxious that the debate would stress the independence of the judiciary.  He is correct in that, but there is a widespread, indeed universal acceptance that the judiciary are independent completely, both in fact and in theory, in the exercise of their duties.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lalor thought that it was wrong to have the position with regard to the assignment of Circuit Court judges&mdash;and this applies also to district justices&mdash;to have the Government's hands tied.  He felt that the Government of the day should have power to assign and re-assign Circuit Court judges as they thought fit and he disapproved of the restriction in the Bill whereby judges once assigned can be re-assigned only with their consent.  I strongly disagree with him and I think he will be a lone voice in the House because he put his view in the context of there being dissatisfaction with the performance of a particular judge at a particular time in a particular area and that therefore the Executive should <Col N="1267" /> have power to move him without more ado.  That would be a wrong power for the Executive to have, and to take it would be to prejudice seriously the principle of the independence of the judiciary.  It would be a dangerous move and I do not think there would be general support for it from any side here in the House.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lalor made the point that if a member of the judiciary should misbehave&mdash;and I am not aware of any situation where that could be said up to now&mdash;there is a procedure for an inquiry into that behaviour.  The person in question may be interviewed by the Chief Justice and there is power for the Minister of the day to speak formally to a member of the judiciary in such a situation, and there is also power for an inquiry to be held.  There are sanctions there but the need to apply these has never arisen and I am satisfied that it is not going to arise and that certainly if it was suggested that the Government of the day should take power to move judges around the country, to transfer to a judicial Belmullet I think is what Deputy Lalor had in mind, would be altogether wrong.</P>

      <P>It is important that the principle of the independence of the judiciary be preserved.  To provide arbitrary transfers and reassignments it is necessary to maintain the provision that re-assignment can take place only with their consent.  This is an important part of preserving the principle of their independence.  The only sour note mentioned briefly in the debate was from Deputy Brennan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to refer to one thing which Deputy Brennan said in which he criticised the decision of a member of the bench as being blatant <Col N="1268" /> political victimisation and vindictiveness. It was wrong of him to make that charge.  If any person feels he has been the victim of such a decision we have an appellant system precisely to redress the errors or wrongs that may be done by any judge.  I reject any suggestion of that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to comment on that.  The Minister will appreciate that there can be circumstances where a person does not want to appeal simply to avoid further publicity even though he may be vindicated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that, but at the same time the procedure is available and if it is not availed of it is not right to criticise the original decision as being vindictive and politically motivated.</P>
      <P>Deputies raised the point that some judicial decisions seemed odd.  Any judicial decision is a subjective assessment by one person of a set of facts presented to him.  The judge must make a subjective assessment and, like the rest of us, he is subject to fallibility.  Judges do not have access to some secret store of wisdom and intelligence to inform their judgments and comments.  The comment or the assessment is subjective and is conditioned by the intrinsic intelligence, the environment, experience, education, and general standard of learning of the individual concerned.  In relation to members of the bench, there is an appellant system so that, should there be a subjective assessment which by common consent of the parties concerned is wrong, inaccurate or prejudiced, there is a procedure to redress any imbalance caused by any of these factors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must also remember that, unless a person is present in court for a whole case, the necessarily abbreviated press report of what takes place can give a misleading picture and can have the effect of distorting the judicial decision. Deputy Toal made the point that press reporters could unwittingly, and purely due to the constraints of space and so on, give an inaccurate assessment of a case.  It is impossible <Col N="1269" /> to reproduce in cold print the atmosphere of a case in court, the demeanour of a witness, and all the other things that make the case on which the judge's final assessment is made.</P>
    <P>Deputy Meaney paid tribute to our judges, and we all echo that tribute. Deputies pointed out rightly that we are and have been lucky in our judiciary.</P>
    <P>The disparity of sentences in criminal cases was also raised.  This is a recurring question.  No two cases are the same, even if the charge is the same.  There may be mitigating factors, or the level of viciousness or negligence may vary from case to case, and this alters the punishment required. The law provides for statutory meetings of district justices.  I have no doubt that disparity of penalties is discussed at these meetings so as to ensure uniformity as far as is possible between one district and another particularly with regard to absolute offences of a technical nature.  There is room for differences in the penalties but there should not be room for great disparities.  The District Court bench are aware of the need to avoid any such disparities and I am satisfied that they will discuss this matter at their statutory meetings as cases arise.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Kennedy raised the question of the need for new registrars. Naturally if there are extra judges, new registrars will be needed.  The Deputy can be assured that any staffs needed to ensure the efficient working of the courts will be made available.  I have dealt with all the points raised by various Deputies.  I thank Deputies for their interest in the Bill.  There was more interest than I had anticipated.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>A question raised by me in relation to the extra territorial legislation was not gone into. Have there been any cases in connection with this?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not take a note of that because when I began my reply I indicated that the purpose of this Bill was to bring in two extra High Court judges and to provide for the making of temporary District and <Col N="1270" /> Circuit Court judges.  During the course of the debate there has been a tendency on the part of Deputies to wander down all sorts of byways connected, no matter how tenuously with courts, and the Ceann Comhairle from time to time had to draw Deputies' attention to the fact that they were out of order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>That was the only side road I travelled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>In deference to the Ceann Comhairle, I did not propose to follow Deputies down any of those byways.  I hoped that they would not take it amiss if I did not refer to some points which they made down these byways.</P>
      <P>As Deputy O'Kennedy has again raised this point, I will crave the Ceann Comhairle's indulgence to take it up.  The Criminal Law Jurisdiction Bill made it an offence against our law to commit an offence of terrorism in Northern Ireland.  This Bill was introduced to deal with the problem of a fugitive offender who refused to return to face the charge on the grounds that the crime was politically motivated. That situation was redressed by taking power to try the offence here.  The Criminal Law Jurisdiction Act is not a self-generating Act.  It can only come into operation when a fugitive offender is found down here and there is evidence to charge him with an offence which had been committed subsequent to the passing of the Act. There have been no trials or charges on foot of that Act yet.  I believe that the Act had a deterrent effect on would-be fugitives, so that no longer do they see the Republic as a haven and therefore they no longer come down here to hide from their misdeeds. That does not in any way detract from the validity of having that piece of legislation on the Statute Book, nor does it in any way take from what was then an urgent matter of getting it into law.  The situation that was in existence up to the passing of that Act was a scandal that had to be removed urgently.  That is why that Act was urgent and that is why I regretted that it took so long to pass through the Oireachtas.</P>

      <P>That is so.  Suppose, for example, that in regard to the Circuit Court we found ourselves in the magical situation of being able to conjure up an extra court which would have a span of six months, we could appoint a judge temporarily for that period.  It would be foolish to repeal that provision.</P>

      <P>In effect, the Minister is saying that he does not intend to make any other appointment either to the Circuit Court or to the District <Col N="1274" /> Court apart from the making permanent of the present temporary holders of office.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Another factor in relation to both the High Court and the Circuit Court is that when either court goes on circuit, an important element in the administration of justice to the best advantage possible is the great asset to the judges of having a knowledge of the social character and the general background environment.  Depending on the extent of a judge's knowledge and experience in so far as these considerations are concerned, some judges are in a position to deal more expeditiously than others with the cases coming before them.  From time to time because of the degree of expedition with which a judge approaches his work, the number of cases dealt with increases substantially in individual courts.</P>
      <P>I can give an example of this.  When I practised on circuit, I practised on a circuit that had eight circuit towns, in Tipperary, Waterford, Carlow and Kilkenny. I think that compares favourably with the number of circuit towns on any other circuit.  I have long since left it but, before I did another county and circuit town was added, namely Portlaoise, and subsequently another county and circuit town was added, namely Wexford.  It must be one of the biggest circuits in the country at present. It makes things difficult for a judge to cover such a big circuit and it seems that often the penalty for expeditious working is that other areas can be added to it.  I wonder what comment the Minister might make on that.  It is desirable that a judge should be secure, not that he would not be shifted from one area to another but that he would not have extra areas added, according to how he disposes of business.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy may take it no such changes will be made without consultation because to make changes that would not be agreed on, if you like, at least informally between the parties concerned and the President would be to introduce a note of <Col N="1275" /> acrimony which would not augur well for the administration of the courts.  In practice I am not satisfied that it could happen without agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to hear that consultation does take place because it is very desirable.  Any degree of acrimony or even frustration or dissatisfaction could act against the interests of justice and the manner in which it would be administered&mdash;not that I do not think that all judges would guard against that&mdash;but where a judge has been sitting on a circuit and has made arrangements generally to travel from home to that circuit and stay at certain houses or hotels, it can sometimes cause great upset if he is transferred to another circuit.  This is where I want to raise the question of temporary assignment to Dublin and to the greatest extent possible I would recommend the Minister to recommend to the President of the Circuit Court that that sort of transfer would be limited as much as possible.  A judge who is generally assigned to a country circuit, from the experience I have of discussing it with them, finds it very difficult and would much prefer to be assigned to a neighbouring circuit if possible even on a temporary basis than assigned to Dublin say, for three or four weeks. It involves a kind of disruption.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to make one comment in relation to the Bill in so far as it does allow for the appointment of extra judges which I have supported and on which I have said perhaps less than might be necessary. I want to come back to one <Col N="1276" /> other thing: this is being done in the Dáil by the Executive.  I do not think there is any better authority to do this or that anybody else who could be charged with this responsibility could discharge it in the same way as the Government.  But, that being so, it imposes an obligation on the Government to ensure that appointments to the bench will be&mdash;and I trust that will be the result of these new appointments &mdash;in the best interests of the bench and the administration of justice.  We may all have been, to say the least of it, less than diligent in our application here.  I do not want to go back over the record of recent appointments but there is an obligation on us and the Government to ensure that that would be the fundamental consideration.  The Government are the only authority who can discharge this responsibility.  That is the best system.  I do not know if the Minister has any reservations when he says that perhaps people say the system is bad.  I do not think it is; I think it is the best system.  Nothing is perfect.  I prefer to see this system operate but it is based on the fundamental responsibility of the Government to do the right thing.  We will leave the judgment as to who has done the right thing best to those who will judge us all.  Some things have been said in the course of this debate which I think might have been better not said on both sides.  What is to be done should be done to the advantage of the judiciary and through them of the public.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann takes note of the reports: Developments in the European Communities&mdash;Fifth, Sixth, Seventh, Eight and Ninth Reports.</P>
      <P>As Deputies will be aware these reports are required by section 5 of the European Communities Act, 1972 which provides that the Government shall make a report twice yearly to each House of the Oireachtas on developments in the European Communities.</P>
      <P>When the Minister addressed the House in March, 1974 on the subject of the Second Report he said that he hoped that debates in both Houses on these reports would take place shortly after publication and certainly in the session during which a report is published. That this has not been possible &mdash;due to the very full parliamentary schedule which the Government have proceeded with since 1975&mdash;is a matter of profound regret to the Minister and he would like to take this opportunity to convey his apologies to the House through me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A solution to our difficulties in this regard may however be in sight.  I refer to the decision, taken with the agreement of the Opposition, that from now on reports should cover the period of a Presidency, that is from <Col N="1278" /> 1st January to 30th June and 1st July to 31st December in each year. Deputies will have noted that it was necessary to publish the Eighth and Ninth Reports according to a particular schedule in order to comply with the terms of the Act which requires that a report be published twice yearly. The Ninth Report was thus the first report for the year 1977.  The Tenth Report will cover the period of the British Presidency and will be the second report for 1977.  The Minister hopes that delays in preparation which we encountered with the Ninth Report in particular, can be avoided in future and that reports will be available within two months at most of the last day of their periods of review.  With the reports thus being published on a more logical basis he would hope it would be possible for parliamentary time to be set aside for debates almost automatically twice a year.</P>
    <P>The Government are also sympathetic to the idea that the reports of the Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the European Communities be taken in conjunction with the reports on developments.  In this context I would like to place on record the Minister's appreciation of the very valuable service which the Joint Committee has performed to date.  The large number of reports prepared by the Joint Committee have been taken into account by the Government and have been welcomed as adding a valuable democratic dimension to policy formulation.  The Minister would like to say particularly that he has read with interest the committee's recent report on its functions and work based on the experience of the past three and a half years.  In his opinion, the observations and recommendations contained therein will form a useful basis for discussion of the terms of reference of a reconstituted Joint Committee.</P>
    <P>May I now turn to the reports themselves which are the subject of this motion.  The period covered is 1st December, 1974, to 31st December, 1976.  Deputies will have noticed certain changes in the ordering of material as compared with previous reports.  These, in conjunction with the introduction of extensive footnotes and cross-references have, I think, represented <Col N="1279" /> significant improvements and much facilitated those working with the reports.  Deputies may be assured that any further suggestions for improvement will be very welcome and will be incorporated in future reports whenever possible.</P>
    <P>The inclusion of annexes has continued to be a feature of the reports. Some material which used to figure in the body of reports has now been removed to the annexes, so that annexes appear on a regular basis relating to ministerial regulations, summary of subsidies, meetings of the Council and sittings of the European Parliament and a list of the principal association and trade agreements between the Community and third countries.  In recent reports, statements made by the Taoiseach to either Dáil or Seanad Éireann on meetings of the European Council have also been included.  Reports have also contained annexes setting out documents or explanatory notes on aspects of the work of the Community which it was felt could usefully be drawn to the attention of Members of the Oireachtas and, through them, to the public at large. For example, Annex V of the Sixth Report contains a note on Community participation in the GATT multilateral trade negotiations and Annex V of the Eighth Report contains the text of the Decision and Act concerning the election of representatives to the European Parliament by direct universal suffrage.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned earlier, the reports with which we are concerned today cover the period from 1st December, 1974, to 31st December, 1976.  On 1st January 1975, Ireland assumed responsibility for the Presidency both of the European Communities and of European Political Co-operation.  The six-month period of our Presidency underlined the greatly expanded role which Ireland has come to play in international affairs as a direct result of membership of the Communities.  Indeed the Presidency represented the first test of the extent to which our Administration had adapted to the demands and obligations placed upon it by membership.  I am happy to say that, despite the exceptional strains <Col N="1280" /> imposed on our rather limited resources of personnel and experience, we overcame all the challenges presented to us.  Indeed, it is a well-acknowledged fact that the Irish Presidency was eminently successful not only in the day-to-day organisation of the work of the Communities but also in its contribution to the formulation and advancement of Community policies.</P>
    <P>Some of the highlights of the Irish Presidency included the organisation in Dublin of the first meeting of the European Council; the development of the practice of the Community's speaking with one voice at major international meetings through a representative of the Presidency and a representative of the Commission; the introduction of the practice of a meeting between the Presidency of the Council and the Commission to discuss the Presidency's work programme; the establishment of a new and much closer relationship between the Presidency and the European Parliament including the initiation of the process of answering parliamentary questions on political co-operation in accordance with a decision of the December, 1974, Paris Summit; and the movement towards the greater use of majority voting in the Council.</P>
    <P>In the field of the Community's external relations the Irish Presidency played a leading role in bringing to a successful conclusion the negotiations with the African, Caribbean and Pacific countries which culminated in the Lomé Convention on trade and development co-operation.  The success achieved in advancing the difficult negotiations in the context of the EuroArab dialogue marked the beginning of a new step forward in relations between Europe and the Arab world. The Irish Presidency played a key role in ensuring that the outcome of the first preparatory meeting for the Conference on International Economic Co-operation would be such as to leave open the possibility of maximising further opportunities to get this conference off the ground.  It also contributed to the successful completion of the renegotiation of the British membership of the Community, the Community's response to developments in Portugal and the <Col N="1281" /> significant improvement in relations between the Community and the United States.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned that the first meeting of the European Council was held in Dublin in March, 1975.  The European Council represented an important new development in the Community and its meetings have now become a regular feature of Community activity. The purpose of these meetings is to ensure the development and overall cohesion of the activities of the Communities and the work of political co-operation or foreign policy co-ordination which is, of course, carried on separately from the ordinary business of the Communities under the Treaties. This concentration in a single forum of two matters subject to separate procedures carries with it one danger&mdash; that it could tend to veer the Community in the direction of inter-governmental co-operation at the expense of its supranational character, the protection of which is of course of vital interest to this country.  Indeed, the Taoiseach in a memorandum presented for discussion at the Rome European Council in December, 1975 &mdash;the text of this memorandum is at Annex IV of the Sixth Report&mdash; stressed that discussions at the European Council on Community matters leading to decisions or orientations of decisions to be taken formally at a later stage in the Council at ministerial level, should take place in accordance with the rules and procedures laid down by the Treaties, including the provisions relating to the right of initiative of the Commission.  This remains the cornerstone of our approach to the European Council.</P>
    <P>Another significant event which took place during the Irish Presidency was the reopening of the whole question of direct elections to the European Parliament.  Negotiations have since culminated in the signing of the Council Decision on 20th September, 1976, which has finally cleared the way at Community level for the holding of these direct elections.  It only remains now for the various member states to take the appropriate legislative action at a national level to enable the elections to take place as envisaged <Col N="1282" /> in May or June, 1978.  The necessary legislation is currently being prepared in the member states and, so far as Ireland is concerned, the Government intend to introduce the draft Bill on direct elections in the very near future when the House will have a full opportunity to discuss the matter in detail.</P>
    <P>In the meantime therefore I will confine my remarks to reiterating the importance which the Government attach to the holding of direct elections, which they believe will have a most significant and positive effect on the future development of the Community most especially by reinforcing and extending the democratic legitimacy of the Community's institutional machinery.  It would be premature for me at this stage to seek to forecast how direct elections will affect the future role of the Parliament in the Community and, in any event, this is something which must to a large extent be determined by the Parliament itself in agreement with the Council.  However, so far as Ireland is concerned, the Government favour the Parliament having a much more effective role in the running of the Community and in deciding on Community policies and we will consider sympathetically any proposals aimed at achieving this objective.</P>
    <P>I should like to say something now about activity in the field of European political co-operation.  European political co-operation is animated by the belief that co-operation among the Nine in the field of foreign policy should be such as to enable Europe to make a contribution to international stability.  In accordance with the inter-governmental procedures established for this co-operation, the Nine continued throughout the period under review to meet regularly at ministerial and official level to consult on and as far as possible to co-ordinate their foreign policy positions.</P>
    <P>Topics under discussion in the period included the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe, United Nations affairs, developments in the Mediterranean area, Southern Africa, the Middle East and the EuroArab Dialogue.  The Minister would like to make some comments on a few of these matters.  Co-operation among <Col N="1283" /> the Nine in international forums continues to be an important element in affirming the reality of the European identity.  The ability of the Nine to pursue a common policy at the CSCE conferred authority and weight on their role at the conference.  Consultations are continuing with a view to co-ordinating the Nine position at the forthcoming CSCE follow-up meeting, to be held later this year in Belgrade. This meeting is to review the implementation of the Helsinki final act.</P>
    <P>In line with the statement issued by the heads of Government at their meeting on 16th and 17th July, 1975, that the Community should act with all the weight of its responsibilities to ensure dialogue and conciliation at the United Nations, during the 30th and 31st General Assemblies the Nine have intensified their co-operation and continued their practice of seeking to concert positions on the issues discussed and to vote together wherever practicable.  To an increasing degree, common positions have been expressed in the Assembly through common statements in the name of the Nine delivered by the Presidency.  Of particular interest during the last UNGA was the adoption by consensus of a resolution introduced by the German Federal Republic and co-sponsored by the other member states setting up a committee to draft an international convention on the taking of hostages.</P>
    <P>As an indication of their grave concern at the evolution of events in Southern Africa, the Nine Foreign Ministers issued a statement in February, 1976, setting out the basic positions of the Nine&mdash;rejection of action by any State attempting to establish a zone of influence in Africa, respect for the independence of all African states and their right to define national policies without outside interference, support for the Organisation of African Unity to promote African co-operation, recognition of the right of self-determination and independence for the Rhodesian and Namibian peoples and condemnation of the policy of apartheid of South Africa. Subsequent statements by the Nine on Southern Africa, including that <Col N="1284" /> made last Monday, together with agreed references by the Presidency in UN general debates have defined clearly the principles advocated by the Nine.</P>
    <P>The Nine hold frequent exchanges of views on the Middle East and maintain the view that the principles contained in their statement of 6th November, 1973, must govern a settlement of this very difficult question. The situation in Cyprus is also followed closely by the Nine in view of the association agreements linking Greece, Turkey and Cyprus to the Community.  The Nine have continually expressed their interest in and expectation of a successful outcome to the intercommunal talks taking place in Vienna.</P>
    <P>The question of Europe's role in the world both in the wider political context and the development of strictly Community policies was dealt with in a report on European union drawn up by Mr. Leo Tindemans, the Prime Minister of Belgium at the request of the Heads of Government, meeting in Paris in December, 1974.  The report was examined by the Foreign Ministers in the period under review.  Unhappily, the Ministers' discussions showed that the level of agreement and willingness to move forward on the lines suggested by Mr. Tindemans was relatively low.  Nevertheless, the Ministers prepared a report for the meeting of the European Council last December in The Hague expressing the view that some progress could be made.  The European Council made a statement in which it laid down the framework for practical progress in realising European Union and it agreed to review the situation each year on the basis of reports to be submitted by the Foreign Ministers and the Commission.</P>
    <P>The question of further enlargement of the Communities arose during the period covered by these reports.  In particular, an application for membership by Greece was accepted by the Council in February, 1976, and detailed negotiations leading to the accession of that country are now in progress.  Deputies will be aware that Portugal recently submitted its application <Col N="1285" /> which is now being studied by the Commission in accordance with the provisions of the Treaties.  The Spanish Government has also indicated its intention to apply for membership although an application from that country will have to await the restoration of democratic government.</P>
    <P>Ireland supports the enlargement of the Communities: the principle that any European State may apply for membership is, after all, enshrined in the Treaties.  But we believe that the process of enlargement and the consequences thereof must be well considered lest the capacity of the Community to develop to its full potential be irreparably damaged.</P>
    <P>We voiced our concern on this matter in the context of the Greek application and, indeed, set as preconditions to the negotiation of Greek membership the following two commitments on enlargement, namely,</P>
    <P>&mdash;that prior to the negotiations starting there must be a commitment to the principle that the consequences&mdash;in particular the financial consequences&mdash;of an enlargement must not be detrimental to the common projects and policies of the Community or to those which it intends to carry out in the future: that enlargement must help strengthen a Community dynamic in its aspirations and not weaken or reduce in effectiveness its institutional structures and possibilities for action.</P>
    <P>&mdash;that prior to the conclusion of the negotiations Community decision making structures be strengthened to cope with the problems of an enlarged Community.</P>
    <P>We envisage the latter point being achieved by eliminating the abuse of the unanimity voting procedure in cases where no vital national interest exists. Under no circumstances would we agree to any changes that would weaken the role of smaller member States in decision making or would give any privileged position to larger countries in a directory type system. Any further enlargement should, of course, be governed also by these principles.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1286" /> At an informal meeting of Foreign Ministers which is to be held in May these and other implications of enlargement will be fully discussed.</P>
    <P>I have been dealing so far with matters relating to the overall development of the Community as a whole.  I would like to turn now to a consideration of some external and internal aspects of Community policy.</P>
    <P>An important development in the period under review was the conclusion of negotiations for agreements with Israel, Malta, the Maghreb and the Machrek countries, excluding Lebanon, in the context of the Community's global Mediterranean policy. In addition to trade provisions, these agreements provide for technical and financial co-operation.  In the same period emergency aid was given to Portugal, following the Minister's visit to that country as President of the Council of Ministers in June, 1975, a measure which was consolidated in September, 1976, by the signing of protocols extending the free trade area agreement of 1972 to the areas of industrial, technological and financial co-operation.  Also, following the collapse of the military regime in Greece, the Community reactivated and subsequently extended the association agreement of 1962 with that country.</P>
    <P>In the context of the achievements of the Irish Presidency I referred briefly earlier on to the Lomé Convention which was signed in February, 1975.  This convention extended the network of the Community's relations with developing countries to include 46 independent development countries in Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific: the number of signatories has now increased to 52.  The significance of the convention lies in its comprehensive scope and innovatory features, notably the provisions for the stabilisation of export earnings and for industrial co-operation between partners at different stages of development.</P>
    <P>Apart from the Lomé Convention and the Mediterranean policy, Community development aid activity during the period under review concerned itself in large measure with the Community's response to the United Nations emergency operation launched <Col N="1287" /> in support of developing countries which were hardest hit by the oil crisis and with the implementation of two important resolutions which had been adopted by the Council on Development Co-operation in July, 1974.  These resolutions dealt with Community financial and technical aid to non-associated developing countries, that is, non-Lomé countries, and with the harmonisation and co-ordination of member states, co-operation policies.</P>
    <P>In the food aid sector the main activity concerned the further renewal for two years, from June, 1976, of the food aid convention and the adoption by the Council of the principle of medium term planning. However, a Commission proposal for increases in Community food aid, based on the results of the 1974 world food conference did not find general acceptance.  Along with some other member states, Ireland has supported an increased Community food aid programme and hopes that this will be agreed in the near future.</P>
    <P>I would also like to mention specifically a novel scheme which to my mind has great potential, particularly in its capacity to stimulate public interest in the development process. This is the scheme to enable the Commission to co-finance the activities of non-governmental organisations in developing countries.  A number of Irish voluntary agencies have played a prominent part in this scheme and it is the Minister's hope that they will continue to do so in future programmes which will, of course, command our strong support in the Council.</P>
    <P>The contractual relationships with developing countries to which I have referred were entered into during a period in which the relationship between developed and developing countries became a major aspect of international economic relations.  The manner in which the oil producers improved their terms of trade in 1973 highlighted the urgency of finding an equitable balance between the need of the developing countries for stable and remunerative arrangements for their <Col N="1288" /> raw materials and the need of the developed countries for security of supply of raw materials.  Against this background two special sessions of the UN General Assembly were devoted to development questions, a Conference on International Economic Co-operation was inaugurated in Paris in December, 1975, and the fourth United Nations Conference on Trade and Development took place in May, 1976.</P>
    <P>The outcome of the Conference on International Economic Co-operation, a new recruit to the labyrinth of initials, which is to conclude with a ministerial conference in Paris on the 30th May and 1st June will be of importance not only in regard to the maintenance of the security of oil supplies, because, as Deputies will be aware, this north/south dialogue which began as an energy conference is now concerned also with raw materials, development and financial affairs.  I am happy to say that throughout this conference the Community has spoken with one voice through the Presidency and the Commission and the Minister is confident that the Community will make a positive contribution to the final ministerial conference, the outcome of which should be of lasting significance to the world economic order.</P>
    <P>I would like to say something now about the co-operation agreements which Ireland has negotiated with the USSR and Poland.</P>
    <P>As a consequence of membership of the EEC, trade relations between this country and third countries are regulated at Community level.  However, certain competences in the field of inter-governmental economic activity are retained at national level subject to compliance with Community consultation procedures.  In this context, in December last, the Minister signed an agreement in Moscow for Economic, Industrial, Scientific and Technological Co-operation between Ireland and the USSR.  A similar agreement has been negotiated with Poland and is due to be signed later this year.</P>
    <P>These agreements are a relatively new but significant development in the field of economic relations between <Col N="1289" /> states and their essential function is to provide an inter-governmental framework to facilitate the development of co-operative projects between economic, commercial and other interests in the two countries concerned. For example, the agreements negotiated with the USSR and with Poland provide that the Irish Government on the one hand and the Soviet or Polish Government on the other will encourage and facilitate the development of economic, industrial, scientific and technological co-operation between organisations and enterprises in their respective countries.</P>
    <P>The types of co-operation covered by agreements of this kind include joint production and marketing of goods; mutual deliveries of machinery, equipment and tools; joint research and development of new technological processes and the exchange of scientific and technological documentation and information; purchase and sale of patents and licences; the exchanges of specialists and the sending of experts from one country to the other for rendering technical services and for training.</P>
    <P>An important aspect of the agreements is the provision they make for the establishment of inter-governmental joint commissions.  These will be composed of government officials and will include among their tasks the encouragement of the development of economic, industrial, scientific and technological co-operation between the two countries, the drawing up of recommendations for the further development of such co-operation and the identification of new fields for co-operation.</P>
    <P>Other countries' experience has shown that the meetings of these joint commissions provide a useful forum for discussion of the whole range of bilateral economic relations and for stimulating economic co-operation between the business sectors in the two countries involved.  The Government will seek to avail of the opportunities presented by the annual meetings of the joint commissions to provide support at the official level for Irish exporters and other economic operators with an active involvement or interest in doing business with the <Col N="1290" /> countries concerned.</P>
    <P>In the case of State-trading countries, such as Poland and the Soviet Union, where most aspects of economic activity are regulated by the State, the provision of a Government-to-Government framework for the further development of economic relations is seen as an important step.  In the case of other countries where a substantial foreign earnings potential is seen to exist and it appears evident that the conclusion of government-to-government agreements could facilitate the Irish business community in seeking business, the Government are prepared to consider the conclusion of such agreements as an instrument of economic policy.</P>
    <P>The beginning of the period under discussion saw the implementation in March, 1975, of the decision of the Paris Summit on the setting up of a European Regional Development Fund.  Ireland has never been happy with either the size of the fund, which was set at 1,300 million units of account, or £542 million to be distributed over a three year period. Despite the substantial increase in our quota secured during the course of the negotiations, our share of the fund will not exceed a grand total of £35 million over the three year period or less than an average of £12 million a year.  Sums of this magnitude can obviously do very little even to help our economy to grow at the same rate as the better-off regions of the EEC not to mention catch up with the latter in terms of standards of living.</P>
    <P>In addition, the very appreciable devaluation of the pound sterling eroded the real value of our share in terms of the major European currencies in the time since the fund was set up.  This can be seen when the position about the unit of account is examined.  The resources of the fund and the shares of the individual member states are expressed in terms of units of account.  The rate of exchange for the unit of account has not changed in recent years and was and still is converted into Irish pounds at the rate of £1 equals 2.4 ua.  However, the Commission have recently devised what is known as the European unit of account which is linked <Col N="1291" /> to the present value of European currencies.  The rate of conversion of the EUA is £1 equal 1.5 EUA.  If this rate of conversion had been used our 1977 commitment allocation alone would have increased from £13.5 million to £21.5 million.  In other words, if the fund remains the same size but EUAs were used instead of uas our share in terms of sterling would go up by more than 50 per cent.  In other words, our share will have to increase by at least that figure to stand still in terms of European currencies.  This point will be borne in mind when the size of the fund for 1978 is being considered.</P>
    <P>Inadequate as the amount was, however, in the period covered by these reports we applied for and obtained commitments in respect of 166 different projects.  In fact we were the first country to present an actual claim under the fund.</P>
    <P>The regulations governing the present fund are under review at the moment by the commission.  It can be taken for granted that Ireland will continue to press not only for a greatly increased fund but for real regional policy which will provide for the regional problems not only of the west of Ireland but of the country as a whole.</P>
    <P>The Social Fund is also under review at the moment.  One of the suggested reforms is that the maximum intervention rates for projects sited in less developed areas should be increased from the present 50 per cent to 65 per cent.  Should this suggestion be accepted it would represent a major improvement in the fund's regulation as far as Ireland is concerned.  Since acceding to the Community we have been submitting applications for assistance and amounts approved have increased from £4.6 million in 1973 to £12.9 million in 1975.  These figures represent approximately 6 per cent of the total moneys available under the fund.</P>
    <P>A major difficulty encountered in the period under review concerned the implementation of the equal pay directive. It will be recalled that on 10th February, 1975, the Council adopted a directive on the approximation of the laws of the member states relating to the implementation of the Articles <Col N="1292" /> in the Rome Treaty which provides for the application of the principle that men and women should receive equal pay for equal work.  In this country the Anti-Discrimination (Pay) Act became law on 1st July, 1974.  This provided for the full application of equal pay for men and women on 31st December, 1975.</P>
    <P>However, because of a worsening economic situation we sought on 5th February, 1976, a deferment of the application of the directive in Ireland for a limited period in the case of undertakings which could not demonstrably fulfil its requirements without dismissing employees.  This was rejected by the Commission which had sent a fact-finding mission to Ireland beforehand.</P>
    <P>We submitted certain proposals to the Commission to help alleviate the distress of unemployment resulting from the implementation of the directive. As a result of this the Commission agreed to make some increases in the amount of aid to Ireland and to speed up disbursement to us in respect of certain claims we had made.</P>
    <P>Irish agriculture continues to benefit considerably from our membership of the European Community and the common agricultural policy of the Community has in general operated to Ireland's advantage.  Difficulties in certain areas have of course arisen, particularly with regard to monetary compensatory amounts on Irish agricultural exports and the failure of the Community to arrive at a common organisation of the market for sheepmeat. The Commission's proposals for the achievement of balance in the dairy sector are also of major importance to Ireland because of our considerable investment in this area.  I should like to elaborate on each of these matters.</P>
    <P>The major problem which has faced us over the last few years has been the level of our monetary compensatory amount.  As Deputies are no doubt aware, MCAs are a device to offset the effects which currency fluctuations would otherwise have on the common price system of the common agricultural policy.  Ireland, because of its depreciated currency, must charge MCAs on exports or <Col N="1293" /> grant MCAs subsidies on imports in trade in agricultural products.</P>
    <P>Because of the national importance of agricultural exports to us, payment of any sizable MCA for any length of time is a very heavy penalty on the Irish economy.  It undermines the competitiveness of our agricultural industry and involves a wholly disproportionate transfer of funds from this country to the Community budget.</P>
    <P>Because of the relatively frequent adjustments in the Irish green £, the level of Irish MCA had been kept in reasonable check up to the middle of last year.  The very sharp depreciation of the pound last year however, caused the MCA to rise enormously: it reached 29 per cent at one point last autumn.  Such a level of MCA would be an intolerable burden on the Irish economy and the Government therefore pressed the Community to take urgent action.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture succeeded in getting the agreement of the Council of Ministers to adjustments in the Irish green £ in October last year and in January and April this year which resulted in the level of Irish MCA falling to the relatively insignificant level of 3.4 per cent.  The benefit to the Irish farming community of the most recent reduction in the Irish green £ is likely to be of the order of £40 million in the current year, and the impact on the balance of payments should be of the order of £20-25 million in the current year.</P>
    <P>The exclusion of a number of processed agricultural products, notably biscuits, from the MCA system put Irish manufacturers of these products at a serious disadvantage compared with British manufacturers as they were obliged to pay more for their raw materials than their British counterparts. This led to problems in competition both on the home market and on the British market, the main export outlet for the Irish manufacturers.</P>
    <P>In view of the distortion in trade which arose the Government applied to the Commission for authorisation to take measures to eliminate this distortion.  Following the Government's <Col N="1294" /> request, the Commission agreed in late March to allow Ireland to apply an MCA system on trade with the United Kingdom in these products.  The effect of the application of this system has been to allow the Government to impose a levy on imports and to offer a subsidy on exports and thereby to remove a serious distortion in trade which otherwise would have had serious consequences for the Irish confectionery industry and particularly for the Irish biscuit manufacturers.  It is expected that the Commission will introduce a Community wide MCA system to apply to these products within the next few weeks.</P>
    <P>Since Ireland acceded to the Community, the Government have constantly sought to secure agreement among the member states on a common organisation of the market for sheepmeat. Our main concern has been the action of the French Government in regularly and unpredictably closing the French market to exports of Irish lamb. The question of a common organisation of the market for sheepmeat has been discussed regularly by the Council and discussions have also taken place between the three member states mainly concerned&mdash;Ireland, France and the United Kingdom.  So far it has not proved possible to arrive at a solution.</P>
    <P>We have indicated our willingness to consider any reasonable proposal that will have improved access to the French market for Irish exports of mutton and lamb.  We fully appreciate France's concern lest the opening of her frontiers to imports from the new member states of the Community should lead to unduly large imports but we cannot accept a situation where the French market is continually opening and closing to Irish exports. The import charges which France levies on imports of lamb have effectively halved our exports of lamb to France in recent years.</P>
    <P>Our position with regard to lamb differs substantially from that of Britain.  Britain imports very large quantities of lamb from third countries, particularly New Zealand.  These relatively low-cost imports have the effect of holding down the market <Col N="1295" /> price for lamb in the United Kingdom.</P>
    <P>Discussions have taken place on a Commission proposal for an interim arrangement for sheepmeat which would operate up to the end of 1977 and which would provide for levies on imports into France from Ireland and the United Kingdom, instead of the present French restrictions.  We have asked that the levy on our exports to France should be lower than that applied to exports from the United Kingdom because Irish market prices are higher.  In addition, we must contend with higher transport costs for sheepmeat exported to France.  While the United Kingdom has indicated its willingness to agree to a small differential in any such levy, its aim seems to be that this should be very small and, indeed, at a level that would be of little or no benefit to our trade with France.</P>
    <P>France, on 5th April, 1977, announced a further increase in its threshold price for imports of sheepmeat&mdash;the new rate amounts to 17.50 francs per kilo or 92.8p per lb.  The increased protection of the French market must be regarded as a step in the wrong direction, and the Government have decided to pursue the matter at the European Court of Justice in an effort to arrive at a solution.</P>
    <P>In the dairy sector the Commission has proposed a programme of action for the years 1977-1980 with a view to achieving a balance in the Community's milk market.  The main proposals made by the Commission are (a) the introduction of a levy on producers for milk deliveries (b) a scheme for the payment of premiums to farmers who cease milk production and (c) a three year ban on national investment aids in the dairy sector.</P>
    <P>While we agree that some action is necessary to prevent the recurring surpluses of skim milk powder and butter in the Community the Government are not convinced that this is the most suitable time to take decisions on the Commission's package and although Ireland would have no objection to other member states implementing <Col N="1296" /> a scheme for the non-marketing of milk, we are opposed to such implementation being mandatory in all member states.</P>
    <P>The question of a revised common fisheries policy has been a matter of grave concern for some time.  The ninth report includes an account of developments up to February, 1977, but I would like to take this opportunity of setting out the background to the situation and bringing matters up to date.</P>
    <P>The review of the common fisheries policy has been taking place in the context of the general move by North Atlantic coastal states to create exclusive national fishing limits extending to 200 miles from their baselines.</P>
    <P>The existing fisheries policy of the Community is laid down in Council Regulation 2141 of 1970.  This regulation provides, <i>inter alia</i>, for the principle of equal conditions of access to and use of the maritime waters coming under the sovereignty or within the jurisdiction of member states.</P>
    <P>The Treaty under which Ireland acceded to the Community provided for a temporary derogation from the common access provisions of the Community regulations enacted in 1970.  This derogation extended to 1982, by which time a review was to take place based on a study of the situation.  There was no guarantee that this review would necessarily maintain the derogation and certainly no indication that it would provide additional protection for coastal fishermen.</P>
    <P>The position thus established has been radically altered as a result of the chain-reaction effect of declarations of 200 mile limits by countries around the North Atlantic, following the failure of the Law of the Sea Conference at several sessions to agree on such provisions.  Declarations of 200 mile limits have been made by the United States, Canada, Norway, Iceland and the Soviet Union, among others.  The extension of fishing limits by other countries has the dual effect of threatening the livelihood of Community fishermen who had traditionally <Col N="1297" /> fished in their waters and of threatening to concentrate the efforts of non-Community fishermen from other States into the waters around Community coasts.  As a result, the member states of the Community have extended their fishing limits to 200 miles.</P>
    <P>The extension of Community waters to 200 miles, and I would emphasise this, has not changed the legal position under the Rome Treaty with respect to the right of access.  Based as it is, on a regulation of 1970 which speaks of &ldquo;maritime waters coming under the sovereignty or within the jurisdiction of member states&rdquo;, these access provisions apply automatically to the enlarged 200-mile zones of each Community member state.  This is the legal view of the Council Secretariat and Commission.  It is also the legal view as interpreted by the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Attorney General, and this opinion is shared also by legal advisers of other Governments.</P>
    <P>The extension of fishing limits to 200 miles has provided the Irish Government and the British Government with an opportunity to renegotiate the access provisions&mdash;an opportunity which would not have existed if the Government had not joined with its Community partners in this extension. Had we failed to take this action, as the Opposition have in the past suggested, we should not alone have left our waters beyond six or 12 miles wide open to continued despoliation by Eastern European, and, indeed, Community vessels, but would also have deprived ourselves of a valuable bargaining counter in the negotiations.</P>
    <P>As is well-known, the Commission in September, 1976, introduced proposals for a revised common fisheries policy.  These were rejected by the Government as being inadequate to guarantee the continued and progressive development of the Irish fishing industry.  At a meeting on 30th October Ireland's special position was recognised and agreement was reached on a development of the Irish coastal fishing industry on the basis of the Government's programme which proposes a doubling of the catch between 1975 and 1979 as a preliminary to <Col N="1298" /> further expansion.  In contrast all other member states are to reduce their catches for conservation reasons. Agreement was also reached at this meeting on the principle of an equitable sharing of fishery protection costs in the Irish 200-mile zone.  Successive meetings of the Council failed, however, to arrive at any agreement on a interim internal fisheries regime for the Community, pending the adoption of a permanent regime which must so far as our waters are concerned be based on the 30th October provisions.</P>
    <P>The Foreign Ministers of the Community at their meeting in The Hague on 30th October, 1976, agreed that if no agreement were reached on Community conservation measures &ldquo;member states could then adopt, as an interim measure and in a form which avoids discrimination, appropriate measures to ensure the protection of resources situated in the fishing zones off their coasts&rdquo;.  Following the failure of the Council to agree on an interim fisheries regime for 1977, the Minister for Fisheries made orders under the Fisheries Acts, the effect of which has been to prohibit fishing by all vessels exceeding 33 metres registered length or 1,100 brake horsepower in a designated area of our coast counted by 56º 30' north latitude 12º west longtitude and 50º 30' north latitude.  Enforcement of the unilateral Irish conservation measures was postponed twice in the hope that the Council would agree on conservation measures.  The proposals finally came into force at midnight on 10th April, 1977.</P>
    <P>When deciding to enforce the unilateral Irish measures, the Government also invited member states of the Community to submit fishing plans to the Irish Government for approval with a view to the introduction later of a scheme by the Government on the lines recently proposed as the basis of a Community measure by the Commission. The scheme envisaged in the Commission proposals, provided that member states fishing in the extended Irish fisheries zone would submit, in advance, a fishing plan to the Commission for approval.  The Commission proposal for fishing plans involves <Col N="1299" /> member states adjusting the volume of their fishing activities in Irish waters to the size of quotas which would be allocated to them by the Commission &mdash;quotas which, together with cutbacks imposed by the Community on third countries fishing off our coasts, would cut total catches by about 40 per cent.  These fishing plans, to conform to the Commission's proposals and to be acceptable to the Government, would have to be spelt out in sufficient detail&mdash;number, size and registration numbers of boats and fishing periods&mdash;as to make them enforceable by our Naval Service.  Pending receipt of satisfactory fishing plans from member states seeking to fish in our waters, the existing unilateral restrictions based on size of boat will remain in force.</P>
    <P>It has been and continues to be the Government's policy to pursue our claim to an exclusive fishing zone of up to 50 miles around our coasts.  At no stage has this policy been departed from.  The Government have made clear to our partners in the Community that we consider agreement on the coastal belt issue to be a precondition to the adoption of new directives by the Council for substantive agreements with third countries on the reciprocal fishing rights which would be designed to follow on the conclusion of framework agreements and of such interim arrangements as may be required before substantive agreements on quotas and zones can be put into effect.  Some of these substantive agreements are likely to come to the Council for decision within the next couple of months, more or less simultaneously with the Commission's proposals for a permanent internal regime and it is at this point that the vitally important coastal band issue will fall to be settled.</P>
    <P>I trust that this outline of some of the main issues covered by these reports will afford a satisfactory introduction to this important debate.</P>

      <P>For the record, as the Parliamentary Secretary said in delivering the Minister's speech, this is the second debate of this kind we have had in the course of the present Dáil.  The last one was initiated in <Col N="1300" /> March, 1974, and we had not any debate on reports since then.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>We have had several discussions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>In effect, it is almost three years since the House has had an opportunity of debating these bi-annual reports on developments in the European Community.  I share the Minister's regret that the House has not had the opportunity of having more regular debates on our progress as a member of the EEC since that time.  Three years is far too long.  It is very evident it does not enable the House to make any effective analysis and criticism of our performance in the Community or of the performance of the Community and discover what corrective measures we can take in order to realise our aims in the Community consistent with the aims of the Community itself.  We have waited three years for this opportunity and now we find it coincides with a day on which the Minister is not available.  Surely the Parliamentary Secretary must have known the Minister had an important engagement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to interrupt the Deputy but it is really an accident of timing that the Minister is not here.  It was originally intended to start earlier.  Had the debate on the Courts Bill finished at 11 a.m. or 11.30 a.m. the Minister would have been here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>That would simply have meant the Minister would have been here to hear himself.  That would have been the extent of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>But our European dimension is mentioned frequently in this House and debated day in and day out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>But not to the extent to which I hope to debate it now.  Having waited three years for this it is unfortunate the Minister cannot be present because of an important engagement.  We could have waited another week.  I am glad to see Deputy Thornley here but I understand there <Col N="1301" /> is a plenary session under way today in Europe and that means most members of the European Parliament are not here to contribute to this debate on issues affecting them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>This debate will resume next week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope it will.  Can we have that guarantee?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I promise the Deputy we will arrange business so that Deputies who are members of the European Parliament will have a chance of speaking next week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Then, hopefully, they will have an opportunity to contribute. We have waited to hear the Minister and we hoped he would be here to hear what we have to say after three years waiting.  It is a serious matter.  We are at the end almost of four years membership of the Community under this Government and I would have thought this debate would have afforded the Minister an opportunity of analysing our performance within the Community and the Community's performance <i>vis-á-vis</i> us. This should have provided an opportunity of looking at the problems raised for us as members of the Community and finding out how our experience at the end of four years measured up to our expectations. Surely this is the time for a broad philosophical analysis of the reality of European membership and how that reality measures up to the expectations we had four years ago, a point of time which more or less coincides with the beginning of this Government's term of office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We do not find anything on those lines in the introductory speech.  There is reference to individual matters, rather detailed references to matters something less than relevant in the period of our Presidency.  All that happened two years ago.  We are much more concerned in discovering how the Europe we joined has measured up to our expectations.  What expectations have we now of implementing our aims?  This is important and all this is missing.  It is particularly regrettable <Col N="1302" /> that this should be missing on the 20th anniversary of the European Community. I hope that, with a change of Government, we will have more regular debates on our European involvment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is creating a quite false impression.  At the end of the last session we had a debate in which the Deputy made a very long and a very good speech on Europe.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Whatever my contribution may have been, for one reason or another, as the Parliamentary Secretary knows, the Minister did not have an opportunity of giving us the kind of analysis I am talking about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy spoke for about an hour on that occasion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>That may be.  What I am complaining about now is what is not here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Do not mind what is not there.  The Deputy is saying he was not given an opportunity of debating this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  There are two separate issues and I am on the second issue.  The second issue is that the man most responsible, most informed by virtue of his office and most knowledgable about the position, is not here to tell the House what Europe has meant, what its shortcomings and its advantages have been and whither we are going.  That is what I regret. Nothing I say will fill that gap, and it is a very serious gap.  What we have had this morning is a very different report from the kind of statement Mr. Roy Jenkins made on the opening of an incoming Commission.  At a time when Europe is at a crossroads, a time when we should be analysing and criticising the progress made or the lack of progress to see what we can do to improve or correct the position, Mr. Roy Jenkins, President of the new Commission, said:</P>
      <P>We want our deeds to be a little better than our words.  Let us always do more than we promised to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the light of the experience we have had over the last three or four years that would be a very welcome change. <Col N="1303" /> We should be examining to see to what extent our aims have been achieved in the European Community and analysing the development of a proper economic order through the various agencies and finding out just what Europe's place is in the world. Anything on those lines is absent here.</P>
    <P>Let us face it.  This is the last time this Minister will have an opportunity of making a detailed statement on those lines to this House.  I regret we have not had this statement because we need to look at the effect Europe has had on us from the economic, social and political point of view and we need to know the results of involvement in Europe and the results of contact with the rest of the world. We need to know to what extent this has helped or hindered our economic progress over the last four years.  We need to know, before we move in to the next stage under a new Government, to what extent our problems over the last four years have been caused by Europe or to what extent Europe has prevented the problems we have becoming more serious.  That information would have been invaluable.</P>
    <P>We have been told on numerous occasions that external factors had very damaging effects upon our economy.  It has been said that the rate of inflation has been affected by external factors.  These factors have been presented to us as holding up economic progress.  It would have been appropriate in that context to compare the inflation rate over all that period in Europe with the Irish experience.</P>
    <P>In this connection I quote from the April, 1977, Community report which was published by the Irish office of the European Community.  This indicates that during 1976, as a whole, inflation rates in the Community member states ranged from 4.5 per cent in Germany to 18 per cent in Ireland.  In between came five countries hovering around the 9 per cent mark: Netherlands 8.9 per cent; Belgium 9.2 per cent; France 9.6 per cent; Luxembourg 9.8 per cent. Then there is another big gap before reaching the UK at 16.5 per cent and <Col N="1304" /> Italy at 16.8 per cent.  We are at the top of the inflation league.</P>
    <P>We have been asking consistently over the last four years why this has been so and, if our inflation rate is that much higher than those operating in the other Community countries, to what extent we can blame that inflation rate on factors operating in countries that have a much lower rate of inflation than we have; to what extent we have contributed to the causes of this most chronic problem in Europe apart altogether from other problems such as the underdevelopment of certain regions, unemployment and so on.  Surely as a first principle, if our rate of inflation has been consistently higher than that of the other member states, as it has been at the end of last year, then many of the problems we have attributed to Europe can be located right here at home, in fact right over there on that side of the House, I know there are other factors involved, but that is the first issue.  It is for that reason that the Council of the European Community Commission found it necessary from time to time, particularly in recent years, to remind the Government here of the responsibility they have to control it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Not by anything like the present gap.  This is a factor that, perhaps, the Minister for Finance and the spokesman for Finance can consider, but the European debate covers a very broad aspect, agriculture, finance, education, social affairs and so on.  I am not going to present myself as an expert in all these areas but would point to the main and obvious questions that pose themselves and need to be answered and up to the moment have not been answered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce said we are caught up in the tempest of raging inflation in Europe. I wonder where the eye of that tempest <Col N="1305" /> was.  It seems to have been very constantly centred right here.  Many of the problems we face would have been all the less critical if we were able to take the same remedial measures as the European partners have been able to take in their own countries.  Similarly, unemployment has proved to be a constant problem here&mdash;and this is not at all unrelated to the rapid inflation&mdash; and again we are by far the highest in the unemployment table in terms of registered unemployed at 10½ per cent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am beginning to welcome the fact that I was not here for all of the Parliamentary Secretary's address, which, let me say, was not due to any discourtesy on my part but the fact that I needed some break after being involved in the other legislation.  I would ask him to contain himself for a little while and brief somebody else to reply to these rather irritating criticisms of mine. Anyway we are at the highest level of unemployment in Europe, even in terms of registered unemployed, at 10½ per cent, way ahead of any other country.  This in itself presents a certain fact to us as members of the European Community and also imposes certain obligations on the Community to deal with our structural unemployment problem.  I shall deal with this problem in more detail later.  I am simply highlighting the main headings in the first instance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, I do not see any real evidence that the Government have been able to advocate the need for a solution to the problems we have in a manner that would get a real and positive response from the Community to help us to help ourselves, so that we would not be a brake on economic development in Europe. Our main approach to this is not with a begging bowl in our hands, far from it, but to remind the Community of what it has said itself from its foundation, from our accession and even since, and to say: &ldquo;If you act <Col N="1306" /> according to those statements and those principles we will deliver&rdquo;.  In that way we will become a more prosperous member of the Community and help towards achieving both the economic and political aims of the Community.  That is why one bears in mind the statement by the President of the Commission when he addressed parliament on the 8th February, 1977, that henceforth he wants their deeds to be a little better than their words and always do more than they promise to do.  We can point out the words that have been delivered and the promises that have not been delivered and at least create a deeper awareness in Europe of our special problems here.</P>
    <P>Similarly, in regard to other factors that affect our economy, we were told that the oil crisis had a very severe impact here and of course it did.  But surely it must have had at least as severe an impact, even relatively speaking, on the major industrial countries of the European Community, on Germany who are huge importers of oil, greater than we are, comparatively speaking, having regard to the disparity in our economies, and also on Holland and Belgium and on France to a lesser extent.  They also suffered to a very serious degree as a result of the oil crisis.  They have been able to overcome the problem in a way that we have not.  They have been able to control inflation in a way that we have not, and unemployment has not been anything like as severe as it is here.  The economic upturns we have been told about over the last year or so have been in evidence there but have certainly not been in evidence to the same extent here.</P>
    <P>This is the background against which this debate should take place so that we can ask what has Europe meant to us, to what extent have we exploited our membership, to what extent have we been effective members of the Community which has adopted the fundamental principles of the elimination of regional imbalances leading towards economic and monetary union and eventually towards political integration and towards a greater cohesion in Europe, which, for instance, will be helped on the way by the new directly <Col N="1307" /> elected European Parliament?  I would like to have seen more of that in this contribution from the Parliamentary Secretary, although he does say we will be hearing more about this later.  I wonder how long more we will be waiting for the introduction of the European Parliament Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to come back to some of the facts which might have been noted so that we could more urgently stake our claim for better support.  Up to 1975&mdash;and it has been aggravated up to 1976&mdash; the discrepancy between the most prosperous area in the European Community, Hamburg and thereabouts, and the least prosperous area, the west of Ireland, grew considerably.  Some parts of the south of Italy would have similar economic disadvantages to the west of Ireland.  In fact, in the four years prior to 1975 the level of prosperity in the Hamburg area had risen from five times the level of gross domestic product per head to six times the level of gross domestic product per head.  Hamburg had become that much more prosperous during our membership of the EEC than had the west of Ireland, the least prosperous area within a Community which, by its own stated principles, is committed to &ldquo;eliminating regional imbalances&rdquo;. With such a cogent argument as that we could not get the Community to acknowledge that their own principles <Col N="1309" /> bound them to eliminating those imbalances. They are bound at least to reduce the disparaties rather than to allow a situation where those disparaties will be aggravated as they have been.</P>
      <P>Perhaps Germany and Holland and Belgium will always become more prosperous and we will always become less prosperous.  If we accept that we should say so.  If we do not accept it then it is time that we said so loudly and clearly in Europe so that they will have to recognise what has been happening within the Community. It is not surprising that round about the time of the Tindemans Report everyone dropped the notion of economic monetary union as a means towards political union.  It was said that we would have to rearrange our targets and programmes so that we could set a more realistic target and decide how long we would have these two-speed Europes and privilege groups within one as against the other.  All these new notions began to emerge within a Community which up to then had spoken only in terms of a Community with responsibilities to the entire community.  That is something we should be talking about at this stage and we should be determined to correct some of these ideas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having said that we must come back to some hard realities.  We are not just holding out a begging bowl.  We have benefited quite considerably in purely national terms, though not by comparison with the progress made in other countries.  We have been net beneficiaries to a very considerable extent. Last year the amounts approved in grants and subsidies from FEOGA, the European Social Fund and the Regional Development Fund totalled £140 million.  That is a very large figure indeed in terms of our national economy.  It is the kind of sum that should have been used to great effect here at home.  With transfers of that nature coming into the country it is ironical that the Government complain about external factors.  It is clear evidence that we have not exploited properly the advantages that have accrued from these direct transfers.  We have not discharged our responsibilities <Col N="1310" /> in utilising the benefits of those transfers, which are not as much as we are entitled to.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Deputy suggesting that the Government should have found some way of mobilising money which very largely went into the pockets of the farmers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not.  I am saying that we should have used the money available to us more effectively, not just to help out the ailing budgetary situation at home.  It should have been used for additional regional development and this was not done.  The record is quite clear on that.  Let us consider the social fund and the £13 million approved in the last year.  Most of this has been applied towards retraining programmes and much of it has been applied to good effect by the authority responsible for that, namely, AnCO. It is the function of AnCO to train people for jobs that should exist but all of us know that much of the money supplied to us from Europe is spent on training young people for jobs that do not exist.  We know that there are many young people going back for a second time to AnCO training courses because no jobs exist for them.  Our European partners must know this unless they have very little awareness of what is happening here.  It is a little difficult to take when the Minister for Labour talks about training programmes provided by the Government without acknowledging, as he should acknowledge every time he mentions training programmes, that this is being done with funds provided from the European Social Fund, and without the net effect at the end of it of increased employment opportunities for the young people who are being trained or, indeed, for the redundant employees at whatever level who are being trained under these programmes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one example under the European Social Fund of where we have not discharged our responsibilities to the Community who provided us with that extra opportunity.  Nothing can change that.  Even though on the one hand we are entitled to better assistance than many other areas, and I can give examples, such assistance as <Col N="1311" /> we have got should have been used to better effect.  That, of course, weakens our case when we ask Europe to be consistent to Europe's stated principles. The Germans, the Dutch, the Commission and the Council in general can and properly will say to us &ldquo;We have been helping you, and what have you done with it?  You have used it simply in some instances to shore up out of the regional fund your own current budgetary position.  You have used it in other instances simply for training for the purpose of training rather than training for the purpose of giving employment&rdquo;.  That is something we have to plead guilty to a dozen times over.  That is not good enough.  Therefore I would like to hear from the Minister or someone from that side before this debate concludes some analysis of the opportunities that we have missed in the last four years and the opportunities that lie ahead in the next four years.  This is the halting point from which we can look back and forward at the same time to good effect.</P>
    <P>I quote again from the programme of the Commission for 1977 which follows as an annex to the address by the incoming President Jenkins to the European Parliament in February.  He talks in terms of the regional fund and says at paragraph 16, page 27:</P>
    <P>As regards the content of these proposals, the Commission considers that in the present economic situation it is more necessary than ever to make improvements in this field.</P>
    <P>That is the same Commissioner who said earlier &ldquo;We want our deeds to be a little better than our words&rdquo;.  If they say it is more necessary than ever to make improvements in the field of the regional fund, then let us say to them &ldquo;You accept that according to your own statements, and your words or your deeds would be even better than that&rdquo;.  The quotation continues:</P>
    <P>Although it affects the Community economy as a whole, the crisis will have a particular impact on the less-favoured regions.  It should, however, be pointed out here that the Fund is only one of the instruments of the Community's regional policy <Col N="1312" /> and can therefore make only a limited contribution to the solution of regional economic problems.</P>
    <P>Of course, we agree with that; but it would be a very effective instrument if it were to be used.  To the extent that it has not been used we have the opportunity of saying something about it.</P>
    <P>Now I come to the regional fund. When we joined the European Community this was an area about which we all had an obsession and we paid more attention to it almost than we did to the common agricultural policy. However, our obsession was shortlived in our experience of membership because we found that it did not match our needs and certainly was well short of our expectations.  Now is the time again to re-examine the situation because this year the review of the regional fund is taking place and each Government has the opportunity of saying to the Commission and the Community &ldquo;Now that you are starting another period of development of the regional fund this is what we think you have failed to achieve and this is where we think you should go&rdquo;. Significantly, that is very much implicit in what the President of the Commission and the Commission themselves have to say in relation to the regional fund proposals of the next period of this Commission.</P>
    <P>Of the Paris Summit of 1974, which set up this regional fund and regional policy, two things could be said to its credit.  In every other respect it involved an unfortunate withdrawal from the previous high ideals of the Community.  No. 1 was that it did set up the regional fund.  No. 2, perhaps even more important, that it was for a period of three years only. Those three years are just now ending. What has been presented as a regional fund during that three years is anything but an effective regional fund.  In so far as it was provided for only three years we can say &ldquo;Well, that is over.  We are into a new era now.  Let us look at it in a more positive fashion and see what has to be done&rdquo;.  It is a time for firm proposals from this Government in relation to the review and operation of <Col N="1313" /> this fund.  Surely this would be the time for the Minister to come in and say &ldquo;These are our proposals.  Tell us here at home because you will not have the chance again.  This is what we are now proposing to the Commission in the reorganisation of the regional fund.  We want the views of the House on this.  Do not expect too much, but this is what we are saying.&rdquo; We have not got that from the Minister today.  We have only a brief reference to the regional fund in the course of this.  It is strange, coming from a Minister of the Irish Government, that perhaps we should note the fact that we should not be obsessed by the regional fund element, but it is time to say what has been wrong with its operation so far and what will be proposed for a more effective operation in the future.  It is a time for firm proposals and we have not got them.</P>
    <P>One thing which has been clear is that in the last three years the centre has grown stronger and more prosperous while the periphery has grown weaker and less prosperous by comparison.  Any child could draw a map of European experience and development in the last four years and colour it black for undeveloped countries and green for developed countries.  Green would hardly be appropriate to apply to us.</P>
    <P>I want to hear from the Minister or from the Minister for Finance before we go to the country, whenever we do, what are the proposals in relation to the new regional fund of the Community. At the next Stage I will offer our analysis of what has gone wrong and where we should go right from here on and make firm proposals, some of which people might say are asking too much but which will be based on the positions and principles stated by the Community themselves.  It is fairly evident&mdash;and this is also clear from the statement of President Jenkins&mdash; that the regional policy of the Community is not effected merely through the regional fund, and it is time we recognised that.  It must be also implemented and effected through the social fund, through the CAC and every other agency of the Community.  That is something that has been acknowledged <Col N="1314" /> over the last few years.  To the extent that every element in the Community proposal must have this as its clear commitment, we should be constantly reminding the Commission of their failure to achieve this.</P>
    <P>For instance, some areas have natural advantages because they are close to the market and you nearly have to prevent them from growing fat.  Germany, Holland, France and Belgium are where the demand is and will remain where the demand is.  Transport costs for them will always be less than for us.  We are where there is less demand by being on the periphery just like the south of Italy.  Apart altogether from the nature of the soil and of the natural deposits that exist in various areas, simply being where the market is of itself gives an advantage. Therefore these natural advantages and disadvantages will be aggravated or extended in the normal course of events unless there is some intervention by the Commission and Community.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>While I recognise that being required to vacate a house one has occupied for a considerable time can in some cases be a source of difficulty, the position in regard to the houses in question is that they are provided for members of the Garda Síochána in order to maintain a supply of officially owned quarters to facilitate transfers.  The occupants have no contract of tenancy and when they retire or are transferred the houses are needed for their successors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LorcanAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that in all other houses build by the NBA and local authorities for industry tenants are allowed the option of purchase? Will the Minister consider the position of the widow of a garda who must vacate a house under the present regulations?  Will the Minister give gardaí an opportunity of purchasing this type of house?  Will the Minister get the Board of Works or the NBA to build other houses for the Garda Síochána as the need arises?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not matter who builds the houses.  The problem is to maintain a supply of houses for serving personnel.  The Conroy Report recommended that there be an adequate supply of married quarters for serving members of the force to facilitate transfers.  I agree that on occasions on the death of a garda hardship may be caused to a widow who will have to leave the house, but one must remember that the house was built for a serving member of the force.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LorcanAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is aware <Col N="1319" /> that even if a garda builds his own house he may be transferred to another part of the country.  There is no guarantee that the garda in question will not be transferred.  He has no comeback.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no guarantee. It is one of the exigencies of service in the Garda Síochána that members are liable to be transferred, but transfers are only effected for the good of the service.  It might happen occasionally that a member having built his own house will have to be transferred, but in those circumstances he can sell his house and use the funds to buy another house.  Alternatively, if there is an NBA house, he can have the tenancy of that.</P>

      <P>The alternative would be not to supply NBA houses at all. If there were no houses that problem would not arise, but it is in the interests of the force that houses be provided. While the rents on these houses are not nominal, they are certainly low by comparison with commercial rents in the areas in question.  The force appreciate the fact that in many areas NBA houses are provided and they accept them on the understanding that these houses are provided only for serving members of the force.  If a garda is permanently transferred somewhere he has the option after a certain time of providing his own house and many gardaí do this.  They go into NBA houses on initial transfer and subsequently provide their own house.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidThornlet" hpid="Dr. Thornley Dr. Thornley">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Thornley</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice the offences for which solitary confinement is imposed; by whom it is imposed; the maximum period for which it is imposed; and whether there is any appeal procedure against its imposition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1320" />
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The breaches of prison discipline for which punishment may be awarded are set out in Rule 68 of the Rules for the Government of Prisons, 1947 (Statutory Rules and orders 1947, No. 320).  The periods for which close confinement may be awarded as a punishment are prescribed in Rules 69 and 71 of those rules and in paragraph (16) of the Schedule to the Prisons (Visiting Committees) Order, 1925.  The maximum period for which close confinement may be imposed by the Minister for Justice or a Visiting Committee for a breach of discipline is 14 days and the maximum period that may be imposed by a governor is three days.  A prisoner may apply to the Minister for mitigation of any punishment imposed or may apply to the Visiting Committee to recommend such mitigation. Prisoners regularly avail themselves of these procedures.</P>
      <P>I should like to take this opportunity to explain that close confinement is seldom imposed.  In 1976, for example, only 13 persons in custody, out of a total of 5,631 committals to custody throughout the year, incurred close confinement and that was for three days only.  The 13 instances arose from two occurrences&mdash;one involving three persons in custody and the other ten persons&mdash;when prison officers were attacked and injured.  Neither of these two disturbances took place in Portlaoise Prison.  As a matter of fact close confinement has been imposed in Portlaoise Prison on only one occasion since November, 1973.  That was on 29th November, 1975, when, during a search which disclosed concealed explosives, six prisoners combined to burn the contents of their cells.  All six received two days close confinement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I must explain, however, that due to a combination of factors, including in particular their positive refusal to work, it can happen that prisoners having lost privileges for breaches of discipline are confined to their cells during the period of their punishment save for the time spent on outdoor exercise.  Apart from their refusal to work, a contributory factor in making this situation unavoidable has been pressure on accommodation, due in large measure to the necessity to keep <Col N="1321" /> separated groups of prisoners who are hostile to one another.  Structural alterations which are currently in progress in the prison may ease this problem somewhat.</P>
    <P>By way of further clarification may I say that the need to keep prisoners under punishment in separation on the basis I have described has only arisen in the last 12 months or so, that apart from one occasion I shall mention, there were never more than a very few prisoners in separation at any one time.</P>
    <P>The only occasion when a large number of prisoners were in separation on the basis described followed the burning out of their cells by 99 prisoners on the day the British Ambassador was murdered.  Apart from that, the number of prisoners who have been in separation has been 20 in all.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidThornlet" hpid="Dr. Thornley Dr. Thornley">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Thornley</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two supplementaries I wish to put to the Minister.  First, will he not agree that the distinction between close confinement and solitary confinement is largely a verbal or dictionary distinction?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no such thing as solitary confinement because when a prisoner is in close confinement, if he is prepared to take part in the normal regime of the prison, he is not at any time in solitary confinement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidThornlet" hpid="Dr. Thornley Dr. Thornley">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Thornley</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept the distinction but is the Minister aware that rule 31 of the UN document of 1955 on the standard minimum rules for close confinement, provides that a prisoner should not be subjected to close confinement other than with the consent of the medical officer?  Is the Minister aware, also, that there is at least one prisoner in Portlaoise who has been in and out of close confinement so consistently that with the concurrence of the authorities he is to be transferred to the central criminal lunatic asylum?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Participation in a hunger strike&mdash;in other words, the refusal of food&mdash;is a breach of good order and discipline in prisons and gives rise to loss of privileges but not necessarily to close confinement.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Ruairí Brugha</NameTxt>
      <P>Without taking into consideration the merits or otherwise of the reasons for such actions, would the Minister appreciate that the stress of mind which results from a hunger strike can be aggravated considerably by reason of a person being alone?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>

      <P>I accept that the conditions in St. Brendan's Hospital fall short of what is desirable but I am advised that the report to which the <Col N="1330" /> Deputy appears to refer was misleading and exaggerated.</P>
      <P>The Eastern Health Board is, of course, responsible for the operation and maintenance of the hospital and I am satisfied that it has in recent years brought about a progressive improvement in the standards of care and accommodation provided there and in its other services for psychiatric patients.  In the allocation of resources I have always tried to ensure that health boards in general have been enabled to maintain a steady upgrading of conditions in the various long-stay institutions.  This year I have distributed £1 million to the boards specifically for renovations and improvements in their institutions and a further £1.6 million has been given to them for minor capital projects.  Under these schemes, the Eastern Health Board are commencing some structural work at St. Brendan's, including provision of smoke stop doors, better external exits and the upgrading of wards.  As far as my longer term policies are concerned, I aim eventually to achieve a situation where, with the growing development of community based services, it will be possible gradually to close old, out-dated institutions. The Deputy must appreciate however, that considerable resources will be required to achieve this aim but I am optimistic that it can be done relatively quickly.</P>

Is he further aware that, while two-thirds of the patients recover to a greater or lesser degree, it is reckoned that one-third still remain as chronic cases and, of that one-third, five per cent are estimated to die or to attempt suicide?

The ear, nose and throat services in the North-Western Health Board area are based in Sligo General Hospital, where there is a consultant ENT surgeon and 14 ENT beds.

Would the Parliamentary Secretary have another look at the proposal to provide an extra theatre in Sligo which will not be available for another two years, and see whether some sanity could be brought into the provision of this service in County Donegal?

      <P>The General Hospital Development Plan provides for the development of Letterkenny General Hospital and agreement has been reached with the North-Western Health Board that this should be the priority project for the area.  The detailed planning of the development by a design team is proceeding and is expected to be completed in spring, 1978.  The date of commencement of building will be determined when planning is completed.</P>
      <P>In the meantime, in order to alleviate overcrowding in the existing hospital, the health board decided to use, as a tempory measure, bed accommodation in the new 50-bed psychiatric unit at the hospital for general hospital purposes and this has been approved.</P>

      <P>I am afraid we are still not getting very good reception here at the back of the House.  I have complained about it time and time again and nothing whatever has been done about it.  It is no fault of the Ministers in the front bench; we just do not get any sound from these boxes up here.</P>
      <P>Might I ask the Parliamentary Secretary whether he is fully aware of the severe overcrowding that takes place daily in Letterkenny hospital and which has been taking place for many years now?  Is the Parliamentary Secretary further aware that rest rooms, television rooms and sundry rooms not intended for bed space are being so used?  Additionally is he aware that daily, week in and week out, the corridors are crammed with beds in this hospital and that it is long past the time when there should have been some crash development there in an endeavour to alleviate the situation? That is no exaggeration.  If one rings up today one will find there are dozens of people being accommodated in the corridors.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Health whether the two existing hospitals at Ballyshannon and Donegal town were considered when the decision was taken to locate the new orthopaedic unit at Sligo; and why neither of these locations was favoured.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBarry" hpid="Mr. R. Barry Mr. R. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of the provision of an orthopaedic unit for the North-Western Health Board area was considered and discussed by Comhairle na nOspidéal, the North-Western Health Board and my Department.</P>
      <P>Various options as to how the unit might be provided were put forward and considered, including the use of the Shiel Hospital, Ballyshannon.  A study prepared by the health board indicated that the Shiel Hospital was not considered suitable for an orthopaedic unit for a number of reasons such as the age of the buildings, the small number of beds, the general shortage of space and the scale of improvements which would really be necessary.  The use of the District Hospital, Donegal was not put forward as an option; it has not adequate facilities for orthopaedic use.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid the attitude in regard to serving this board area is as evident in this case as in all others.  Would the Parliamentary Secretary agree that it is ridiculous to suggest that this new unit be placed in Sligo which, to get down to the question of mileage, is approximately <Col N="1336" /> 150 miles from the most northerly point of County Donegal?  Surely this is ludicrous?  Would the Parliamentary Secretary not agree that the Shiel Hospital, Ballyshannon&mdash;even if it had to be enlarged to twice its present size&mdash;and/or the Donegal Hospital, which is quite a new unit, could be brought into operation for this type of patient and indeed for many other purposes in respect of which we now have to send patients all over the country?  It is ludicrous&mdash; 150 odd miles from the most northerly point of Donegal to Sligo and that is regarded as a service.  In fact a lot of money will be spent on its provision, allegedly serving the people of north Donegal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I well understand the Deputy's concern in regard to this problem, but I am not a member of the health board.  The report given to the Minister which I have here says that in view of the nature of the specialist services, such as orthopaedics, they should not be physically separated from a general hospital and, consequently, should be attached to Sligo General Hospital.  That is the report and advice given to the Minister by the people in the North-Western Health Board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Taking cognisance of the fact that up to now the orthopaedic service has been in Galway Regional Hospital mainly&mdash;and of course Sligo is regarded as a big improvement&mdash;might I draw the attention of the Parliamentary Secretary to the fact that this does not really constitute an improvement?  It is still totally inconvenient, absolutely too far removed from most of County Donegal and, much as Donegal people might deplore the idea of having to go to Dublin, it would be much more convenient for the patients, their families and visitors rather than going to Sligo, because that hospital is not suitably placed at all in this or any other regard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I certainly appreciate the case made by the Deputy for those people.  Perhaps I may say this to him, because this is what has been said by the board; the use of the Shiel Hospital was considered <Col N="1337" /> by the health board as a possible alternative location for the orthopaedic unit.  However, because of the scale of improvements necessary, the age of the buildings, the small number of beds and general shortage of space, the hospital was not considered suitable for an orthopaedic unit.</P>

Standing instructions require local office staff to return forms P.45 without delay to claimants when the necessary action has been completed and I can assure the Deputy that every effort is made to see that this instruction is complied with.  I understand that the majority of unemployment claimants attending employment exchanges have their forms P.45 returned to them within a week.  Those who attend at local branch offices normally have their forms returned within ten days due to the fact that the claims, including <Col N="1340" /> the form P.45 have to be submitted, generally through the post, to the parent employment exchange for scrutiny by a deciding officer.</P>

      <P>Would the Parliamentary Secretary indicate when the limits were last increased?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>To the best of my recollection, the rate was £26 per year when we came into office.  In the first budget introduced by this Government it was increased and has been increased on two occasions since by £1.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the Parliamentary Secretary found himself unable or unwilling to answer the supplementary question, would it be correct to say that the limits were last increased in April, 1975?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that is correct.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Would it be true to say that because of the inflation rate since then, the effect in real terms is that a number of people who were included in 1975 are now excluded?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be correct to say that allowing for inflation since this Government took office the percentage increase in the allowance has by far exceeded the inflation rate&mdash;in fact, the rate of allowance has been increased by several hundred per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know why, perhaps I do, the Parliamentary Secretary keeps evading the supplementary question put to him.  The question relates to the limits and the Parliamentary Secretary appears to be saying that the limits were last increased in April, 1975.  Since then, the rate of inflation has been approximately 40 per cent. Therefore, the limits obtainable in 1975 have been almost halved in real terms and, therefore, is it not true to say that people included in April, 1975 are now excluded from any allowances whatever and that consequently the amount of the increase is immaterial to them because they are not getting anything?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>There is neither a desire nor an intention to evade answering, <Col N="1342" /> but the question should be put in its proper context.  The performance of this Government in the area of means tests and allowances should be appreciated.  I do not intend to accept responsibility for the failure of the previous Government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Parliamentary Secretary agree that it is a relatively simple matter to increase allowances fairly substantially if at the same time one effectively is excluding many people who were entitled to widows' non-contributory pensions and OAP non-contributory&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare whether it is proposed to restore the position whereby on reaching the qualifying age for old age non-contributory pension, a recipient of a widow's non-contributory pension was entitled to opt for whichever pension was more favourable to her.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>A recipient of a widow's non-contributory pension never had the option of retaining that pension on reaching the qualifying age for old age pension.  There is, however, a provision which enables a non-contributory old age pension to be paid instead of a widow's (contributory) pension where the non-contributory rate would be higher. This provision is still in existence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Parliamentary Secretary indicate whether the means test applied in the case of a widow who reaches the age for OAP is different from that which operated when she was awarded the widows' non-contributory pension?</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's question indicates that there has been some change in the position.  As I pointed out in my reply, the position now is the same in that respect though there has been, by virtue of substantial increases in the meant test, a substantial extra number of people in receipt of these pensions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the Parliamentary Secretary does not find it possible to answer the question, I would ask him is it a fact that many widows reaching the qualifying OAP age find themselves receiving a reduced pension because they get the OAP under a statutory means test?</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>

    <P>That Dáil Éireann takes note of the reports: Developments in the European Communities&mdash;Fifth, Sixth, Seventh, Eighth and Ninth Reports.</P>
    <P Just="Right">&mdash;(Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the adjournment of this debate I was trying to identify the philosophy we should pursue in Europe.  I was pointing out that this was an appropriate time for the Minister to analyse our satisfaction or dissatisfaction with the European experience coming as it is four years after our membership and at the end of the Government's term. Generally speaking, I find that the Minister's speech, which was delivered <Col N="1350" /> by the Parliamentary Secretary, lacked that broad analysis of our experience in Europe which one would have expected at this stage.  More significantly, it lacked any statement or indication of how we intend to fulfil our role, discharge our obligations and exploit our opportunities in the next few years. We have a certain historical analysis but we do not have one of the type I mentioned.  We do not have an outline of the kind the incoming President of the Commission, Mr. Roy Jenkins, gave to the European Parliament when he set the scene for the Parliament as to where Europe goes from here.  I expected such an analysis at this stage because it is very much a landmark to this Dáil and the Government.</P>
      <P>I regret the Minister was not here to listen to my contribution but I accept he had an important commitment. However, business could have been arranged in such a way as to ensure his presence.  I said that two things could be said about the Paris Summit by way of commendation, the establishing of the regional fund and, secondly, that it limited the operation of that fund to three years.  The fund eventually provided was far too inadequate and at the end of the three year period we are all in a position to review the operation of that fund.  More important, we are in a position to highlight what must be done at the next stage that was not done at the last stage.  In so far as this review period is now on the way, I had hoped that the Minister would have told us the proposals he intends making to the Commission, and his colleagues on the Council, to correct the defects which were all too evident in the regional fund over the last few years.  This debate has not started in Ireland yet and the Minister could have highlighted what is required and what positive proposals the Government intend making. In the absence of those clear guidelines from the Government we felt, as an Opposition, that we had an obligation to pinpoint defects, some of which are obvious, and then make proposals when we change sides in this House shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the regional fund it will be recalled that I said we all had great expectations about this fund <Col N="1351" /> four years ago but sadly it has been most disappointing.  Why has it been a failure?  We all agree that the amount provided was far too small.  It was not adequate to deal with the imbalances that exist in Europe.  I highlighted this by saying that the discrepancies in wealth or gross domestic product between, for instance, the richest area like Hamburg and the poorest area, the west of Ireland, had increased.  Prior to accession Hamburg was five times ahead of us in terms of gross domestic product per head and now, after the operation of the regional fund, it is six times ahead.  Therefore, far from correcting regional imbalances we have allowed them to be aggravated.  That fact cannot be denied and it must be presented to the incoming Commission and Council to underline the fact that Europe has not been consistent and has allowed the imbalances to increase rather than diminish.  The total fund for the three years was £542 million and for that period it was totally inadequate from the point of view of imbalances and inflation to deal reasonably with problems.</P>
    <P>The regional fund is only one entity in regional policy&mdash;I acknowledge that immediately&mdash;but it is the most easily identifiable one and so one looks at it because it is so easily identifiable.  Clearly, Ireland's allocation has been quite inadequate.  A sum of £35 million over a three year period, taking inflation into account, does not represent anything like a serious attempt to deal with regional imbalances in so far as they are exemplified in the differences in our economic condition and wealthier states in the centre of Europe as distinct from ourselves who are on the periphery of Europe.  Far from correcting the imbalances the fund has been such as actually to allow the imbalances to increase.  That is just not good enough.</P>
    <P>I quoted this morning something Mr. Roy Jenkins said on becoming President:</P>
    <P>We want our deeds to be a little better than our words.  Let us always do more than we promised to do.</P>
    <P>The reverse of that has been the case where the regional funds are concerned <Col N="1352" /> since we joined the Community.  The reverse has been obvious.  We have an opportunity now of saying that we accept that principle and let the Community now deliver on it.</P>
    <P>When we look at our Government's handling of the fund allocation we see a fault which can be attributed directly to ourselves.  The allocation of £35 million over the three year period is flowing directly into the Exchequer.  We have had this out on a number of occasions in the last few years.  Can we pinpoint in the west, the south or anywhere else precisely what projects have grown out of our allocation from the regional fund?  To what extent have projects been grant aided out of the regional fund?  The Government have certain obligations and will continue to have those obligations to provide adequate financing for development projects.  There have been industrial projects in relatively advantaged areas, in Dublin and along the south and east coasts.  These, we are told, are benefiting from the regional fund.  This fund should be applied to the most deserving areas, the disadvantaged areas in the west.  In fact, the allocation has been used to supplement what the Government themselves should have been doing through the medium of IDA grants and so on.  It has become impossible to identify precisely how much each project has benefited and what the Government would have felt obliged to give had the regional fund not been in existence.  This is something that should be clearly analysed for our own benefit and also for the benefit of the Community because we should be able to show what advantages are coming to us directly from the Community.</P>
    <P>The training programme in AnCO is carried through by moneys provided from the social fund.  Every time the Minister for Labour talks about training programmes he should say that the money is provided by Europe.  He should acknowledge that.  He should also acknowledge the fact that the fund is not being put to effective advantage at the other end in the provision of jobs.  In that way people would know what exactly is being done and by whom.  That is the second criticism I have to make.</P>
    <P>I referred to Governments channelling <Col N="1353" /> moneys from the regional fund into their own Exchequers.  That should not happen and I hope that weakness will be corrected in the operation of the new fund which will now be established.</P>
    <P>The Commission has very little control over the operation of the fund. Of course, we all like our own independence but this money is coming from Europe and Europe should be aware of how it is used and what control there is over its application.  The only people who could make that information available are the national Government. We all like getting the money but we have a responsibility to those who provide the money.  I hope in the future it will be possible for industrialists, local authorities and others to apply directly to the Commission on the basis of the allocation for Ireland.  The application would, of course, have to be generated through the Government to some extent.  The Government should shoulder their responsibility and not confuse the public with regard to what is regional fund assistance and what is a national obligation.  We have all been guilty of ambivalence in this.  The same pattern has been repeated in Italy.  The money there was channelled into southern Italy.  This is a weakness that must not be allowed to continue when the new regional fund is created.  We must be able to see what exactly is being done with the money and to what effect it is being put.</P>
    <P>Obviously, there will be a temptation for member states to say they will keep things as they are so that they can put these moneys into their respective Exchequers and use them to assist their own currency position.  This must be avoided at all costs.  We must have clear evidence of the success or failure of the regional fund to achieve its object.  As it is, there is a defect in the system.  If my suggestion is adopted, then we will be able to see the effect.  It is not just good enough to put the money into the national Exchequer.  The basic aim of the fund must be maintained.  The basic aim was stated away back in 1972 or 1973. We all supported that but, having supported it, we did the exact opposite. The performance was far short of the promise.  The aims must be clearly <Col N="1354" /> stated and it will be up to each Minister to implement those aims or even exceed them in terms of the commitment given.</P>
    <P>The new fund must be a Community fund in the real sense.  It must be in no way associated with national quotas.  Understandably contributors will say they have been contributing so much to various funds and they now want to cut back.  If they want to do that, then let that be clearly stated honestly by those contributors. We must have an open debate at the level of the Commission and the Council of Ministers as to what exactly they intend to do.  If the Germans were to say: &ldquo;We have been giving too much anyway and we will not put more into the regional fund&rdquo;, then at least we would all be faced with the realities of the regional fund, but there is no point in pretending the one and doing the other.  In that sense it must be divorced from national quotas.</P>
    <P>The national quota allocation has been such as to limit the operation of the fund in the areas of greatest need, and this country happens to be still one of those areas, and to apply it in areas where the need is not at all as critical.  If it had been applied in the way it might have been, it would have helped to ensure that the discrepancies and disparities that exist in the levels of wealth and prosperity in Europe would not have developed to the extent that they have over the last number of years.  It would have meant that Ireland would qualify for a much larger share of whatever fund was made available than it has done.</P>
    <P>The amount of aid each country would get would and should.  I submit, depend to a very considerable extent on the nature of the projects they submit for grant assistance, such as would give the greatest degree of employment, provide adequate development of infrastructures, including communications and so on.  All of these would be suitable for development of the periphery within the periphery, namely, the west of Ireland, Ireland being peripheral to the European scene as a whole.  All of these involve long term planning, in the first instance, on the part of the <Col N="1355" /> national governments, and would be submitted to the Commission.  The right to apply directly and benefit directly from the fund would ensure that defects would be corrected.  It should also mean that whatever would be applied from the regional fund would be applied without any reduction in the level of national aid to be applied to the particular problem under consideration. Otherwise we do not operate a regional fund effectively even within our own country.</P>
    <P>This would ensure an equal opportunity for everyone to apply but it would also ensure that the Commission could play a more effective role.  It might seem strange for me to be talking in terms of the role the Commission could play, but given adequate resources to discharge its obligations it can ensure that the imbalances throughout the Community which only the Commission as a Community instrument can achieve will be corrected; in other words, the responsibility would come back to them.  To put it another way, supposing our allocation from the regional fund was even doubled, unless there was a greater answerability directly in the Commission, they still could not ensure that what we used here would be effectively used to eliminate the imbalances greater answerability directly to the Community.  I know all of this depends on co-operation and that we must assume responsibility in each member state, but one must also recognise that responsibility can only be discharged where there is authority.  The Commission should have a greater degree of authority in this direction, that is on the assumption, of course, that there are adequate resources to implement its policy.  To that extent the Commission would have responsibility to implement regional policy through the social fund and through FEOGA, and all the time they would be in a central position to ensure a constant and consistent programme.</P>
    <P>The European Parliament under direct elections could play an important role in this regard, but it seems to me that fixing a fund for a three year period in advance is sometimes simply <Col N="1356" /> a way of giving the impression to the public at large that this big amount of money is made available.  Two things happen in the meantime.  First of all, inflation, exchange rates and so on diminish the amount that a country such as ours will receive from the Community, although there are moves afoot in the Commission to correct this. Secondly, the only way this can be effectively done is that there would be a regular annual allocation which would mean that after each year there would be a review of progress and equally an admission of failure where failures occur.</P>
    <P>Where there is a three year block, as there was in the last period, disparities can be aggravated and all of us are powerless to do anything about them during that three year period.  I believe in long term planning, perhaps, in a way the Government do not, but I do not think this regular annual review would cut across long term planning within the European context. Deputy Thornley is here and I hope I can give way to him so that he can make more than the beginnings of his address.  I would hope that the European Parliament, which he and others serve&mdash;and I am sorry the others cannot be here today because of their other obligations&mdash;would have more direct control each year over that fund and similar funds, which cannot be achieved with a global fund over a three year period.  If we want these people to look after our interests as European Parliamentarians, then this annual review will be of vital importance to them in discharging that responsibility.</P>
    <P>We also have the obligation&mdash;and I suppose this is the easiest thing for us to say as net beneficiaries&mdash;at least to state publicly, whatever will be the response from the Commission, what we think is the appropriate or minimum size for the fund over the next few years, having regard to the experience we have had with the all too diminished fund that has operated over the last number of years.  Everybody has acknowledged that what has been applied has been far too small, and it is reasonable to expect that the size of the fund should be doubled for 1978.  That would give us a figure of <Col N="1357" /> around £400 million which would bring us back somewhere close to the figure which the Commission themselves originally proposed in July, 1973.  However, if allowance is to be made for inflation and the effect of recession on the Community's underdeveloped regions&mdash;and we obviously have suffered more than most&mdash;then this figure will have to be amended upwards in this first year to a figure in the region of £500 million.  That is only to bring us back to where we were three years ago.  If the fund is to be allocated and to have any impact on the disparities that exist in the Community, it will have to be of that order.  If we were to get 6 per cent of that, it would give us a figure of between £24 million and £30 million, and this for one year would be a vast improvement on the global figure of £35 million which had to be accepted over a three year period.</P>
    <P>There is another way of presenting it.  Let us talk in terms of jobs being created and look at the national programme, what the Government propose, what we all recognise to be necessary.  For instance the IDA say we need to create 17,000 new jobs in industry each year.  This probably corresponds to roughly 25,000 gross when account is taken of job losses over the same period.  Perhaps an extra 25,000 jobs need to be created to have a net 17,000 new jobs.  Taking the IDA rate of job allocation and jobs being grantaided at the rate of approximately £4,000, that is, on the 1975 figures, that would be talking in terms of an annual grant of £100 million.</P>
    <P>If the regional fund were to contribute a mere 25 per cent to that, we would benefit to the tune of £25 million. These are figures which we can present as hard facts and I hope they are being presented at the moment, though I have no evidence that this is so.  Our total requirements would be considerably more because that is only for employment and to supplement the activities of the IDA.  Taking account of infrastructural development, we would need about £40 million, which is not unrealistic in European terms. This would give us an opportunity to <Col N="1358" /> eliminate the imbalances which exist between ourselves and the rest of Europe.  Some people may say it is not realistic to talk in terms of a fund of £400 million or £500 million in the first year but it is realistic according to the stated principles of the Community. They may say it is unrealistic to talk of Ireland benefiting to the amount of £40 million but it is realistic in terms of the programmes we should have and the commitment which Europe has set for itself.  I would have hoped for an indication from the Minister as to what he is now proposing to the Commission which has this matter under review.  I should like the Minister in his reply to give us the exact proposals of the Government.  We have put the position on the record and we are setting a precedent for the Government in doing so publicly.</P>
    <P>The social fund is very much involved in this and the tables show that it can be used to great advantage in implementing the regional policy of the Community.  We have benefited to a very considerable extent from this.  The fact that the new priorities of the social fund will be directed towards employment as much as towards training gives us an opportunity and an obligation to co-ordinate this with our own national plan.  That depends, of course, on our having a national plan or programme. It is understandable that the Commission would set rather stringent guidelines for any assistance or loans or support in the absence of our presenting to them a national plan.  We badly need such a plan so that the nation can respond and we can identify where we are going and so that Europe can judge our success or failure by our implementation of that plan.  We have not used to full advantage the vast resources which we have got from the social fund.</P>
    <P>In the last few days I have read an article written by the Minister called &ldquo;Taking Stock Four Years On&rdquo;.  I might say that I found the general tenor of this article appropriate to what I had hoped we would be discussing today.  I took my theme from this article but there was very little stocktaking involved in the Minister's speech today.  In the article the Minister <Col N="1359" /> said that the area we expected most from, the regional fund, we got least from and one of the areas we expected least from and from which we had no expectations at all, the social fund, was the area from which we got most.  I say amen to that.  We did not use the social fund to the best effect.  We retrained people for jobs that did not exist.  That is not consistent with our responsibilities as a member of the Community.  We do not have limitless funds to shore up the economies of the various countries.</P>
    <P>I might mention that I was rather surprised on reading the Minister's article that there was no mention of the question of fishery development. This would be considered by most people to be a most important matter at this time.  I would have expected it to figure very prominently in any such report given by the Minister.  I know that it is not possible to cover everything in one article but I expected to find some reference to this matter.</P>
    <P>I will deal briefly with direct elections.  Deputy Thornley will probably have more to say about this.  It would have been appropriate for the Minister to make some reference to what this will mean for us.  Someone whispered to me earlier that the Bill to give effect to this will be circulated tomorrow.  Certainly the time has long passed when the Irish people should have been told something other than the constituencies in which they will vote.  This has been arranged by Deputy Tully and I use the word &ldquo;arranged&rdquo; euphemistically.  He is a master of electoral arrangements and he has learned his lesson very well. We should have started this very important debate already otherwise we may not have the time for it, depending on how long the Taoiseach postpones the general election.  The man who should launch that debate is in the House.  I understand the commitments which he has and the obligations he must fulfil.  People can always criticise politicians for not doing what they should but let us have the launching of this debate very shortly.  While it will not be an issue of conflict or disagreement in the <Col N="1360" /> general election, it is an issue which should be presented to the people before the general election so that they will know more about the direct elections when they occur in 1978.  It is vitally important that this debate should get under way.  I have referred to this before and the fact that I am making a brief reference to it today in no way minimises the importance which I and my party attach to this.</P>
    <P>Enlargement is an issue which has been discussed.  I was a little surprised to read a report of the conditions being set down by the Minister for our response to the applications of the other states.  One of the conditions summarised in the Press appeared to be that their accession should not involve the diminution of our share.  Perhaps that is too general a summary but it seems that if their accession were to mean a diminution in our share of the various funds, then we would not be very enthusiastic supporters.</P>
    <P>It is recognised that all democratic states of Europe have basically the right to membership of the Community when they fulfil the conditions subject to normal practical negotiations. That is the purpose of the foundation of the Community.  We were anxious to get in for a number of political and economic reasons&mdash; very definitely for economic reasons so that we could ensure, for instance, that we would not have to subsidise our food for the British market under their cheap food policy.  It does not come too well from us having got in to be saying to others who are also entitled to come in according to European ideals &ldquo;Wait a minute, Greece&rdquo;, or Spain or Turkey as the case might be, &ldquo;our support for your entry will be conditional on the strengthening of the institutions of Europe&rdquo;.  That is fine.  That is a matter for the existing Nine.  The strengthening of the commitment within Europe is also a matter for the existing Nine and we will not be diminishing our share.  That is not the right approach.  Europe globally, even allowing for the undeveloped regions, such as we are, within it, is still a comfortable Community.  We cannot <Col N="1361" /> consistently face the world outside of Europe while simply trying to protect the position of those in Europe who are already members. What right have we to say to Greece or Spain or Turkey, if they meet democratic criteria &ldquo;No, because it is going to mean you poorer nations joining and we have enough poor nations already.  God knows we have Ireland and they are a chronic problem&rdquo;?  That does not make sense. There are, after all, political reasons to the advantage of the existing member states why these countries should be there.  Sometimes to have the advantage of their political accession they may have to acknowledge that there are financial transfers to be applied.</P>

      <P>The Deputy has summarised the position we discussed succinctly though it is somewhat incomplete. While certainly it was not absent from my mind that we should be concerned, it does affect us detrimentally.  We are also concerned in this and this was made clear in the expression of that view that the resources of the Community would be adequate for the new members also. It was not totally a narrow view although some degree of self-interest was not entirely absent.</P>

      <P>I was surprised when I heard the summary of what the Minister was meant to have said when he visited Spain.  It seemed to me a little inconsistent with the European attitude as has been previously expressed by him.  He has always a tendency to say &ldquo;We want what we have&rdquo;.  That is understandable.  We want it because we are entitled to it under the terms of the European commitment. <Col N="1362" /> Suppose the European Community were to say in the coming year &ldquo;We are not going to increase the regional fund and we are damned if we are going to give much more to the social fund&rdquo;, would Ireland say then &ldquo;Right, well that means that Greece or Turkey can wait until such time as they do&rdquo;, or would we put the pressure on them and say &ldquo;Right either your commitment is a reality or it is not&rdquo;?  We are not going to oppose their membership simply because those who have the obligation to contribute to the financial betterment of the Community are not prepared to do so.</P>

Everybody accepted that this was correct, but it was important to us to get the assurance at that time and important to Greece to get in at that time.  There was no objection whatever to Greece joining in.  I said in Spain that this obstacle was out of the way.</P>

      <P>Let us insist that President Jenkins, when he says this, really means it and not just as President of the Commission.  Let us see that he gets the support and the muscle to do what the Commission some years ago were prevented from doing when the interests of the superior member states were prior to the interest of the Community as a whole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are one or two other things I want to refer to briefly.  One is the Third World.  It is always there and it is an acute area.  I do not want to make this a debate on our development obligations, having regard to the naturally limited financial contribution we <Col N="1363" /> can make, but we can do something imaginative, constructive and creative. We could, for instance, by allocating certain funds for studies of the structural problems in the relations between the Third World and the Community set up some study centre here at a small cost which would, say, look at the restructuring of our industrial programme within the Community to admit not just access for the Third World to our markets because access is not enough if they are competing at a disadvantage with developed countries, but also to see how we could restructure our industrial activities within the Community.  We want to encourage the industrial development of these states and to a certain extent qualify our industrial promotion in certain areas&mdash;textiles for instance&mdash; in areas where they can generally be produced cheaper.  In other words, we should be looking to Europe to see how we can exploit advantages in markets that will not affect them, and how we can to a certain extent gradually withdraw slowly from markets that they depend on.  That is a whole new area that involves a degree of research and study.</P>
    <P>I am quite sure that if our Government were to launch such a study in a constant centre we would get the best and most concerned brains, coming to this study centre, activating a new sense of awareness of Europe at very little cost and also giving us a real role as initiators rather than simply reacting to events.  This is the kind of area where we can show to the Third World, as distinct simply from transfers of money, that we are really initiating.  Perhaps the only Government at the moment doing this in an effective way apart from their own regular commitments are the Dutch Government.  If other events had not intervened in Holland the Minister and I might now have been at a seminar there on reshaping the world order. We should at least commit ourselves to engaging in that kind of activity, There is a great goodwill in our own country for that kind of aim and the support we would get would have a reaction throughout Europe.  It would mean that these experts going back to their own <Col N="1364" /> countries would have an input into their own ideas that would have some effect, certainly far in excess, of the cost of the project, which might be of the order of £40,000 or £50,000.  The effect of it could be enormous by comparison with our investment in it. It is a proposal that would help us to discharge more effectively our responsibility to the Third World.</P>
    <P>I have two or three other matters and then I will finish.  As a principle we should where possible discourage trading in arms with the undeveloped world.  I know that this is the position of the Minister, but we must have it seen to be so.  We hold the view that this is exploiting the needs of the third world, to the advantage of the developed states in Europe.  The armaments industry in Europe is an immense industry which should be able to survive without relying on the needs of the Third World or armament development. For the first time we may also become exporters of armaments.  I hope that we can take up a consistent position if that should arise.  We should help the Third World countries in a positive way and not simply because it suits us to help them.</P>
    <P>In the area of general commitment, it is important that each country should be fully represented on the commission.  In this report I would have liked to have seen a reference to the senior positions held at directorgeneral level in this country.  It is clear that we are not represented to the extent that we should due to the fact that the Government presented two applicants for the same post, so that we wound up with neither of them getting it.  That is something that the Government should not have allowed to have happened.  The sooner that position is corrected the better, particularly having regard the preponderance of British representation in the Community at the moment.</P>
    <P>In relation to the national scene, surely we can tell the commission that we need assistance and support very badly in relation to opportunities for employment for young people.  We can talk about that in terms of the regional fund and rural development.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1365" /> Because I am conscious of the fact that Deputy Thornley is waiting to come in I will not refer to other matters. I will probably have some opportunity to refer to other matters at a later date.  I have simply tried to set out guidelines and to establish a philosophy for ourselves in Europe.</P>
    <P>In relation to fisheries I will make one reference which supports a position I have been holding all along.  In the fisheries sector of this report President Jenkins says that the Community has to build a policy suited to the new division of the world seas and that the extension of limits from 12 to 200 miles brings within our authority a a vast expanse of waters.  That happened because of the extension which took place after we joined the Community. Unfortunately, it is now painfully obvious that that is another case where the Government have been given a great opportunity to do something new and positive and where they have failed miserably, because of divided counsels at home and because of the lack of a consistent policy in the Community.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidThornlet" hpid="Dr. Thornley Dr. Thornley">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Thornley</NameTxt>
      <P>These debates are usually taken as opportunities for pretty wide-ranging discussions of recent developments in the European Economic Community.  I am following Deputy O'Kennedy in interpreting them in that way.  It is rare for me to touch <i>terra firma</i>, and to have an opportunity to enter into one of these debates, because, in common with the Minister for Foreign Affairs, I spend most of my life waving to my colleagues from passing jets.  I will compress my remarks as far as possible since the time at my disposal is short. As the date has yet to be decided for the resumption of this debate and as my presence at that time is equally unknown, I will endeavour to speak with a rapidity which will even exceed that of the Minister for Foreign Affairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Speaking as a European parliamentarian I must refer to one of the recent developments which has taken place in the European Parliament, that is, the election of a President to the Parliament. Direct elections will face us in 1978.  We have come within eight votes of having the opportunity of having <Col N="1366" /> the first Irish President of the European Parliament.  I unashamedly took the view that it was better to have a member of Fianna Fáil, in the person of Senator Yeats, as President of the European Parliament than anyone else. The three Fine Gael members of the Christian Democratic Group apparently disagreed with me with the result that we now have a President of the European Parliament in the person of Signor Colombo, who defeated Senator Yeats by eight votes.  I am not comparable with the Minister for Foreign Affairs in mathematics, but it seems to me that, if the three Fine Gael members had deserted their groupings and transferred their allegiance to the other side, Signor Colombo would have had a majority of only two.  I do not think it would have been beyond human ingenuity for even someone like myself to have whittled that down by judicious blackmail.  However, they chose to adhere to their group, and the Parliamentary Secretary praised them for their adherence to their group.</P>
    <P>Therefore, instead of having Senator Michael Yeats as President of the European Parliament in the year in which direct elections face us we have instead an ex-Minister of the Italian Government in the person of Signor Colombo.  That is his main claim to fame, a claim to fame which, with due respect to the Italians, of whom I am extremely fond, is held in common by most Italians over the age of 50, as far as I can make out, since the ending of the Second World War.  Signor Colombo comes to the presidency of the European Parliament trailing clouds of glory in the shape of the Lockheed scandal. He was a member of the European Parliament for only three months, while Senator Yeats has been a member since the entry of Ireland into the European Community.</P>
    <P>It reminds me of the joke about John Lindsay, the Mayor of New York, when he joined the Democratic Party and immediately decided to run for President.  They had no objection to him joining the choir but they disliked him seeking to become Pope in the first week.  This is what Signor Columbo has done.  In the words of one of the Italian newspapers, having <Col N="1367" /> almost wrecked the Italian Government he now proposes to wreck the European Parliament.</P>
    <P>As far as I am concerned the Fine Gael group who co-operated in this interesting proceeding can consult their own mode of rationalisation to justify why they did it.  While I hold no particular brief for Senator Yeats, who is not of my party, I feel that at this juncture, when issues like fishing are so important, I would rather have the ear of a kindred spirit in the shape of a fellow Irishman than the ear of a slightly more remote spirit in the shape of Signor Colombo.  The Parliamentary Secretary's justification for this was that one should adhere to one's group.  This was not, as I pointed out to <i>The Irish Times</i>, a view shared by the Italian Communists, who mysteriously obliterated their Marxist affiliations and, by abstaining, brought into office an Italian Christian Democrat&mdash; a very normal, natural thing to do. This sort of thing happens all the time in the European Parliament.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kelly, despite his long career in European universities of one kind or another, appears to be oblivious to the fact that the group descriptions in the European Parliament are even more meaningless than the descriptions of socialists, liberals, conservatives&mdash; Fianna Fáil, Labour, Fine Gael&mdash;as applied in the British Isles.  Deputy Kelly appears to live under the illusion that Christian Democrats are Christian Democrats, that Communists are Communists, that Liberals are Liberals and that Socialists are Socialists.  Speaking for the Socialists, in theory we represent the most extreme left wing group in the Parliament. We reasonably numbered among ourselves an Italian Republican, who decided to leave us to join the Liberals. The Liberals in England are regarded as a sort of centre, a nice sort of people, whereas in the European Parliament they are the extreme right wing group, so that his transition from the socialist group to the extreme right wing group was quite illogical.  Someone should explain this to the Parliamentary Secretary sometime, because while he may be expert in the field of <Col N="1368" /> jurisprudence he does not appear to have studied political science, political philosophy or contemporary European political events.</P>
    <P>I have no particular sympathy with the European Progressive Democratic group.  An ex-president of the socialist group described the association between Fianna Fáil and de Gaullists as a made marriage.  That was a witty remark, but both groups have a fair amount in common.  Groupings in the European Parliament are brought about, broadly speaking, on the basis of possessing the minimum number of people which entitles one to secretarial assistance and financial subvention throughout the contesting of direct elections. If anyone finds that brutally logical or unacceptable, all I can say is that it is true.</P>
    <P>To do justice to the Fianna Fáil and de Gaullists groups, they have a lot in common.  For instance neither group believe in anything in particular. I am not saying that by way of criticism.  Indeed, I am not sure what Fine Gael or the Labour Party believe in from time to time.  The Fianna Fáil and de Gaullist groups have in common also the fact that they are held together by the memory of great men, in one case de Gaulle and in the other de Valera.  Therefore, I find their liaison as logical as the liaison of any other groupings.</P>
    <P>In my own case I am regarded as one of the communists of the socialist group.  There are Belgian socialists who would barely speak to me, regarding me as a dangerous form of animal.  But, then, there are Italian communists who would regard Deputy Flor Crowley as one of the most extreme exponents of social radicalism that one could meet.  If the Parliamentary Secretary has not discovered yet the realities of European policies, it is about time he took a crash course and got away from fundamental rights in the Irish Constitution.  I recall an interesting seminar of the socialist group in Triestè which broke up in disorder because the French began to sing the Red Flag, something the Germans did not like.</P>
    <P>I do not find Deputy Kelly's intervention in this sphere particularly <Col N="1369" /> harmful but when he sets himself up as an ideologist of the European Christian Democratic right I find myself somewhat distressed.  He chided me for my support for Senator Yeats. Supporting his own three representatives for their support for Signor Colombo he said that the great opportunities had been missed by the Fianna Fáil members.  As reported in the debates for March 10th he said he was certain one could not put a knife between the position on the European plane of the great Christian Democrats of the forties and fifties, de Gasperi, Adenauer and so on and the things for which the great men of Fianna Fáil have stood.  He said that Fianna Fáil had turned their backs on what would have been a much more natural alliance, that of throwing in their lot with the Christian Democrats which group Fine Gael had joined and an historic development might have unfolded even in this country.  This is very interesting.  The implication of it is that the logical coalition for this country is a coalition of the Christian Democratic right between the right wing of Fine Gael and the right wing of Fianna Fáil.  As I approach the electorate I find it difficult to think of a way of explaining to them that I am supporting ostensibly Fine Gael in the Coalition while Deputy Kelly puts forward the view that Ireland should be governed by a Fianna Fáil-Fine Gael alliance following in the footsteps of de Gasperi and Adenauer.</P>
    <P>So far as I am concerned if the Parliamentary Secretary wants an alliance that would follow in the footsteps of de Grasperi who, incidentally, hid out the Second World War in the Vatican Library while better men were dying in the Italian resistance, Deputy Kelly may, in the immortal words of Samuel Goldwyn, include me out.  I would point out to him that he is not the only university professor in this Dáil and that furthermore I am the only university professor here of political science.  If the Parliamentary Secretary seeks to set himself forward as the intellectual theoretician of the right in Ireland, he will find that I am happy to take him on as the intellectual theoretician of the democratic left because it is the <Col N="1370" /> intellectual theoreticians of Christian democracy of this kind who are the most dangerous.  The Hitlers, the Stalins and so on are quite simple. One can kill them or something like that but the others are the ones who try to place a theoretical gloss on the opportunistic beliefs.  If Deputy Kelly is endeavouring to make out that a Fianna Fáil-Fine Gael Christian democratic alliance has some sort of historical European justification, he is living in a world of his own imagination and one in which I would be happy not to have a place.</P>

      <P>The issue of direct elections has been raised.  This will be a vital issue during the next 12 months.  It is of vital importance that Ireland lead the way in this.  At present the Italians, of all people, are at the most advanced stage of legislative procedure in this regard.  Deputy O'Kennedy is absolutely correct in pressing for the Bill in connection with the direct elections to be laid before the House at the earliest moment possible.  I say this for many reasons, not least for the purpose of educating people in their obligations in voting in constituencies that will be six or seven times the size of the constituencies with which they are familiar.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps I have a selfish interest in this but this is not the selfish interest of seeking a position myself although I may find myself in that situation. Rather my interest is that the further this Bill is deferred the further my bookmaker's mind implies to me that the general election will be deferred correspondingly because I cannot see what I am afraid many of my colleagues regard as 15 pieces of patronage being allowed to go wanting while the Coalition are in office. One of the great functions of direct elections will be to abolish the dual mandate.  As has been pointed out in recent newspaper comments arising out of a rather sad circumstance to which I shall refer in a moment, the physical stresses of the dual mandate are intolerable and cannot be continued. It is impossible for one to <Col N="1371" /> maintain one's constituency work particularly in a multi-member context and at the same time be an adequate European representative.  For instance, my frequent absences from this country, apart from imposing considerable strain on my physique, are also promoting an excessive zeal on the part of my colleagues in my constituency which exceeds the bounds of what I regard as good manners.</P>

      <P>I am provoked to make these remarks by reason of a rather sad circumstance to which we should refer, that is, the very recent death of Sir Peter Kirk, the leader of the English Conservative delegation. He was a very gifted man who made a forceful and effective contribution to the development of parliament in his short career.  He was a man of 48 years of age but the strain became intolerable for him.  He died after successive heart attacks.  Following on the death of Crosman, too, I hope the Irish people will realise that a politician's life is not as easy as the public may think and that in particular the life of a politician who must commute increasingly between Ireland and Europe will become more difficult as more and more the buck will stop in Brussels or Luxembourg.  We will require politicians with constitutions of iron especially those in multi-member constituencies, who have friends of dubious loyalty.</P>
      <P>I fear that if the Bill is rushed before the people the poll will be correspondingly low, that the people will be apathetic.  I speak here as someone not involved directly but I am sad that so many of my colleagues on both sides of the House seem to regard these 15 seats as pieces of lucrative patronage.  This is a dreadful way to regard the ultimate functioning of this country in a European context.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If I may make my second and final dig at the Parliamentary Secretary, in discussing the drawing of the <Col N="1372" /> boundaries by the Minister for Local Government he casually dismissed the Fianna Fáil criticism as simply reflecting the fact that Fianna Fáil were annoyed that they might lose what he described as one or two of these Euro-pools wins.  He suggested that European Deputies were overpaid.  If the dream of Schuman, Monèt and the other gentlemen he mentions so freely &mdash;presumably he knew Adenauer well in his European days&mdash;is to be summed up as involving Euro-pools wins and if that is the view of an educated university academic with a Heidelberg degree, God help us when we go down to the Ring of Kerry and try to get people to understand what they are voting for in direct elections. It is vitally important, as Deputy O'Kennedy has said, that statutory control should rapidly be introduced. Both Council and Commission&mdash;here I address my remarks specifically both to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Deputy O'Kennedy neither of whom are members of the European Parliament&mdash;I have found hostile on many occasions to Parliament.</P>
    <P>I had the pleasure yesterday of bringing over a Conservative MP, Mr. Hugh Dykes, to Ireland and brought him to see President Hillery.  They largely discussed the role of the Commission and the attitude of the Commission to Parliament.  Mr. Dykes was greatly impressed with the goodwill that President Hillery had always felt as a Commissioner towards Parliament but President Hillery had to admit, although he was much too discreet to name names, that goodwill towards Parliament was not shared by all of his colleagues.  I pay compliment to the Minister for Foreign Affairs that during his period as President we always found him most co-operative and most helpful in this regard but the same is not true of all members of the Commission or all members of the Council of Ministers who tend to regard Parliament as an irritant, a cumbersome, annoying irritant.  As long as they treat it in that way the hen and egg circle will continue; Parliament will be no more than a powerless, lucrative, cumbersome instrument.  The question is whether you give Parliament powers first and take it seriously <Col N="1373" /> second or the other way round but one way or another ultimately the role of Parliament must be greatly enhanced and in the quality of representation greatly enhanced and this will only be done if the best people are sent over irrespective of treating these as further forms of patronage.</P>
    <P>I am speaking here very frankly and very rapidly and I trust that somebody is waiting to come in because at any moment I may suddenly sit down in my abrupt and brutal manner.  I am also struck by the lack of liaison between members of this Government &mdash;indeed I think of most Governments in west European countries&mdash;and the members of the European Parliament. When delegates to the European Parliament seek briefs from a Minister's Department very often what they get&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Thornley</NameTxt>
      <P>That was the idea.  I am very sadly struck by the lack of Government-Parliamentary member liaison.  When a Deputy like Deputy Kavanagh or myself, to take the two Labour Deputies, going to the European Parliament seek information on Government policy on a matter like fisheries&mdash;I fear I shall not take the self-denying ordinance of Deputy O'Kennedy and refrain from talking about fishing&mdash;from the Minister for Agriculture or the Minister for Fisheries, very often what we get is yet another inch-thick load of &ldquo;bumf&rdquo; to add to the existing loads of &ldquo;bumf&rdquo; in purple which we are getting in English translation at the rate of approximately 1 cwt. a day from the European Parliament.  This is not a brief.  Very often we find ourselves strenuously defending positions within <Col N="1374" /> our groups only to open the <i>New York Herald Tribune</i> which is the only English-speaking newspaper you can get with any rapidity in any of these centres to find that the Ministers of State have abandoned the position that we were defending so strenuously the night before.  This makes us look extremely ridiculous in front of our colleagues.</P>
      <P>I mentioned the <i>Herald Tribune</i> as being the only English-speaking paper you can get and if I may be permitted this aside, one of the great tragedies of our unpreparedness for Common Market membership is our lack of linguistic fluency.  I have made this point before.  The best equipped speakers of the ten delegates to the European Parliament are unquestionably Senator Yeats by miles and myself a very bad second.  I can just about read French and Italian newspapers and converse awfully in French. Broadly speaking, we are dependent on news from home which reaches us about two days after events have occurred.  We are dependent on the <i>New York Herald Tribune</i> which does not exactly regard the situation of the Irish economy as one of its prime news items.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This particularly applies in the case of such issues as fisheries.  I wish to be absolutely frank.  Deputy Kavanagh and myself are in a minority of two in a consumer-orientated group, a cheap-food-orientated group which cannot understand the sheer smallness of the Irish problem.  I have in some sense little sympathy for the problems of the Irish fishing industry because I think these are problems that could have been arrested if we had realised that fishing was a major Irish resource as long ago as 1921 instead of waiting until about 12 months ago to find out that such was in fact the case.  If we had developed our fishing industry in the historical past as we should have the quota system as understood by Europeans could possibly have worked in the Irish context.  I must say&mdash;I trust it will not be taken in bad heart, coming from somebody who is, despite his record, a loyal supporter of the Coalition&mdash;I sometimes wonder if the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister for Fisheries communicate <Col N="1375" /> with each other by carrier pigeon because the impression I get abroad when asked to defend the Irish position is that the Irish position fluctuates on a 24-hour basis.  This impression can perhaps be laid like all derogatory impressions at the feet of the Press; it is their fault; no doubt the two Ministers are absolutely at one in all their utterances but that is not the way it appears to me or to my English speaking colleagues on the Continent.</P>
    <P>Here again, I find that too much of the Irish-European contribution on an issue like fishing&mdash;it does not simply relate to fishing&mdash;suffers from two defects. One is the explanation of sheer smallness to Europe.  The firm of Siemens Schuckert, for example, employ something like 215,000 workers; the largest union in Ireland, the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union has about 150,000 members.  It is very hard to explain to a German industrialist precisely how you apply development capital to a firm of the industrial scale to which we are accustomed here.  The second thing I find is that there is dissension within the delegation that goes abroad.  Personally, I feel that the Irish three-party delegation should maintain, as far as possible, a united front when they go abroad and should not be constantly looking over their shoulders to make capital at home.  Once we step on the plane, as far as I am concerned, we are all Irish men.  I am reminded of Churchill's famous remark when he was asked what his attitude to the Government was during one of his many periods in Opposition.  He said his attitude was quite simple: he damned it to hell when he was at home and defended it to the death when he was abroad&mdash;if you will pardon the language.</P>
    <P>I think that it is a very fair and proper attitude.  Every other country does it.  If you want to bring up an issue like wine the Italians, with due respect to the Parliamentary Secretary, drop all group barriers and become Italians.  If you bring up an issue like fishing, the Dutch drop all group barriers and become Dutchmen.  The same is true in regard to butter and all the other major issues confronting <Col N="1376" /> Europe in recent years.  Nationalities eternally obtrude and if there is a major distinction on the Continent it is between primary producing countries and consumer-orientated countries and I fear the consumer-orientated countries not merely predominate in my socialist group but also predominate throughout the Parliament as a whole.</P>
    <P>Here I must, for once, take issue with something Deputy O'Kennedy said.  He spoke of the necessity for us to aid the Third World.  This request was put forward in rather strident terms by Bishop Casey recently and here may I praise the Parliamentary Secretary; he administered in my opinion a quite correct rebuke to Bishop Casey on that occasion&mdash;but I think there is much confusion about our aid to the Third World.  For example, the English Conservatives on one day on which I was present made a ferocious attempt in regard to the necessity to defend the cane-producing countries of the Third World.  This was all part of an immense capitalist advertising campaign financed by Tate and Lyle and to the English Conservatives loyalty to the Third World means simply a cheap food policy.  It is nothing more nor less.  That will not appeal very well to the Irish sugar beet producers.  This is something we must sort out.  I will come back to that in a second.</P>
    <P>On the question Deputy O'Kennedy specifically raised about the admission of new members, we should approach this question with a selfish and cautious care.  It is all very well to say we should not slam the door on the fingers of new entrants now that we have got safely in.  If Greece, Spain and Portugal are all admitted together, the strain upon language within the Community, and the strain upon the resources of the regional fund, will be so enormous that undoubtedly we will suffer.  This point has not simply been made by me as an Irishman.  It was made by one of the more intelligent of the English socialist group.</P>
    <P>We should differentiate between the arguments of economics and the arguments of sentiment.  I have always found that in Europe the Members of Parliament are hard-headed business men who will respond to an economic <Col N="1377" /> argument, who will respond to a growth argument, but who will not respond to a sentimental argument that you want, in effect, subsidies in order to permit you to continue in the semibarbaric state you were in before.  They have a phrase for that.  They call it building cathedrals in the desert.  The Germans and the Dutch are not prepared to subsidise cathedrals in an Irish desert.  They are prepared to listen to an economic argument.</P>
    <P>All of us have been disappointed that the regional policy as originally spelled out was not implemented.  As originally spelled out, Ireland was designated as a region totally in need of regional aid.  Partly through the lack of parliamentary control, the original regional policy which was adduced by a socialist Belgian was not implemented.  We have suffered as a consequence of this.  I am broadening the discussion here slightly in the few moments remaining to me, but all these things must be seen against the euphoria of the referendum.</P>
    <P>I listened to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Minister for Fisheries and Deputy Gallagher on television.  Deputy Gallagher tried to convince the fishermen more and more about what they would do if they were in power.  I think back rather sadly to how a few people like myself and the Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy Keating, went around the country, and while not arguing against EEC membership as such, we did argue that the Protocol of Association, which was originally negotiated by the Fianna Fáil Party, should have taken into consideration the weaknesses of Ireland in these areas.</P>
    <P>I will give the Minister for Foreign Affairs his due in this.  Before he entered politics he was one of those involved in the organisation of the Committee of Industrial Organisation reports.  Had those reports been heeded, had Ireland geared herself to membership in the years before Common Market membership took place, perhaps some of the worst consequences of membership would not be the case as they are today.  I agree with much of what Deputy O'Kennedy <Col N="1378" /> said.  There is one thing I disagree with him about.  He and Deputy Gallagher, when they speak about fishing, speak as if they were free agents.  The word &ldquo;must&rdquo; occurs all the time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidThornlet" hpid="Dr. Thornley Dr. Thornley">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Thornley</NameTxt>
      <P>It recurred constantly in Deputy O'Kennedy's speech. The regional fund must be this, it must be that.  It is not in our power to determine what must be done.  For better or worse, we are a member of the EEC.  Those of us, like myself, who had misgivings about our entry under no circumstances would recommend that it would be economically or politically conceivable for us to withdraw from the EEC at this stage.</P>
      <P>In these circumstances I believe the Minister for Foreign Affairs is extracting the maximum bargain consistent with our membership of the EEC.  He is driving a hard bargain with a hard-headed man in Commissioner Gunderlach.  In the event of an election this year reversing our positions in this House, I do not believe Deputy Gallagher could strike a harder bargain.  The word &ldquo;must&rdquo; does not operate.  If you have a &ldquo;must&rdquo; which depends upon multiplying the navy by ten and multiplying the air force by ten and then being taken before the European Court of Justice and being told you cannot do it anyway, that &ldquo;must&rdquo; is not a very convincing &ldquo;must&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These people who are convincing the people of Ireland that in some way they are being let down by the Government should have the honour and the honesty to recognise that we are all in this together for better or worse.  It is very easy to stand on the street corner and say &ldquo;Prices are higher.  Small farmers and small fishermen are being ground down because of the incompetence of the Coalition&rdquo;.  It is much easier to say they are being ground down because the State got out of the tunnel and we did not suceed in producing the Eurodollar and we are subject to the laws of the European Court of Justice. Nobody will listen to that.  The other argument that it is all the Coalition's fault is nice and short and simple.  It <Col N="1379" /> is also nonsense&mdash;blatant, arrant nonsense. Fianna Fáil, who after all got us into this in the first place, should have the sense of responsibility to accept their share of the responsibilities concomitant with out membership.</P>
    <P>With beautiful timing I am coming to my conclusion.  I am tired of this dichotomy between producer and consumer which exists throughout the Common Market.  Fianna Fáil and the Minister for Agriculture have used this unfairly.  The Minister for Agriculture goes to Europe and seeks higher and higher prices for cattle.  If he gets them, he prices meat off the table of the people who vote for me in Dublin.  The same applies to Fianna Fáil.  They call for higher prices for primary products in the rural areas and they call for lower prices on the housewife's table in the urban areas. The two are not compatible unless somebody works out a sophisticated non-partisan process of social transfer payments which makes them compatible. At the risk of making a silly joke, Fianna Fáil succeed in defending both higher prices for agricultural goods and lower consumer prices for the housewife only by the device that west of the Shannon, &ldquo;Fianna Fáil man, him talk with forked tongue&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I am sick of the moanings of the farmers' organisation, with the exception of the small farmers.  These are the very ones who voted us in and told us that the bonanza awaited us around the corner.  They are now groaning because they are not getting what they want.  I am tired of the <Col N="1380" /> groans of Mr. Lane, just as I was tired of the groans of Mr. Maher before him.  The trouble is that we are a member of a consumer orientated society which is not concerned with aiding primary producers.  Whatever Government are in power will have to fight a very difficult and hard fight to secure the legitimate claims of the farmers of Ireland for the proper reward for their work and, at the same time, to make sure that the rewards they gain do not render Ireland virtually a meatless country, a veal eating and chicken eating country of the kind you get on the Continent.  The Irish housewife will not exactly like that.  That is the truth of the matter and this is the truth I will have to face within my own constituency within the next few months.</P>
    <P>The greatest tragedy is the tragedy of apathy.  This gets back to Deputy O'Kennedy's point about the necessity to introduce the Bill dealing with direct elections.  All this seems incredibly remote to the Irish people.  A debate like this empties the House, empties the galleries, empties everything. Yet, when the decisions come through and factories are closed and the farms are no longer economically viable and the people become unemployed, they rush to people like the Minister for Foreign Affairs, or to me, or to Deputy O'Kennedy, and ask why.  Then you have to say &ldquo;It is all because of PE/GS/1734 of 1976&rdquo; and they say: &ldquo;Thanks for nothing&rdquo;.</P>
