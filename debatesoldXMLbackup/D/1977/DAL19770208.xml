      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmons</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Col N="947" />
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not my intention at present that the wearing of crash helmets be made compulsory.  I welcome this opportunity once more to encourage young motor cyclists in their own interests to wear a helmet every time they ride their bikes&mdash;just as motorists should always wear seatbelts&mdash;and insist that their pillion passengers wear them also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EugeneTimmons" hpid="Mr. Timmons Mr. Timmons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmons</NameTxt>
      <P>Having regard to the growing mortality rate among motor cyclists and to the fact that more motor cyclists are using our roads, it is an urgent matter to take some steps.  Does the Minister say he proposes to take some steps in the future?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that is necessary.  A study carried out by An Foras Forbartha showed that in 1975 65 per cent of motor cyclists involved in accidents were in fact wearing helmets and so were their passengers.  I would imagine the number has increased since then so the position would appear to be righting itself.  We would all hope that everybody using a motor cycle, whether as rider or passenger, would wear a helmet.  Adding another offence would be a little bit useless, I think.  I believe encouragement is making people use helmets and I hope that the practice will grow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EugeneTimmons" hpid="Mr. Timmons Mr. Timmons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmons</NameTxt>
      <P>Because of the high mortality rate there should be a specific deterrent because of the high risk involved.  It is vitally necessary safeguards should be introduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The only thing I can say is&mdash;it is a rather peculiar statistic&mdash;of the number killed in 1975 30 were wearing helmets and 19 were not.  That does not prove anything but it does show that wearing a crash helmet is not the only safeguard.  Users of motor cycles should take their time.  Since 65 per cent were wearing crash helmets in 1975 I would imagine we are going prettly close to the maximum now.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government if his attention has been drawn to the report of the Clonmel gas inquiry; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I would remind them that, while I have been keeping in touch with the progress of investigations in this matter and have impressed on the local authority my wish that they be conducted as expeditiously as possible, it is the responsibility of the local authority to deal with any problems arising out of the operation of the town's gas supply.  My information is that they have been doing all that is reasonably possible in the matter.</P>
      <P>Immediately after the explosion they conducted their own check of cellars and underground spaces in which escaped gas might collect.  They commissioned the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards to undertake a phased investigation having the following objectives: First, to determine the most likely cause of the explosion of 26th November last.  Second, to determine the best practicable means of ensuring that such accidents do not occur in the future.  Third, to determine the least-cost solution to providing Clonmel with a gas supply that meets the highest standards of safety and reliability.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The county manager has now received a report on the first phase of these investigations.  The report, while <Col N="949" /> dealing with the cause of the November explosion, makes certain interim recommendations pending the detailed report on the second phase of the investigations.  I am advised that the county manager is treating this firstphase report as a confidential document and that the borough council accept this, also that the manager has advised the council of the conclusions in the report and the interim recommendations made in it, and of his intention to implement these as quickly as possible.  I understand that the borough council have endorsed this.</P>
    <P>The manager has just sent me a copy of the report for my confidential information.  I can however advise the Deputy of the conclusions and recommendations in the report, as follows:</P>
    <P>The central conclusion is that, on the basis of careful consideration of the available evidence, the most probable cause of the explosion was the town gas, and the most likely source of the gas a fractured main in Mitchel Street. The interim report also indicates that the source of ignition of the gas was probably electrical&mdash;either a light switch in the basement where the explosion occurred, a lampholder or some faulty wiring there.</P>
    <P>The report's interim recommendations are that, pending a detailed examination of the Mitchel Street gas main and an evaluation of the structural condition of the premises in Mitchel Street, gas to that street should be cut off; that there should be regular inspection and proper ventilation of public premises with basements which are serviced by or close to town gas mains, the encouragement of the installation in such premises of gas detectors, and the provision of advice for owners and occupiers of private dwellings, in the same category, on how best to minimise the risk of explosions from town gas.</P>
    <P>I am advising the local authority of my continuing wish that everything possible should be done to implement as quickly as possible the decision they have taken to carry out the interim recommendation and, furthermore, my wish that the further stages of the institute's investigations will be completed <Col N="950" /> as quickly as possible.  I understand that their report on the second phase of their work is expected later this month.  It should provide the corporation with detailed recommendations concerning safety and accident prevention in the distribution and use of town gas in Clonmel.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government if he is aware that a person (name supplied) in Galway received a letter from Galway Corporation in January, 1977, informing him that the rent of his local authority house had been increased from £4.42 to £7.11 and that arrears as at 17th January, 1977, were £82.43; and, if so, if he is satisfied that arrears arising from a retrospective rent increase are properly charged.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 9 and 10 together.</P>
      <P>On 3rd September, 1976, my Department circulated a revised national differential rent scheme to local authorities generally, including Galway Corporation. The authorities were informed that the scheme was to apply uniformly throughout the country with effect from the commencement of the rent week, or other period, immediately following 1st July, 1976, apart from the change in the manner of assessment of income from short term benefits for rent purposes and the proposed increases in maximum rents which were to apply from the commencement of the rent week, or other period, immediately following 17th September, 1976.  The terms of this scheme were accepted by the National Association of Tenants' Organisations.</P>
      <P>As far as local authorities generally were concerned, rent increases backdated to the beginning of July, 1976, were due mainly to increases in the incomes of the tenants concerned since the general review of incomes was carried out in July, 1975.  The 1976 general review of incomes, which was due to take place in July last was deferred in most areas following the issue of a circular letter to local authorities on 9th July pointing out that any revisions of the rent scheme subsequently decided on would have effect in due course from the beginning of July.  Tenants on low incomes benefited from the improvement in the graded rents scale announced in September.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that, in the particular case referred to by the Deputy, the revised rent was calculated in accordance with the terms of the revised national differential rent scheme.  The revised weekly rent exclusive of rates, is £4.50.  The weekly assessment in lieu of rates is £2.61.  I would point out that but for the phased transfer by the present Government of health and certain housing charges from the rates to the Exchequer, this amount would be substantially higher.  The average saving to the rates contributed by this transfer in 1976 has been calculated at over £5.50 in the £.  In the case of <Col N="952" /> Galway Corporation, the saving is estimated to have been much greater; in fact, a continuation of 1972-73 rates policy would have produced a rate in Galway city in 1976 of over £7 in the £ in excess of that actually struck.  This would have imposed a most serious burden on ratepayers, including local authority tenants such as the person mentioned by the Deputy.</P>
    <P>In addition to the further relief on rates being provided this year by the completion of the phased removal of health and certain housing charges, the tenant in question will also have his weekly rates assessment reduced as a result of the 25 per cent reduction on domestic rates announced by the Government for 1977.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FintanCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister state that reductions have also been given to tenants due to this revision?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, quite a number of tenants on the lower end of the scale did receive a fairly substantial reduction in their rents and it is fair to say that part of this trouble has been caused by the fact that Galway Corporation apparently did not carry out the regulations as per instructions received from 1973 onwards.</P>

      <P>The duty and tax, i.e. customs duty, excise duty and value-added tax, on motor cars are not chargeable by <Col N="953" /> reference to horse power.  It is not practicable, therefore, to give the information in the form sought.  The amount of excise duty and customs duty payable varies according to the value of the motor car and the rate of customs duty varies also according to the country of origin of the vehicle. Value-added tax is effectively payable on motor cars at the rate of 25 per cent on the sale value at manufacturing level or at importation, plus 10 per cent on the price realised on a retail sale.  The appropriate rates of duty are set out in the form of a tabular statement, which with the permission of the Ceann Chomhairle, I propose to include with the Official Report.</P>

      <P>It was originally intended to build a new Garda station at Strand Road, Tramore, on a site which had been acquired from CIE but to facilitate other development of the area in the interests of tourism it was later agreed to exchange the site for one at Turkey Road.  In April, 1974, shortly before the exchange transaction had been legally completed, the Commissioners of Public Works received representations from Waterford County Council indicating that the council wished to use the Turkey Road site for car parking and suggesting that the new station could be better located on a site at Market Street, owned by the Tramore Town Commissioners.  The council accordingly proposed a further exchange of sites.  The Garda authorities favoured the Market Street site and the county council's proposal was agreed to by the Commissioners of Public Works in November, 1974.  There has been delay in giving effect to the exchange because the Town Commissioners had first to extinguish certain rights of way across the Market Street property. The difficulty has now been resolved and every effort is being made to bring the transaction to an early conclusion. There will be no delay in the planning of the new station but it is not possible to say at this stage when work on the erection of the building can be commenced.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>As I indicated in the course of my reply to a similar question on 26th January, while the areas in question are, of course, included in the disadvantaged areas they were not included in the additional areas designated as most severely handicapped following the recent review carried out by my Department in conjunction <Col N="959" /> with the services of the EEC Commission.  The relevant EEC directive requires that aid must be varied in accordance with the degree of handicap and cattle headage payments are made only in those areas which are most severely handicapped.  In the course of the recent review detailed studies were made of the available economic data coupled with on-thespot inspection and consultation with local interests.  I am satisfied that this review identified all the district electoral divisions that warrant designtion as most severely handicapped and that it would not be possible to persuade the Commission that any further addition should be made to either the disadvantaged areas or the severely handicapped areas at the present time.</P>

      <P>There has been no avoidable delay in making payments under the cattle headage grant schemes.

      <P>The Minister is probably aware that this question was put down before the recent increase in the budget.  Would he agree with me that the farmers rightly feel that, with the increased inputs they were due an increase since last October which they did not get?  Farmers have been placed in the situation, by the Minister's reluctance to grant this increase, that they were subsidising foodstuffs since October and doing the work the Government decided to do very belatedly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cronin</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries if, in view of the exceptionally low percentage of cows recorded under a milk recording system in the State as compared with many other countries and having regard to the increasingly critical references by dairying experts in the cattle breeding stations and farming organisations, it is proposed to institute a statutory milk recording service; and if he will make a statement <Col N="964" /> to the effect that the absence of such a system is seriously inhibiting the research work of all who are endeavouring to improve breeding production and other techniques in this country's very valuable dairying industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that the percentage of cows which are milk recorded here is low compared to other countries involved in the dairy industry. I am not satisfied, however, that a statutory milk recording service as proposed by the Deputy, which would presumably involve compulsory recording, would effect any improvement. Such a service has not, so far as I am aware, been tried in any other country.</P>
      <P>Our milk recording schemes were reorganised in recent years.  They are now on a satisfactory basis and the only requirement is increased participation, which my Department are constantly urging on herd-owners.</P>

      <P>Can we take it from what the Minister said that he is reluctant to make grants available for silage units on the banks of rivers from now on?  Are there precautions to that effect?  Obviously a silage unit situated on the banks of a river or near it is a hazard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that frequently while we have been discussing this matter in the House it has been apparent that in regard to most of these farm buildings <Col N="967" /> the only safeguard we have is the Minister and the giving of his particular grant?  Most of the other controls do not really apply to farm buildings. Can we be assured that the Minister will exercise a very high degree of caution?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Deputy is probably aware that any man can build a silage layout for himself without planning permission or anybody else's permission.  All the control, as Deputy Haughey says, is that if we are giving a grant we can set out conditions in relation to the grant.  We have been doing that in recent years. It is only in very recent years because it is only then that there has been such an awareness of the danger of pollution.</P>

      <P>I am astonished to hear the Minister say there was no worry about pollution in relation to the giving of grants since 1972.  I advocated that a man should erect sheds a quarter of a mile up a field because he was a very near a rainbow trout lake and the officers of the Department who were concerned about pollution told him he would not get a grant unless he went that distance from the lake, put in a slurry tank and a liquid tank to prevent pollution.</P>

Many elderly farmers would like to go out and buy stock jointly with their sons and the sons were never aware that they did not qualify if that position obtained.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>With a view to the conservation of the salmon stocks in their area the Foyle Fisheries Commission require fishermen desiring to land their catch in any part of the Foyle area, which includes the port of Greencastle, to hold a licence from the commission.

      <P>Apparently, it is pretty well known that the Letterkenny Fishery Board gave a licence to anybody who produced something in the region of £3 regardless of the conservation needs in the area.  It is because of the fear of the Foyle Fisheries Commission that they require that licences to be used within the Foyle fisheries area should be issued by them.  That is fair enough because the whole question of salmon stocks is <Col N="970" /> vitally important at present due to substantial overfishing of salmon.</P>

      <P>The Minister did not give us all the information at his disposal. Is he aware that present policies lead everybody involved to believe that the AnCo training centre in Kildare town is due to be phased out in June or July and that the force there is being reduced accordingly?  Is the Minister further aware that the figures Manpower have for the unemployment position in Kildare have increased rather than diminished?  Will the Minister agree that training centres set up on a temporary basis in other areas in the country have been made permanent?  There is a great need for the retention of this centre and in view of the wonderful work being done by the centre will the Minister assure me that it will be retained?</P>

The actions taken recently, particularly the failure of AnCo to renew their lease with CYMS on the property they have, the reduction of the teaching staff and the further reductions envisaged, are an <Col N="973" /> indication that a decision has been or is about to be reached.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) (for the Minister for Foreign Affairs) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) (for the Minister for Foreign Affairs)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan</i>) <b>(for the Minister for Foreign Affairs):</b> The provisions governing the appointment of officials in the European Economic Community are laid down in the Staff Regulations of Officials and the Conditions of Employment of Other Servants of the European Communities applicable from 5th March, 1968. Article 29 of the Staff Regulations of Officials of the European Communities, which deals specifically with the system of appointment, states, and I quote:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;1.  Before filling a vacant post in an institution, the appointing authority shall first consider:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="977" /> (a)  whether the post can be filled by promotion or transfer within the institutions;</P>
    <P>(b)  whether to hold competitions internal to the institution;</P>
    <P>(c)  what applications for transfer have been made by officials of other institutions of the three European Communities;</P>
    <P>and then follow the procedure for competitions on the basis either of qualifications or of tests, or of both qualifications and tests.  Annex III lays down the competition procedure.</P>
    <P>This procedure may likewise be followed for the purpose of constituting a reserve for future recruitment.</P>
    <P>2.  A procedure other than the competition procedure may be adopted by the appointing authority for the recruitment of Grade A1 or A2 officials and, in exceptional cases, also for recruitment to posts which require special qualifications.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
    </P>
    <P>The appointment of officials in the EEC is thus entirely the responsibility of the particular Community authority concerned, i.e. the Commission, the Council, the Court of Justice or the European Parliament, as the case may be, and the member states have no function in the matter.  In the case of very high level appointments to posts of Director-General, A1 Grade, or Director, A2 Grade, where a Community institution is considering the appointment of a national of a particular member state to fill a vacancy at this level it may, and in practice frequently does, consult with the authorities in the member of state concerned before making its appointment. Such consultation, however, does not limit the powers of that institution to make its own appointment.</P>
    <P>With regard to the second part of the Deputy's question as to why changes are made with the appointment of a new Commission or Commissioners, I should point out that any such changes are an internal matter of the organisation of the Commission <Col N="978" /> and as such are the responsibility of the Commission and do not involve the member states.</P>
    <P>Finally, I am not aware of any proposals to change the present system of appointing officials to the Community institutions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment asks the House to add, in line 15, after the word &ldquo;Minister&rdquo;, the words &ldquo;a copy of which agreement shall forthwith be laid on the table of each House of the Oireachtas&rdquo;.  That amendment is not precisely what I want because its effect would be to have the agreement laid on the table of each House of the Oireachtas after the Bill became law, assuming it does, and its value to Members of the Oireachtas would be very limited because we would not see it until after the Bill had been enacted.  At least, it would lead to publication of the agreement and the public would be aware of what was involved in that agreement, although it would then be at the stage that their representatives could not do anything about it even if there was widespread public disagreement with the terms of the agreement in question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Had it been possible to draft an amendment on that basis, I would have preferred an amendment that would call on the Minister to publish the agreement during the course of this debate so that Members would know what they are talking about.  This is a very short Bill&mdash;eight very short sections&mdash;and is only about a page and a half in length.  It says nothing except that the representatives of the Irish people in the Dáil and Seanad ratify the terms of the agreement of the 12th December, 1975, and authorise the Minister to pay a sum of £9.540 million <Col N="993" /> in purchasing shares from shareholders in a particular company.  I have said this already and I have to repeat it, this is an idiotic exercise we are engaged in now.</P>
    <P>While most of the amendments are important in one way or another, this one is the most important.  Without a study of the agreement which this Bill purports to ratify, this debate is meaningless. Last week Deputy Colley and I asked the Minister if there were any precedents for a short Bill like this which refers six times in a page and a half to the agreement and the various terms of it but where the agreement is not made available to Deputies.  On each occasion the Minister said he would need notice of the question and that he was not able to think of a precedent off-hand.  I should be surprised if there were a precedent because this proposal to ask the Oireachtas to ratify an agreement that no Member of the Oireachtas has seen, other than the Minister and some of his Government colleagues, must be without precedent not alone in this country but in any other normal democracy.</P>
    <P>During the war orders were made under the Emergency Powers Acts whereby certain things were enacted by way of statutory instruments.  The content of some of that law was not made public.  This was unusual in that it only happened on two occassions and it was specifically provided for in the Acts.  In peacetime we have never known such a thing.  It was not done by a legislative act of the Oireachtas but by ministerial order as much of our legislation had to be carried out in that way during the war.  As far as I am aware, it was done twice in relation to matters of enormous importance to the security of the State.  It has never been done in peacetime in this way.  If it had been, the Minister would have given us examples.</P>
    <P>The Minister is asking us to ratify something that none of us has ever seen.  Does the Minister realise the consequences of asking this Parliament to do such a thing?  I wonder is it realised by the Government that one of the basic necessities of law in western jurisprudence is promulgation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="994" /> Law is not law, even if it is passed by this or any other Parliament unless it is promulgated to the people.  If this Bill is passed without publication of the agreement, what is the law?  The law will then be the terms of an agreement of 12th December, 1975, made between Bula Holdings, Patrick Wright and other parties named in the agreement and the Minister.  That would be the law of the land and one of the consequences of it will be to force every man, woman and child to pay more than £3 each towards the purchase of shares from four shareholders in Bula Limited.  That will be the law but it will not have been promulgated.</P>
    <P>I would address my remarks to the ultimate guardian of the Constitutional rights of the people, that is, the President of Ireland.  I am aware that he is abroad at present but will return on Friday.  The report on this debate will be available then and I presume he reads the reports in part at least. It may be that he will be referred to what I have to say.  I want to point out to the President that he has duties imposed on him under the Constitution in regard to the signing of Bills. The section of the Article which imposes that duty also imposes the duty of promulgating every law made by the Oireachtas.  How can the President promulgate what he has not seen, and what Dáil Éireann and Seanad Éireann have not seen?  Section 3 of Article 13 of the Constitution reads:</P>
    <P>1º.  Every Bill passed or deemed to have been passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas shall require the signature of the President for its enactment into law.</P>
    <P>2º.  The President shall promulgate every law made by the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>If this section is not complied with, I suggest to the House and to the President that the Bill in respect of which it is not complied with does not become an Act and does not become law.  I suggest to the President&mdash;and it is presumptuous of me to do so because he is more aware of his duty than I am&mdash;that it is his duty to see that the provisions of the Constitution are <Col N="995" /> complied with in respect of this and every other law passed by the Oireachtas.  It is difficult to envisage how the provisions of Article 13 can be complied with in respect of this Bill.  The President should consider whether or not it would be appropriate for him in the circumstances to sign a short Bill which ratifies an agreement which is referred to six times in the Bill but which is never published.  I say to him: how can you promulgate the terms of the agreement of 12th December, 1975, by which the State now purports to be bound unless those who made that into law and you who are signing it into law know the terms of that agreement?  I suggest to the President that it cannot be done within the terms of the Constitution. He should, therefore, consider in his own discretion, and if he so wishes after consultation with the Council of State whose advice he is free to reject, whether this question of purporting to ratify by an Act of the Oireachtas an agreement that nobody has seen other than the Minister and the terms of which are unknown should be referred to the courts for a decision.  I would remind the House that the Constitutional rights of citizens are not alone those which are specifically set out in Bunreacht na hÉireann.  In the last six or seven years the courts have taken pains to hold that the list of rights specifically set out in the Constitution is not exhaustive and that there are many other fundamental rights which the courts will vindicate on behalf of the citizens as against the State or anybody else who seeks to infringe those rights, even though the right in question is not specifically spelt out in the Constitution.  I suggest to the House and to the President that one of the rights of a citizen is not to be bound by a law which is not promulgated to him.  How can any citizen in any Parliamentary democracy be bound by something of which he knows nothing?  It is monstrous to seek to make him liable in financial or penal terms for something that he knows nothing about and that his elected representatives know nothing about when they purport to enact into law something <Col N="996" /> under which he will be bound and under which he, in common with each citizen, will be called to pay £3.20 to fulfil the Minister's obligations.</P>
    <P>Two hundred years ago in America there was a great cry that there could not be taxation without representation. That cry and that right prevailed.  Are we now in Ireland in 1977 in the position that there will be taxation without knowledge?  Surely knowledge is as fundamentally necessary as representation. Here we are, the representatives who impose taxation, but we are imposing it in respect of something of which we know nothing.  If, therefore, this law which the Minister and the Government are asking us to make cannot be promulgated then I submit this law can never be binding and should be upset.  The first guardian of the constitutional rights of our citizens is the President.  His predecessor has given a good example in vindicating with dignity and nobility the rights of the people under the Constitution.  I do not think the present President needs any example.  He is a man of equal integrity and ability and a man who will fulfil his sworn duty in a way as commendable as that of all his predecessors.</P>
    <P>I wish to draw the attention of the House and the attention of the President to this very fundamental problem we are now facing.  This can be overcome by the Minister accepting the spirit as well as the letter of this amendment.  He should make this agreement available now to Members of this House and then postpone the Committee Stage for perhaps a week so that we can study the agreement and decide whether it is appropriate that we should ratify it in what we consider to be the national interest.</P>
    <P>Let us consider the position of the Deputies opposite if the Minister does not do this, if he does not accept both the letter and the spirit of this amendment. By virtue of the fact that they hold a small majority of the seats in this House, they will walk through the lobbies purporting to enact into law something that is in fundamental conflict with basic legislative jurisprudence in every parliamentary democracy. They will purport to create a situation <Col N="997" /> in which every citizen will have to pay taxes in order that this payment can be made by the Minister.  All this will be done on foot of an agreement that none of us has ever seen, except the Minister, Deputies opposite, if they are forced by their Whips to go through the lobbies, will have a very heavy responsibility.</P>
    <P>This point was brought out very well by Mr. Bruce Arnold in his article in last Saturday's edition of the <i>Irish Independent.</i>  He felt that the secretiveness associated with this Bill and with this whole deal should not cause Deputies to enact a law without the fullest disclosures and information.  My point is more fundamental than that.  Even if none of us disputed the terms of what the Minister is trying to do, every one of us, as an elected representative in a parliamentary democracy, should resist and refuse to enact a proposal that would make something unknown become the binding law of the country.</P>
    <P>This will be basically a taxing measure in the sense that £9.54 million will be devoted to this purpose.  That sum must be obtained in the normal way by taxation.  It may be obtained by in the short term by borrowing, but in the long term it must be obtained by the taxation of the people.  If we are prepared to tax the people by this kind of law, is it not possible that next week, next month or next year we will be prepared to penalise the people in the criminal sense, to impose penal sanctions for breaches of the law that the House has not seen and that the citizen has not seen?  The citizen of any genuine democracy has the right to know what the law is.  It has been a principle of our law for centuries that ignorance of the law does not excuse anybody.  The reason for that is that the law is always discoverable.  An individual might not know what the law is on a particular topic, but it is possible to find out.  Therefore, ignorance of the law is no excuse.  I suggest that in this case ignorance of the law must be an excuse.  That principle cannot apply because this Bill flouts in a fundamental way the tenet that has run through the law for centuries&mdash;that knowledge of the law is available to those who seek it.  It is not available <Col N="998" /> here and that is why I think that, if this House is foolish enough to enact this Bill without this amendment being accepted both in letter and in spirit, then it is the duty in the first instance of the President and afterwards of our courts to protect and vindicate the rights of our citizens.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to one aspect of the kind of difficulty that can and almost certainly will be created by the enactment of this Bill and the ratification of this agreement when we do not know its contents.  The Minister will not publish the agreement in spite of many requests to do so.  Could the Minister give the House an assurance that all the shares in Bula Limited rank <i>pari passu</i>, in other words that they all have equal rights? Can he give the House a categorical assurance that no group of shares in this company has any special voting rights as against others?  Can he give the House a categorical assurance that the majority shareholding in this company will always prevail?  Can he give the House a categorical assurance that the holders of a group of shares smaller than his 49 per cent will never be able to outvote his 49 per cent?  Can he give the House a categorical assurance&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGrattanEsmonde" hpid="Mr. Esmonde Mr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Esmonde</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that, having regard to the 10 per cent of the shares in Bula Limited held by the representatives of Patrick Wright, deceased, if they were to vote with the Minister and make a total of 59 per cent, that 59 per cent could not be outvoted in certain circumstances by the holders of the remainder of the shares which would amount to 41 per cent?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been suggested to me that some of these shares hold special voting rights and that that is one of the reasons that the Minister is so loath to publish this agreement which we seek in the amendment.  If that were the situation it would be very wrong. The Minister would not just have bought a minority shareholding, as he now tells us he has done&mdash;buying 24 and getting a gift of 25, giving a total of 49&mdash;but would have locked himself <Col N="999" /> permanently into a minority position if any other shares had any special voting rights.</P>
    <P>It would be absolutely intolerable if the State, which already, unfortunately, has only a minority in this private company and has no control in it either at board level or at general meeting level, put itself in an even worse position under this agreement that the Minister will not publish, that even if it held 59 per cent of the shares or had the support of another 10 per cent of the shareholders, it could still be outvoted in regard to certain matters.</P>
    <P>I would be interested to hear from the Minister in his contribution on this amendment whether there is any possibility of anything of that nature happening.  If there was any suggestion whatever that such a provision existed, it would be a matter of very considerable seriousness and it would heighten still further the suspicions that are inevitably created in the public mind by the extraordinary refusal of the Minister to publish a document that is fundamental to this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Keating) Justin Keating">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Keating)</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot accept the amendment.  I made that clear, not on this amendment but when the demand was made for the publication of the agreement.  Although I made my reasons clear then, it is fair that on this amendment I should reiterate them at some length.</P>
      <P>This agreement is part of a whole category of agreements which exist between the State and companies, whether private or public.  This relates to the minority shareholding in a private company.  Over the life of this State and, indeed, of similar states over a comparable period of evolution, norms have been worked out which balance two things: the perfectly desirable right of the public to know as much as possible, on the one hand, with the need for commercial confidentiality, on the other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think anybody would urge me to behave in an arbitrary way in regard to particular agreements, in other words, to behave towards one in <Col N="1000" /> a way that was different from the way in which I and my predecessors have behaved towards others during the life of the State.  I do not think that sort of arbitrariness by Ministers is desirable. There ought to be guidelines evolved which are clear, which can be operated by civil servants as well as by Ministers and which can be operated by one Minister after another; Ministers come and go.</P>
    <P>I have to take note of the operation of the commercial agencies responsible to me and to listen to them very carefully. I particularly have to take note of the norms we have encountered in other countries in regard to the question of oil and gas which is upcoming at this moment.  With the evolution of the concept of participation by the State, a concept which is not peculiar to this Government and which was in the 1969 IDA Act, which enabled the IDA to take minority shareholdings in companies&mdash;and that is not the only example but it is the most recent and most relevant one which is nearest to my mind&mdash;one has to take due note of the successful functioning of those agencies.  I want to put the cost in context, because Deputy O'Malley has mentioned how many pounds this is for every man, woman and child in the country.  Let me remind the Dáil that we give away&mdash;if I may put it that way, because we give this in grants and not in investment&mdash;about £60 million a year by the action of the IDA, and during the comparable period of the payment of the three slices on this agreement, that is, three years, since the IDA moneys are increasing, there will be a sum of about £200 million wanted.  There are also payments under SFADCo, Gaeltarra Éireann and other such agencies.  All of these distribute public money on the head of agreements which are confidential and which have never been asked for in this House, and that confidentiality is a necessary part of the success of those agencies.</P>
    <P>There are people in the House, like Deputy Colley, who was Minister for Industry and Commerce at one stage and understands the working of the IDA.  He knows that if in regard to all of the confidential agreements between <Col N="1001" /> the IDA and companies, Irish and foreign, public and private who are the recipients of grants&mdash;and the sort of money we are talking about here, taking it year by year, is perhaps 5, 6 or 7 per cent of the annual disbursements by the IDA&mdash;we were to insist that for all those disbursements they be treated the way I am asked to treat this private company, Bula, who have made an agreement with the State, then the functioning of the IDA as it is understood would become impossible. I know there are people who disapprove of the IDA and do not want it to work, but that is not an opinion I would attribute to the Opposition; I think they want it to work as much as I do.</P>
    <P>There is a second category which preoccupies me intensely.  We have looked very hard at the participation agreements between states in relation to oil and gas.  The whole question of these agreements as they relate to the oil companies prospecting and exploring the hydrocarbons on the Continental Shelf is of great importance to us.  The sums of money involved were greater by far than the sums we are talking of here.  A country which we studied a great deal in this context is Norway.  By tradition Norway is very open.  As much as possible was revealed; but her agreements with the oil companies, agreements which involved vast sums of money and included State investment were sacrosanct.  They were not made public.  If we were to make available information regarding our agreements, we would damage seriously the companies involved. Therefore, those agreements shall remain secret for so long as I am here. When I say that in relation to the IDA's functioning and to the oil and gas agreements we must have commercial secrecy, I affirm a difficulty. However, I do not believe in solving that difficulty in the case of one company thereby creating a precedent which could be very messy and which would immediately expand the effort in a way that would be detrimental to our whole economic activity.  The difficulty is that as the State moves into a position of participation&mdash;and when this is done on the Continental Shelf, the sums of money involved will be <Col N="1002" /> much larger than what we are talking of here&mdash;I am in a no-win situation because if I reveal one item out of a whole series, I do something arbitrary and I cast tremours into the minds of people investing in our Continental Shelf, people contemplating investing in Ireland, people setting up private companies and the whole question of grants for such people.  Therefore, if I reveal, I do damage to all of that; but if I do not reveal, people will say, as Deputy O'Malley has said, that I have something to hide.</P>
    <P>It is relevant to raise this whole matter on the subject of this Bill because it raises a concept in the context of law as it evolves in a country.  My opinion is that at a later stage neither I nor future Ministers should not be put indefinitely into a position either of being forced to do commercial damage and breach all the traditions of the State in regard to confidentiality or, alternatively, be accused of bad faith.  That is what I describe as a no-win situation.</P>
    <P>Regardless of what people may think, the trend is in many countries towards increased State participation. With this in mind we must work out a mechanism which applies to categories and not to individual agreements. Deputies who know how the State works are aware that one cannot pluck out one agreement and exclude others.  Why should we hamstring the State's commercial activities by doing something that is not enshrined in law in regard to companies?  On the other hand we ought to have a mechanism, be it a committee of the Dáil or a committee of judicial people, whose job is to be above reproach and who would scrutinise these matters and say clearly &ldquo;We will not publish these matters because to do so would damage the commercial activities of the State but we can testify that everything is above board&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley waxed eloquent in regard to the President.  I know that the President will do his job.  I am neither a lawyer nor an expert on the Constitution, but I am convinced that if the President sees anything wrong with this legislation he will do his duty. However, the people on the front <Col N="1003" /> bench opposite know how Bills are prepared.  They know the process is one of Government approval, of drafting and then of the legislation being put into words which comply with the provisions of the Constitution. Deputies opposite know that Bills are subject to the scrutiny of the Attorney General and that subsequently they come forward in their prepared form for Government approval.  Because of the role of the Supreme Court in recent years, a role which by and large has been progressive and with which I am pleased, any parliamentary draftsman will have regard to this aspect in drafting legislation.  Apart from the question of my conviction that the President will do his duty punctiliously, I know, too, that those matters of the propriety of legal correctness, of respect for the common law and for the laws of the State, are the proper concern of the parliamentary draftsmen and of the Attorney General.  But should there be any substance in what Deputy O'Malley says, there is a remedy.  In such case we would suffer the consequences and the Bill would be struck down, but people do not go to the trouble of bringing forward Bills here without those matters being considered carefully.</P>
    <P>I have referred to the amounts of money that we give away through the IDA by way of grants.  The amount given in this way each year is about ten times the amount involved here, but that money is made available under legislation.  Its distribution is on foot of secret agreements, but what interests me is that those agreements have never been sought in this Chamber.  This precedent was set by the present Opposition.  So much is commercial secrecy respected in regard to the IDA that when one asks a parliamentary question here about the grants made by the IDA, one is referred to the following year's annual report.  That convention has been accepted.  One is not even supplied with the answer to a parliamentary question.</P>
    <P>People who scrutinise the IDA's annual report are familiar with the amount of information it contains.  I <Col N="1004" /> must look askance on the effort to treat this company, when the amount of money is £9.5 million, as totally different from the IDA grants.  People know that the IDA take shareholdings as well, sometimes very substantial ones.  This is done not alone without the agreements being brought before the House but without anybody ever having asked that they would be brought before the House.  We are asked to treat this private company in which the State is taking a minority shareholding differently from other companies in which the State is taking a minority shareholding.  We are being asked to do something in regard to one company which has never been done in regard to others and which was never asked for before.</P>
    <P>I cannot help noting the intensity of Deputy O'Malley's concern with the public right to know.  I have to allow myself an internal smile when I hear the words which Deputy O'Malley uses.  I remember years in which grants by Bord Fáilte made by the Opposition when in Government were secret both in regard to the names of the recipients and the amounts of the grants.  A campaign was waged which was finally successful for that information to be made available.  Phrases like &ldquo;no taxation without representation&rdquo; are fine but the IDA takes more money every year which goes out without ever coming to the House.  I have made agreements in relation to oil and gas with the great international companies which are sacrosanct.  Bord Fáilte gave out money during those years to all those recipients without naming names. That was a tax on people and it was secret.  I am not going to make an individual exception in regard to a single company.  I believe we need a mechanism of scrutiny by neutral people.  As we move on with participation and agreements between the State greater than have existed in the past 20 years, and when we move to investing profitably rather than simply giving money as grants, we need a mechanism for scrutiny.  I will not accept a mechanism of scrutiny which is arbitrary in its application, which applies to one company and not to another.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1005" /> I cannot accept that we should do this in regard to one single agreement for one company that the Opposition apparently do not like.  We have to treat companies identically.  We have to treat categories of agreements and not single agreements.  Deputy O'Malley is asking me to breach the traditions and practice of this State which have grown up over decades in regard to a single company.  We ought to evolve, we ought to change and have a mechanism of scrutiny but I do not think it ought to be introduced in accidental and arbitrary ways or as a result of pressure to reveal an agreement of a single company which has been made the object of very sharp controversy. It ought to be done in a coherent and integrated way.  In the meantime, I propose to stand on the position I have taken and I propose to reject this amendment.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister recall, as I do, that the Minister revealed two parts of the agreement of the 12th December, 1975, last week, in reply to statements which I made in my Second Reading speech, and I said, by way of interjection at the time, that this was a very selective method of disclosing bits and pieces of what presumably is a long and complex document?  I said in my Second Reading speech that the probability was that the State would have to take up a rights issue and would have to take up 49 per cent of the rights.  The Minister replied that I was wrong because the agreement had a provision in it that a rights issue cannot be made by the company unless the Minister agreed.  I said that I was delighted to hear that but that <Col N="1006" /> I thought it funny that we were only having selective disclosures of bits and pieces of the agreement that happened to suit the Minister at the time.</P>
      <P>The second disclosure was around the same time in the debate where the Minister said that I was not quite right when I said that there was likely to be a liability on the State as a 49 per cent shareholder in this company to guarantee at least to that extent and possibly more, loans from banks which are a feature of the financing of mining operations.  The Minister said that I was wrong because there was actually a provision in the agreement of the 12th December, 1975, that if we did not want to, we need not guarantee loans from banks; however that was not to say, that we would not give a guarantee and that if one was sought from us we would have to consider it at the time it was sought.  I again observed that this was another selective disclosure, because it happened at the time to suit the Minister's argument.  It showed that I was 98 per cent right instead of 100 per cent right in what I had said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have asked five or six specific questions now in relation to the ranking of these shares and the Minister has declined to answer them.  I can only draw the inference and I invite the House to draw the inference that what I have said is right.  If as it now appears what I have said is right, it discloses a position which I described earlier when making the inquiry as intolerable.  We have a position in which one group of shareholders, Messrs.  Roche, Wymes and Woods, hold 41 per cent of the shares in a block.  The Minister holds, or will hold if the House fails to reject this, 49 per cent and the representatives of Patrick Wright deceased will hold 10 per cent. The Wright block of 10 per cent is regarded as not being part of what one might call the Bula or the Roche/ Wymes/Woods block of 41 per cent. It has been suggested to me that these differentiations are drawn in the agreement and that, if you had a situation in which the Wright block of 10 per cent voted with the Minister to give a total of 59 per cent, they would not over rule the 41 per cent because in certain circumstances the 41 per cent <Col N="1007" /> have special voting rights and the shares are not therefore <i>pari passu.</i> I invited the Minister to deny what I put to him.  He has declined to do it and the House can draw its own inference. The House now knows the position in regard to the voting rights of shares in the company.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that apparently the Minister does not wish to reply to Deputy O'Malley and has declined to disclose to the House whether there are special voting rights built into the agreement it makes it all the more important that we look very closely at what the Minister is trying to get the House to do.  Listening to the Minister it struck me that here we had a classic example of a man turning facts on their head.  Remember he told us he did not want to pick out one company.  He thought they should all be treated at least in categories, that we should not single out one.  He did not want to create a precedent in the way this company was treated, as we were urging, and this would apply in the future to other companies.</P>
      <P>What are the facts?  The facts are that the Minister has brought before this House a Bill for which there is no precedent, and he has admitted that. No Minister in any Government in the history of the State has ever asked Dáil Éireann to pass a Bill which refers in the way this Bill does to an agreement without disclosing the terms of the agreement.  Deputy O'Malley raised this fundamental point on the introduction of Second Stage and got no satisfaction.  I raised it at the conclusion of Second Stage, and I should like to quote from the debate in the Official Report dated 2nd February, 1977.  At columns 747 and 748 it is stated:</P>
      <P>Mr. Colley: Could the Minister direct the attention of the House to any precedent of any Act passed by the House referring to an agreement, in the way this Bill does, where the agreement was not produced?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mr. Keating: I cannot do that at this moment.  It may be an appropriate point to raise when we come <Col N="1008" /> to the next Stage of the Bill.  I will endeavour to furnish an answer then. I cannot do it at this moment.</P>
    <P>Mr. Colley: Does the Minister appreciate that in view of the very heated argument which there was on this point that it would be appropriate that he would at this stage be in a position to refer to such a precedent if it existed?  If it does not exist does it not invalidate the whole argument he was making?  What is he covering up?</P>
    <P>Mr. Keating: The position is as I have stated.  This is a point which can be dealt with later on in the proceedings of the House.</P>
    <P>Mr. O'Malley: There is no precedent.</P>
    <P>We come now to the next Stage.  The first amendment before the House deals with this point and in all the Minister had to say he could not refer to one precedent for this Bill.  Contrary to what he has said, the facts are that the Minister is creating a precedent and never before in the history of the State has any Minister sought to do what this Minister is doing here.  There must be a good reason for that but we have not heard it.</P>
    <P>We heard from the Minister a great deal about the money paid out by the IDA.  The IDA pay out money in the form of an investment in a business which is already in existence or which is about to start, one that they have assessed and are satisfied will be viable. They do not pay money just for the purpose of compensating shareholders for giving up some of their shares.  They pay money for a share in a business which is in existence, as was done in the case of Cement Roadstone, or in the case of a new business starting up in respect of which they are satisfied. However, that is not the case here.  In this situation the Minister is paying money to shareholders in respect of a business which may never start, a business that has no start-up date and where the cost of start-up is not known. If planning permission is not given it cannot start-up; if planning permission is given subject to certain conditions, the cost of start-up will be enormously <Col N="1009" /> greater than if they were subject to certain other conditions which the Minister hopes to see achieved.</P>
    <P>It is a totally different situation.  But above all&mdash;and this goes to the fundamental issue involved here&mdash;the Minister has endeavoured to suggest that there is a tradition of confidentiality in dealing with public and private companies which ensures that disclosure of this kind is not made.  I say to the Minister he is wrong.  The tradition is that there is no disclosure of information which would affect the commercial interests of the company concerned and in the normal way that would apply to the day-to-day operations of the company.</P>
    <P>The Minister implied in what he said that investments made by the IDA are secret and are kept as such. I was responsible for the investment in Snia.  There were no conditions that the terms of the investment by the IDA in Snia were to be kept secret.  No such conditions were imposed.  The IDA give full disclosure in their annual report of their investments or grants.  Public companies, such as Cement Roadstone, which have a State investment disclose publicly the terms of that investment.  The only case for non-disclosure would be if the Minister could show that the commercial interests of this company would be affected by disclosing the terms on which the investment is being made.</P>
    <P>I cannot visualise circumstances in which disclosure of the terms of investment could be damaging to the commercial interests of this company, but let us assume for a moment that such conditions exist.  If that were so and if the Minister is faced with a situation where he has to bring in a Bill to this House authorising that investment, it is certainly not beyond the bounds of possibility that the Minister could devise a method whereby the necessary disclosures could be made without its being a public disclosure. The Minister has spoken about the desirability of a mechanism for dealing with this kind of situation but we have never had this kind of situation in which investment as such&mdash;not day-to-day working&mdash;and the disclosure of its terms would be damaging.  Until it <Col N="1010" /> has been proved otherwise, there is no reason to accept that there would be any damage whatever done by disclosing the terms on which the State is investing this money; and if any such danger exists there is an onus, an obligation, on the Minister at least to disclose what the danger is.  If he thinks there is any concrete danger he should at least tell us the nature of that danger.</P>
    <P>We are talking about the terms on which the State are investing because of a change in the ownership of the shares of the company, and it has nothing to do with the manner in which the company conduct their business, and there would be nothing in the disclosure of the information to the advantage of rival companies. There is no precedent in this Parliament in relation to the circumstances in which the Bill is being introduced and there is an obligation on the Minister to disclose clearly the risks he is trying to avert, if such risks exist.</P>
    <P>Have this company been asked to agree to the disclosure of these terms? Other companies in which the IDA invested were not given the option&mdash; the disclosure was made anyway.  Have this company been asked and have they refused, and if they have refused, why?  If they have refused why is the Minister refusing to disclose and if they have not been asked, why have they not been asked?  It is no answer to say this company should not be picked out and treated differently from all others.  That is what the Minister is doing in this case.  No other company, public or private, have been put in the same position as Bula are being put by this Bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister has been asked to indicate at least one precedent for this and he has failed to give it.  His failure to do so leaves very serious and I suggest reasonable suspicions in the minds of all of us, inside and outside the House, who had any interest whatever in this matter.  The Minister may talk at considerable length about the situation in regard to IDA grants but there is no similarity at all in the situation or in the way such companies are treated.  He referred to Bord Fáilte grants.  I agree it is true that for a <Col N="1011" /> number of years there was not disclosure of the grants or the recipients. That was a situation with which I personally disagreed, as did a number of my colleagues, and in due course it was remedied and for many years there has been full disclosure.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will appreciate that even in those circumstances the situation is quite different from the one he is presenting to the House through this Bill in which he is asking the approval of the House to an agreement which he refuses to produce, and for the non-production of which he has given no good reason. Because he has failed to give a good reason in relation to the circumstances of this case for which there is no precedent, at least he has the obligation to indicate to the House in which way the disclosure of the terms of the agreement could damage the interests of this company.  In the absence of information of that kind from the Minister it is necessary to consider why the Minister is refusing this disclosure&mdash;it is necessary to consider why we have the almost unbelievable situation of a Bill being brought before us which would have us approve of an agreement whose terms the Minister refuses to disclose.</P>
    <P>As I have said, no Minister in any Government in the history of the State has ever sought to do this.  The Minister spoke about it being necessary to have guidelines.  He has them.  If he follows the traditions that exist he will disclose the terms of the agreement. He is the one who is creating a unique and unprecedented situation. In view of his continued refusal to disclose the terms of the agreement and of the lack of substance in the reasons he has advanced for his failure to disclose those terms, as I have said it becomes necessary to consider why the Minister has put himself in such an untenable situation.  He is an intelligent man and there is no way in which he would put himself in this position without very good reason.</P>
    <P>Since he has not disclosed that good reason, all we can do is to speculate on what the reason might be.  The most obvious reason is that this is an <Col N="1012" /> effort by him to cover up incompetence, at best, in the negotiation of this agreement.  Then one wonders about the whole approach of the Minister and his colleagues in regard to this whole area.  Anybody taking an objective view of this Bill and the Minister's attitude must consider that all he wants is that the Dáil and Seanad would rubber stamp this agreement.</P>
    <P>That rubber stamping approach is one that is becoming more and more common under this Government.  I ask people to cast their minds back to the time when this Government came into office and to try to visualise if they were told at that time of some of the things that would happen under this Government from the point of view of total contempt for Parliament whether they would have believed it. Even we here would not have believed it.  It may be recalled that this is a Government which not so long ago introduced a guillotine motion in respect of Bills which had not even been introduced or circulated.  No other Government in the history of the State did that.  If one were told in March, 1973, that this Government would do a thing like that one would have taken a bit of convincing.</P>
    <P>We have seen attempted censorship of the Press and of the letters pages in the newspapers being used as the basis for threatened prosecution by the Government.  We have seen the reaction of a member of the Government to the exercising of his constitutional powers by the President; we have seen this Minister threaten the Official Secrets Act in respect of this particular transaction.</P>
    <P>All this gives very considerable food for thought, and I suggest that in the light of these facts, limited though they are&mdash;they are by no means an exhaustive illustration of the actions of this Government&mdash;it becomes clear that Deputy O'Malley's amendment is of much more fundamental importance even than the details of this very substantial payment or the agreement would imply.  Deputy O'Malley's amendment goes to the root of parliamentary democracy.  There is no precedent for what the Minister is trying <Col N="1013" /> to do.  He has not given any good reason for what he is trying to do.  He has a clear obligation to spell out at the very least the dangers that he can visualise to this company by disclosure of the terms of the agreement, not disclosure of the day-to-day workings of the company but just the terms of the agreement.  I hope the Minister appreciates the difference.  In the absence of that disclosure by the Minister he cannot blame anybody who has his suspicions and he cannot blame anybody who regards this Bill and the failure to accept the amendment to it as another example of the Fascist mentality this Government have been showing.</P>

      <P>The situation is that the persistent refusal of the Minister even to attempt in any rational logical way to justify his refusal of this amendment justifies everybody in being extremely suspicious of what he is covering up and equally justifies everybody who looks at this particular provision and the record of this Government in regarding this part of this section, if it remains unamended, as a further example of the kind of Fascist mentality this Government are increasingly showing.  It is possible the Minister can relieve all our minds by explaining to us what he has not done up to now, namely, explaining the dangers involved for this Government <Col N="1014" /> and for the State's investment in disclosing the terms of the agreement.</P>
      <P>I want to make it as clear as I possibly can that, unless the Minister is able and willing to do that, we can only regard his refusal to accept this amendment in the way I have already outlined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>I am surprised at the Minister's attitude.  The Minister has made no effort whatever to justify his outright and downright refusal to publish this agreement or, as Deputy O'Malley suggested, lay a copy of the agreement on the Table of the House. The Minister said the agreement is part of a whole series of agreements and he placed a great deal of emphasis on the necessity for maintaining secrecy about agreements come to by the IDA with various companies.  I am somewhat surprised in view of that that it was not the IDA on behalf of the State who negotiated this particular agreement.</P>
      <P>There has been criticism from time to time by various people, including Members of this House, about the IDA not coming to the aid of the Irish investor and doing too much to encourage the outsider as against the local entrepreneur.  There were Members of this House, who are now Members of the Government side, who had a great deal to say by way of criticism of certain IDA activity down through the years.  When there was a 95 per cent success record they would complain that it should have been 100 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For the last four years I have listened to my colleague, our spokesman on Industry and Commerce, exhorting the Minister to encourage the IDA, to be a little more elastic and take more chances in attracting industry in order to create much needed employment. In this instance the Minister is literally creating his own smokescreen by continuing to compare this agreement with traditional IDA agreements.  From my experience of the operations of the IDA I am satisfied the figure the IDA would be paying to the company on behalf of the State would be more in line with Deputy O'Malley's later amendment than it is with what is contained in section 2.  That is why <Col N="1015" /> I am so worried about this agreement. Why should it have been the Minister who negotiated the agreement?  He draws comparisons between this agreement and agreements come to year after year, month after month and week after week between the IDA and industrialists within this country.  But this got special treatment.</P>
    <P>One of the pronounced reasons why it got that is that, whatever is conveyed in this agreement, without this special treatment, no sane group of people&mdash; which I believe the board of the IDA are&mdash;could responsibly face back to the Minister for Industry and Commerce and say &ldquo;We have paid; we propose to pay £9½ million for a quarter share in Bula, and would you ever go and try to sell that to your Government colleagues?&rdquo;  That is what the Minister will have to do in that context. This is the type of operation that the Minister in his defence endeavours to offer as the reason why he cannot disclose or talk about the terms of this agreement.  He quotes many similar agreements drawn up with the IDA under himself and under previous Ministers.  I am aware of numbers of agreements whereby the IDA on behalf of the State took shares, but in all cases the company in which the State or the IDA was taking equity were spending far more money themselves on the development of that industry than the State was.</P>
    <P>We are in a unique position.  We are paying over £9½ million for a quarter share in a company which was set up for £½ million.  That is the difference, and the IDA would be leaving themselves open to a lot of criticism. I am wondering if it was the case that the Minister asked the IDA to negotiate this.  The fact was that they could not stand over it and went back and told the Minister &ldquo;You handle this yourself&rdquo;.  For the first time we have the Minister creating a precedent in a Bill being introduced here.  His excuse for creating this precedent is that he does not want to create a precedent. That was his reply to the amendment moved by Deputy O'Malley, that there may in the future be big business such as the business <Col N="1016" /> he was talking about last weekend. We have drilled very deeply off the west coast for oil but we will have to go lower before we can do business. Seemingly that has been the policy of the Minister for Industry and Commerce over the past four years.  This country is laid low at the moment but we will be worse before we can be better; we will have to go lower before we can strike back.</P>
    <P>I am desperately suspicious of this agreement.  I was the Minister's immediate predecessor and I am fully conscious of the pressures that must be on this Minister in relation to this business and I am afraid he has succumbed to those pressures.  This precedent-creating operation of introducing a Bill here last week and having to give approval to something we have not seen is a very bad move for any Government.  Any honourable Government would be ashamed to bring in such a Bill.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach in his opening speech in the lifetime of this Dáil talked about open Government.  Open Government is really making history now in coming in and asking this Parliament to rubber-stamp a secret agreement. This is what the Taoiseach described as open Government.  The Minister in reply to the moving of this amendment by Deputy O'Malley, endeavoured to justify his action on the basis that this is only £9 million, and over the next two or three years with the big business that is on the upsurge at present that will be only chickenfeed in relation to the money that the Minister for Industry and Commerce will seek to have rubber-stamped in this House.  But he does not want to disclose this agreement because that would create a new development and we would lose the confidence of the prospective industrialists coming into this country.</P>
    <P>We must get across the message to the Minister and I am glad that earlier, for the first time for a long while in this Parliament, we had five or six representatives from the Government present to hear Deputy O'Malley's contribution because of their qualms and worries about this thing.  Normally at 3.40 p.m. on any <Col N="1017" /> Tuesday or Wednesday in this House you would find a Minister deserted and operating on his own but for some reason today there were at least ten Deputies including two Ministers who stayed, one Minister with a pronounced interest.</P>
    <P>It is rather an extraordinary thing that the Minister for Industry and Commerce should say today that the Opposition were quite clearly opposed to this company, Bula, and that this is their objection to this Bill.  I am afraid that the Minister is forgetting that it was his colleague, the Minister for Local Government, who described the principals in Bula as claim jumpers.  That description did not come from this side of the House. It came from the Minister for Local Government who was not in the House at any stage of the discussion on this.</P>
    <P>This legislation as a precedent in itself is an extremely dangerous precedent. If I am to accept that the Minister is genuine, the message I got from him a short while ago when he was making his reply was, &ldquo;If I go any of the way here, if I were to disclose this agreement it could create complications.  We have studied the situation in Norway and other parts of the world and they do not disclose the content of agreements for the very serious business reasons of protecting the interests of both the Government and the involved client.&rdquo;  What he is forecasting is that this is the first of many such Bills that will be introduced in this House, and this is why I am so worried.  It is remarkable that Parliament should not be given the opportunity of seeing an agreement where the State is involved in the purchase of a 25 per cent share, which will amount to a 49 per cent share, in a property which originally cost the shareholders of this country £½ million.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in the persuasive manner in which he gets his message across to the people, talked about the necessity to evolve.  He said that we ought to evolve, that we ought to change.  I do not think we should; I do not feel that I ought to change.  I do not think there is any great need <Col N="1018" /> for change.  A remarkable amount of change has taken place in the Minister himself and within his party over the last four years.  The Minister for Posts and Telegraphs never stops talking about £70,000 or £100,000 but his colleague the Minister for Industry and Commerce talks about £9.5 million as if it were chickenfeed.  Perhaps it is that the Minister for Finance gets it so easily&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am using the word &ldquo;chickenfeed&rdquo;.  It sprang to my mind as I listened to the manner in which the Minister talked about £9.5 million. He said it is only £9.5 million and the IDA disperse £60 million of the tax-payers' money annually to bring in much needed industry.  Despite that, the unemployment figure is increasing. The Minister for Foreign Affairs told us last week that the figures were going down.  If some money were spent on keeping the Minister for Foreign Affairs up to date when he comes home, it would be a good thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister's contribution was interesting.  It was to placate the knockers, to placate his critics and to placate Members on this side of the House.  He has not made up his mind positively not to disclose the contents <Col N="1019" /> of this agreement at any stage.  He said he is studying a mechanism through which this information might be made available on a confidential basis.  If there were even two people on the Opposition side of the House who could be trusted he might invite them in and show them the agreement but, of course, it goes without saying that there are not.</P>
    <P>As Deputy O'Malley said, the Minister has disclosed a certain amount. When we are finished making our case he will say: &ldquo;I cannot contradict the case made by Deputy O'Malley.&rdquo; Deputy O'Malley asked the Minister if his interest, the State interest, and the interests of the representatives of the State at shareholding level got support from the people representing the 10 per cent that would make a total of 59 per cent and would they be able to outvote the shareholders representing the Roche, Wymes and Woods interest.  In his normal fashion the Minister will tell us: &ldquo;I do not want to disclose this.  I cannot have Deputy O'Malley forcing me into giving a reply&rdquo; and we will be left speculating like a number of the people involved.  That is not good enough.</P>
    <P>There is no logical way in which the Minister can talk himself out of this. The only way this Bill can go through is by a straightforward whipping arrangement which we describe as the rubber stamp method.  If there are genuine Deputies on the Labour benches, and I believe there are, it will be heart-breaking for them to have to vote for this Bill.  As they are walking through the lobby they should keep in mind the statement of their patron the Minister for Industry and Commerce and keep saying to themselves: &ldquo;We must change.  We must evolve.&rdquo;  The Minister told us last June about the enormous difficulty he had in reading through those hefty files.  I know one man who will have no problem in walking through the Division Lobby.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Labour will have no difficulty in walking through the Division Lobby because his files will show that at a dinner in the winter of 1972 which Deputy O'Leary attended as spokesman on Industry and <Col N="1020" /> Commerce he assured not the Bula people but the Tara people that the Labour Party had to make noises about nationalisation and all that jazz with a follow up about the £850 million the Fianna Fáil Government had allowed. He said that was all bunkum and the Labour Party could be counted upon for any support they wanted if they got into office.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and the confidentiality in the commercial sector both in the offshore oil mining agreement and in the agreements made between the State and so many representatives of industry.  It seems singular that the sole demand from the Opposition in recent years that copies of documents should be laid on the Tables of the Houses should relate entirely to this issue concerning Bula mines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bula mine issue must be put into perspective against the policy of the Government in the mining sphere and also against the background in Navan where another major mining company has been involved and, in particular, the change of policy by this Government in the mining area from the attitude of the previous Government under which no taxation was extracted from those engaged in mining activities.  One of the first steps of the National Coalition Government on taking office was to introduce legislation under which tax would be forthcoming <Col N="1021" /> from such interests.  When that legislation was introduced it was very hotly contested by the Opposition and spurious arguments were made by the Opposition drawing analogies with industrial development policy.  There was a suggestion that there would be a lessening of industrial development activity as a result of this change of policy. We can say, in the light of experience of industrial development in the last three or four years, that there has been no question whatever of the new legislation introduced by the Government affecting in any way the scope of industrial development in the country. Naturally, against this background, the Opposition will come in here in this Bula case.</P>
    <P>In regard to the attitude of the Opposition it seems to me that some extremely spurious arguments have been drawn up, particularly by the chief spokesman for Fianna Fáil, who has this amendment before the House, especially in his speech on the Second Stage of the Bill last week.  He attempted to represent the sum of £9.54 million as being the equivalent of giving the Bula company a sum of £298 million.  This is the most spurious sum brought before the House in my short term here.  It took the valuation put on the mine, in which the Government are paying, for roughly a quarter share a sum of £9.54 million and suggested that automatically that is the value for the 50 per cent approximately which Bula are retaining and that this total of approximately £30 million can be quantified upwards to arrive at the figure of £298 million.  There is no justification whatever for the extension of this.</P>

      <P>I appreciate your concern but I am merely following on the type of argument we have had for <Col N="1022" /> the last two hours which seems to me to have been of a more general nature than merely being concerned with this amendment.  There has been a great deal of evidence in the last few days which refutes much of the arguments of the Opposition and the contentions made, particularly in a couple of journalistic sources, which have been refuted completely by the people who have been quoted.  This is a matter which we can deal with at a later stage.</P>

      <P>I said quite clearly that I do not propose to reveal this agreement.  I have declined to answer questions of detail for the obvious reason that one question would lead to another and by the process of revealing one bit of information and then another bit my basic position of not revealing the agreement would be overcome at this instance and people could say &ldquo;There you are, you revealed it&rdquo;.  It is natural that questions with maximum possible inuendo would be chosen. Deputy O'Malley is well able to do that.  It is also natural that he can draw innuendo from my refusal in view of the point of view he is putting.</P>
      <P>I must reiterate that I decline to answer questions of detail on the agreement.  I do not do that because of this agreement.  I do not stand my argument on this agreement.  I base my argument on a category of agreements. I will come to what Deputy Colley said about that because it is not about this particular one but about the category.  Nobody has tried to refute my argument about commercial damage.  In response to earlier calls for the publication of the relevant agreement I have explained&mdash; nobody has been able or even tried to demonstrate otherwise&mdash;that the publication would be a major departure from established practice in this regard.</P>

      <P>I want to refer to the position not alone of the IDA but of Fóir Teoranta, the Industrial Credit Company and a whole series of other State agencies which are authorised not only to take shares in private enterprises but to give them grants and loans without any question of the relevant agreements being published.</P>
      <P>The IDA were reconstituted under the Industrial Development Act, 1969 which specifically provides that it has certain responsibilities under the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  It is now contended that it is permissible for the Oireachtas to pass an Act of Parliament providing that the IDA may give grants and take up shares without publishing the relevant agreements but that somehow it is improper for the Oireachtas to pass an Act empowering me as Minister for Industry and Commerce, to whom that subsidiary agency is responsible, from doing the same.  Let me point out that in so far as grants and share acquisitions are concerned only the minimum information is given by the IDA annual reports.  This is also the case for the various other State agencies.</P>
      <P>Deputy Lalor spoke about agreements and he spoke about the traditional IDA agreement.  He is aware of agreements.  In all his experience, Deputy Colley's experience and my experience when has there ever been publication of any of those agreements?  Deputy Colley spoke about Snia Viscosa.  Does he think that that proceeding in Sligo would have gone on without detailed, specific agreements worked over by the lawyers on both sides?  He knows perfectly well that there was a very detailed agreement with Snia.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>There was never a request.  The Deputy knows that the tradition that evolved here was precisely because companies would be scared off and the industrial promotional activity of the IDA would be damaged.  Why did it grow up in the way it did?</P>

It gives the total payment as £6,053,971.  There has been no request to publish any of those agreements.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>There has never been any question of these agencies being required to give detailed information about the transactions or agreements relating to them.  In this case I have given a great deal of information to the Oireachtas about the transaction but I am told that is not good enough, that I should publish the agreement even though that files in the face of everything that has been said and done in the House over many decades.</P>
      <P>Deputy Colley asked if I could give an example of a similar case in the past where publication did not take place.  It is a lawyer's question because it is asking me to prove a negative. It is harder to prove a negative. One would have to start at the beginning of the life of the State and examine each statute and even if one came across a provision for the acquisition of shares&mdash;I doubt not that there are such&mdash;if it was found that the relative agreement was not scheduled to the enactment, one would still have difficulty because the agreements might somehow have been published by another means.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my view it would be fairer for me to ask him if he can give me an example analagous to this case where <Col N="1025" /> an agreement to acquire a minority interest in a private company was published. That would be the interesting one.  If some mechanism has been discovered in the past for dealing with this dilemma of preserving the confidentiality to which the House has always attached so much importance and, at the same time, meeting the wishes of the people who want to see the relevant documents, I will be glad to consider it.  All I can do is point to the various Acts which have been passed in relation to the IDA and other State agencies involved in commercial matters.  At an earlier stage I referred to the Minerals Development Company Act, 1941, which enabled and enables a Minister for Industry and Commerce to acquire mining businesses without any obligation to publish the relevant agreement.  We must assume in the drafting of a Bill that if one wants to do something under it one puts it into the Bill&mdash;I am not a lawyer like the Deputies opposite but that is a good principle.  There is no such statement in the Minerals Development Company Act, 1941; there is no requirement and in the IDA Act of 1969&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I have had the circumstance where I thought it would be nice to know more details about certain things but the Deputy knows, as well as I, that if there is such a question by the tradition accepted by both sides of the House it is referred to the annual report.  I have quoted the annual report in relation to one instance.  The annual report contains very little.

    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has tried to draw a comparison between what is happening under this Bill and the IDA.  I fail to see how he can justify his efforts to make that comparison. As far as the IDA are concerned, whether they make funds available to firms, native, foreign-based or otherwise, by grant, aid or otherwise, they are obliged to carry out a full and proper investigation and examination of that project and to be satisfied that that project is viable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Deputy suggesting that there was not a full and proper investigation into this project?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>They are obliged to be satisfied that the project is about to go into production or is already in production before they make a payment. When the IDA make money available to such firms they also ensure that the money goes into the company for the <Col N="1027" /> full utilisation of it, to ensure job creation, more production and market viability.  This is a different matter. The Bill seeks to permit the Minister to make more than £9 million available to a few individuals, tax free, without any reference as to whether all that money, or any of it, will go for the utilisation of the company, Bula.  There is no reference to that.  There is a vast difference between what the IDA do and what they are permitted to do and what the Minister is doing here.</P>
      <P>The Minister, because of the veil of secrecy which he has made use of from the start has failed to clarify any of the points raised here, in the newspapers, on the radio or television.  Surely, he must feel obliged to clarify these matters, if not for the benefit of Fianna Fáil then for the benefit of the people. Will the Minister clarify, for instance, the position with regard to the contradictions between him and Lazard, his own financial advisers?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">

      <P>We are entitled to seek clarification while we are still discussing the veil of secrecy the Minister is hiding behind.  Now is the time to tell the people about this because it has been given plenty of publicity and questions are being asked about it throughout the country.  I should like to ask the Minister why we had to have arbitration at all.  What were the terms of the secret agreement that obliged him to go to arbitration in this case? How can we judge the security of this investment of more than £9 million? We cannot do that because of the veil of secrecy.  How are we, or the people, to judge the quality of the Minister's case put before arbitration?  How can we judge the effect of the lack of a full and proper study and examination of the arbitration award?  How can anybody judge the capital requirement needed by this company?  Can the Minister enlighten us on this matter? How are we to judge the ability of the company and those involved in it to finance the capital requirements of the company?  The Minister would be <Col N="1028" /> asked such questions at any board room meeting.  What do we know about the viability of this project because of the uncertainty created as a result of planning permission not being granted yet?  We do not know anything about the conditions that may be imposed by the planning authority and such an authority is not obliged to be concerned about the costings of any company.</P>

      <P>While we are still discussing this veil of secrecy and because of the way this business has been highlighted outside the House by the media here, and in London, I want the Minister to clarify the points raised by speakers on this side of the House. Will the Minister say &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo; to the question put by Deputy O'Malley regarding the voting rights of the 41 per cent shareholders as against the 59 constituted by his 49 per cent plus the Wright 10 per cent?

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>They may have slightly misread the situation.  The Minister's silence is the most eloquent answer ever made to any question here. The answer is obvious and perfectly clear.  It is not surprising that the Minister should wish to avoid formally going on record and confirming what his silence very eloquently states.  There is only one member of the Government parties, apart from the Minister, who bothers to be present now and I suppose, through the Chair, I can ask him what does he think or what does anybody else over there think who may be asked to vote on this matter to preserve the veil of secrecy.  What do they think about a situation in which first, the State has a minority holding and <Col N="1029" /> because it is a private company has no say in anything because it is out-voted both on the board and at a general meeting?  When there is a chance that the smaller of the two distinct blocks in the 51 per cent might, as it were, come in the fullness of time, in the on-going situation that we hope will develop in regard to this mine, to the stage that there might be a falling-out between the Wright interests and the other interests and the Wright interests might think it proper to vote with the Minister they would then constitute 59 per cent of the company and yet the 41 per cent would make the decision.  The Minister has reluctantly put himself into that situation.</P>
      <P>If one wanted to speculate one could quite properly do so on this amendment which seeks to have this agreement published, about other things one is led to believe are in the agreement besides this abnormal voting rights situation.  One could speculate on those at considerable length because what one hears is equally as disturbing as what one has correctly heard in relation to the voting rights of the shares and the inequality of the shares one with another.  It might be better to reserve our speculation about the other undisclosed contents of the agreement to later amendments or sections or Stages of the Bill so that we can take them separately and go into them very thoroughly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are being asked by the Minister to accept that there is an absolute analogy between the IDA putting money into a company, whether by way of equity participation or by way of grant or loan and what is happening here and that if the IDA disclose only a limited amount about what they do in this respect, therefore nothing should be disclosed in regard to this particular company.  I want to make it very clear to the House that the analogy on which the Minister relies is false and for this reason as well as the various reasons quite validly given by my three colleagues.  It is false for this reason above all others, that the IDA when they take equity invest public money into a company. They actually contribute to the capital of the company, the equity capital, and <Col N="1030" /> the company use it in the course of business.  They build or extend a factory or use it for whatever business they are in.  They may buy machinery or vehicles or raw materials or whatever they need.  That is not the position here.  The Minister is not putting a farthing into Bula Limited; he is giving £9.54 million tax free to four individuals.</P>
    <P>Let me repeat that I do not grudge these individuals their windfall, their manna from Heaven, but I would not be human&mdash;and neither would any of us&mdash;if we did not envy them.  I do not begrudge them this and I am not criticising them, despite their impression that they are being criticised. More power to them if they can pick up £9.54 million.  I am criticising the man who is giving it to them and I am showing that his analogy is false and that the investment by the IDA in a company is a valid one.  It is something that we introduced and we support and we like to see it operating, the giving of grants by the IDA, large amounts of money to companies that are operating in order to help them to increase their work force or their output.  These transactions are very helpful to the economy and the nation but they are investments by the IDA into the company whether through equity or grants.  The public money that comes via the IDA from this House actually goes into the company to improve the company's performance, to enable it to do things that it could not otherwise do.</P>
    <P>Apart from the hundreds of millions of pounds they have given in grants over the years there have been investments, as far as I know, in quite a number of companies, public and private.  I think one of the most recent cases in regard to a large company where they took up equity was in a very well-known company, Cement Roadstone Holdings Limited.  I think the amount they took up was £2 million, although I am not exactly clear on that.  Cement Roadstone Holdings is a company which is publicly quoted on the Dublin Stock Exchange and possibly on the London Exchange also.  As soon as they made this arrangement with the Minister they <Col N="1031" /> published, as they are obliged to do under the stock exchange rules relating to publicly-quoted companies, the full details to the extent relevant to investment of the arrangement which, in practice in a matter such as this, would almost certainly mean the entire details.</P>
    <P>Similarly with any other publicly quoted company: they have no option; if they wish to retain their quotation on a recognised stock exchange they must publish these details.  Even if they did not, the IDA report gives information in regard to them, as in the case of all these other semi-State bodies or those in similar situations such as Bord Fáilte&mdash;I do not think that applies now because Bord Fáilte are not giving and have not been giving any money to anyone for the past couple of years.  But in the days when Bord Fáilte did give money for tourist development they published the details.  Some of it went to resort development&mdash;for example, building a promenade in some seaside town. More of it went into hotels which were privately owned.  The figures were all given.  They built new wings, extra bedrooms or a bigger dining-room and the details were there for all to see.  That was actual investment in the companies or resorts concerned. What is happening here is that there is not investment of one penny under this agreement we are not allowed to see.</P>

      <P>As the Chair said we are reporting some progress on the matter, slow as it may be.  I noticed that the questions I raised in regard to the constitutionality of this whole operation and to the fact that it flouts the basic tenets of our law were neatly side-stepped by the Minister.  He referred to them but said &ldquo;This is all lawyers' talk.  The draftsman drafted this and he is the expert.  The question of the constitutionality or propriety or otherwise of it from a legal point of view is a matter for the draftsman and no one else.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of the constitutionality or otherwise of this or any other Bill is primarily a matter for this House and for this House only. This House has an obligation in the first instance, the other House in the <Col N="1033" /> next instance, then the President and then the Supreme Court as the case may be, to examine all Bills from that point of view.  To my way of thinking, it seems incredible that we should be told that, because the parliamentary draftsman drafted it, it is grand and we should not be worrying about it.</P>
      <P>There are a great many unanswered questions in relation to that aspect of the matter which all arise directly from the refusal of the Minister to publish an agreement.  The Bill is meaningless, totally meaningless without the agreement. I have gone through this Bill. The agreement is referred to in six places and there are phrases like &ldquo;subject to the agreement, the Minister may do this&rdquo;.  How do we know whether the Minister can or cannot do it if we do not know what the phrase &ldquo;subject to the agreement&rdquo; means?  We do not know that because we do not have the agreement.  The phrase &ldquo;in accordance with the terms of the agreement, the Minister may decide to do&rdquo; is also used.  How do we know the circumstances in which he can decide to do or not to do such a thing when we do not know the terms of the agreement?</P>
      <P>Last week where it suited the Minister's book, he made selective disclosures of bits and pieces of the agreement. This week when it did not suit his book he said: &ldquo;I am not answering any more questions about the agreement because you will get it all out of me if I keep telling bits now and again&rdquo;.  Deputy Barrett and Deputy Lalor need not worry about what they thought was the Minister's refusal to answer my questions.  They were very eloquently answered by a very eloquent silence.</P>
      <P>It is regrettable that we will soon see the spectacle of 60, 65 or 70 Deputies marching through the lobby to say that this House must enact a law ratifying an agreement that 142 of the 143 Deputies have not seen.  The consequences for the House and the country of doing this are very serious.  If the principle of legislating into law documents, agreements and principles which have not been seen by the House is going to be accepted, we are entitled to ask where will it end.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This may only relate to taxation, but that is a very serious matter in <Col N="1034" /> itself.  If that principle is accepted by Deputies without knowing what they are doing, going through the lobby to make it a principle, what is to stop them in principle doing it again next week in a criminal statute?  What is to stop them creating a crime of which citizens cannot become aware but in respect of which a citizen will be penalised if he breaches a law that not alone he does not know but he cannot know.</P>

Nonetheless, because 60 or 65 people are forced to march through a lobby on a point they apparently do not wish to know anything about, we are asked to believe that that is good law and that is the right way to run this country.</P>
      <P>It is deplorable that we are in this situation which was created by one man, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, who, for some reason he has not explained and none of us can fathom, asks us to pass a short Bill which has no meaning whatever without the agreement which was referred to six times.  A refusal to accept this amendment will be crucial and we are now being asked to enact into law an agreement that 142 of us have not seen.</P>

    <P>Amendment declared lost.</P>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 1 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The section contains the definition of the agreement as the agreement of the 12th December, 1975. Unfortunately, as a result of the defeat <Col N="1037" /> of my amendment, we will have to debate the rest of the Bill in a total vacuum.  We will not be in a position to refer to the document which is itself referred to six times in this Bill.</P>
      <P>The other definition in this section is the definition of the company, which is defined as being Bula Limited.  It is right to draw a distinction between two of the Bula companies which are directly involved in this transaction. The other one is a company called Bula Holdings, which is registered as an unlimited company.  It was originally registered on 29th May, 1974, under the slightly surprising name of Frolic Investments.  The following year the name was changed from Frolic Investments to Bula Holdings.  Its file in the Companies Office, which of course is public, is not as informative as the files of most companies because this is a private unlimited company and it is not necessary for its shareholders to be set out as would be the case in a limited company.  One of the documents on its file is the copy of the special resolution which was passed pursuant to section 141 of the Companies Act, 1963, on 9th December, 1975, which authorises the company to enter into this agreement which subsequently became known as the agreement of 12th December, 1975. This is the agreement we are not allowed to see because it contains some fact or facts which the Minister does not want the public to see.  The directors of the company are set out, as are their directorships of other companies, and some of these may have some significance.  I do not propose to go into that significance now or at any time unless I am forced to discuss the significance of these matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The file of the other company defined here as Bula Limited is also in the Companies Office but it is not as readily available as the other one. When my agents called on a number of occasions during the past couple of weeks the file was not there and the officials concerned were not sure where it was.  I was able to get at least some of it copied by my searchers and there are a number of interesting matters which arise.  In talking about what is in the file of the Companies Office I am not, of course, disclosing anything <Col N="1038" /> which is not available to any member of the public on payment of a modest fee.  There are pages and pages of charges given by this company, Bula Limited, which, of course, have to be registered in the Companies Office in order to be valid.  By referring to this, I am in danger of being accused by the Minister of being in some way &ldquo;anti-Bula&rdquo;, which of course I am not.  But one is entitled to draw the conclusion from the pages of charges created by this company on its assets and various undertakings that it is singularly in need of cash, and singularly in need of equity investment from whatever source it might draw it.</P>
    <P>It is therefore tragic, if the Minister makes the decision&mdash;and let us forget whether we agree with the decision&mdash; to spend 9.54 million on equity ordinary shares in Bula Limited, that some at least of that vast amount of public money does not go into the company where it could do some good.  It would be unfortunate that a lot of public money should be spent in relation to a company without actually being invested in it.  In the debate on the amendment just concluded I drew the distinction between the IDA putting money into a company and helping the company, allowing it to expand, create more jobs, safeguard existing jobs, and what the Minister is doing here now, in that not one penny of what he is paying is going into the company.</P>
    <P>The company is singularly starved for cash and it appears to have very heavy overdrafts with two banks which are secured by various charges and various holdings of land and mineral rights.  The company, I notice, in March, 1976, bought a very small piece of land.  It is described in the register as part of the lands of Windtown containing 1 rood and 2 perches approximately&mdash;that of course would be statute measure&mdash;being all the lands comprised of Folio 25756 of the register, County Meath.  Such a small quantity of land could not have been wildly expensive; nevertheless it must have been expensive.  It seems that a charge was created by the company in favour of the vendor who is named in the register of charges, to buy 1 rood and 2 perches of land, which is very <Col N="1039" /> fractionally over a quarter of a statute acre and perhaps slightly bigger than the site of the modern semi-detached house.  Still there is a charge created for that, which seems to indicate that cash was not paid for that very small amount of land but that payment was made by way of a transfer of the land without payment, the money that was due being secured in favour of the vendor by a mortgage.  The mortgage is dated 16th March, 1976, and it was registered on the 6th April, 1976, and the amount of the charge is £15,000.</P>
    <P>There are, in addition to that, very extensive charges over all the undertakings of the company registered in one case in favour of the Governor and Company of the Bank of Ireland, and in the other case in favour of the Northern Bank Finance Corporation Limited.  One of those is a floating charge.  Another is a legal mortgage. There is a further legal mortgage; then there is a debenture, and then there is another mortgage.  It all seems to indicate that there is an unusual under-capitalisation of the company.</P>
    <P>On further scrutiny of their public file in the Companies Office one finds that 999,998 shares were issued.  They were all issued together on a particular date and that date happens to be the 12th, December, 1975, which some of us might think was a coincidence; perhaps it was not.  However, what struck me as more important than the date of issue of those shares is that they are described in the file concerned, Form 45, Return of Allotments made, 12th December, 1975, as having been allotted for a consideration other than cash&mdash;the whole 999.998 of them.  The nominal amount of the shares so allotted is on Form No. 45, which was filed shortly afterwards and is described as £999,998, and no cash at all was paid for any of them.  The other two, of course, which make up the million are what are called subscriber shares, and they were taken up by two solicitors when the company was originally formed. That is the normal process and no consideration would have been given for those two shares because they were <Col N="1040" /> taken up in a trustee or fiduciary capacity and transferred by their holders subsequently on the direction of the beneficial owners of the company. The form goes on to say that the consideration for which such shares have been allotted is as follows:</P>
    <P>Conveyance of lands at Nevinstown, County Meath, to Bula Limited.</P>
    <P>Conveyance appears to have been from various individuals and presumably from Bula holdings, but no cash was involved.  That, I suppose, explains why there are so many charges, because it appears that basically there is no subscribed equity capital in this company and that, I want to repeat, is particularly tragic, that none of the large amount of money which the Minister is now giving to the four beneficiaries of his largesse tax free is going into the company, because there must be few companies that would need that kind of money or even some of it.  Even a small proportion of it would be a godsend at the present time.  If they were capitalised in terms of equity capital they would then be in a position to raise money from banks and elsewhere to finance their proposed operations, and until they raise equity capital&mdash;and the procedure we are asked to ratify in this Bill will not raise equity capital for them&mdash;they are going to be hamstrung in so far as the development of their operations is concerned.</P>
    <P>There is nothing I have said on these matters that is not available to any member of the public who cares to take himself along to Dublin Castle and look up these matters in full detail. What is available there appears to raise certain question marks, indeed further question marks on this whole affair which is so riddled with question marks.  These matters should be dealt with now by the Minister, particularly of the method that is proposed by the company of which he is about to become a 49 per cent shareholder to capitalise itself and to have paid up these floating charges, debentures, mortgages and so on, so that the company may, if they intend going into production, approach banks for the <Col N="1041" /> purpose of raising long-term finance to enable them to put the mine into production.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I note what the Deputy says but in relation to the points he makes on section 1, information, if not widely available, is at least available. I am not clear as to what comment Deputy O'Malley wishes me to make. If he would amplify a little what he has in mind I should do my best to answer him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister would wish to be helpful but I have spent about 15 minutes on this. I referred to the very large number of mortgages, debentures, floating charges and other encumbrances, to use a general word, which appear to affect the company and, so far as I can see, all their assets as well.  I am referring to all the assets that the public would know about but perhaps there are other assets that are not affected.  However, a floating charge normally would affect all the assets of the company.  The overdraft and other mortgages I have talked of would seem to be a very heavy set of encumbrances on the company. I referred also to the issue of the shares for a consideration other than cash.  These are the 9,998 shares.  I drew the conclusion from that that no actual cash has been put into this company and I regretted that in these circumstances and having regard to the fact that £9.54 million was being made available to the shareholders, there was no provision in the agreement&mdash;at least so far as we know&mdash;whereby this money instead of going to the shareholders would go direct to the company as an equity investment in the way the IDA invest directly, whether by way of grant or by way of equity capital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the circumstances I asked whether there is anything in the agreement that would enable the Minister to put a few million pounds into the company in order that they might be capitalised properly from an equity point of view, because until such time as they are capitalised properly they will not be in a position to go on the market for long-term money to enable them to develop their mineral assets.  The kind <Col N="1042" /> of money required will not be obtained in an overdraft situation of the kind that the company have been using up to now.  On the contrary it is necessary to have, for example, long-term sales contracts, generally for about eight years, and to arrange a repayment of fixed-term loans by reference to these contracts.  I do not think the company can even begin looking for those while they remain as heavily encumbered as the file in the Companies Office would appear to indicate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed that the encumbrances to which the Deputy referred were analysed very carefully in setting up the valuations.  Apart from that the Deputy has asked me to comment on questions of management of the company, but it is not within my province to do that.  It is perfectly within the compass of the company to raise the sort of money required in the light of the valuations available.  As I told the House during the Second Stage reading, I understand that the various plans and methods of proceeding to obtain the moneys required for investment have been drawn up carefully and scrutinised. There is no other comment I wish to make except reiterate that the matters to which the Deputy referred were analysed very carefully and taken into consideration by my specialists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Having regard to the fact that the Minister proposes spending more than £9 million of public money I do not think it unreasonable to ask him to give us some idea of how the company proposes to operate. Leaving aside the argument that arises in regard to how much money will be needed to put the mine into production, can the Minister indicate, even in general terms, where it is proposed to raise that money, having regard especially to the evidence produced by Deputy O'Malley which suggests that there is little, if any, cash in the company at present and that the more than £9 million which the Minister proposes to invest will not increase by one penny the amount of cash available to the company?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>The sort of estimates I gave last week of the money required <Col N="1043" /> would not make a significant difference to the company in developing the mine even it they represented the normal amount of cash in the form of issued share capital.  The procedure which is normal in these instances is to borrow and the Deputy is aware of the range of lenders available in such circumstances. With an asset of the kind we are talking of, the loan market is the place on which to obtain development capital and the Deputy is at least as familiar as I am with the range of lenders available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">

      <P>Would the Minister accept that in the normal case in which one is trying to raise a substantial amount of cash for a purpose of this nature the prospective lender likes to know that the borrower is investing some of his own cash?  In the event of such a situation arising, are there any plans for the company, or in particular for the shareholders in the company, including the Minister, to put up the cash for that purpose?  Or does the Minister envisage the total amount required for putting the mine into production being borrowed with no injection of cash by the shareholders?</P>

      <P>The figure I gave for the total amount of money required was £25 million.  There would be no question of anything of that scale being inserted other than by way of borrowing.  The Deputy knows that the types of borrowing sources one would think of would be, for example, the ECGD arrangements of the UK for comparable circumstances for other countries and also banking consortia and, possibly, the AIB.  If money were required to be inserted into the company the quantity would be very much less than the £25 million. It is the norm to have much smaller amounts in issued share capital.</P>
      <P>I cannot make any comment in regard to the sources or in regard to any plans for putting share capital into the company.</P>

      <P>The information we have got over the last five minutes on this section from the Minister is shattering.  It bears out the case being made by Deputies O'Malley and Colley in relation to the Second Stage and in relation to our amendment.  It appears that we can now take it that there is nothing in this agreement which involves anything except the Minister acquiring a 49 per cent shareholding in Bula and that no further plans have been made.  As Deputy O'Malley has pointed out, when over £½ million has been paid out to Bula Holdings, there is nothing whatsoever to prevent them from putting this money into their <Col N="1045" /> pockets and sitting back and doing nothing.  The Minister has explained today and previously that he reckons that it would take about £25 million to get this mine developed but as of now no arrangements have been made in relation to its development or in relation to working capital.</P>
      <P>When, arising from this agreement, the Minister hands over the £9.5 million that has to be paid, he will hopefully join with the other partners in going ahead cap in hand to the banking consortia and to various other interests with a view to seeing how the £25 million can be raised on which we will find ourselves paying 49 per cent of the interest.  The last reply I expected to hear from the Minister was that he did not know how much of the £25 million will have to be injected by the State.  I am shattered to hear the Minister saying that after the passing of this Bill, plus the agreement, that we know nothing about, the job ends, and that we then have to sit down and hopefully his representatives will use their persuasive power on their partners in the new company to get them to join with them in seeking money.  They will have the great advantage that they have the security that this State will be responsible with the backing of the Minister for Finance to go surety for any loan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>In the light of what the Minister has said about future capitalisation, it appears to be appropriate to discuss the point that was raised briefly last week at the rights issue.  It would seem from reading the company file in the Companies Office and from what one reads about this company that the minimum equity capitalisation of Bula Limited should be a figure of about £4 million in terms of cash.  There is no cash.  There are heavy encumbrances.  The Minister said that his advisers had gone into these encumbrances very carefully and that they knew the position in regard to them and so on.  It amazes me if this is so, that still nothing was worked out regarding the likelihood of a rights issue and what the Minister's attitude would be in regard to it.  The Minister told us last week, that there was a provision in the agreement of the 12th <Col N="1046" /> December, 1975, which enabled him to veto a rights issue.  The Minister could if he choose, even though in the minority, say that there would be no rights issue.  The Minister has the power to do that but whether it would be wise in the company's interest and his own interest as the largest single shareholder in it to exercise that right of veto is problematic.  The Minister's financial advisers might well advise his not to exercise the right of veto.</P>
      <P>If the figure of about £4 million capitalisation was agreed on and if there were going to be a rights issue in respect of that, the Minister would have to take up 49 per cent of it out of public money and that would be fractionally under £2 million.  The company would have to capitalise itself properly anyway for the purpose of raising long term finance for the development of the mine.  I am advised that the usual proportion of equity capital towards long term finance is about one in five or one in six. If we are to take the Minister's figure for development costs of about £25 million and divide it by six, that would give just over £4 million, which tallies with my estimate from the other point of view.  It would suggest that whatever way the ball hops, the Minister will have to take up the rights of about £2 million.  The House should know that so that the expenditure will not be £9.54 million but will be about £11½ million.  I would more readily agree to the £2 million extra than the £9.54 million sought under this Bill because it would be an actual investment in the company.  It would be productive and helpful to the company and, therefore, to the economy.  It would be the right type of investment to make if the Minister wants to get involved in equity in mining companies that are totally embryonic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We know that the taxpayers commitment will be about £11½ million but we must go a little further.  We must examine the Minister's position and, therefore, the taxpayers' position in regard to guarantees of the borrowing. Charges on land or minerals will not suffice for the banks that will lend long-term finance.  That is only a very small aspect of their security.  It could be an unrealisable part of their security. <Col N="1047" /> They will want two other things. They will want long-term sales contracts for concentrates and they will want the repayments tied in or locked into them.  In addition, they will want guarantees from the shareholders and the directors.  Of course the most attractive potential guarantor of all is the Minister for Industry and Commerce because he is a corporation sole with perpetual succession&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Next to the Minister for Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  Next to the Minister for Finance he is the best of all.  The Central Fund is there to underwrite the Minister's guarantees and, therefore, one would anticipate that the banks concerned, who will be lending £25 million, £35 million or £45 million, will actively seek his guarantee. If anything goes wrong one guarantor stands to lose and one would like to know the Minister's, and the taxpayers', potential liability in this respect.</P>
      <P>The Minister was at pains to tell us on the previous occasion, in the media and at certain parts of today's debate, that every aspect of this matter has been gone into if not by him personally certainly by his advisers. These are questions that would immediately spring to the mind of any potential purchaser of shares.  They are the first questions any potential purchaser would ask.  How is he going to stand <i>vis-á-vis</i> a rights issue and how will he stand <i>vis-à-vis</i> guarantees, especially if he is a particularly attractive purchaser in the form of a Minister who it would have been thought up to a few years ago could never go bankrupt or into liquidation? One is less certain now about these possibilities, but nevertheless as a corporation sole his chances of going into liquidation are less than they would be in respect of even the wealthiest person in the land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, a prudent and knowledgeable purchaser would certainly have acquainted himself with all these problems, would have asked the questions and would have satisfied himself with regard to the answers.  They are <Col N="1048" /> not technical matters.  They are fundamental matters to anyone who engages in the jungle of commerce or as the Minister described it last week, perhaps more aptly than he thought in relation to a company such as Bula, in &ldquo;horse trading&rdquo;.  The answers to these questions should be readily available to the Minister and I consider it in the public interest that he should give those answers now.</P>

      <P>The Deputy has indicated his understanding of the situation in his last sentence.  We are dealing with section 1 of a Bill on Committee Stage, a section that consists of definitions.  On the debate on this section the Deputy has widened the question enormously to ask me about specific matters in very considerable detail.  I know that the sort of questions he has raised were the questions raised by my staff in the detailed investigations.  They are the kind of questions that would have to be considered by experts.  What we are doing here is bringing into Committee Stage the discussion of small detail, of a kind that has not been raised in other contexts of State grants and investments.</P>

One has serious professionals who look at a project, who do their work on it and who come to a conclusion.  However, it has not been our practice to try to run industrial companies through the Oireachtas. There is a distinction between the Legislature and the Executive and the checking is not done by individual Ministers who do not possess the expertise.  The checking is done by professional people who are neutral, who are fair and skilful.  The functioning of any State relies on the judgment of such individuals.  The pursuit of fine <Col N="1049" /> detail in the Oireachtas is in total breach of what we normally do.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann calls on the Government to increase the money value of third level grants and scholarships and to update the eligibility limits.</P>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to move this motion.  Time was when third level education was regarded as the preserve of the privileged, the wealthy.  People who could not avail of it were not necessarily lacking in intelligence, but it is true that people who had plenty of intelligence and lacked wealth could not avail of it.  Until comparatively recently, third level education was mainly regarded as university education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The philosophical basis for the introduction of third level education grants and scholarships was the provision of equality of opportunity in so far as that is possible in the modern State. Young people of ability who normally without aid could not avail of third level education, by what had become almost a consensus philosophy in the world, could be aided by Governments and thus be able to exploit their potential and also move socially&mdash;it became a means of social mobility.  When little words like these become popular they <Col N="1050" /> develop into the nature of a cliche, but we should examine the realities behind the words.  In our own society it is true, that there are many young people of ability who will not be able to go to third level institutions, universities and other institutions of higher education if they have not got help from the State.</P>
    <P>Indeed, for many years second level education in Christian Brothers' schools and other such institutions was provided practically free.  It was the best value for money in any country in the world.  The money from the State was small and the fees were ridiculously low.  The next logical step was to see to it that able people who wanted to go on to third level institutions should be able to do so.  Consequently, the few scholarships that had existed were replaced by a system of grants introduced by a Fianna Fáil Government in 1968.</P>
    <P>That scheme may need amendment, improvement, but tonight I am talking about raising the money value of the grants and the parents' income ceilings so that the ridiculous situation that exists because of inflation will no longer obtain.  The part of the grant that covers maintenance and other expenses is at maximum £300.  There is a proposal to increase it to £350 for a person living away from home.  For someone living in or adjacent to a university town, the maximum is £120.</P>
    <P>I have here an expense case in relation to a girl whom I will call Susanne in University College Dublin.  Her fare to Belfield is 12p.  She goes to Belfield and returns six days a week.  That costs £1.44.  She has bed-and-breakfast lodgings and has to buy her lunch in Belfield, subsidised, for 60p, which amounts to £3.60 per week.  She must buy her tea six times a week, sometimes five, which at 55p amounts to £3.30 a week.  She is in modest lodgings with week-end meals at £9.50.  This is not a case I am taking from the air. It is a real one.  All that amounts to £19.84 per week.  I have not included the cost of books.  I should not include cigarettes, but if she smokes, a packet of Carroll's, the cheapest, costs her 20½ per 10.  I have not included anything for entertainment, social life, <Col N="1051" /> dancing, the theatre.  If she drinks a pint of ale per week, they do it nowadays, it costs her 40p.  This continues for 30 weeks and I am giving the cost without indulgence of any kind.  I have not added money for clothes and I have not reckoned travel between her home and Dublin and her return home at the end of term, which a student would be entitled to have taken into account.  All I have given is a parsimonious estimate, crushing out any social element, and that for 30 weeks, and that may be a little longer than the normal.  With examinations or extra study it could reckon out at roughly £600 a year and it is low at that. Everyone knows, including the Minister, that expenses are very high nowadays no matter how carefully a student lives.</P>
    <P>Away back in 1966 Fine Gael proposed £350.  Deputy Collins is smiling. He is an economist and he knows about inflation.  Admittedly, Fianna Fáil would have had to pay the Bill. Now that we are in Opposition we can be a little more flaithiúlach: Is fial thú le stiall leathair duine eile.  That is what Fine Gael were doing at that particular time.  Those were the good old days.  There was an inflation rate of roughly 8½ per cent per annum which would bring the total for that period of eight years to about 70 per cent. Since 1973, on top of that, we have had an 84 per cent increase in the cost of living.  The end result would be 154 per cent of £350.  I presume fees were excluded originally.  I saw the Fine Gael document but I did not read it very carefully.  I think it would have excluded fees.  I reckon the £350 should now read £875 in round figures. What is required now is not the £50 mentioned by the Minister for Finance but a realistic figure related to the CPI.</P>
    <P>This is not the most serious aspect from the point of view of the son or daughter of the poor man because even those inadequate grants are not available in any liberal fashion.  I have here the figures for the student who does not live in an university town or adjacent to it.  This is something the Minister should study until he grows <Col N="1052" /> angry and changes it.  At the top there is &ldquo;Income of parent less than £1,600 per annum&rdquo;.  To start with, £1,600 is too low.  I am sure this is the most recent table.  Perhaps the Minister will confirm whether it is or not.  A man with less than £1,600 and one child will get the full grant but if he has £1,600 he will not get the full grant. That is the result of these figures being left untouched despite inflation totalling 84 per cent since 1973.  A farm labourer on the maximum wage with one child may not enjoy the full grant under the present system.  The line lies between £30 and £31 per week.</P>
    <P>I had a look at <i>Eolaire an Stáit</i> to see who would be excluded.  A paperkeeper ranges between £48.73 to £51.42 per week.  Even if his child should be very bright and get four honours in the leaving certificate, he will not get the full grant.  A messenger ranging between £44.55 and £47.68 with a child anxious to avail of third level education will not get the full grant because his father is earning too much.  A cleaner with £44.22 per week up to £46.89 will not get the full grant under the present system.  This is as a result of inflation, as a result of this text becoming a sacred text not to be changed or updated.  The Minister will in all fairness see the strength of the case and change that column realistically to bring it in line with the realities that I have just been reading out to the House from <i>Eolaire an Stáit 1977.</i></P>
    <P>A comparatively young clerical officer would be unlikely to have a candidate for higher education, but even he would be outside the limit for his one son or daughter who had the qualifications; a clerical assistant the same.  Those few instances indicate to the House how badly in need of revision those figures are.  Fine Gael's concern away back in the 1960s seems now to have turned into indifference and I am trying to rouse their conscience to the same fine pitch as it was roused to in 1966 when Fianna Fáil were paying the Bill.</P>

I have a little booklet here which was got out by the Labour Party, who are notably absent.  They did not stray over here and they are not on that side of the House.  They must be ashamed of what is going on and do not want to come in.  This is <i>Challenge and Change in Education</i>, a report put out by a committee chaired by Deputy Barry Desmond&mdash;I thought he might be here &mdash;and I am reading from page 22:</P>
      <P>We may not need a very large expansion in the number of graduates but we most certainly need to ensure that those graduates should be our best vocational and secondary school students, not just those who can afford to pay for university education.</P>
      <P>If the Labour Party policy remains the same on that, they should get moving. They should convince the Government that they have 20 votes and that unless they up these figures realistically those 20 pairs of feet will not trot after the Minister into the lobby.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is one of the persons who agreed in the corporation with the resolution that the Minister should increase the grants.</P>
      <P>I want to point out that there is a certain development which accords to the Labour Party the luxury of a separate policy on education.  If the members of the Labour Party, and especially members of that party who are also members of the Government, agree that the income of parents is set too low on that list that I have just read out&mdash;and I think they do believe that it is set too low because they have been labouring the point around the country and I have had reports and I have read speeches&mdash;they now have an opportunity to put their feet where their words have been and to support this motion and not be indulging in the hypocrisy of pretending that the Government have a policy on education, that the party do not agree with it, that this is what they want.</P>
      <P>If they want that, all they have to do is back up this motion on this point. If the Labour TDs and Minister think that a labourer with one bright child who achieves four honours in the leaving certificate; a messenger with one bright child who achieves four honours in the leaving certificate; a paperkeeper with one bright child who achieves four honours in the leaving certificate, is too wealthy to be allowed to enjoy a full third-level grant and get a higher education, then they should vote against this motion.  If they believe that the categories mentioned by me are too privileged in our community to be able to enjoy for their children a third-level full university grant, then they should vote against this motion. I do not believe that the supporters of the Labour Party or the TDs in the Labour Party think that that eligibility scale has any truth or validity left in it.  I believe they are as anxious as I am that the eligibility limits be increased, and for that reason I am appealing to them to support this motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I started off by saying that the whole idea of university grants had as its philosophic basis the belief that opportunity <Col N="1055" /> should be equal for all.  If the Government and the parties who support the Government believe that, then they should face the two problems mentioned in the motion: that the money allotted by way of grant is not sufficient due to inflation, that the eligibility limits have no reality nowadays and that therefore, the Government should raise the limits and raise the amount of the grant.  It is fraudulent, in a sense, to say the money is available provided the standard is reached, if you cut off an individual, in certain circumstances admittedly, between £30 and £31 a week and if you say: &ldquo;You cannot have a full grant if your salary is somewhere between £30 and £31 a week.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance announced an increase of £50 in the grant in his budget but, significantly, he did not touch the parents' income limits.  You could make £1 million available straight away and then cut out all possibility of anyone enjoying it by leaving there the figures which have been operating practically since the scheme began.  It is like the £4,500 loan for a house in the local government sphere.  There are many sums of £4,500 available but where is the unfortunate person to get the other £6,000 or £7,000 it takes to build a house?</P>
    <P>The pretext&mdash;and that is all it is when we study those figures&mdash;that third level education is, like the Ritz, open to everyone must be faced up to.  We must remove the unreality, the element of pretext and fraud in it.  What is mainly in contention is the part which deals with maintenance and other expenses, and this part is very closely monitored by the consumer price index. So, there is a regulator ready to hand in the CPI which covers the items I mentioned earlier.  The Minister has that ready to hand and can use it to decide realistically on the salaries and on the amounts of the grants.</P>
    <P>In asking the House to pass this motion for the reasons stated I am conscious, as I remarked earlier, that a consensus has developed, partly under the influence of socialistic thinking, that lack of money should not preclude anyone from going as far as <Col N="1056" /> he or she possibly can in the educational world.  That consensus is there. The will to do something about that consensus seems to have been lacking in the Government.  I am surprised the Labour Party have not acted as a goad and have not provided a stimulus to have the parents' limits for eligibility raised.  They should be conscious of what has happened in that sphere. They are interested in, and some of them are members of, and dealing with, and making representations for trade unions.  Above all, they should be conscious of this anomaly.</P>
    <P>I am not without hope that they will support this motion when it comes to a vote tomorrow night.  They will be acting in accordance with their own traditions; they will be acting perfectly logically when they vote for this motion, that is, if the Minister decides to put it to the vote.  The Minister may very well accept it and, in doing so, he would be acting in accordance with the principles laid down in the Just Society document in the mid-1960s.  I did not mean it as a jibe when I said somebody else was paying the bill and somebody else was responsible for the public purse at the time.  I would be very glad if the Minister proved I was wrong.  I said the old proverb was: &ldquo;Is fial thú le stiall leathair duine eile.&rdquo;  The Minister may very well decide to be fial and flaithiúl with public funds at his disposal in the two ways I mentioned, namely, upping the amount of grants and realistically reappraising the parents' income limits.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. P. Barry)</NameTxt>
      <P>I might first make reference to the different schemes of third level grants and scholarships which are in operation and the conditions pertaining to them.  The motion reads:</P>
      <P>Dáil Éireann calls on the Government to increase the money value of third level grants and scholarships and to update the eligibility limits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From the Opposition's point of view the timing of this motion is wrong.  If they had put this motion down prior to 10th September, 1976, I would see some merit in it or some reason for putting it down, or if they put it down <Col N="1057" /> next autumn if the Government did not act on the basis of the report to which I will refer later on again there would be some merit in it.  Knowing as they must that this investigation is being conducted at the moment, and knowing the results are not available yet, and knowing that on the basis of those results and the conclusions drawn from that report any changes in the eligibility level will be made, I cannot see any point in the Opposition putting this motion down now.  To prod my predecessor last autumn into conducting this report, or to prod me to act on the basis of that report would be more understandable than choosing this twilight period to put down a motion and have it debated in this House.  For that reason I will be confidently asking supporters of the Government to reject this motion.</P>
    <P>In a way I was glad to have the motion debated because it gave me an opportunity to find out exactly what grants and scholarships are available from the Government and how they are implemented, which I had not managed to get around to over the past few weeks.  I should like to refer to the different schemes of third level grants and scholarships which are in operation and the conditions pertaining to them.  These are (1) the Local Authorities (Higher Education) Grants Scheme, (2) the Department-operated Primary Education Training Colleges Grants Scheme, (3) the Department-operated Thomond College of Education (Physical Education) Grants Scheme, (4) the Department-operated Home Economics Teacher Training Colleges Grants Scheme.</P>
    <P>The scholarship schemes are: (1) the vocational education committee-operated schemes of scholarships to regional and other technical colleges, (2) the scheme of university scholarships awarded by the Department to students from the Gaeltacht, (3) the scheme of scholarships for students wishing to pursue courses throught the medium of Irish at University College, Galway, which is a limited one, (4) the Department's Easter Week, 1916, Commemoration Scholarships, (5) the Department's schemes of scholarships for students who obtain places on <Col N="1058" /> departmental teacher-training courses in woodwork, metalwork, woodwork and building construction, general and rural science, metalwork&mdash;post-primary education&mdash;and educational woodwork and (6) the scheme of awards known as Department of Education scholarships.</P>
    <P>The first one I referred to, the Local Authorities (Higher Education) Grants Scheme is administered by the local authorities under the county councils, the county boroughs and the corporations.  Each local authority prepare a scheme each year applicable to the candidates in its own functional area and submit it for the Minister's approval.  These, of course, are uniform schemes.  When they are submitted to the Minister he sanctions them and they go back and are administered by the county council or the borough council, whichever is in question.</P>
    <P>The method of financing the scheme is that each local authority contribute a fixed amount annually, that is a sum equal to the amount provided by them in respect of university and post-primary scholarships in the financial year ended 31st March, 1968 and the expenditure on higher education grants over and above the fixed contribution is recouped by my Department. This means that the local authorities' contributions to the scheme have been frozen at the 1968 level. Any increase in university fees since then has been borne totally by the State.  I believe what may have prompted in some measure the putting down of this motion was the fact that they could not see an increased allocation in the Estimate for the scheme.  The figure in the Estimates for 1977 is the amount of money which has been billed by the local authorities in respect of the preceding year so that any increase in 1977, were it to come, would not appear in the 1977 Estimates but would appear in the 1978 Estimates because it is a year behind.</P>
    <P>The principal conditions to be complied with in order to be eligible for a grant are that the student must obtain the prescribed successes in the leaving certificate of the Department, <Col N="1059" /> he must satisfy the provisions of the means test and he must pursue a full-time approved course of third level education.  With regard to the means test particulars are given in the scholastic limits.  They were read out and this was the document referred to by Deputy Wilson when he spoke. That, as he said, contains all the information as regards all levels, at what particular spot anybody can slot in. Where income is derived partly from lands and partly from other sources the income derived from such lands is reckoned on the basis that £1 rateable valuation is equivalent to £26.70 cash income.</P>
    <P>With regard to the value of the grants, the original position was that the grants were inclusive sums, a maximum of £300 per year for a student whose normal family residence was not in or adjacent to a university town and a maximum of £175 per year for a student whose normal family residence was in or adjacent to a university town.  In the academic years 1970-71 and 1971-72 upward adjustments were made to meet the increases in university fees.  From the beginning of the academic year 1972-73 grants were divided into two elements, that is, a lecture fee element of up to £156 per annum and a maintenance element of up to £250 a year. The maintenance element was at that time divided into two.  It was £250 for those who were not in or adjacent to a university town and £100 a year for those who were in or adjacent to a university town.  The increases granted since then are as follows: in the academic year 1974-75&mdash;this part is broken into two parts&mdash;the maximum of the lecture fee element was raised to £172 and this upper limit could be exceeded in certain faculties.  The maximum of the maintenance element was raised to the existing £300 a year for those not adjacent to a town and £120 a year for those in or adjacent to a town.  In the academic year 1975-76 the maximum of £172 in relation to the lecture fee was raised to £215.  For the current academic year, that is 1976-77, the maximum of £215 in relation to the lecture fee was raised to £249.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1060" /> The number of grant holders in each academic year and the value of the grants held by them, since the introduction of the scheme in 1968, is as follows:</P>

    <P>As I said earlier, these figures were up to the end of the academic year, that was last summer.  The current figures are not yet available because they are compiled on the basis of the bills sent in by the county councils, county boroughs and corporations. They will be available some time in the not too distant future.  The value of the grants&mdash;I will not read out the years but will just give the amount of money in each of those years&mdash; were £252,185, £572,503, £908,016, £1,176,314, £1,524,371, £1,692,502, £2,143,816, and £2,401,000.  The bill for the current year is not yet available so I cannot say what that is.  This is the point I wanted to make earlier on about the inappropriateness of this motion at this time.</P>
    <P>On 10th September, 1976, my predecessor announced that it was proposed to make a fundamental review of the terms of the scheme which would apply as from the academic year 1977&mdash;78.  It was decided that for that purpose information should be obtained from the local authorities in relation to the operation of the scheme, especially the figures of income, rateable valuation and number of dependant children.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Could we get the reference to that?  Was it a statement?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>It was issued from the Department in the name of my predecessor.  It was decided that the information should be obtained in the case of students who held grants in the academic year 1975-76 and students who were awarded grants in 1976.  It <Col N="1061" /> is proposed on the basis of this information that increased limits may be determined which will be more appropriate in present circumstances and result in an improved and more suitable scheme being introduced by the academic year 1977-78.  As Deputy Wilson stated, the Minister for Finance last month in his budget statement announced that with effect from the academic year 1977-78 the maximum maintenance grant for all holders of grants will be increased from the present £300 to £350.  That applies to what are described as &ldquo;non-adjacent students&rdquo;.  The grant in respect of &ldquo;adjacent students&rdquo; will be increased from £120 to £140.</P>
      <P>In accordance with the terms of the Act of 1968, the courses in respect of which grants apply are (a) university degree courses and (b) courses outside universities which are accepted as being equivalent to university degree courses.  It was decided in 1974 to extend the scheme to certain other educational institutions such as the regional technical colleges and colleges of technology in respect of their courses which are (a) wholetime with leaving certificate entry; (b) of a minimum duration of two years and (c) lead to a national certificate or diploma awarded by the National Council for Educational Awards or a certificate or diploma awarded by another recognised institution.  That extension is in operation since 1974.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope to give the House an opportunity of a further discussion on this subject by introducing the necessary amending legislation to give effect to that provision.  Separate schemes, broadly similar to the Higher Education Grants Scheme, are operated by the Department for students in (a) primary teacher training colleges; (b) the Thomond College of Education (Physical Education) and (c) the home economics teacher training colleges. Vocational education committees also award scholarships to students in the regional technical colleges and other technical colleges on the basis of schemes containing a means test, and the value of awards, as provided in the Higher Education Grants Scheme. Non-means test scholarships are awarded by the Department under <Col N="1062" /> three schemes: (a) university scholarships for students in the Gaeltacht; (b) scholarships for students wishing to pursue courses through Irish in University College, Galway, and (c) Easter Week 1916 commemoration scholarships.  The value of the scholarships for students from the Gaeltacht and for students wishing to pursue courses through Irish in University College, Galway, is £470 per year for a student who has to live in lodgings and £290 per annum for a student living at home.  The value of the Easter Week commemoration scholarships is £520 per annum in lodging and £340 per annum for those living at home.  Other non-means test scholarships, in the form of weekly allowances, are paid by the Department to students who obtain places on the following departmental teacher-training courses: woodwork, metalwork, woodwork and building construction; general and rural science; metalwork (post primary education) and educational woodwork.  The value of the scholarships range from £9 per week to £33.86 per week.</P>
    <P>That, then, is an account of the particulars of the situation.  But it is necessary, in order to place the matter in its proper perspective, to refer also to the general consideration and, in fact, determine the allocation of finance for the purposes of these schemes.  Deputy Wilson glided over this subject.  I need hardly remind the House that the past decade has been one of extremely rapid expansion and development at all levels of education.  These different levels, as we choose to call them for administrative convenience and ease of identification, are, however, in reality so interdependent and interrelated that any alteration at one level must disturb the existing equilibrium and influence all other levels.  Growth in the participation rate and related expansion in investment of resources at one level, for example, leads in the nature of things to a demand, and, indeed, to strong pressure, for the provision of opportunities for still more advanced education.  The higher the general level of education becomes, the greater our people's aspiration in this direction.</P>
    <P>I hope, therefore, that before proceeding <Col N="1063" /> further I have underlined sufficiently the significance of the word &ldquo;interdependence&rdquo; in the vocabulary of education and its equally important implications for the allocation of limited resources to the provision of education.  Clearly, the development of an educational system is influenced not only by the aspirations of the population and the needs of the economy for qualified personnel but also by financial considerations.  A modern educational system is extremely expensive, especially as far as vocational and higher education are concerned.  We cannot, however, much as we might like to, simply wish ourselves free of the constraints which finite resources impose upon us, however desirable our objectives.  This is an inescapable fact of life.  Deputy Wilson spoke of change to bring us into line with the realities but the realities from behind the desk at which I sit are stark and unavoidable.  Deputy Wilson can call for increases in the investment in education&mdash;very desirable increases and very desirable objectives&mdash;but he cannot call for huge sums to be invested in any one project, especially in education.</P>
    <P>I should like to remind the House that of the £1,600 million in the Book of Estimates this year more than £300 million will go towards education. That is the real mark of the Government's and the community's willingness to help education and an indication of the willingness of the community to supply that amount of money in taxes for it.  There are limits to the increases in expenditure on higher education which may be tolerable, limits which are determined by the country's level of economic development.  The amount of money which can be supplied can only be increased by greater growth in the economy generally.</P>
    <P>In the money voted for the Department of Education higher education must compete for resources with many other things, both inside and outside education.  It is the task of the Government to balance the needs of the various sections of the community.  It is my job to balance the demands of <Col N="1064" /> those sections.  We can give to third level education, but only at the expense of secondary and primary.  That is the interdependence I spoke of earlier. Many people would argue that those who go on to higher education, whether they are from the categories listed as not being poor men by Deputy Wilson, or those whose parents can afford to pay the full fees for their education at third level, benefit from State assistance.</P>
    <P>The fees paid even by that wealthy segment of this society, or the segment that would be termed well-fed, is not the full cost of third level education. It represents about one-fifth of the cost.  The State pays a further four-fifths for all categories and as regards those in the list supplied by Deputy Wilson, the amount of money provided there has grown tenfold in the past ten years and the number of people benefiting by it has grown five-fold. These would still be considered by those who fail academically to qualify for a place in the university, as the lucky segment of society.  I do not wish to be taken as saying that we should not, therefore, increase the level of or amount of grants available nor increase the eligibility level of parents so that they are entitled to grants.  I think we shall have to do that but we cannot do it on the basis of plucking the figures out of the air or because we feel that the income levels should be raised or that grants should be increased.  We must do it on some quasi-scientific basis&mdash;it may be no more than that&mdash;but we must do it on the basis of the experience of the county councils and corporations that have been administering the scheme for over ten years now.</P>
    <P>It was for that purpose that my predecessor asked them to supply figures and facts so that he might either continue the present scheme or introduce a new scheme depending on what they produced.  The facts are now with my Department and will be assembled and brought to me with possible policy options as regards continuing the current scheme or introducing a new one for the academic year 1977-78.  It is on that basis that we shall move forward.  I do not <Col N="1065" /> understand why, at this twilight stage after the Minister's announcement in September, and before the results are available, this motion was put down for debate when it was known to the Opposition that the facts on which a proper debate could be held were not available either to them or to me until this study is completed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that the Minister is new to this Department. This is the first opportunity I have had of wishing him good luck in his onerous task.  Having said that, I do not think anyone listening to what the Minister said could be under any impression other than that he had not yet had time to get a grasp of his new Department.  I can understand that, but it is only fair to point out to him, when he chastises our party for putting down this motion on the grounds of its timing, that the Dublin Corporation through the cultural committee and then through the city council unanimously passed a resolution calling on the Minister for Education&mdash; the Minister's predecessor&mdash;to increase eligibility limits for grants for higher education.  At the time when I was chairman of the cultural committee a deputation was selected and we requested a meeting with the Minister. That was not last year but in the previous year and the Minister should have on the records the request we made to discuss this matter with the then Minister.  The then Minister refused to meet the deputation from Dublin Corporation.  Deputy O'Brien, I note, is absent now possibly because I reminded him that he was one of the people who also supported the call to the Minister for Education to discuss this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The facts are, and they cannot be denied, that the figures for eligibility which were last fixed in 1972 still exist.  In speaking on the budget as reported in Volume 296 of the Official Report on 27th January, 1977.  I referred to the fact that Dublin Corporation had prepared some figures to show how the limits allowed today should be increased to allow for inflation.  Their figures were worked out for 31st March last.  The figure of £1,600 was the lowest level which was fixed in 1972 and at the end of <Col N="1066" /> March it should have been £2,770 to keep in line with inflation.  Allowing for about 18 per cent inflation since then the figure should be over £3,000. Without going through all these figures I may start with the maximum and take parents with ten children, which was the maximum number under the scheme.  In 1972 the limit was £3,490.  At the end of March, 1976, that figure should have been £5,766.  Allowing for inflation since, that figure should be nearer £7,000 today.  So, many people who have the necessary marks in their leaving certificate have been denied the higher education to which they were entitled.</P>
    <P>Generally, I believe that correspondents on education are probably the most objective journalists writing in our papers.  I do not say that for the sake of plamás.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Minister agrees.  I have been critical of other correspondents but these correspondents, I think, would agree that&mdash;if I may use the word ideology &mdash;the Fianna Fáil ideology in regard to education is far wider in our commitment to education for the people than that of the Minister's own party, unfortunately.  We used to think the Labour Party had a greater commitment to education than the Fine Gael Party, but the Labour Party have disappeared from the scene and merged with the Fine Gael Party.  I am saying sincerely what I believe and that is that they do not attach the same importance to education as Fianna Fáil.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>We can be judged on our record in education.  Today, because of inflation, figures can be thrown out; they do not mean anything any more.  When I speak about opportunities for education I am concerned with individuals, young people who show promise, who have the intellectual capacity to partake in an academic career.  I see some of these people being deprived.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1067" /> I would like to give an example of what I mean when I talk about the importance we as a Government attached to education.  In 1972, before we left office, a young girl came to me because she could not qualify under the £1,600 eligibility limit as her father was earning £1,900 in England and he had to support himself there. When I took this up with Dublin Corporation they said there was nothing they could do and that I should contact the Department of Education.  I spoke to the then Minister, Deputy Faulkner, and he said consideration should be taken of the fact that if a father is working in England he has to maintain himself.  He said that since the entire grant was paid by the corporation, as far as he was concerned he would authorise that the scholarship grant should be given, and it was.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>That is humanity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>Where scholarships are concerned the Minister has a great deal of power.  He can authorise them It is not a statutory situation over which he has not control.  Obviously he has some control if a Fianna Fáil Minister could do that.  It is not plamás when I say he has humanity. When cases like this come before him I hope he will give them the same consideration.</P>
      <P>I also believe that when we renew our request to see him at some time in the future to discuss the situation and let him know the problems we are faced with in Dublin, he will have the courtesy to meet us.  We know the demands made on him for deputations. We are not unreasonable.  We do not bring along 45 councillors.  We select five, six, seven or perhaps even ten, because there is always a tremendous interest in education.  We believe the Minister will at least listen to the case we present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department are aware that very few people qualify because due to inflation, and under existing eligibility limits they are not able to avail of the grants. That is why I implore the Minister as a matter of urgency to try to bring the eligibility limits in line with inflation. There are many other aspects with <Col N="1068" /> which other people will deal.  From May, 1968, to May, 1976, inflation was 136 per cent.  One must consider how much grants were worth in 1968 and by how much they have increased. We all know demands on education are vast and we know the difficulties facing the Minister&mdash;building and extending schools&mdash;but the Government have an obligation to feed the people, put roofs over their heads and educate them.</P>
    <P>Education is very important.  I can remember when it was the poor relation. Under the late Donncadh O'Malley it became recognised as a most important subject.  If we cannot employ our own people we should not adopt a dog in the manger attitude by saying &ldquo;We are not going to educate them either&rdquo;.  If we educate them for export they will be able to make a good living in another land where they will be welcomed and someday they will come back when our economy improves.</P>
    <P>Anyone who has the capacity to avail of an academic education should not be denied it.  The Minister should be much more aggressive at Cabinet level than his predecessor and demand that his Estimate will not be cut back. It is easy for the Minister for Finance to give increased amounts for grants if they are not availed of because, allowing for inflation, these people will be outside the eligibility limits.  This is a very subtle way of denying people their due.</P>
    <P>I am not as optimistic as my colleague when he states that, if this is put to a vote tomorrow and the Minister does not accept this motion, members of his party will support this motion even though quite a number of them and members of the Labour Party voted for increased grants at the Dublin Corporation meetings.  It is this type of hypocrisy which tends to bring public representation into disrepute.  In Dublin Corporation they vote one way but in the Dáil, where it really counts and something can be done, they vote the opposite way.  I would sooner they got up and argued their case at local level and said it cannot be done.  They should be consistent.</P>
    <P>I have made the best case I can. <Col N="1069" /> This is not the first time I have brought up in this House the need to increase these limits.  The Minister must increase them.  He said a report was coming out but everyone knows we are in an election year.  The promises we get now&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The increase of £50 on the £300 grant for those living in digs in the university area is paltry compared to the amount granted at the time the figure was originally raised to £300, which was in 1968.  It does not matter when it was increased.  We know it was increased&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Taking it from that time, the figure is not in keeping with inflation when you allow 20 per cent for last year and 20 per cent for the previous year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some time ago Deputy Fergus O'Brien and I spoke at UCD.  I pointed out to the Historical Society that the University at Belfield was a monument to Fianna Fáil and that we had to ask ourselves if the university could be maintained let alone consider building another university like it for many years to come.  Great problems beset us in relation to higher education.  I appreciate the difficulty that the officials of the Department have in trying to meet the thousands of demands made upon that Department.  The headline in one of this evening's papers is &ldquo;Cash Crisis in Schools&rdquo;.  We know this is true and the Minister must now fight his corner to get extra funds.  I know from close contact with people in my constituency, which is an 80 per cent working-class constituency, that they do not begrudge paying taxes if their children are being educated.  I know this is true because I have attended many parent/teacher association meetings.  From deputations they have met, the officials and the Minister <Col N="1070" /> know that people have a sense of sacrifice in relation to the education of their children.  The painful part is to educate them and then to see them having to emigrate through lack of job opportunities.</P>
    <P>In the school in Terenure East, where I hope the Minister will shortly meet a deputation, quite a number of children have been turned away because there is no room for them.  If there is no room for them in that school, where are they to go?  There is a crisis in education which requires tough action by the Minister.  The sooner the election takes place, the sooner we can get back in, restore confidence and inject money into education.</P>

      <P>We have a very inhuman Minister for Finance who needs shaking to empty his pockets. The Minister would need to be determined to fight his corner at Cabinet meetings for extra money.  Other Departments without such a backlog can get money.  When people do not get the opportunities to which they are entitled, the seeds of discontent are sown.  We must recognise that, after food and shelter, education is the next important need.  I know that the Minister will exert himself in his new Office and I wish him luck in doing so.</P>

      <P>We all share Deputy Briscoe's concern about education. This motion has been badly timed and the arguments have been badly put. The number of grant holders and the money spent on third level education has increased substantially since the Opposition were in power.  There are a number of valid points to be made in respect of higher education and I am surprised that the Opposition spokesman failed to make them.  I will make them for him.</P>

      <P>I can assure the Minister that I am on his side.  We widened the scope of third level grants to include regional and technical colleges in 1974.  This was an important move.  Far too much emphasis is placed on university education.  We should be more involved in developing courses in regional and technical colleges. The Government are financing these colleges; indeed, the regional college in Waterford has doubled its capacity <Col N="1072" /> in the current year.  I am delighted that the higher education grants have become available to those who are doing equivalent courses in the regional and technical colleges.  I look forward to a widening of the scope of grants in relation to third level education and an intake of new courses which will become eligible for grants in the not too distant future.</P>

      <P>Unemployment benefit was paid to the person concerned at the maximum rates applicable to a married man with a wife and four dependent children up to and including 24th November, 1976.  A deciding officer then disallowed his claim for a period of six weeks with effect from 25th November, 1976, on the statutory ground that he had failed or neglected to avail himself of a reasonable opportunity of obtaining suitable employment or alternatively that he had refused an offer of suitable employment.  He has appealed against the deciding officer's decision and arrangements are being made for an oral hearing of his case before an appeals officer.  He will be notified shortly of the place, date and time of the hearing at which it will be open to him to attend and give evidence on his own behalf.</P>

      <P>In order to be entitled to unemployment benefit on her claim of 24th November, 1976, the person concerned would require to have at least 26 employment contributions paid or credited in respect of the 1974-75 contribution year.

      <P>(a) £60 million revenue buoyancy: Estimates of revenue are calculated by reference to the level of economic activity associated with a particular profile of public expenditure and taxation and having regard to appropriate assumptions about trends in the economy generally.  The revenue estimate for 1977 contained in the White Paper on Receipts and Expenditure was related to the pre-budget profile of public expenditure and taxation and their implications for trends in the main macro-economic aggregates during 1977.  On the basis of past experience and using standard econometric techniques, estimates were then made of the impact in 1977 of the measures announced in the budget on economic activity in general and on public revenue in particular.  From these calculations, it was estimated that the additional revenue buoyancy generated by the budgetary measures in 1977 would be about £60 million.</P>
      <P>(b) £35 million tax on farm incomes: The estimate of £35 million yield from taxation of farming incomes was computed by reference to the proposed amended provisions for assessment and payment of tax on farming incomes in 1977 as outlined in my financial statement, and to the assumption that the following numbers of persons will be assessible accordingly:</P>

    <P>(c) and (d) Inflation from April, 1976 to April, 1977, and rate of inflation for year 1977: The rate of inflation is normally regarded as being represented by the rate of increase in consumer prices or, in other words, the rate of increase in the deflator of personal consumer expenditure.  Changes in this deflator are determined by changes in the prices of primary inputs into consumption, chiefly wages and salaries, farmers' incomes, profits and import prices.  The weighting of each of these primary inputs is given by the Input-Output Tables for 1969, which are the latest available.  These weightings, taken in conjunction with assumptions about the likely developments in the prices of primary inputs can be used to forecast the rate of increase in consumer prices in 1977.</P>
    <P>As the data from which the consumer price index is compiled are not collected during the month of April, it is not possible accurately to estimate the increase in consumer prices over any 12-month period ending in April. A fairly reliable estimate can, however, be calculated by reference to the increases which occur in the 12-month periods ending in mid-February and mid-May.</P>
    <P>For the purposes of forecasting the rise in consumer prices in the period April, 1976&mdash;April, 1977, estimates of the likely increase in prices between mid-November, 1976 and mid-May, 1977, were prepared on the basis of trends to mid-November, 1976, and in the context of the expected rise in prices in 1977 as a whole.</P>

      <P>For the purpose of this reply I regard as companies in negotiation with the Industrial Development Authority those whose executives had visited this country and discussed specific proposals with the authority.  I am informed that at the end of September, 1976, there were 71 such US companies.  In addition, many other US companies were at earlier stages of inquiry or discussion with the authority's overseas offices.</P>
      <P>I am informed that six of these companies have since notified the authority that they do not intend to proceed with the projects under discussion. The authority will maintain contact with these firms in an effort to receive the projects which were under negotiation or obtain alternative industrial proposals from them.</P>
      <P>Three of these companies ceased negotiations in October, 1976, and the others in November, 1976, January, 1977, and February, 1977, respectively.</P>

It must be appreciated that the only possible way in which the flow of work in an office the size of the Land Registry can and ought to be managed is on the basis that applications are dealt with in order of receipt, subject to the qualification, that where it is shown that hardship will result from delay, special efforts will be made to deal with the case as early as possible.
