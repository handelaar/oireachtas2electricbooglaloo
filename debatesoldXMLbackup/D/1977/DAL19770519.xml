      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Cooney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The sole purpose of this short Bill is to extend for a further period the provisions of section 2 of the Prisons Act, 1972, which provides for the transfer of prisoners from the civil prisons to military custody.  When I sought the first extension of the Prisons Act, 1972, three years ago, I stated that the main reason for seeking it was to permit the continued separation from the civil prison system of prisoners who promoted or actively engaged in seriously <Col N="1175" /> disruptive activities.  It is still necessary to separate a small number of prisoners from the civil prison system if relative peace and calm is to be maintained in the civil prisons and so enable rehabilitative work to proceed without hindrance.</P>
    <P>Three years ago I stated that this problem could be solved by building a special high security prison unit capable of housing up to 30 high risk prisoners.  Preliminary planning work had started on this unit and it was intended to build it in the Portlaoise prison complex.  For security reasons it has been found impossible to commence the work.  Portlaoise prison has since then accommodated the main groups of subversive prisoners and they have amply demonstrated in the intervening period that they will use every means, including violence and intimidation of security personnel, to undermine security at the prison and escape if possible.</P>
    <P>In August, 1974, the prisoners used explosives recklessly to breach the perimeter security, and 19 of their number escaped.  In December, 1974, they took hostage a number of prison officers and proceeded to wreck fixtures and fittings in the prison.  In March, 1975, explosives were again used by the prisoners to blow their way out of the recreation hall and yard.  This escape attempt was co-ordinated with an attack on the prison from outside during which a heavily armoured truck was used to attempt to smash a way through to the prison.  During the firing which occurred a prisoner lost his life.  In July, 1976, an attempt was made to burn down the prison by setting fire to bedding and cell furniture.  There have been numerous other incidents in the prison, with persistent defiance of the prison authorities, culminating in a hunger strike.  In this situation it was quite impossible to contemplate starting major construction work in the prison with all the hazards this would entail for the security of the prison. Apart from the presence of building material, equipment and machinery, and the movement in and out of building material, there was the very real danger of workmen being intimidated.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1176" /> As a matter of fact, the site for the special unit has had to be given over temporarily to accommodate military personnel stationed in the prison.  The House will agree, I am sure, that if the security situation requires the continuous presence of substantial number of soldiers, reasonable accommodation must be provided for them.  The only available suitable site for that purpose was the one proposed for the special unit.  There is no other suitable location in the civil prison system for this special unit.  None of the existing buildings would suit.</P>
    <P>Mountjoy prison remains the largest prison.  It accommodates about 400 prisoners and is the main committal prison.  Mountjoy is an old prison and requires extensive reconstruction and development to meet present day needs. The work of reconstruction has been proceeding steadily.  A new plant house has been built outside the prison walls and this is intended to serve the power needs of the whole North Circular Road complex.  Fully modern staff quarters have been built just outside the prison wall and these will be opened in a short time.  Space for development is at a premium in the grounds and there is no possibility of providing a site there for a high security unit.  Allocating a section or wing of the existing prison for this purpose would not be an acceptable solution.</P>
    <P>The new training unit, which is of course completely separate from Mountjoy Prison, both physically and administratively, is now in operation and some specialist industrial training for prisoners has commenced.  The rate of activity will increase gradually and by the end of this year I expect that it will be fully operational.  It has accommodation for 96 prisoners in what I would describe as a very open setting inside the perimeter walls.</P>
    <P>Limerick prison is the committal prison for the south-west.  It accommodates some 100 male prisoners and, in a separate section, some ten female prisoners.  It is also a very old building which will require extensive reconstruction and renovation to meet present day needs.  There is little space available in it for new development, <Col N="1177" /> but what there is available is needed for ordinary rehabilitative facilities for prisoners.  An old administration block in now being renovated to provide educational class-rooms and there are plans to build a prefabricated structure on another site for workshops.  A small site has been acquired at the rear of the prison for further development of work training/educational facilities.</P>
    <P>The reconstruction of Cork prison is proceeding.  It has not been possible, because of the pressure on prison accommodation generally, to vacate the prison and so allow the reconstruction work to proceed without hindrance.  Some 40 prisoners are accommodated there at present and it may be up to two years yet before the work is fully completed.  There is no space available for the high security unit.</P>
    <P>Arbour Hill prison has been completely modernised and accommodates some 60 long-term prisoners.  Further development work is proceeding.  The staff quarters adjoining the prison are near completion and work will commence shortly on a new building which will augment the work/training and educational facilities for prisoners. Already a number of well-equipped workshops are in operation in the prison, including ones for printing, joinery and braille.  The braille unit is a particularly noteworthy development, the idea being to produce educational material for the unsighted, material which would not otherwise be available to them.</P>
    <P>I mentioned three years ago that I intended to allocate Arbour Hill prison to remand prisoners but after re-examining the matter I decided that it should be allocated instead to long-term prisoners who need a good standard of accommodation and good facilities to make their stay in prison tolerable.  Although there has to be a measure of security at Arbour Hill, it cannot for a number of reasons, including its location and layout, be regarded as a high security prison.</P>
    <P>Portlaoise prison is allocated entirely to prisoners who have been charged with or convicted of subversive type offences.  The population at present is fairly steady at about 150. As I have said already, there is no <Col N="1178" /> scope there for major development work for security reasons.  The remaining place of detention for male adult prisoners is Shelton Abbey, County Wicklow.  It accommodates 15 to 20 prisoners and this figure can be increased to some 40 as soon as work and educational facilities can be developed.</P>
    <P>Female prisoners are accommodated in both Mountjoy and Limerick prisons.  While it is likely that Limerick prison will have to continue to be used to accommodate female prisoners either charged with or convicted of subversive-type offences, because it is the only place where a reasonable degree of security can be provided for them, I am more than anxious to see the new prison proposed on the site at Kilbarrack started. The diversion of scarce resources to other areas, not least in providing the necessary degree of security at Portlaoise prison, has meant the postponment of this project.  The planning work is, however, proceeding and I hope it will be possible to start the building work fairly soon.</P>
    <P>There are three places of detention for male juveniles, that is, St. Patrick's Institution, which is a closed place of detention, and the two open centres at Shanganagh Castle and Loughhan House.  St. Patrick's Institution accommodates some 175 boys between the ages of 16 and 21.  It has a very good educational unit and recreational facilities are reasonably good.  Some work is about to commence to improve work facilities but I confess that I will not be satisfied with the provision for closed custody for juveniles until St. Patrick's can be replaced altogether with two entirely new places&mdash;one in Dublin and one in Cork.  When that happens, it will be possible to use St. Patrick's to take some prisoners from Mountjoy prison to ease the pressure of accommodation there and also to enable the reconstruction work there to proceed. In the long term the space at St. Patrick's is needed to provide extra rehabilitative facilities for prisoners in the North Circular Road complex. There is no space available there for a high security unit.  The layout and <Col N="1179" /> location of the site is not, in any event, suitable for that purpose.</P>
    <P>The two open centres are operating very satisfactorily, providing excellent accommodation and work/educational facilities for the 60 or so boys accommodated there.  With further development both these places will continue to play a key role in the rehabilitative programme for juvenile offenders.</P>
    <P>I should mention at this point that I have authorised the creation of a number of additional welfare officer posts for the purpose of enabling a substantial proportion of juveniles serving sentences in St. Patrick's to be released into the community under intensive supervision.  The scheme will commence as soon as the necessary staff have been recruited.  I look forward to the results of this unique departure in the rehabilitative field.</P>
    <P>The improvements in rehabilitative facilities for prisoners are, as I said at the beginning, proceeding rapidly. They cannot be continued unless there is reasonable peace and calm in the prisons.  Those small number of prisoners who are disruptive cannot be allowed to stand in the way of improvements for all prisoners and they must continue to be separated out of the ordinary prisoners.  The long-term solution to the problem is to build a highly secure prison unit for them but at the moment this is not possible. There is no alternative, therefore, but to continue to hold them in military custody in the military detention barracks, Curragh Training Camp.  The average number so accomodated in the past three years has been around 30 and this is the number for which the accommodation continues to be needed.  I am asking that the provision for military custody should continue for another three years in the hope that it will be possible in that time to find a long-term alternative to it.</P>
    <P>A further reason for maintaining military custody has emerged in the last year or so, and this is the need to transfer subversive type prisoners who need hospital treatment to the General Military Hospital, Curragh <Col N="1180" /> Camp.  Subversive type prisoners like those accommodated in Portlaoise prison are prepared, as I said before, to use every possible means to effect their escape, and their supporters and sympathisers are likewise prepared to take any steps to rescue them.  Of necessity, ordinary hospitals are places where it is very difficult to ensure safe custody.  The General Military Hospital has obvious advantages from this point of view and there is no alternative to continuing to use it for prisoners who require hospitalisation but who, at the same time, present serious security risks.</P>
    <P>As I have said before, military custody for civilian prisoners is not something which I like and if there were a reasonable alternative I would gladly accept it.  I should hasten to add, that my misgivings relate to the principle involved and nothing else. I know the military authorities do everything in their power to have conditions for the prisoners as humane as possible and as close as possible to those available in the ordinary prisons.</P>
    <P>At this point I would like to pay a special tribute to the Defence Forces and especially those in the Military Police Corps, who have done so remarkably well in coping with this difficult problem both in the detention barracks and the General Military Hospital.  I recognise that this work represents a great burden on them and it is to the credit of the Defence Forces that they have done it so well.</P>
    <P>To sum up, the Bill merely seeks to extend for a further limited period the temporary Prisons Act introduced by my predecessor.  The constraints which inspired the original Act are unfortunately still with us and I am sure all sides share my regret that this should be so.  I am sure too that all sides will join with me in expressing the hope that circumstances will so improve during the currency of this Bill that a further renewal in three years' time will be unnecessary.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>My party are not opposing this Bill.  I find it amusing that there is a three line Government Whip on the members of the Coalition today&mdash;which is unusual for a Thursday. <Col N="1181" /> This was quite unnecessary. There appears to be a bit of a flap on among the Coalition.  Perhaps they feel the old law and order flag must be waved and the drum kicked today because tomorrow is the gathering day of the Fine Gael jamboree which is to take place in the Mansion House at the weekend.  Good luck to them.</P>
      <P>Perhaps there was another reason for the three line Government Whip. It could be because, as Opposition spokesman for Justice, I was refused permission to visit the empty high security prison in the Curragh.  I cannot understand why I was refused permission and I will have something to say about this later.  I wanted to see the prison so that I would be better informed on the situation before this debate started.</P>
      <P>I note with regret that there was no mention by the Minister&mdash;and I am open to correction on this&mdash;of the very high security prison built in the Curragh which so far has not been used.  The Minister gave a good run down on prisons generally throughout the country.  I will go through them in detail later.  Is there reason why no mention was made of a high security prison?  I shall have much more to say about it later but I noted that there is little or no reference to the principle involved in this Bill of having civilian prisoners under military custody.  I had a question on the Order Paper for this week to the Minister for Justice in regard to this empty prison in the Curragh but the Minister thought best to hand the question over to his colleague, the Minister for Defence. Perhaps during Question Time this afternoon I may be able to get the information I seek.  If we are to have a proper and meaningful discussion, to which each can contribute as best he can on an important matter such as this, information should be given regarding the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My question, unfortunately, will not be reached today and one asks, with the political situation being as it is, if it will ever be reached.  It is No. 62 on the Order Paper seeking information as to when construction commenced on the new high security <Col N="1182" /> prison at the Curragh, County Kildare; when the work was completed; the cost of the project and when it will be used and whether it will be under civilian control&mdash;that is a very important question.</P>
    <P>I might refer briefly to yesterday's <i>Irish Press</i> where a spokesman for the Department of Defence explained or tried to give reasons why my request to visit the empty prison at the Curragh was refused.  He said that the Fianna Fáil Deputy's request came in connection with the Prisons Bill extension which comes before the Dáil this week. This Bill, the source goes on to say, is merely the extension of a temporary measure first introduced by the Fianna Fáil Government.  We have had this temporary measure for five years and now it is hoped to extend it for a further three years and it is still described as &ldquo;a temporary measure&rdquo;. The Bill, the source said, was first introduced by Fianna Fáil and sought permission to permit civilian prisoners to be held in military custody.  The rules permitting this are exactly the same as in the original Bill for detention in barracks. Under the circumstances it was not felt that the request to visit would serve any useful purpose or add in any significant way to the knowledge of the situation at present in the possession of the Opposition, said the Minister's statement.</P>
    <P>I incorrectly attributed this to a spokesman for the Department; I must correct that and say it was a Minister's statement.  Unfortunately, I shall not have the opportunity, nor does the parliamentary system allow me, to question the Minister for Defence on the matter but of course the information I am seeking in my question goes right to the bone of the whole situation.  If we have a new high security prison ready for business in the Curragh Military Camp at the cost of the taxpayers, why are we not using it?  If we were using it and if it were under civilian control; and if we were returning to that principle now that we have suitable accommodation for high risk prisoners, this establishment could be operated under civilian control and there would be no need for the Minister to come here today, <Col N="1183" /> practically five years to the day since the Bill was first introduced, seeking an extension of the powers.</P>
    <P>The Minister could have been more forthcoming in his introductory remarks and have given more information if he wants the debate to be meaningful, but if he just wants to get this extension to the 1972 Act rubber-stamped he is going the right way about it.  There is little or no information in his brief but, to be fair to him, his brief today, 19th May, 1977, is far more informative than was his brief on 23rd May, 1974, when he last sought in the House similar powers of extension of the 1972 Bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister is not &ldquo;coming clean&rdquo;, not giving the necessary information if the debate is to be of value.  He knows that this prison is completed; it is an expensive high security prison in the Curragh Camp.  He knows it is ready for business.  He may say it is not finished but what is an unfinished building?  Perhaps it is one from which one chair is missing or one where a light fitting is not properly fixed.  For all practical purposes, this building, seen by people over 12 months ago, was described by them as a building ready for occupation.  Perhaps the Minister is withholding deliberately this information because he still has not made up or has not been able to make up his mind on whether this prison should be under civilian or military authority.</P>
    <P>The grapevine has it that the military want nothing to do with this job and this is a view that is fairly common. This type of talk or rumour should be cleared up.  The Minister and the Government should say whose responsibility it will be to run this prison.  The military can rightly argue along the lines that members of the Fine Gael Front Bench argued when in Opposition that the military are not trained for this type of work, are not happy with it.  Certainly, because of their loyalty, they are prepared to undertake it when called upon.  Certainly, the loyalty of our armed forces was never in question and is not in question now.  They have always done what they were asked to do.  It appears they are now being forced to undertake <Col N="1184" /> the particular job of looking after this prison when they feel that this is within the scope of the civilian authority and they would far prefer to see it done that way.</P>
    <P>Maybe this is the reason.  Maybe it has not been sorted out between the Department of Justice and the Department of Defence but, whatever the reason, my belief is that this prison is ready for occupation but the Government and the Ministers concerned, the Minister for Justice and the Minister for Defence, have not been able to come to an agreement between themselves about who should run the prison.</P>
    <P>At this stage I should like to pay a special tribute to the members of the prison staff throughout the country for the service they are giving.  I should like to thank them very sincerely for their loyalty and devotion to duty in exceptionally difficult circumstances.  It is fair to say that as a nation we owe a deep debt of gratitude to them.  We must ensure that their integrity is protected at all times, particularly from attacks by those who would try to discredit them for subversive reasons. With this kind of protection for the prison staff in mind, after the recent hunger strike in Portlaoise I asked the Government through the Taoiseach to provide some method of inquiry into the many allegations made against them during the hunger strike.  I believed then, and I still believe, that the best method of protecting our prison staff is to expose these dangerous allegations for what they are and let the general public see them for what they are.  They can only do this when they have the full facts before them.  It was regrettable after the hunger strike that my request was not granted.  I believe it was just another foolish Government decision.</P>
    <P>At this stage I should like to pay tribute to the members of the Garda Síochána and the Defence Forces for the part they play in keeping our prisons in operation.  Our whole system would collapse overnight but for the loyalty and dedication of these people. I would remind the Government and the Minister of this fact and point out that many members of the Garda <Col N="1185" /> Síochána and the prison staff are not at all happy with the way their efforts are being appreciated, as is obvious from the lack of protection by the Government.</P>
    <P>It has been said frequently in this House in recent times that the morale of members of the forces, particularly the Garda Síochána, possibly is at one of its lowest states since our nation was established.  This is not just my opinion. It is the view of the Garda Síochána themselves and this is possibly a direct result of the mishandling of the situation by the Government and the shortsighted foolish economies being forced on the Garda Síochána.  Again, I wish to emphasise that this is the view of the force and any Member of this House who wants to find out what they are thinking can do so by talking to them and by reading their monthly magazine, the <i>Garda Review,</i> which has been strong in its condemnation of the Government and the Minister for a considerable time.  It is a sad reflection that these loyal, dedicated people, the members of the Garda Síochána, only this week at a meeting in the centre of Dublin came to a decision that they were being forced to go &ldquo;sick&rdquo; for a day because they cannot strike in order to voice their complaints in such a way that they will be heeded by the Minister and the Government.</P>
    <P>Many of the prison officers to whom I have spoken have assured me quite categorically that they would by far prefer an opportunity to clear their good name than have, and I quote, &ldquo;untrue allegations&rdquo; bandied about at frequent intervals by subversives and their fellow-travellers.  The prison officers I have met strongly reject and resent the attitude of the Minister for Justice, the Taoiseach and the Government in the way the Taoiseach in particular and the Minister for Justice immediately label anyone who speaks about civil rights or Government responsibilities to prisoners as a subversive or an associate of subversives. I asked for an inquiry into the situation in Portlaoise after the hunger strike was over.  No Minister for Justice and no Taoiseach in a Labour/ Fine Gael Government would dare label me a subversive.  Bishop Daly of <Col N="1186" /> Derry city asked for an inquiry after the hunger strike had finished and certainly no Minister for Justice and no Taoiseach would dare question the integrity of that fine man.</P>
    <P>I believe, and many share this view, that the kernel of the problem is clearly to be seen in that neither the Garda Síochána nor the prison staff are satisfied that the credibility of the Minister for Justice is such as to ensure that his denials are believed by the general public or are accepted by them.  I am satisfied that the Garda Siochana and the prison staff are satisfied that their own credibility is much higher with the general public than is the credibility of the Minister, the Taoiseach or the Government.  I accept the viewpoint of the gardai and the prison staff in this matter.</P>
    <P>The fact that we are discussing the Prisons Bill, 1977, is further proof, if that is needed, that the credibility of the Minister for Justice and the Government is open to question.  We have a Government Minister coming before the Dáil seeking renewal of a Bill which they in opposition venomously opposed for party political reasons when it was first introduced in 1972 by the then Minister, Deputy O'Malley.  The Official Report clearly shows the depths to which the then Opposition descended in abusing Deputy O'Malley personally.  He had to introduce the Bill after the wrecking of Mountjoy prison by the prison inmates on the night of Thursday, 18th May, 1972.</P>
    <P>As a result of the wrecking of Mountjoy prison it was necessary to seek permission of the Oireachtas to hold civilian prisoners in military custody.  If those prisoners could not have been detained in the Curragh they would have to be allowed go free because the situation then was that there was no guarantee whatever that they could be held securely.  Despite this, almost half of the Labour Party, who now hold the Fine Gael Party in Government, irrespective of the consequences, voted against the particular Bill.  We find that a number of those who voted against that Bill in a very short time were singled out for political favours by the Taoiseach, Deputy Cosgrave, who says that he <Col N="1187" /> puts the nation first.  If he does he certainly did not put it first the day he was handing out the political favours because he had to number among those who were honoured those who, despite the consequences, voted against the 1972 Bill when it came before the House.  I refer to one Member of the Labour Party whom he made Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy Keating, and Deputy Cluskey, who is Parliamentary Secretary to the Tánaiste, the deputy Prime Minister of the country.  I am precluded from mentioning you, so I will leave that out.</P>
    <P>It is very easy to see, when one reads the contributions of those who spoke on the Bill, the motivating forces behind each speaker.  One could say that it might perhaps have been out of deep conviction for the principle involved.  Surely, it should have been deep conviction when one remembers the consequences of their actions.  I hope that today we will see how deeply their convictions really are.  There were Members in 1972 of the then Opposition who grudgingly supported the Bill but absented themselves from the vote.  I refer in particular to the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, Dr. Cruise-O'Brien, who is on record as saying, if it matters to anybody at this stage, at column 118 of the Official Report for the 23rd May, 1972:</P>
    <P>Secondly, the case for the time limit is extremely strong.  I hope the Minister will tell us he accepts the principle of the time limit, that he does not ask us to give him a kind of blank cheque for an indefinite period to keep in force regulations which most of us here would regard as regrettable or undesirable.</P>
    <P>A few questions must now be asked, five years later, of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.  What of his concern for a time limit now?  Does he know of the extension of three further years being sought of regulations which he described as &ldquo;regrettable and undesirable&rdquo; I am sure the same Minister would have no difficulty in side-stepping his recorded remarks of the 23rd May, 1972, if he <Col N="1188" /> were present during the course of the debate.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice, Deputy Cooney, at column 85 of the Official Report for the 23rd May, 1972, on behalf of the Fine Gael Party, said he was prepared to assist the Government.</P>
    <P>. . . only on a strict time limit basis, on the understanding that this Bill will only last for so long as it takes Mountjoy to be restored . . .</P>
    <P>We must note that carefully, because that will come up time and time again. He said that they would support the Bill only until such time as Mountjoy was restored &ldquo;and be fully capable of receiving its full complement of prisoners&rdquo;.  This was the attitude of the Fine Gael Party at that time.  I cannot say the Opposition because at that particular time Deputy Cooney was the Opposition's spokesman on Justice for the Fine Gael Party and could not speak on behalf of the Labour Party.  I very much doubt if he can speak on behalf of them now in Government.</P>

      <P>With all fairness to the Minister, his party were so long waiting for it, they have got it and they will keep it for as long as they can, but it will be up for decision very shortly.  I know that the Minister's interjection was in good humour.  I want to say to him that, whatever the decision of the people is.  I will be the first man to honour it, respect it and work within the system.  I hope that I will be unlike the members of the Minister's party who during the course of this debate in 1972 proudly boasted that they had to be interned by the Government of the day for their activities. I would never do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the course of the debate the Fine Gael spokesman at the time, Deputy Cooney, went on record and said that to him the idea of military custody was something that causes apprehension to people living in a democracy and was something that should be kept at arms length.  Did <Col N="1189" /> the Minister mean what he said then? Was he really worried about the principle at that time?  If so, what is his concern for this principle now?  He only kept his principle under control because of the time limit that was put into the Bill by my colleague, Deputy O'Malley, that the Bill would be in operation for only two years and until such time as Mountjoy prison was able to take its full complement of prisoners. Mountjoy prison is more than ready to take its full complement of prisoners.  How that principle was paraded that night.  We had to listen to about 20 speakers from the Fine Gael and Labour Parties talking about principle.  How easy it is to forget principle when one has to resume responsibility.  How easy it is to be politically reckless in Opposition for political advantage, to talk of principle but to forget about it now and wish the words that were said were never said.  At column 87 of the Official Report of the 23rd May, 1972, Deputy Cooney is quoted as saying:</P>
    <P>We on this side of the House are not in favour of any move in the direction of military custody <i>per se.</i> I want further to emphasise that our support is conditional on the Government writing into this Bill a time limit for its operation.</P>
    <P>I probably will be accused by the Minister when he replies to this debate, of being selective in my quotations. I am not.  There is no need for one to be selective in this regard because one could speak on this Bill for ten hours if one were to use all the material that was provided for us by members of Fine Gael and Labour during the course of that memorable debate.  At this very early stage of this debate I want to make it clear that any accusation that may be made later to the effect that I have been selective in my use of quotations will not wear with me.  If I am wrong or if in any way I am doing the Minister an injustice in anything I say, he has officials beside him, who, no doubt, will be very quick to check out what I say and to bring it to the attention of the Minister.</P>
    <P>At the time to which I am referring the Minister went further and said that his party were not to be taken in any <Col N="1190" /> way as endorsing the idea of military custody, of regarding it as being something good in relation to civil prisoners or as being something that should be part of our normal law from then on. There was no qualification then in the attitude of the then Fine Gael spokesman on Justice.  He was definite in his view.  Indeed, I compliment him in that he was the one who set the tone of the debate that followed so far as his party were concerned.  His line of, presumably, deep conviction and deep commitment to the principle involved was taken up at a later stage by Deputy Clinton, now Minister for Agriculture, who said that the emergency legislation should not have been necessary.  This was at a time when Mountjoy prison had been absolutely wrecked.  As reported at column 99 of the Official Report for 23rd May, 1972, Deputy Clinton said:</P>
    <P>. . .  I am sure that every Deputy would like to rest assured that this situation would arise only in crisis circumstances and that it would exist only for the shortest possible time that would be necessary to meet such a situation.</P>
    <P>He was pressing for a time limit, a condition that had been propounded by his spokesman on Justice.  The Minister for Agriculture went on to say that these duties are not the duties of the Army and that we would not wish to be seen to have a situation here that could be compared with the situation, say, in Greece.  Unfortunately, we are not likely to hear the Minister for Agriculture today.  We should like to hear now about his deep conviction and his commitment to principle. Where does he stand now with regard to military custody for civilian prisoners?</P>
    <P>However, he must be excused and his contribution of that time written off as an effort at political tight-rope walking or, to use a phrase that I might borrow from the learned Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach, Deputy Clinton must be regarded as being guilty of political trick-o'-the-loopery. The Minister for Agriculture, too, was very glad to find in the Act the provision whereby normal visiting was catered for and he expressed the <Col N="1191" /> hope that this provision would be honoured scrupulously.  What a little sick joke that is today.  In the so-called interest of democracy and <i>per</i> the present Minister for Defence I was refused permission to visit an empty prison.  It is regrettable that the high principles of the Minister for Agriculture with regard to visiting prisons and with regard to how these institutions should be run, do not rub off in some way on his colleague the new Minister for Defence.</P>
    <P>During the course of his contribution to the 1972 debate Deputy Clinton, with profound dismay, could not understand how it would take as long as 12 months to repair Mountjoy prison.  He remarked to the then Minister for Justice, Deputy O'Malley, that it was nonsense to suggest such a long term for repair work and he proceeded to tell Parliament how quickly the prison could be repaired.  One might be forgiven for saying now that the Minister for Agriculture has apparently been unheeded by the Minister for Justice in that regard.</P>
    <P>Again, during the course of that debate, Deputy Cooney's firm and clear lead on the question of a time restriction on the legislation was taken up by another Deputy who, also, is a Minister in the present Government. I refer to the Minister for Education who, at column 126 of the Official Report for 23rd May that year said:</P>
    <P>We are supporting the Bill until Mountjoy is ready.</P>
    <P>I cannot be accused of selectivity in regard to that quotation because, to the best of my knowledge, it was the only utterance to emanate from Deputy Barry during the course of the entire debate.  Later on one finds that the present Minister for Foreign Affairs said that it would not take 12 months to repair Mountjoy if the Government were serious about it and, still later, as he beat his very large political white breast; he protested at the introduction of what he termed repressive legislation.  I think I am being very fair when I say that this Minister, as is usual for him, tried to walk on both sides of the fence in his contribution but failed.  Nevertheless, <Col N="1192" /> he followed the party line as set down by the man who is now Minister for Justice.</P>
    <P>It is somewhat ironic that the Minister for Foreign Affairs scoffed and jeered at the idea of it possibly taking longer than 12 months to repair the prison.  From his assumption in this regard&mdash;he has been proved wrong &mdash;he tried to read every motive possible, devious and otherwise, into the contributions of the then Minister for Justice.  I regard myself as having the right to say that Deputy FitzGerald's contribution then can be seen clearly for what it was&mdash;an exercise in political humbug and insincerity.</P>
    <P>Let us turn now to the final Minister in the Fine Gael part of the Coalition to whom I wish to refer.  He is the newest Minister and the one who, with the exception, perhaps, of the Minister for Fisheries, is the greatest embarrassment to the Government.  I refer to the Minister for Defence who, at column 336 of the Official Report for 24th May, 1972 said:</P>
    <P>I have a very serious objection to prisoners of any kind being under the supervision of the military authorities.</P>
    <P>I have already expressed that view today.  It would be a considerable easement if the general public could be reassured on this point.  Every Member of this House advocates the maintenance of law and order and, if laws are broken, we all agree that there must be a place of detention for law-breakers.  My argument is that that place of detention should be under civil authority and under civil supervision, not the military authority and military supervision.  If the Minister will ensure that prisoners are supervised and catered for by the civil prison personnel that will go a long way towards alleviating public unease.</P>
    <P>He went on to say:</P>
    <P>There is a feeling that this is the thin end of the wedge to the opening of internment camps.  It is not the responsibility of the military to be in charge of prisoners.  The Minister should really take another look at this.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1193" /> That was an interesting contribution from the then Deputy Flanagan who now finds that he is the person in charge of the operation which he publicly said should not happen, an operation which he detested.  We have that Minister forgetting his principle. Perhaps the seal of office had something to do with that, but certainly principle is forgotten now.</P>
    <P>Before I finish commenting on the Fine Gael contributions at that time I want to say quite categorically that Deputy Cooney's efforts clearly show that in terms of principle he too was in opposition to the measure.  I suppose, as with the others I have mentioned, that the principles involved then for Ministers Cooney, Clinton, Barry, FitzGerald and Flanagan are probably now best forgotten and pushed quietly aside.  I would like to describe their attitude in two words and leave it at that; political chicanery, or I might say political humbug.</P>
    <P>I now turn to the pearls of wisdom thrown by the Tánaiste, Deputy Corish, and some members of his Labour Party.  On 23rd May, 1972, Deputy Corish spoke as one wrestling with his so-called political conscience, and I quote him as reported in Volume 261, column 90 of the Official Report:</P>
    <P>If there is a specific situation because of a specific activity no one could take exception to the introduction here of specific measures to deal with that situation, say in the form of a temporary provisions Bill. But this is not a temporary provision Bill.</P>
    <P>How right he is.  It is not a temporary provisions Bill, and he is second in command of this Labour/Fine Gael Government.  He went on to say:</P>
    <P>It will now go on our Statute Book as a permanent Act and much more dangerous, in the form of a generalised Bill which can be invoked at any time it is deemed necessary to invoke it by any Government now or in the future.  The Bill can be invoked without any reference whatsoever to the rioting in Mountjoy and the destruction there on the night of 18-19 May, 1972.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1194" /> Remember that it was the riotings on the nights I have just mentioned and the destruction of the prison which gave rise to the Bill and made it vital that that Bill be introduced and enacted then.  Deputy Corish went on to say farther down in the same column:</P>
    <P>One of the issues&mdash;and it is serious as far as the individual members of my Party are concerned&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>That was spelling it out.</P>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;is the taking of people out of civil custody and transferring them to military custody.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corish was much more correct in his prediction than many would have believed.  He is quite a forceful character when he wants to be and he wanted to be on this day for political reasons in his own party. At column 91 of the same volume he said that he would support the Bill only if it was a temporary one and he went so far as to promise an amendment to that effect.  Amendments were accepted by Deputy O'Malley.  A time restriction was incorporated in the Bill, but today, five years later, I ask Deputy Corish if he feels now as he did when he was in Opposition?</P>
    <P>How does he feel with regard to his contribution at that time?  His objections were against the method by which civil law is transferred to military control.  He even went so far as to say that military custody had an ominous ring.  He said there was a suggestion of martial law and that in his opinion military custody could only provoke trouble and that he did not want to see trouble provoked. That I accept.  He said that if people could be transferred to military custody at the will of the Minister, to say the least of it, quite a number of people would be upset.  I am sure he was upset.  I would like to know if he was upset today because the measure which he wanted to see as a temporary measure has not turned out to be a temporary measure.  It is now five years old and with the Minister's help it will be an eight-year old before we next get a chance to talk about it.</P>
    <P>How would Deputy Corish react if he were here today to participate in <Col N="1195" /> this debate?  In fairness to him, he had difficulties at that time, extreme party political internal differences during the course of that debate. Nevertheless, the leader of a party has certain responsibilities and obligations and I believe that during that debate he could and should have given leadership to his party members, those members who refused to follow him in his line of reasoning or those who on the following day refused to go through the voting lobbies.  Deputy Corish, now Tánaiste, on that night realising and knowing that he had lost effective control over his party, during the course of his contribution to this debate set about doing his political Pontius Pilate act.  Once again he washed his hands of his followers' actions.  Of course he had an excuse. Why not?  The excuse then was that they did not have enough time to study what was in the Bill.</P>
    <P>I wonder whether they had enough time to study it in 1974.  I am sure they did not because the present Minister saw to it that they were not given time.  The Bill was circulated in the morning and taken that same day. Did Deputy Corish's followers for the Bill of 1977 have enough time to go through it to see what was in it and whether it was any different from the Bill which they rejected and a number of them voted against in 1972? Their efforts at that time were insincere efforts and must be described as efforts at political sidestepping and humbug.  Such obvious weakness on the part of a leader is something we could certainly do without.  Of course there were problems about asserting leadership and trying to keep the rebel mavericks in line to support the Bill. Let it be borne in mind the consequences if that Bill had not gone through at that time.  If prisoners could not have been kept in the Curragh, there was no other place they could have been kept.  Nevertheless, members of the Labour Party refused to follow their leader and voted against the Bill irrespective of the consequences. They now have been favourably rewarded by the man who &ldquo;puts the nation first&rdquo;, some of them <Col N="1196" /> with ministerial portfolios, some of them with Parliamentary Secretaryships, and others I am forbidden to mention because the office they hold is supposed to be above discussion.</P>
    <P>I would like to think that not only would the highly irresponsible and reckless action of these people be brought up and shown to them but that it be borne in mind that these are the type of people who now form the Government.  They would want us to forget that when it came to&mdash; forgive me for once again using the phrase&mdash;putting the nation first, they did not put the nation first but were well rewarded for their attitude.  I wish to quote what Deputy Cluskey, now Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Welfare, said at column 102, Volume 261, of the Official Report of 23rd May, 1972, and I am not being selective, because this is the kernal of his contribution at this time:</P>
    <P>This is possibly one of the most difficult decisions any Member of a democratic assembly has been asked to make for quite some time . . . the transfer from civil to military authority is a responsibility that lies very heavily upon us . . .</P>
    <P>Those are Deputy Cluskey's efforts at publicly wrestling with his conscience. The end result was that democracy was booted up the transom that day by Deputy Cluskey and by those who went through the lobbies with him voting against the Bill.  He was truly helped on that occasion by his colleague, Deputy Thornley and while I will not attempt to create the same theatrical atmosphere put into it, I quote what he said at column 137 of the same volume of the Official Report:</P>
    <P>To me, this measure is repugnant in every respect, except in the retention of trial by jury, and that in turn is modified by a continuous remand in the case of some of these men.  In every respect this measure is a cynical one which takes advantage of a temporary and slight difficulty in one particular prison to bring in here Draconian legislation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1197" /> It will be noted that Deputy Thornley described the wrecking of Mountjoy prison as a temporary and slight difficulty and no more than that.  He accused us of using this so-called temporary and slight difficulty for the purposes of introducing Draconian legislation, he having been assured at that time that we could not have put those highly dangerous and subversive prisoners anywhere but into custody in the Curragh.  Although Deputy Thornley, a man who helps to keep the Taoiseach in his office, described our efforts as Draconian but in 1974, when this Bill was being extended Deputy Thornley was not here nor was Deputy Corish of the Labour Party.</P>
    <P>The only person to offer during the course of that debate in May, 1974, a bare week before the existing legislation ran out, was the Minister for Justice himself, Deputy Cooney.  The men of conscience had disappeared. So much for Deputy Thornley and where he and his fellow-travellers were in 1974.  I suppose they are in the same place in 1977.  However, if there were a vote&mdash;and I have already said we are not opposing this Bill&mdash;I have no doubt whatever but that they would go through the &ldquo;Tá&rdquo; lobby, and the political neck is so great that they would not be ruffled.  The party renegades at the time, the men who were not prepared to accept the leadership of the Tánaiste, Deputy Brendan Corish, on this vital question&mdash;the Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy Keating, Deputy John O'Connell, Deputy Liam Kavanagh, Dr. John O'Donovan, who is no longer a member, Deputy Dan Spring, who I regret is not here, and the Ceann Comhairle, Deputy Seán Treacy&mdash; marched through that lobby and voted &ldquo;No&rdquo; irrespective of the consequences.</P>
    <P>In May, 1974, as I have already said, a matter of days before the expiration of the time limit for the provisions in the 1972 Bill, the Minister for Justice, Deputy Cooney, then with indecent haste and a certain amount of political sleight of hand and stealth, came before the Oireachtas with the Prisons Bill, 1974, a Bill which sought to extend the provisions of the previous Act for a further period of time, this time <Col N="1198" /> for three years, not two as was given to him by Deputy Desmond O'Malley. These were the people who wanted a time limit on it.  These are the people who were afraid, these were the people who said, through Deputy Oliver Flanagan, that it was the back door to internment and shouted and ranted and raved and disrupted this House until they got a two-year restriction in the original Bill from Deputy O'Malley, but now the Minister came before us to get an extension under the Prisons Act, 1972, the relevant section of which makes provision for the transfer of prisoners from civil to military custody and for related matters. At column 1848, Volume 260, of the Official Report for 15th May, 1974, the Minister for Justice, Deputy Cooney, said, and I ask you to watch for the first sidestep from his original position in 1972, and I am not quoting him out of context:</P>
    <P>We on this side of the House were reluctant to agree to the enactment of the 1972 Act,</P>
    <P>Whom was he talking about?  He was not reluctant to talk on behalf of the seven or eight Labour Members who set about torpedoing the Bill; he was not talking on behalf of his present Government colleagues because Deputy Keating had voted against the Bill and so had Deputy Cluskey.  Of course, it was a fair effort by the Minister to talk on behalf of all those who now make up the Coalition.  The Minister's statement begs the question of why Fine Gael at the time were reluctant to agree.  Are they not on record as saying they believed it to be the back door to internment?  Did they not at that stage say that there was no need for this further example of so-called repressive legislation?  That was Deputy Garret FitzGerald.  Did we not have Fine Gael Members of the House saying how they had been treated while in prison, and in so doing were they not admitting their own disregard for the institutions of this State?</P>
    <P>We must appreciate, therefore, that Fine Gael and Labour Deputies played politics in a most reckless fashion in 1972 by their approach to the debate on that Bill.  I will give <Col N="1199" /> credit where it is due.  The record clearly shows that the most responsible member of Fine Gael during the course of that debate was the then Deputy T.F. O'Higgins, now the Chief Justice.  At column 1848 of the Dáil Official Report for 21st May, 1974, Deputy Cooney is reported:</P>
    <P>In March, 1972 the prisons simply could not hold the prison population at the time&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>There was an admission in 1974 of the existence in 1972 of something which they vehemently and venomously denied in 1972.  He then continued:</P>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;and the only course open was to transfer some of them to military custody.</P>
    <P>In 1974 the Minister admitted that the only course open was to transfer some of the prisoners to military custody in 1972.  He went on:</P>
    <P>Those transferred were persons requiring a high degree of security or who promoted or actively engaged in seriously disruptive activities.</P>
    <P>There the Minister was admitting what was venomously and viciously denied in 1972 by members of the parties making up the present Government. What a big change of heart between 1972 and 1974.  How realistic, responsible an understanding they became in that short period.  If the prisoners in Mountjoy in 1972 could not have been kept in the Curragh, as was intended by Labour Deputies in 1972, were they to be set free?  Present Government Ministers like Deputies Clinton, FitzGerald, Flanagan, Barry and others scoffed and jeered and ridiculed Deputy O'Malley in 1972 when he said that Mountjoy could not be properly repaired within 12 months.  The present Minister for Justice said on 21st May, 1974, as reported at column 1848:</P>
    <P>The damage to Mountjoy Prison caused in the riot of May, 1972 was made good for the most part.</P>
    <P>Even in May, 1974 Deputy Cooney still could not say that the damage <Col N="1200" /> had been made good in all parts, because he continued:</P>
    <P>The repair work restored the prison substantially to its pre-riot condition.</P>
    <P>That was another qualification.  So much for the professional know-alls in 1972, the self-styled architects and clerks of works, Clinton, Fitzgerald and others, who abused Deputy O'Malley no end for saying the work could not be carried out within 12 months.  To save face in 1974 Deputy Cooney had to eat humble pie, but he was dishonest or less than honest when he told the House:</P>
    <P>However, a new factor emerged in the overall situation which makes it necessary to continue the present arrangement.  This is the emergence of well-organised disruption within our prisons and the consequent need for the careful segration or grouping of prisoners.  The problems involved in maintaining secure custody for the full range of our prison population has been conpounded since 1972 by the increased number of subversives in our prisons.</P>
    <P>In 1974 the Minister came here and tried to tell us that a new situation had begun to emerge and that disruptive elements were beginning to be felt in our prisons.  That is not true.  I believe the Minister was trying deliberately to mislead the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Denis Francis Jones">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should not use such terminology.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>If he was not trying to mislead the House then, he proved without doubt that he did not have the foggiest notion of the situation in 1972 within our prisons because if he had he would have known that disruptive elements within prisons did not emerge in 1974, they were in 1972 and before that time.  If the Minister had been responsible in his role as Justice spokesman for Fine Gael, instead of playing politics with our national security efforts he would have expressed understanding of the position in 1972. In 1972 he had been definite in his views that the Curragh detention barracks could have been taken over <Col N="1201" /> by the prison administration and operated as a civilian prison but in 1974 he made a further admission to the effect that he was wrong once again.</P>
      <P>I should like to quote a statement made by the Minister on 21st May. 1974, as reported at column 1849 of the Official Report.</P>
      <P>I was of the opinion in 1972 that the Curragh Detention Barracks could be taken over by the prison administration and operated as a civilian prison.  I am satisfied now that it could not.  Apart from the basic objection to having a civilian controlled enclave in the heart of a military complex, there are not adequate staff resources in the prison service to run the Curragh Military Detention Barracks and at the same time meet current and prospective commitments in the civil prisons.</P>
      <P>What has the Minister done since?  He has built a new high security prison within the Curragh Barracks.  What has he not done?  He has not recruited the civilian manpower needed by the prison authorities to man this prison. We are now left with the situation of an expensive high security prison with nobody to run it because the Minister deliberately did nothing about it for reasons best known to himself. This is the empty high security prison that I, as spokesman for my party, was refused permission to see this week.  I sought permission to do so so that I might be in a better position to talk more knowledgably on the important principle which they resurrected in 1972 of civilian administration in the prison or military administration in the prison.</P>
      <P>At a later stage in the course of that debate on 21st May, 1974, the Minister said:</P>
      <P>I should say, of course, that I would much prefer to be in a position to have facilities to house these prisoners in civil custody but the simple fact is that, as of now, there is still no suitable high security unit to keep these prisoners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us go a little further on to where he had a monumental announcement <Col N="1202" /> to make, the carrot for fear a carrot might be necessary for the Labour Party mavericks who refused to vote with him when he opposed the Bill in 1972.  Had it come to a vote in 1974 and had my party not been as responsible as they were at that time, had they for political reasons forced a vote, who knows what way the mavericks might have gone.  Certainly, only one of them could have been assured of because he was Ceann Comhairle and he could not vote.  The Minister went on to say:</P>
    <P>I have decided, in fact, that it is necessary to build a special unit to house prisoners of the type now in military custody.  This will be a high security unit capable of housing up to 30 high risk prisoners and will be located in the Portlaoise prison complex.</P>
    <P>That was more than a firm decision because the Minister went on to tell us that preliminary work had started; the operation was in progress.  Three years later the Minister told us he had another change of heart; he made another mistake.  He has now stopped; he is not going ahead with the project because he discovered he would not be able to go ahead with it.</P>
    <P>Surely, if the Minister had his ground work done before he came here three years ago and if he had listened to his advisers who would have known the position then, he would have been aware that his talk and promise of building a high security unit for 30 prisoners within the Portlaoise compound was nothing other than a carrot to hold out to Labour Party mavericks or renegades who were needed to go through the lobbies in the afternoon in the event of a vote being called.  In 1974 the Minister held out further carrots to Labour Party Members he was not sure would support him if a vote was called when he stated:</P>
    <P>. . . it will, however, take up to three years to complete this project and while it may be possible to dispense with military custody for civilians before then . . .</P>
    <P>However, instead of dispensing with <Col N="1203" /> the military custody within the three years we now have him back looking for a further three year extension. Where was the Labour Party when the Minister looked for that extension three years ago?  Where were the people with the consciences?  Where were the people with the fears in the Fine Gael Party?  Where were the people with the deep commitment and the unlimited high principle they kicked around this Parliament in a most disruptive fashion?  Where were the Labour Party mavericks?  I got no answer to those questions earlier and I am not likely to get one today. I suppose their principles were bought with State cars and other high trappings of office.</P>
    <P>If principles were involved in 1972 when a desperate situation existed&mdash; the Minister has since admitted that a desperate situation did exist in that year which made it necessary for the former Minister, Deputy O'Malley, to bring in legislation&mdash;for those who were wrestling with their consciences, where was the desperate situation that existed in 1974?  As the present Minister for Education, Deputy Peter Barry, pointed out, he was supporting the Bill until Mountjoy was ready. The Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Clinton said the same thing.  Deputy Fitzgerald had the same thing to say as had every other speaker from the Fine Gael Party.  Mountjoy was repaired by 1974 and there was space for the prisoners but the Minister by coming back here and saying he could not hold them securely is another important aspect of the whole thing. In spite of the desperate situation that existed in 1972 under Deputy O'Malley, in spite of the fact that the prison was wrecked that night no prisoners escaped.  Shortly afterwards it was open season, one could go in and out with a helicopter, one could do what one liked there.  They got out in droves.  While it was never proved by the Government, on the occasion that the helicopter went in there to bring the prisoners out was there a Special Branch man there to help the prison authorities?  If the type of security that the Government are known for is of <Col N="1204" /> the same level as that being given to the holding of our prisoners in custody is the same as the security being given to the ordinary people as they go about their business and try to protect their lives, their families and their property, then it is not a high security prison that is needed in Portlaoise or at the Curragh.  Unless we have the manpower to run our prisons they will not be looked after as effectively as they should be.</P>
    <P>This is important legislation.  My party are as committed now as they were in the past, and will be in the future, to ensuring that legislation for holding subversives in custody will be enacted here.  We will not force a situation here today that would embarrass the Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy Spring, Deputy Kavanagh, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health, Deputy Cluskey, and half the Labour Party by making them swallow their principles&mdash;if principles they were&mdash;by pushing them through the lobbies.  We will not play politics.</P>
    <P>An Opposition party have responsibilities at all times.  The recklessness for political purposes that was shown on the night of 23rd May in this House should never again be seen for any reason.  The irresponsibility shown that night will not be shown by my party. As I said, we are not opposing this Bill but we are criticising the attitudes and the efforts of the Minister and the Government.</P>

      <P>Deputy Collins spoke for 90 minutes and in all that time he did not offer one helpful suggestion. In his long diatribe he quoted practically every member of the parties constituting this Government. Not content with quoting members of this House, he also quoted the present Chief Justice.  He took the unprecedented step of criticising the present Ceann Comhairle.</P>

      <P>Nevertheless, he is now the Ceann Comhairle.  In all my years in this House I have never heard the man who occupied that position being criticised even for past <Col N="1205" /> actions.  Deputy Collins questioned the responsibility of the Minister for Justice when he was spokesman for the Opposition.  This Minister was more responsible then than the Deputy is now.  It must be remembered that Deputy Collins was a Minister for many years in a previous Government.</P>
      <P>He was good enough to admit that the Fine Gael Party when in Opposition were not responsible for what the Labour Party said then.  That is true, but nevertheless he was very critical of them.  It is well to remember that not alone could Fine Gael not be held responsible for what another political party said, but there were times when Fianna Fáil, even in Government, were not responsible for the actions of their own party members.  On occasion, they were not responsible for the actions of some of their Ministers.</P>
      <P>A former Fianna Fáil Minister stated on one occasion that he was proud to say that he, as a Cabinet Minister and with other Ministers, had met people from the North and that they were received sympathetically. Some of those people, he was proud to say, now form the nucleus of the Provos in the North.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I will try.  The Minister outlined the need for this Bill. He pointed out the different happenings in Portlaoise where it was intended at one time to have a high security prison.  He pointed out that in August, 1974, explosives were used and 19 prisoners escaped.  In December, 1974, prison officers were held as hostages and furniture and fittings were wrecked.  In March, 1975, explosives were again used.  Coinciding with the use of explosives from within, there was an attack on an armoured truck on the outside.  Unfortunately, this escapade led to the loss of life of one prisoner.  Again in 1976, an attempt was made to burn down the prison by setting fire to bedding and furniture. <Col N="1206" /> It would be impossible to go ahead with the construction of a high security prison in Porlaoise under prevailing conditions.</P>
      <P>I do not intend to refer to any prisons other than those in the Dublin area.  Mountjoy prison is very old and requires a great deal of reconstruction and development work to meet modern day requirements.  Work has started there and is proceeding steadily at the moment.  A new plant house was built outside the walls to provide power for the North Circular Road area.</P>
      <P>I want to refer now to the new training unit there.  I would advise any Deputy who has not visited this unit to see this very modern structure. Deputy Collins complained that he was not allowed visit an empty prison.  I do not know what he wanted to see there.  While he is in Dublin, he would be well advised to try to see this new training unit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">

      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>At the moment it accommodates 96 prisoners.  It is situated in what might be called a very open setting.  Arbour Hill has been completely modernised and is also well worth a visit.  If Deputy Moore has not seen it I would advise him to visit it at the earliest opportunity.  The staff quaters adjoining this prison are near completion and work is to begin soon on a training and education unit there with facilities for prisoners.  There are a number of workshops there already including a braille unit, a particularly noteworthy development, the idea being to produce educational material for the unsighted, material which would not otherwise be available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Close to Mountjoy is St. Patrick's Institution, a closed detention centre for boys aged from 16 to 21.  It has a very good educational and recreational unit.  Work will soon commence to improve facilities there.  The Minister has expressed the wish to see this establishment closed and replaced by two entirely new units as soon as possible, one in Dublin and one in Cork. <Col N="1207" /> Another welcome development is that the Minister has now authorised the creation of a number of additional welfare officer posts for the purpose of enabling a substantial proportion of juveniles serving sentences in St. Patrick's to be released into the community under intensive supervision. This scheme is due to commence shortly as soon as the necessary staff have been recruited and we all look forward to this experiment which is a unique departure in the rehabilitation field.</P>
    <P>Improvement in rehabilitation facilities for all prisoners is proceeding rapidly.  It cannot be continued unless there is peace and calm in prisons. Unfortunately, a small number of prisoners are disruptive and cannot be allowed to stand in the way of improvements for all prisoners.  They have to be separated from the ordinary prisoners.  Speaking as a member of the visiting committee of Mountjoy prison I should say that at the time the present Minister took office there were three public representatives on that committee.  All of them belonged to the one political party, Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="LukeBelton" hpid="Mr. L. Belton Mr. L. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>That may be the Fianna Fáil way of doing it.  I regard the Deputy as reasonably fair and I think he will agree that the present Minister's attitude was much fairer.  He put on three public representatives, one from each party, giving a broader approach.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know that. The visiting committee meets once a <Col N="1208" /> month and hears prisoners' complaints which in the main are frivolous.  Some of them are probably hatched out by prisoners who try to form themselves into a sort of prisoners' rights association. Invariably, when you get one such complaint you get four or five. These are complaints about such petty things as not having a proper selection of sweets available for purchase in the shop or not having a complete range of all brands of cigarettes.  They complain that things are not available which are not available in many city shops.  They have facilities to use transistor radios provided they are not of a type that can pick up Garda messages.  There are ample educational facilities.  In this connection I should like to praise the work of Dublin Corporation in providing a library service which is excellent and available for all prisoners who wish to use it.</P>
      <P>In addition to the monthly meeting, each member of the visiting committee is free to call to the prison at any time without prior notice.  Most of the committee avail of this facility. I have called on several occasions without prior notice.  We are accorded the facility of visiting any part of the prison and talking with any prisoner we wish to see and hearing any complaint he or she may have.  We are also free at any time to sample the food provided for prisoners.  If Deputy Moore would care to see the prison menu I shall show it to him.  It is excellent and would compare favourably with that in many of our better class hotels.</P>
      <P>I should like to pay a special compliment to the prison officers in Mountjoy who are coping very well with the situation there.  They are most attentive to prisoners' needs.  Prisoners who have made allegations of being denied this or that or being refused certain privileges are always questioned by prison officers on these points.  Invariably, we find the prisoners have no cause to complain about the behaviour of any of the prison officers.  They are doing an excellent job.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First class medical attention is provided with a doctor available at all times for any patient who my require <Col N="1209" /> him.  If the doctor deems it necessary a patient can be transferred across to the Mater Hospital.  Altogether there is no cause for any complaint regarding prison conditions in the Dublin area.  Different people have asked the Minister to allow them to visit other prisons but this is as a result of false information and inaccurate statements made by people not in a position to know the true conditions prevailing in those prisons.  As the Minister said last week, he has no doubt that when the true position is explained the people will realise who was right. They will soon realise that the Minister is perfectly correct in the attitude he is adopting.  He does not want to inflict any unnecessary punishment on anyone because he is not that kind of man.  He would be as glad as any of us&mdash;possibly more than most of us&mdash; if the day would arrive when it would be unnecessary to imprison people.</P>
    <P>In the City Hall there is the quotation &ldquo;Property or society has its duty as well as its rights&rdquo;.  Deputy Moore will correct me if I am wrong.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>It is roughly correct.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LukeBelton" hpid="Mr. L. Belton Mr. L. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Recently I read a letter in the <i>Evening Herald</i> but the writer had not the courage to sign it. He said that for a minor motoring offence he was strip-searched in Mountjoy on three or four occasions. He said he refused to pay the fine on principle and that may have been the problem.  As he did not sign his name to the letter, I think his statement can be questioned with regard to its accuracy.  In Limerick prison female subversive prisoners were given facilities to make tea but their gratitude for this privilege was to throw boiling water on members of the prison staff.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Collins spoke for a long time but he did not say anything other than give quotation after quotation.  He did not offer any constructive ideas. He said at the beginning and at the end of his speech that he was not opposing the measure.  I do not know his reason for speaking at such length and using so many quotations.  Could it be that coming events are casting their shadow?  The Deputy should <Col N="1210" /> know that there are no votes in the exercise in which he engaged.  I hope Deputy Moore will not delay the House for long and that the Minister will be granted a Second Reading of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>The attitude of Fianna Fáil to this Bill as enunciated by Deputy Collins in his fine contribution shows clearly the difference between a responsible party even in Opposition and the present Government. Deputy Collins said we are not opposing the Bill but quite rightly he took time to expose the hypocritical stance of the Government when they were in Opposition in 1972 when Deputy O'Malley as Minister introduced the Bill.</P>
      <P>Fianna Fáil will support the Bill and, as usual, they will be quite responsible in their attitude.  I think that the liberals who are now on the other side have a lot to answer for with regard to our prison population.  When Deputy O'Malley as Minister tried to introduce the Bill five years ago he was met with the usual hypocritical liberalism of the Labour Party and Fine Gael.  I wonder if these people ever examine their conscience and ask if by their attitude they are responsible for some of the unfortunate young people who are now incarcerated in our prisons?  I hold no brief for those who break the law.  I hold no brief for politicians who enunciate the liberal ethic when it suits them but whose actions may have encouraged young men to join subversive groups and are now languishing in prison as a result.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is time for those who voted against the Bill we introduced to examine their attitude to the whole question of prisons.  They should think of the task of the Fianna Fáil Government in 1972 when they had to introduce the Bill so that the prison system would not be broken down by people who sought to bring down the democratic state.  At any time if a group want to wreck a democracy they try to wreck the prison system thereby letting the lawbreakers see that there is no way of stopping them.  This nearly happened in 1972.  Had Members, including present Ministers of <Col N="1211" /> the Labour Party and Fine Gael, got their way the prison system would have been smashed and we would have chaos and anarchy in the country.</P>
    <P>In the last paragraph of the Minister's statement today he said:</P>
    <P>To sum up, the Bill merely seeks to extend for a further limited period the temporary Prisons Act introduced by my predecessor.</P>
    <P>That is a very simplistic statement. The Bill extends the previous Act and this debate gives us an opportunity of looking at our attitude to prisons, punishment and the kind of system we need if we are to succeed in the general hope that some day the prisons may be empty because there are no lawbreakers.</P>
    <P>I hope the people in the coming weeks will be given an opportunity of making known their attitude to the present Bill.  Will we see a further struggle by the Labour Party with their collective conscience and will the party win as usual?  I mention this because the latest move by the liberals in the Labour Party is an attempt to introduce a Bill abolishing completely the death penalty.  I realise this is not quite relevant to the Bill but I want to give notice that if I am a Member of the House and if the Bill comes before us, I shall question the sincerity of the Labour Party members.  When they say they want to abolish the death penalty, will they include abortion in the Bill?  Their attitude on this has been rather confusing.  I give them warning that this question will be asked so we will not have any more hypocritical equivocations on the meaning of a Bill relating to detention or punishment of prisoners.</P>
    <P>I can see the Minister's difficulties in relation to this Bill.  I appreciate the serious situation in the country.  We all hope that the reason why we have subversives in our prisons will end and that those young men will get some sense and decide that the only way to end our national ills is through the democratic process.  I do not know if they will ever heed my words.  I appeal to them to look at what has <Col N="1212" /> happened in the country during the past nine years.  There are many of those young people in prison now.  I have visited several prisons in the last few years.  I realise the dreadful punishment it is to send any person to prison.  I looked at some of those young men in Mountjoy prison and I wondered if any of them were influenced by the attitude in 1972 of Members of this House towards the Prisons Bill.  Were they encouraged by the word or deed of a politician on this Bill?  Is the plight of those young people on the conscience of some of us here, that by any word or deed we encouraged them in their deeds which eventually lead to apprehension and imprisonment?</P>
    <P>I believe the Minister tries to be as fair as possible.  I do not envy him his job.  I believe that he and other members of the Government created a kind of Frankenstein and now, in order to control it, they must extend the scope of the Bill which they opposed so vehemently five years ago.  This is not good enough.  If we bring the prison system into contempt and if the people lose faith in it we will not have a just, ordered or happy society.  There is no use in blaming the people in prison all the time.  The people in the House who so vehemently opposed Deputy O'Malley as Minister for Justice when he introduced the Bill have got to take some of the blame for the situation today.  The people will now see in the present Bill the vindication of Deputy O'Malley for what he had to do then and for which he was hounded so much.  Now we find the Minister saying:</P>
    <P>To sum up, the Bill merely seeks to extend for a further limited period the temporary Prisons Act introduced by my predecessor.</P>
    <P>The operative word there is &ldquo;merely&rdquo;. I do not believe the Minister expects to get away with that rather trite statement.  He must justify to this House the attitude of the leading Members of the Fine Gael and Labour Parties of the Government when they so vehemently opposed the Bill five years ago.  It did not stop with Members of the House.  I will wait for a <Col N="1213" /> while if the Deputies opposite do not want to listen.  It is not very good manners to turn one's back on the Chair.</P>

They may, because of their action in the House and their encouragement of the subversives five years ago, well be responsible for some of those young people acting in accordance with the capers of the then Opposition on this Bill.

      <P>One must speak generally on those things and commiserate with Deputy Desmond.  The absence of a Minister may well exemplify the guilt complex of the Government on this Bill.  There has been equivocation for the last five years and we have this strange happening this morning. Today, when our youth have little hope or prospect of employment, they will be subject to pressures by antidemocratic forces and maybe encouraged to join subversives.  If they read the Official Report they will find out the attitude of some members of the Government to prisons.  It may well be put down to the poacher turning gamekeeper.</P>
      <P>One cannot be flippant on this very serious measure.  I look forward to finding out whether anyone from the Government benches will absent himself from the House when the question is put on the final Stage of the Bill. The people opposite must find it very difficult not to oppose the Bill on this occasion having regard to the vehemence of their opposition to a similar measure of five years ago.  These remarks might very well be directed also to the various left-wing organisations in this city who, during the passage of the previous measure, picketed the homes of some members of Fianna Fáil and made various threats about what they would do in the event of the Fianna Fáil Government of the day going ahead with the legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1216" /> The change in the attitude of the Government side merely indicates further the state of confusion in which the Coalition find themselves.  They have confused many of our young people.  They should try now to make recompense to those people, many of whom find themselves behind bars today as a result of being misled by the so-called liberals.  There were many in Fine Gael and Labour who endeavoured to make political capital out of the needs of the country at the time of the passage of the 1972 Act.  We cannot be blamed for our lack of confidence in regard to the future of the prison system should this Government remain in power.  Deputy Luke Belton was speaking sincerely when he talked of rendering the prison system less penal and more humanitarian.  We would welcome any such move.  However, I do not believe that the people opposite have changed very much in their attitude in this regard since 1972. They say that they are anxious now to have a prison system that would be corrective and educational and which would bring people to the realisation that they cannot with impunity break the law.</P>
    <P>I take this opportunity of expressing our sincere appreciation of the manner in which prison staffs, the Garda and members of the Defence Forces deal with some very dangerous people in our prisons.  However, we must indicate also that there is hope for those who are unfortunate enough to find themselves in prison, in some cases as a result of the reckless attitude of some of the people opposite.  We need a better and a reformed prison system. Fianna Fáil will continue to spell out what they mean when they introduce legislation.  As is the case in relation to this Bill, we will support the Government when we consider that our support is proper and necessary but we will not mislead any young person in anything that we may say or do.</P>

      <P>What the people opposite said on the last occasion is on the record for all to see.  There are some young people in prison today who wish that they had not listened to some of those people.  It is regrettable that they were led astray.</P>
      <P>It is worth contrasting the attitude of Fianna Fáil on this occasion with the attitude of the then Opposition in 1972 when, in an effort merely to be portrayed as liberals even at the expense of national security, they opposed us vehemently.  What crimes have been committed in the name of liberalism.  It was the trendy thing to portray a facade of liberalism in 1972, but it was spurious liberalism.  In itself it may be a harmless exercise but I am convinced that such an attitude was responsible for misleading some of those who are now in Mountjoy or Portlaoise.  They were encouraged to adopt an anti-Government attitude. Consequently, I admonish the liberals to look to their consciences and to try to make some amends in the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a matter of regret to every Member of this House that it is found necessary to extend for a further period the provisions of section 2 of the Prison Act, 1972.  However, the security situation remains so serious that the Government find it necessary to continue to separate a small number of prisoners from the civilian prison system and if necessary to put such prisoners into military custody.  That proved necessary in 1972.  I supported the Government's decision on that occasion because I considered no other course of action was open to the then Minister for Justice and I support today the decision of the Minister for Justice, Deputy Cooney, in finding it necessary to continue the option of having such persons so transferred.  In that regard I <Col N="1218" /> do not have any retrospective conscience whatsoever.  There can arise circumstances in which it would be necessary to transfer certain prisoners from civil prisons into military custody.  That has happened in the recent past.</P>
      <P>Deputy G. Collins, in his flow of rhetoric this morning, did not contribute very much to the serious questions of prison institutional involvement, of penal reform generally or of the role of Government vis-á-vis military custody and civilian prison custody. He seemed to be confusing what was the kernel agreement between the Government and the Opposition of the day.  That agreement, which was there in large measure in 1972 and is still there today in large measure, is that in the Curragh, in the heart of the major military complex of the country, it is quite impossible and most undesirable to have, in any future planning for the institutional care of prisoners, a major civilian prison.  I know of no viewpoint within the Department of Justice which would favour a civilian/military complex of a prison system within the Curragh.  I do not know of any Deputy in this House who would want to see an integrated civilian prison in the middle of the Curragh surrounded by a military complex under part civilian and part military control.  Such a provision was never intended.</P>
      <P>We have to distinguish between that and the circumstances which can arise where on occasions, particularly in the context of the Curragh Military Hospital, people may require special care, as we have seen in the recent past, and it might be necessary to take a small number of prisoners out of civilian prisons and put them into military custody or into the Curragh military hospital for obvious security reasons.  It is with that very distinct limitation and on that understanding that in 1972 I supported the Prison Act, 1972.  That very clear policy attitude was enunciated in 1972 by the then Minister and it is still maintained today by the Minister for Justice, Deputy Cooney.  Efforts by the Opposition to indulge in what I call retrospective retribution in relation to this matter are not very productive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1219" /> One of the better things that happened to this country was the change of Government in 1973.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the traumatic things which happened between 1973 and 1977 is that certain politicians who are now in Government have had an opportunity of becoming more aware of the problems that arise in relation to civil prisons, military custody and the control systems which one must operate.  Such politicians are now more mature, and responsive to the needs of the country.  It is good that today such politicians who opposed Deputy O'Malley in 1972 have had to face at Government level the problems which he then faced, and they now support the extension of this Act for a further period.  It does not help anybody to find Members of the opposition being long in tongue and short in memory on such issues as this.  It is a waste of time to indulge in retrospective recriminations. The important point is that there are now some 780 persons in civilian prisons in the country.  We have a growing prison population.  We have some 400 in Mountjoy, 110 in Limerick, 40 in Cork, 60 at Arbour Hill, 150 in Portlaoise and 20 in Shelton Abbey. Between St. Patrick's and Shanganagh Castle and Loughan we have 235 juvenile prisoners in detention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a society we have to look very carefully at the attempt at rehabilitation and at the extent to which rehabilitation work is proceeding in these prisons.  In Mountjoy the complex is very inadequate.  I say that as one who has visited that prison on a number of occasions prior to and after becoming a Dáil Deputy.  At the invitation of Deputy O'Malley I was one of the few Dáil Deputies to go to Mountjoy after the riot to see what damage had been done there and what the situation was. I claim some familiarity with it, particularly when I was a trade union official with an interest then in the employment of prisoners.  I am not familiar with the current situation in Cork or Arbour Hill and I am not entirely familiar with the situation in <Col N="1220" /> Limerick.  I have visited St. Patrick's and I have visited also the female prison in Mountjoy complex.  I have been on a number of occasions to all three sections of it.  I think it will be generally agreed that it requires major work and a smaller prison population, particularly in Mountjoy, to enable a proper rehabilitative process to proceed with an opportunity for staff to contribute, for prisoners to benefit, and for social workers and the training unit to provide effective care.</P>
    <P>In the past two or three years tens of thousands of pounds of taxpayers' money has been spent in trying to improve our civil prison system.  Were it not for the appalling security situation which calls for great rigidity, it would be much easier to proceed expeditiously with a good deal of this work.  The crippling security situation at Portlaoise prevents a great deal of work from being done.  Here I give credit to Deputy O'Malley&mdash;he was an excellent Minister for Justice in many ways&mdash;for his interest in that area.  He was far more progressive than his predecessors, who had no real personal interest in the situation apart from being preoccupied with matters which were not necessarily within the province of the Minister for Justice. Deputy O'Malley made a distinctive contribution, and Deputy Cooney as Minister for Justice has certainly continued on and has made a major contribution. Furthermore, the National Coalition Government in the last four years have not stinted in the provision of taxpayers' money for such development.</P>
    <P>In that context there have been a number of discussions within the Parliamentary Labour Party on the question of penal reform and the role of prisons in society.  We have had several discussions within the Parliamentary Labour Party over the last six months.  At our meeting yesterday we decided as a matter of policy to set up a working party of parliamentarians who would review the prison system and who would bring forward, under terms of reference we are currently discussing, various proposals to our own party and to the Government for the general improvement of the prison system.  We are pleased that the <Col N="1221" /> chairman of the prison visiting committee of the Curragh Military Hospital, Deputy Joe Bermingham of Kildare, is on this working party. Senator John Horgan, who has a particular interest in the educational aspects of prison, has indicated that he will be prepared to make a contribution. Others who have so indicated are Deputy O'Connell, who has an interest in the social and medical welfare of prisoners.  Senator Quinn, and Senator Robinson, who has considerable legal knowledge of the situation.  I, as Party Whip, in so far as I have some knowledge in this connection having been secretary to a trade union working party on the question of employment of prisoners, have also indicated my desire to make a contribution. Senator M.D. Higgins and other colleagues are also members of this working party which we in the Parliamentary Labour Party have set up.</P>
    <P>Therefore, as a political party, we would not be disposed to rushing in and making a whole series of recommendations to the Government unless we had an opportunity of sitting down dispassionately and reviewing the overall situation.  It is our intention to consult as widely as possible in that work, to consult with the Minister of the day; and should there be an election after which the Coalition Government would not be returned, it would be our intention to continue to consult with the new Minister in so far as consultation would be permitted.</P>
    <P>It would also be our wish to consult with the Prison Officers' Association. There are constraints on prison officers, who are public servants, in regard to talking about security matters to politicians, and I accept those constraints.  I got the impression from Deputy G. Collins, in his tirade about not being permitted to visit high security prison complexes, that he has a rather flexible attitude in this connection. We would certainly hope to consult with the Garda Representative Body.  Gardaí have now been working within some prisons, particularly Portlaoise, and again so far as we can have consultations of an informal nature, which have taken place over the years with all political parties, we <Col N="1222" /> would certainly hope to hear their views.  There are also members of the legal profession who have a deep personal interest in this, and we would take their views into account, and those of many other bodies, for instance, those interested in legal aid and those who are disposed to make allegations about conditions in prisons.</P>
    <P>Whether the lifetime of this Dáil is short or long, or whatever way it may be after a general election, the Parliamentary Labour Party have now set in train a process whereby, within a short period, they hope to make a constructive contribution on the question of the role of prisons in our society, on the question of the conditions in prisons, working conditions of prison staff, the question of security, and the question of prisoner's rights and so on.</P>
    <P>As a member of a trade union and as one who has served for a number of years as a civil servant, one might say, on behalf of public service unions, I think I should pay tribute to the extremely difficult, onerous and very often nerve-wracking work which has to be done by many prison officers, particularly in the Portlaoise situation. People often make allegations about us as politicians which can be not only very hurtful but also very damaging to our careers, and which can be disastrous in their impact on our families, and indeed on the interpersonal relations which we have with many sections of the community.</P>
    <P>There are many prison officers who have faced a nervous breakdown in the context of the pressures which have been put on them due to the exigencies of high security situations. This situation is not the creation of the Government because a substantial number of prisoners in high security prisons, particularly in Portlaoise, which was never intended as a high security prison unit, have made it abundantly clear that they will escape by whatever means possible.  It does not worry them if in the process they have to kill a member of the prison staff or a member of the Garda Síochána or the Army.  They have made it quite clear on a number <Col N="1223" /> of occasions that they will endeavour to escape.  It is intimidating to maintain a high security situation in which prison officers and members of the Garda and the Army are obliged to work together and have a complex system of communication and in which they all have different responsibilities. The State must have a deep and abiding respect for those involved in this appallingly difficult work.</P>
    <P>That is not to say that we would countenance in any way abuses which might arise.  God knows in political life one is frequently intimidated, perhaps more in the verbal than in the physical sense, and one is frequently tempted to retaliate and put one's career on the line.  That temptation has to be resisted and it certainly has to be resisted within the security forces of the State. It can be said that the present Minister and the present Government, despite at times the most exonerating form of circumstances, have not countenanced abuses in any way.  While prisoners maintain that they are determined to use all possible means, legal and illegal, to escape from prison and to disrupt totally the prison system the Government have no option but to maintain a very high level of security.</P>
    <P>I am referring to a small number of the prisoners at Portlaoise, a very small number out of a total prison population of 780.  It is a tragedy and a scandal that so many of our community, members of the general public and employers, have branded so many other unfortunate men who found themselves for a short or a long period in a civilian prison.  Of course, the word &ldquo;prisoner&rdquo; has an increasingly pseudo-security and quasi-political connotation and inevitably other people suffer in terms of being reintegrated in society.  That is one of the tragic spinoffs.  A couple of dozen men simply brand 700 or 800 others and succeed in destroying their lives as well because of the attitude of society towards them.  Every employer whom I have approached requesting him to take back a former employee or employ someone who has spent some time in a civilian prison has asked me if the man is a member of the IRA, <Col N="1224" /> if he was in Portlaise and where he comes from.  By the time the internal security procedures are completed the prospect of employment for such a person will have diminished.  The man may have drifted off in despair with little prospect of getting rehabilitative employment.  There are sides to the story in that regard which are very often overclouded by a spectacular escape and which we tend to ignore.</P>
    <P>I understand Deputy O'Malley is anxious to speak so that he can at least go on record as commencing.  I very much regret&mdash;not as a liberal in Deputy Moore's definition but as a social democrat&mdash;that this Bill is necessary but any social democrat with any respect for the institutions of this State will find it necessary to support the Bill.  There is not an Army man in the country who wants to be involved in this situation but it may be necessary for the State to deem that men should be put into military custody. We certainly long and work for the day when it will no longer be necessary to transfer prisoners to military custody.  I would hope that all political parties would work to bring about such a situation.</P>

      <P>It is with a certain wry amusement that I speak in May, 1977, on the further continuation of a Bill which was necessitated by a riot which took place in Mountjoy prison five years and one day ago.  The only reason the Bill was introduced in 1972 was because of that riot and I gave an assurance at the request of not one but a dozen members of the then Opposition&mdash;some of them now members of the Government&mdash;that the Act would not be continued beyond the period it took to repair the damage in Mountjoy prison.  I was asked for that assurance and I gave it.  After three years the damage was finally repaired and we have a situation that, instead of the Act being allowed to lapse, we have its most vehement critics coming in and asking that it be extended for a further three-year period into the 1980s, making its life at least eight years.  I can be excused the wry amusement I must feel in this situation. It was proposed and agreed that this Act should operate for two years <Col N="1225" /> in the aftermath of riot which destroyed about one third of our prison capacity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not accept that the position regarding the provision of dental treatment for school children in County Wexford should be described as deplorable.  In fact, in 1976 the number of children dentally examined was nearly three times greater than the number examined in 1972, and a greater quantity of treatment was made available in 1976 than in 1972.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know that the health board are at present recruiting replacements for three dentists who retired recently. These vacancies have already been advertised by the Local Appointments Commission and the competition should also lead to filling one extra post of dentist for Wexford.  This is one of four additional posts which I sanctioned for the South-Eastern Health Board under the job creation <Col N="1226" /> programme provided for in the 1977 budget.  I hope that these jobs will be filled within the next few months and this should enable the amount of service provided to be further extended.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister not accept that there are no dental services in Wexford county?  I am sure the same applies to all areas in the southeast in regard to schoolchildren.  Three dentists have left the service, I do not know why, and apparently the health board are unable to recruit dentists. Is the Minister aware that the waiting list is so long that in the case of fillings they have become extractions before they can be dealt with?  Is he aware that the waiting list for the county hospital is in the region of 300 and that only three or four minor cases can be taken each week?  Have not the services completely broken down?</P>

      <P>I would not agree that the service has broken down completely&mdash;that is more than exaggeration. I should like to see the dental services being improved but difficulties have been encountered.  The Deputy said there were practically no examinations or treatment.  I have not got the figures for 1977 so far but I would point out that the seven posts have been approved, for which interviews will be held, and I expect vacancies filled in the next few months will mean a big improvement.  If, as the Deputy has suggested, the situation is deplorable I should like to give him some figures&mdash;I am sure he has armed himself with figures.  In 1972 the number of children examined was 4,141 and in 1976 the number was 11,926. That does not bear out what the Deputy has been saying.  I am as concerned as the Deputy about the position not alone since I became a member of the Government but much earlier.  I appreciate the difficulties and I will try to have improvements made as quickly as possible through staff recruitment and ancillary matters.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1228" /> The complete closure of a hospital would, of course, be very rarely contemplated but changes of user where particular services are discontinued do take place, for example in relation to the conversion of tuberculosis hospitals for other purposes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughGibbons" hpid="Dr. Gibbons Dr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health the manner in which hospital staffing is arranged between his Department and Comhairle na nOispidéal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>The relevant statutory functions of Comhairle na Ospidéal as specified in section 41 (1) (b) of the Health Act, 1970, are to regulate the number and type of consultant medical posts and of senior registrars and top-grade biochemists and to specify the qualifications for such posts.  I think that answers, if not all, part of the Deputy's supplementary question on the last question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before creating or filling any of these posts, a health board or hospital authority must, therefore, first seek the approval of Comhairle na nOspidéal. Health boards and hospital authorities approach an Comhairle direct for such approvals and are expected to present a fully documented case in support of each proposal. After an Comhairle's approval to an appointment has been obtained, it is then necessary for the health board or hospital authority concerned to have cleared with my Department <Col N="1230" /> all the financial aspects of the matter, including the direct remuneration costs, the costs and numbers of any ancillary staff, together with any non-pay expenditure of a revenue or capital nature, which may arise. The conditions of service&mdash;especially remuneration&mdash;must also have been approved by my Department in the case of all new posts and changes in existing appointments.  When these matters have been cleared and my Department's approval obtained, the making of the appointments may proceed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughGibbons" hpid="Dr. Gibbons Dr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that Comhairle na nOspidéal cannot make any decision on any of those posts except one prescribed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>No, that is not so.  As I said in my reply, the health board or the hospital authorities, in the first instance, must approach Comhairle na nOspidéal.  If they refuse it, they refuse it, and that is their right.  If they agree to it, then it comes to the Minister for Health.  He must decide, not on whether or not the post should be assigned to a particular health board or other hospital, but if he is satisfied that the rate of remuneration and other expenses in connection with the post are justified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughGibbons" hpid="Dr. Gibbons Dr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 41 states that Comhairle na nOspidéal only enter in when those positions are prescribed.  I suggest to the Minister that, before they are prescribed, somebody must make a decision that they be prescribed; this is the initiating and important decision, the one that lies with the CEO and the Minister, and that in fact it does not give Comhairle na nOspidéal any primary or initiating right to decide on what positions are to be filled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>They have initiating rights but they have also, so to speak, the powers of veto if they do not appoint consultants to a particular hospital.  If Comhairle na nOspidéal accede to that request, it has to go a step further for the Minister for Health must determine whether or not the remuneration or other aspects of the appointment are satisfactory to him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Cluskey)</NameTxt>
      <P>Two sets of criteria are used in establishing the means of smallholders who are applicants for unemployment assistance depending on their area of residence and the rateable valuation of their holdings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1237" /> In the case of smallholders in certain specified areas, the rateable valuation of whose holdings is £20 or under, means derived from land are assessed on a notional basis by applying a multiplier of £20 for each £1 valuation where the land valuation is £15 or less and a multiplier of £30 for each £1 valuation where the land valuation exceeds £15 but does not exceed £20.  Income other than farm income, if any, is determined on a factual basis under the general provisions of the unemployment assistance scheme.  The specified areas in which this method of assessment of means of small farmers applies are Counties Cavan, Clare, Donegal, Kerry, Longford, Monaghan, the Counties of Connaught and parts of West Cork and West Limerick.</P>
    <P>In the case of smallholders in the specified areas with land valuations exceeding £20, and smallholders outside of these areas irrespective of their land valuations, the means are assessed on a factual basis.

      <P>Apart from the notional system, when a farmer is being assessed on a factual basis, what <Col N="1238" /> system is being used to assess the estimated income of a small farmer? I asked this supplementary question before but I was not satisfied with the reply.  The small farmer's income must be assessed on an estimated income from farming.  I am sorry to be so long-winded but I want to make this clear.  In answer to a supplementary question of mine the Parliamentary Secretary said the system was similar to the old age pension system which is based on an estimated income also.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of factual income never arose in the case of small farmers until the change because they were always on a valuation basis.  Now, anybody over £20 poor law valuation has to go on factual income.  I am asking what the system is, because it was not in operation before for small farmers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not quite correct.  Before any adjustment was made in the calculation, approximately 7,000 farmers had opted for factual assessment, and approximately that number have been on factual assessment down through the years.  The means by which the assessment is made and the items taken into consideration in the assessment are spelled out in the Acts I mentioned.</P>

      <P>Boat repair facilities are provided for hull and machinery repair for big and small vessels at the board's boatyards at Killybegs, Dingle and Baltimore.  Similar activities are also provided at a private boat yard at Mevagh, County Donegal.  The marine coast radio stations at Valentia and Malin Head are the responsibility of the Minister for Transport and Power but are available for communication in the event of a trawler breaking down.  In 1973, the Taoiseach opened the Decca navigating system.  This electronic aid enables fishermen on the west coast to pinpoint their position at sea with complete accuracy, and thus return with the minimum of effort to the most profitable fishing grounds on the second occasion.  The segment of the system to assist fishermen off the west coast of Ireland&mdash;other coasts were covered by an overspill from the British network&mdash;was formally commissioned on 31st May, 1973, and has been fully operational since.  The Irish segment consists of a master station at Rinville, Oranmore, County Galway, and subsidiary &ldquo;slave&rdquo; stations located at Falchorrib, Dungloe, County Donegal, Ballydavid, Dingle, County Kerry, and Ardmore, County Waterford.</P>

      <P>In view of the fact that the EEC, under Article 103, bound themselves to carrying out a survey on the economic and social development of areas along the coast can the Minister indicate what evidence there is that this survey has been carried out?  Has any worth-while effort been made to provide funds for the development in the more backward areas?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Article 72 of the regional fund regulations stipulates that projects costing less than £4.17 million should be submitted as grouped applications.  Article 74 goes on to specify that the EEC Commission should approve assistance for such grouped applications in the aggregate. Consequently, the Commission does not publish details of the assistance in respect of individual small projects. The amount of financial assistance related to the syncrolift project is a figure for the Minister's information only and, because of EEC regulations, I cannot give it to the House.</P>
      <P>The selection of a project for regional fund assistance will not increase the level of aid paid for that project.  Regional Fund aid will instead be applied to increase the total pool of resources available to the State to finance additional industrial and infrastructural investment particularly in the areas of greatest need.  This approach places priority on increasing the overall volume of regional development investment rather than giving additional assistance to particular regional development projects already in progress.  This Department submitted two further fishery harbour development projects, Clogherhead, County Louth, and Drumatoor, County Kerry, to the Department of Finance for consideration under the 1977 regional fund allocation.  I am glad to announce that the work on Clogherhead pier will commence in this financial year at a cost of approximately £500,000.</P>

      <P>These matters are dealt with in groups in the aggregate. At present two relatively small projects are in the office of the Minister for Finance.  I have already explained to the Deputy how Articles 72 and 74 work.  The small fishery harbours are being dealt with at high civil service level at important meetings in Brussels. Out of those meetings will come sanction for various developments which will then go to the Department of Finance.  I cannot tell the Deputy, as he knows, the various items at present before those civil servants because I do not know what will emerge from those meetings and which schemes will be successful.  I will do my utmost, through my officials in Europe, to see that the maximum number are successful. I had experience of this myself because in my business I was unsuccessful in getting a grant because FEOGA turned it down.

      <P>In view of the Government's commitment to job creation does the Minister not accept that he should take action immediately to retain those jobs in labour intensive industries?  Does he not agree that the redundancies are a direct result of his reduction in the allocation of money for national primary and national secondary roads over the last few years?  Would he not agree that in that area where some of those quarries operate, especially in the Cavan-Monaghan region, they received more money for national primary and national secondary roads in 1972-73 than the total amounts received for the four years under the National Coalition?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The position about national primary and national secondary roads is that we do not spend money on a system of making new roads where roads have already been made.  The Deputy is mixing things up to suit himself when he talks about money not being expended.  Does the Deputy expect that the money which was expended doing certain roads should be expended there even though the job on the roads has finished?

In the last three years money has been given to local authorities under the heading of &ldquo;Block Grant&rdquo; and it showed a substantial increase on previous years.  The result is that the local authorities are entitled to spend that anywhere they feel it should be spent.

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>No allocation in respect of new works was made to Wicklow County Council in the first half of the year pending the carrying out of an investigation of general housing needs in the county.  This review has recently been completed and I hope to communicate with the Council shortly in the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CiaranMurphy" hpid="Mr. C. Murphy Mr. C. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister verify that Wicklow is the only county authority which obtained no money for new house starts for the first six months this year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to give the Deputy information.  Yes, that is so, because it was felt that without an investigation it would not be proper to <Col N="1250" /> give an allocation.  It is well to point out that in 1968-69 the previous Government gave £61,000 for housing in County Wicklow and 16 houses were built.  In 1969-70 they gave £56,000 and 37 houses were built.  In 1970-71 they gave £40,000 and 34 houses were built.  In 1971-72 they gave £279,000 and 12 houses were built.  In 1972-73 they gave £833,000 and 67 houses were built.  In 1973-74, we gave £1,327,000 and 207 houses were built. In the nine months of 1974 we gave £896,000 and 149 houses were built. In 1975 we gave £985,000 and 162 houses were built.  In 1976 we gave £1,012,000 and 120 houses were built. A number of houses were started and carried forward and since the money was already available, it was not necessary in the first part of this year to give additional money.  In spite of that, in 1977 we gave £1,250,000 for housing in Wicklow as against £61,000 in 1968-69.  The first year I took over as Minister for Local Government I gave them £279,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CiaranMurphy" hpid="Mr. C. Murphy Mr. C. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for a lot of irrelevancies.  My question dealt with new house starts. Would the Minister state whether the money given in 1973 was for new house starts?  In relation to the houses listed for 1974, when was the money for new house starts allocated?  Will the Minister verify if Wicklow local authority submitted a priority list with Newcastle heading that list and no money was given in the first six months?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>For Newcastle 12 houses were approved and none are being processed.  The Deputy is not up to date with his information.  With regard to the question of when money was made available for 1973, when I took over £1,327,000 was made available as against £833,000 the year before.  In 1972-73, 69 houses were built.  Therefore, I assume they spent all that money in that year.</P>

      <P>Before Questions, I was saying that I derived a certain wry amusement from this Bill in view of what was said in 1972 and particularly what was said about me and the allegedly sinister and improper motives that I had in introducing it in the wake of a riot that destroyed about one-third of our prison capacity as it existed then.  I was drawing a contrast between the fact that it is one thing to propose or agree to military custody for two years in 1972 in the aftermath of that riot and the circumstances that then existed when we literally had nowhere else to put the prisoners&mdash;and some of them were very dangerous prisoners&mdash;and the very different thing it is now to propose or agree to a further extension of three years, making a total of eight so far in this year of 1977, for the continuation of military custody when three or four prisons, four, I think, have been provided since May, 1972.  Three of them were provided by me before I left office in March, 1973, and one since then.  There was certainly justification, despite all the criticism from Fine Gale and Labour at the time, for the 1972 Act.  There is none now in the present circumstances.</P>
      <P>The present prison population was quoted before lunch by Deputy Desmond as 780.  When I left office it was about 720, as I recall.  There is virtually no difference between the two figures but there are hundreds more places available for prisoners now than there were in 1972.  Arbour Hill, Cork and Shelton Abbey are available and the most important one in this context that is available now and was not available then&mdash;significantly it is one which the Minister did not mention in his opening speech&mdash; is the new high security prison provided in the Curragh since 1973 by the conversion of what I think was called Plunkett Barracks.  I understand this was completed about a year ago when our spokesman on Defence, Deputy Dowling saw it and it is lying idle since.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our spokesmen on Defence and Justice, Deputies Dowling and Collins, sought to inspect it yesterday but, significantly, they were refused permission because the Government did <Col N="1265" /> not want it highlighted here today that there is accommodation of a high security nature for quite a number of prisoners away from the military detention barracks at the Curragh, in a different place, and that that prison or place of detention could be used for the imprisonment of civilian prisoners and it could be done under civil control.</P>
    <P>When one analyses the present position it seems there is no need, primarily because of the existence of the new unused prison in the Curragh and also because of the existence of extra capacity in other prisons which did not exist in 1972, for a continuation of this system of military custody.  Thirty prisoners out of a total population of 780, is a very small number. From the figures given in the Minister's speech this morning it is quite clear that several prisons are not by any means full to capacity and that these 30 prisoners at present in the Curragh under military custody could easily be distributed among the other prisons and held in civilian custody. This is a fact which the Minister cannot change no matter what he may say.  It is not a shortage of accommodation that is causing this system of military custody to be maintained.  It also seems that at a time when approximately 150,000 people are out of work, it cannot be a question of lack of civilian staff that prevents these 30 prisoners being held in civilian custody. If the Minister were to advertise to-morrow for vacancies in the Prison Services he would be inundated with applicants.  There is no job advertised nowadays for which there is not a surplus of applicants.</P>
    <P>The Garda Síochána for which there has been no recruitment for several years, had literally thousands of applicants when it was announced recently that an examination would be held.  If there are not sufficient civil prison staff to look after all the civilian prisioners they could be recruited within a matter of weeks. There would be a queue a mile long of people looking for the job.</P>
    <P>The significance of these two facts is that under the 1972 Prisons Act the Minister for Justice is entitled to transfer <Col N="1266" /> people to military custody only if the prison accommodation is insufficient to keep them in civilian custody.  We have shown that is not so, that there is plenty of accommodation.  If there is a shortage of staff, we have shown there is no difficulty in recruiting them. It seems to me a matter of some doubt whether the Minister under the 1972 Act is entitled to ask the House to continue the process which he and virtually all his colleagues found so obnoxious in 1972.</P>
    <P>If they found it obnoxious in 1972&mdash; and nobody denies that nearly one-third of our prison accommodation was destroyed overnight&mdash;if there is any consistency in the critics of the 1972 Act it must be infinitely more obnoxious to them today.  However, in spite of the fact that there is ample accommodation we have a continuation of this process of military custody.</P>
    <P>I cannot think of any other country in the EEC that has a semi- or quasi-permanent system of military detention for civilian prisoners.  I do not think there is one other than ourselves.  I cannot think of what is called a western democracy that has this system which we are now permanently retaining. Certainly it is not in the United States, Canada or in the Scandinavian countries and while I am sure it existed in the past in Spain and Portugal it has been phased out there.  It is very doubtful if any civil prisoners remain in military custody in those countries. We are unique among what one would call the genuinely free countries in having this system of detention in military custody on a more or less permanent basis.  This is the second renewal of three years in respect of an Act that the Government found obnoxious at the time.</P>
    <P>I could have a field day and I would be justified in going through many of the quotations that are in Volume 261 of the Official Report of 23rd May, 1972, and for a number of days afterwards before the Bill was passed.  Deputy Collins picked out a few of them this morning and I could quote ten times as many.  However, I do not think much purpose is served by it because the kind of people who said these things with such passion in 1972 <Col N="1267" /> have such thick hides that it does not seem to matter to them.  The kind of people who were prepared to approve of what was announced by the Taoiseach 15 minutes ago will not be worried that they are shown up for the hypocrites they are.</P>
    <P>I note that the Minister took the opportunity in his opening statement to make a general speech about the prison situation.  I had not anticipated that this would be in order but I assume it is.  There are a few remarks I should like to make on the subject as somebody who was very much involved in the problem.  I tried to do as much as I could and I succeeded to a reasonable extent in making some major changes in our prison system in the rather short time I was Minister for Justice.</P>
    <P>The first thing I note about the speech in terms of the remarks about the general prison situation is that there is absolutely nothing in the speech of what is proposed that was not advocated by me in his House in 1972. Admittedly, there have been problems in the meantime but despite that one would have thought more progress would have been made.  As far as I can see, the progress has been virtually nil and in certain respects the movement has been backwards.</P>
    <P>One of the most disturbing aspects was to learn from the Minister's speech that the prison accommodation in this country for women is exactly as it was four or five years ago.  The first time I visited St. Patrick's Institution was in May or June, 1970. I had never been there before; I had often been to Mountjoy but not to the St. Patrick's section of the Mountjoy complex.  I was horrified by what I saw.  Women are incarcerated on a floor of a wing of an institution which is used for the detention of young men between 16 and 21 years.  The women are on the first floor.  There are young men on the second and third floors and there are young men in the other wings of that institution.  At that time there were about 150 or 200 young men and about 15 women.  Unfortunately, there was no difficulty in communication between the two sections <Col N="1268" /> of the institution.  I do not think there is any difficulty now because there is nothing that can be done to prevent it.  When I was there I overheard the problems that arose from that easy communication.  It struck me as absolutely shocking that that should be the situation and that women should be imprisoned in that kind of set up, literally within a matter of feet of a few hundred young men. To say the least, it was very unsatisfactory from the point of view of endeavouring to maintain discipline in the male part of the establishment.  The women concerned exercised in what was described as the Governor's garden.  That was in the full view of about 50 cells in the male part of St. Patrick's Institution and I was told of some of the things that happened. One did not need to be told because one could readily imagine that these things would happen.</P>
    <P>It was in the summer of 1970 and I immediately gave directions that a purpose-built women's prison was to be constructed and that even if there were greater priorities in the prison service from the administrative point of view for obvious reasons this would have to take priority.  Architects were instructed to draw up plans and a site was acquired with the help of the then Dublin City Manager who was very helpful and co-operative.  The site was ready by early 1972 and the plans completed by late 1972.  I went to Deputy Colley who was then Minister for Finance and explained the position to him in some detail.  After some persuasion he agreed to allot a sum of £1 million to the Department of Justice in the 1973 Estimates for the building of the prison.  There was no reason why the building could not have gone ahead at the beginning of the 1973-74 financial year which would be from April onwards.  The plans were ready and the site was obtained. Unfortunately, it now appears from the Minister's speech that nothing was done.</P>
    <P>Those women are still in the same position their predecessors were in as long ago as 1970 when I decided, as any normal human being looking at the situation would decide, that it would have to be brought to an end <Col N="1269" /> very rapidly.  It is probable now that the Kilbarrack women's prison, which in 1973 could have been built for £1 million, will probably cost £2 million today.  While it takes two or three years to build, those unfortunate women who are convicted are put into this terrible situation and kept there.  The majority of the women who are imprisoned in Mountjoy are there for very petty reasons.</P>
    <P>There are countries with more advanced social thinking than ours who feel they should not be in prison at all.  They are mainly there for soliciting and for petty shop-lifting.  In the case of one group it is probably economic hardship that is causing them to be in the position they are in and in the case of the other group it is likely to be some mental abnormality that has them in their unfortunate position.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to Limerick women's prison, which has about ten or 12 inmates. In recent years this has differed radically from Mountjoy prison as they have a few long-term prisoners there, who are subversives, who have caused tremendous trouble there, very seriously assaulted ban-ghardaí and female prison officers.  The administration of Limerick prison generally has been considerably upset by the presence of those women and by the apparent necessity to have a very large number of gardaí and soldiers assigned to Limerick prison to keep in three women.  The other women in Limerick prison are harmless.  They are mainly there for begging or some other trivial offences.</P>
    <P>During the past few years 56 gardaí stationed in Limerick have been doing nothing else but prison duties either inside or immediately outside the walls of the prison at Mulgrave Street. During that time the crime situation generally in Limerick has got totally out of hand.  A high proportion of the people in Limerick are now living in fear.  No denials from the Minister or anybody else will obscure that fact, which is brought home to me daily by the complaints I get.  I understand that Limerick is to have the honour next week of a visit from the Minister for the much delayed opening of the new Garda station at Henry Street, which <Col N="1270" /> was occupied some time ago by the Garda.  No doubt an appropriate announcement will be made that more gardaí will be made available for Limerick, they will now be paid overtime or something else will be announced to enable them to deal with the appalling crime and vandalism there which terrifies so many of the people.  I do not believe anybody in Limerick or anybody else will be codded by those announcements, which are being made almost every day of the week for general election consumption and which no doubt, like so many promises made before the last general election, will be conveniently forgotten if the Coalition Government are returned to power on this occasion, which I very greatly doubt.</P>
    <P>We will probably have the same type of announcement made in Dublin. We have had it already but the Garda in Dublin said that the figures mentioned were quite inadequate.  There is an enormous difference between the number of man hours worked by the Garda in Limerick four years ago and the number worked by them today and during the past 18 months.  That is shown up by the fact that the crime situation in Limerick has literally got out of hand.  The Garda do not deny that they cannot cope with it.  I know they formally deny it to the Minister when formal inquiries are made but that is about the only occasions on which it is denied.  I am not allowed to say that the Minister deliberately misled the House.  The effect of his remarks was to mislead the House when he said that there are as many or slightly more gardaí in Limerick today than there were four years ago. That is strictly true if every one of them are counted but 56 of them are doing nothing else except sitting in the prison in four shifts of nine or ten each.  They cannot even cross the road if they see a crime being committed on the other side of Mulberry Street. They are totally committed to that prison where there are three subversive prisoners.</P>
    <P>A good deal of work was done in the early seventies in Limerick prison, which was always one of the more pleasant of our prisons, towards the rehabilitation of our prisoners and <Col N="1271" /> their assistance.  Unfortunately, because of the presence of so many gardaí and soldiers, the atmosphere is so unpleasant not alone for prisoners but for prison officers that much of the work that was done in the past with much success and which should have been developing in recent years, is now unfortunately at an end.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to Arbour Hill, Cork, Blacklion, Loughan House, Shelton Abbey in Arklow, Shanganagh, all the institutions opened in recent years, as if he produced them since he came to office.  The truth is that they were all there before I left office. They were either open or in the process of being rebuilt.  Shelton Abbey is put down in the Minister's statement as being able to accommodate 15 to 20 prisoners.  It is an open prison and there is no difficulty about accommodating a great deal more.  Cork can accommodate a lot more prisoners than the number the Minister indicated if the will was there to put them there.  It would be perfectly feasible, between all the prisons which are not filled to capacity at the moment, to accommodate the 30 men who are at present in military custody.</P>
    <P>The second paragraph of the Minister's speech is a fairly long description of various things done by violent prisoners in the prisons since he took office.  This catalogue of smuggling explosives into prisons, blowing their way out of them in large numbers and all the other things they did during his time relate entirely to Portlaoise prison but not to the Curragh. There are about 150 Provos in Portlaoise.  There has been trouble there all along but there have been no reports in recent years of violence of this or any other kind among the 30 prisoners at the Curragh.  These are not the violent men of whom the Minister speaks.  So far as I know they are not Provisional IRA but represent a cross-section of people who have been convicted of crime.  In response to members of Fine Gael and Labour at the time of the passage of the original Act in 1952 I had to give an undertaking to the House that we would not have only people whom they referred to as political <Col N="1272" /> prisoners at the Curragh.  I recollect there being a cross-section of the prison population there in the early days at least.  I cannot speak for what may have happened since I left office but at that time those people comprised some who had been convicted of murder, others who had been convicted of fraud and housebreaking and some who had been convicted of assaults either of a physical or sexual nature.  To the best of my recollection there has not been in recent years any incident of any significance at the Curragh that would indicate that the prisoners there were acting in a violent fashion, so violent that they would have to be restrained by military police rather than to be dealt with in the normal way by civilian prison officers, whereas there have been almost a daily litany of violent activity at Portlaoise where the prisoners are not in military custody and where, apparently from all that is said and written, the level of violence is considerable.  The long paragraph at the beginning of the Minister's speech in relation to the smuggling in of explosives which were used by prisoners to blow their way out refers only to Portlaoise and to Provisional IRA prisoners.  It does not refer to those people who are held in military custody at the Curragh.</P>
    <P>It seems extraordinary, therefore, that if we are being asked, because of the violent nature of some prisoners, to retain for a further three years this system of military custody for civilian prisoners, that this system should be retained for relatively mild prisoners while those who are violent by common consent can be held in civilian custody.  There is no logic in such approach.  One asks, therefore, why the Bill is being brought forward.  Is it being put through for some other reason?  The only other reason that the Minister gives is that because from time to time prisoners go on hunger strike it is good to retain this power so that they can be transferred to military custody for treatment rather than be treated at a general hospital.  I agree with that having regard to what happened on an occasion in 1972 when we tried to treat a prominent IRA prisoner at the Mater Hospital and when thousands <Col N="1273" /> of people, led by a Labour TD who now supports this Minister in what he is doing, paraded outside that hospital and terrorised the 550 patients there in support of the then leader of the IRA and who were harangued by a Labour TD in his support.  That meeting so inflamed passions that the following day a group of six or eight men attacked that hospital, firing guns down the corridors for the purpose of attempting to rescue the gentleman concerned.</P>
    <P>Consequently, I am aware perhaps better than anyone else, with the possible exception of Deputy Thornley, of how unsatisfactory it is to try to treat in general civilian hospitals people who are on hunger strike.  But there is nothing to prevent them being treated at the Curragh Military Hospital while under civilian rather than military custody because all that is needed for that purpose is the presence of one civilian officer in whose custody they would be, technically, while there. Three civilian officers would be required, each working an eight-hour shift.  That was what we did during the four or five days that elapsed between the riot at Mountjoy on the 18th May, 1972, and the passing of the 1972 Act.  Technically, those prisoners were in civilian custody for those days.  Obviously, the military hospital at the Curragh would have to be guarded in the last resort by soldiers but there is nothing to prevent prisoners in civilian custody being sent there.</P>
    <P>Therefore, the argument put forward by the Minister in this regard is a spurious excuse for the alleged necessity for this Bill.  The major difference between now and 1972 is that not only are there all those extra prisons which I provided in the aftermath of 1972&mdash;Arbour Hill, Shelton Abbey, Cork and so on&mdash;but we now have something that we had not thought of then and which we had not the possibility of acquiring in a short period.  I refer to the new maximum security prison that is being left empty. When Deputy Dowling saw this prison 12 months ago he took it to be finished but yesterday both he and Deputy Collins were refused permission to see <Col N="1274" /> it again.  Of course, the Government in acting in this way were well aware of the weakness of their case.  While that prison is there, there is no justification for the continuance for a further three years, making a total of eight years, of this system of military custody which is without precedent in western democracies and in free countries generally.  I wonder whether there is any use appealing to the conscience we heard so much from in 1972.  It looks as if the benches opposite are as empty now as the 1972 conscience today is empty of principle.</P>
    <P>It is well-known that the Army are sick and tired of this system of holding civilian prisoners in military custody.  It is having an effect on the morale of the Army and is preventing recruitment because of the knowledge that after joining a soldier may be required to serve for a few years in the role of a prison warder, a role for which the average young man does not join the Army.  The new high security prison at the Curragh could be put under civilian control with the assistance of the Army if necessary as is the case at Portlaoise.  It would be very much more convenient for the Army to have to go only a few yards down the road to the new prison rather than have to travel the 30 or so miles to Portlaoise where conditions are very difficult.  They would much prefer to be able to live in their own homes or in the barracks, as the case may be.</P>
    <P>I have demonstrated that the two reasons given by the Minister for the Bill are invalid but if there were a real reason for the Bill&mdash;and we have not heard of one so far&mdash;that would necessitate the 1972 Act being continued into the eighties as is proposed here.</P>
    <P>The Second Stage of this Bill when I introduced it originally on 2nd May, 1972, was subjected to an absolute torrent of abuse from Fine Gael and Labour.  All my motives were questioned and I was called a Hitler by Deputy Cruise-O'Brien, now Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, and similar things by similar types of people.  The one thing they were all screaming for was a time limit.  Not all of them <Col N="1275" /> agreed to this because eight voted against it, but most of them would agree to it, even though they found it obnoxious, if it were limited to 12 months.  They said that Mountjoy could be rebuilt in 12 months.  I told them it could not.</P>
    <P>I took advice that night after Second Stage as to how long it would take and I was advised it would take up to three years.  I came back the following day in a conciliatory mood and tried to meet what I thought at the time were genuine and sincere criticisms. I wish I had then the wisdom of five years later and I would have known how genuine and sincere they were.  In an effort to meet what I thought were genuine criticisms I said: &ldquo;All right, I will introduce an amendment.  We will put in a subsection providing a three-year limitation on this.  It will expire at the end of three years.&rdquo;  But three years was not good enough.  All the liberals and pinks and all the rest of them, all the leopards who have since changed their spots, would not dream of that.  That was totally impossible for a Fine Gael liberal or a Labour socialist, as they then were, to agree to.  They put down an amendment for 12 months.  Finally I compromised and said: &ldquo;All right, we will split the difference.  We will have two years, although I do not think it is long enough and there is a possibility that it may have to be renewed for another year because I do not think that all the necessary work will be done in two years.  We will try to do it in two years and if we cannot we will extend it for a further year.&rdquo;  Finally that was agreed to.  It was voted against by eight people including members of the present Government but it was agreed to by the vast majority of the House.</P>
    <P>Now it is eight years here without so much as a by your leave.  Look at the empty benches.  Look at the concerned consciences now.  In 1972 the whole of these benches were full of people jumping up trying to catch the Ceann Comhairle's eye so that they could get in to condemn the fascism and so on that the Government of the day were exhibiting when they refused <Col N="1276" /> to let dangerous criminals loose on the street.  I was a fascist and Fianna Fáil were fascists because we did that. There was a mob outside the gates here of a couple of thousand screaming for blood, and people who sat on these Opposition benches at that time were going out and lending succour to them and then coming in here and making speeches lending succour to them too.  There was the celebrated debate when one of the great supporters of this present Government, Deputy Coughlan, made the celebrated contribution that 80 per cent of the Irish people supported the Provisional IRA. That debate was noteworthy, along with some others, for some things, but a lot of water seems to have flowed under the bridge since then, a lot of people seem to have extraordinarily short memories and a lot of hypocrisy seems to be taken for granted today.</P>
    <P>For reasons that Deputy G. Collins and I outlined, we propose to put down an amendment or amendments as may be necessary on Committee Stage of this Bill to limit its operation, not to a further three years, but simply to a further 12 months.  It seems to us that this is more than adequate. Assuming that there is some short-term valid reason for this Bill, although the Minister has not given a valid reason for it, I would be prepared to extend this for a further 12 months but no longer.  That would be keeping the Bill in existence for six years in all.  No western democracy that I know of has any such provision in its law or would contemplate any such provision in its law unless it were in a state of absolute siege.  This country is not in a state of siege.  It is not in a state of emergency in spite of the efforts of the Government last August and September to convince us that it was.  Maybe it is in a state of economic emergency but it is not in a state of emergency in the sense that the institutions of this State are in any danger of being overthrown at present.</P>

      <P>And never were, and the time of greatest danger to the institutions <Col N="1277" /> of this State was December of 1972 when there were mobs outside the gates of this House and when there were a thousand guards lined across the front gates of Leinster House blocking the end of Molesworth Street and more guards at the back in Merrion Square to protect this House on that side.  There were 100 armed soldiers in the lane between Government Buildings and the new block of the Dáil with loaded rifles ready to fire to kill to prevent this House being burned down.  That was the time, and the only time I know of, when the institutions of this State were in mortal danger.  Instead of the Opposition of the day rallying to the defence of this country and its institutions we had them below haranguing mobs in front of the Mater Hospital, and we had them in this House making speeches to seek to prevent this country defending itself against those who would overthrow it.  Because the Leader of one party was not prepared to go against the Government at that time we had people, who know very well who they are, who were in this Chamber then conniving and intriguing behind his back to overthrow him. The only thing that saved him on that night was an unfortunate incident in which a number of people tragically lost their lives.  That was the time when the institutions of this State were in immediate danger.  I hope to God that whatever length of time I live it will be the only time because I hope that we will never again have an Opposition in this House who would give succour to a mob that would have overthrown this State as did the Opposition who sat here during the Prisons Bill of 1972, the Offences Against the State (Amendment) Bill, 1972 and the Prohibition of Forcible Entry and Occupation Bill of 1971. Because there were men who were then able to stand up against that threat, with no encouragement from this House and not as much encouragement from the country as a whole as there is today, those institutions survived. It does not take much courage today because 99 per cent of the people realise just what the IRA and all these other people are.  It was much harder to convince them of that in the very <Col N="1278" /> early Seventies, and the Opposition of that day is the proof of that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to add my words to the words of our spokesman, Deputy Collins, and Deputy O'Malley and the other speakers.  First I should like to question the sorry state of affairs here yesterday when we were told the Government deprived Members of this House of an opportunity of visiting the high security prison at the Curragh.  Some years ago, when this prison was being developed, I asked the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, who was at that time dealing with the Estimate on Justice, to give some indication of the prison development taking place there.  I was told by him at that time that there was no prison being built at the Curragh. Dealing the same day with the Estimate on Defence he told me that the Defence Forces knew nothing about such development.  I rang the Departments of Justice and Defence seeking information.  I was told by both that they knew nothing about the development of a prison at the Curragh.  That is the situation with which we were faced with at that stage.</P>
      <P>As a Member of this House I then sought permission to visit the Curragh Camp, which is obtained from the Minister for Defence, and, when I arrived, I found that the building had been almost completed.  Therefore, one can readily understand the anxiety of Members of this House when neither Department knew anything about that development.  At that stage I asked them who was building the prison.  Now this high security prison has been completed. The military barracks have been converted, at very great cost, into this high security prison, with pill boxes and all of the high security facilities that make such a prison one of top security.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One wonders what the Government have to hide when they failed to respond to the request of two Members of this House to visit the complex at the Curragh.  One wonders what is cooking behind the wire?  There is some secrecy about it.  We want to know what is behind it.  We were told that this was an open Government.  But one <Col N="1279" /> finds, when one questions Ministers or the Government in relation to such matters, one gets a blank answer.  In fact, on one occasion we were told that such a prison did not exist and, when we discovered that it did, we were told we could not visit it.  No doubt any Member of this House who had seen that development would have been fortified in a debate such as this. He would be aware of the pros and cons.  During the course of his visit there he would be made aware of the problems of internal and other security arrangements.  He would then be in a position to come into this House and make a contribution in the knowledge that he had the full facs.</P>
    <P>Before termination of this debate perhaps the Minister could tell us what is the secrecy about this encampment at the Curragh, about this high security prison, a prison that now covers an extensive area of the original Curragh Camp.  Indeed one might well ask why this area was selected.  I asked that question here before.  Why should the military encampment there be made vulnerable by the building of such a prison within its confines?  Surely the Minister and the Government must be aware of the pressures applied on the Curragh Camp when prisoners were first placed there.  Indeed for years afterwards protests were made about the encroachment on the perimeter of the military camp adjacent to married quarters where the wives and families of Army personnel in some cases were terrified by what they regarded as approaching danger.  Until such time as we receive an answer as to what is the secrecy and what is hidden behind the barbed wire at the Curragh we shall not be able to set out our thoughts clearly in relation to the matter.</P>
    <P>Deputy Collins has indicated already our support for every safeguard measure in relation to disruptive activities, in relation to mob law, to subversive organisations.  Our expressions have been full and complete on all occasions in relation to the maintenance of law and order and the protection of the institutions of State.  It is no less today than on any occasion in the past when, as he said, Deputy O'Malley was vilified and attacked <Col N="1280" /> inside and outside this House by Members and their supporters in relation to the job he had to do.  Indeed the job the Minister has to carry out is a difficult one.  The Minister must feel now as Deputy O'Malley felt when he had come into this House seeking concessions in relation to changes within the structure for prisoners.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to understand the purpose of this prison, the manner in which it will be used and the problems involved.  Military custody and detention and high security prisons from time to time smack of internment of one type or another.  This prison has lain there completed for a considerable period.  I understand that the final touches make it indeed an up-to-date one from the point of view of conditions and accessories.  In replying perhaps the Minister will tell us why Members of this House were not afforded an opportunity of visiting this prison and will explain the manner in which it will be used.</P>
    <P>In relation to military detention and the detention of prisoners in military custody one must consider first the demoralising effect they have on serving personnel in the Defence Forces.  The Minister rightly pays tribute to the Defence Forces for the way in which they carry out their duties.  But men do not join the Defence Forces to become prison warders.  It is a very specialised job, requiring a high degree of training, so that such personnel are fully equipped to deal with the problems one meets in the handling of prisoners of one type or another.  Military personnel are not trained for this type of operation.  Indeed I can say that they are gravely concerned about the development of a high security prison within the Curragh and about the maintenance of prisoners there at all.</P>
    <P>It is necessary and desirable to have competent, efficient people trained to do an efficient job in dealing with prisoners especially now when we hear so much about prisoners problems and brutality to prisoners.  Military personnel change from day to day and they are not trained to act as prison warders.  I am sure that the morale of the military assigned to such duties is very low.  They did not join the <Col N="1281" /> Defence Forces for that, but because of the present circumstances they must carry out prison warder duties.  Given the option, I am sure many of them would give the Minister his answer. The Garda and the military carry out their rightful duties effectively and thoroughly under difficult circumstances.</P>
    <P>The Minister should set up an independent inquiry into the allegations of brutality that are being made against prison authorities and Garda, so as to relieve the tensions and pressures that build up as a result of false allegations. My sympathy is with the prison officers who must contend with rowdy elements and the other elements which have been mentioned here from time to time.</P>
    <P>The advantages of the General Military Hospital in the Curragh, for assisting prisoners who will be imprisoned there have been mentioned. No mention has been made of the fact that recently two prisoners escaped from that hospital through a toilet window.  No matter where the prisoners are stationed, escapes take place. Prisoners do not need explosives, or armoured vehicles.  The fact that it is near a military hospital is neither here nor there.  Prisoners must be maintained. This is a highly specialised job for people trained to undertake the work.  The Minister will not deny that many aspects of a prison officer's work requires specialised training.  To move prisoners from an area where there is highly skilled and highly trained personnel to the atmosphere in a military prison, with members of the Defence Forces in charge, who are not trained, and who do not want the job, is bad for morale all round.  I am sure that the military personnel who must undertake these duties do them to the best of their ability but I hope the time will come shortly when it will not be necessary to use military detention centres.  There are all too few civilian detention centres in Dublin city.  The crime rate has increased, and there is nowhere to confine young offenders who have been caught committing serious crimes.  They are allowed out immediately and they continue committing offences.</P>
    <P>The Minister's problems are many <Col N="1282" /> and varied and for that reason one can understand the large amounts of information contained in some sections of his brief, and the limited information contained in other sections.  The Minister spoke about disruptive elements in society.  As pointed out earlier by Deputy Collins and other Members, when reasonable measures to maintain law and order come before this House, this party will respond generously. We must be made aware of the problems. There must be no secrecy as there was on this occasion; as there was a day or two ago when the representation was made to the Department.  I do not know if the Minister for Justice was aware of the request.  I do not know whether the Minister for Justice supported the Minister for Defence in his rejection of the request, or whether it was a Government decision.  In any event, the responsibility falls on each member of the Government, so the Minister for Justice is as responsible for the decision as is the Minister for Defence. It was a reasonable request and until such time as we are told the reason for the rejection there will be an air of suspicion as to the great cover-up.</P>
    <P>When Deputy O'Malley brought a Bill before this House there was vicious and violent opposition from within and without.  We see a sorry change in the Members of this House who were very vocal in their opposition in relation to law and order. Deputy O'Malley's Bill was attacked by both Labour and Fine Gael.  Many people now in detention are there as a result of the encouragement they got at that time.  The responsibility falls on the shoulders of the present Government.  Many of these people have now seen the folly of their ways and have realised that there is such a thing as internal security.  The Minister should give us the information we require even if we are not allowed to see the institution, to show that the Minister and the Government have nothing to hide.  The prison officers and the Garda have been subjected to attacks from time to time by the vicious sections of the community. False allegations of brutality have been made which must be cleared up as effectively as possible.</P>

      <P>From time to time the Minister has been asked to hold independent inquiries to eliminate the allegations against this very responsible and involved body of people. Their standing must be of the highest order.  I am sure no Member of this House doubts the sincerity and the efficiency of members of the prison staff and of the Garda Síochána.  They have to carry out their duties under very difficult conditions.  They were often deserted by authority, by the authority of this House, and by the Government.  Recently there have been indications of a change of attitude now that the security situation has deteriorated to a high risk level.</P>
      <P>This is a city of fear, a city of steel shutters, as I said in another debate. There are many problems in the city. There must be some restraint on members of the public who commit crimes.

      <P>This is possibly one of <Col N="1285" /> the most important measures to come before this House because it relates to law and order and there is a complete breakdown in law and order.  As the Minister, the Leas-Cheann Comhairle and the House know, there has been a complete breakdown in law and order in this city and in the country.</P>
      <P>The Minister said:</P>
      <P>Three years ago I stated that this problem could be solved by building a special high security prison unit capable of housing up to 30 high risk prisoners.</P>
      <P>Why did the Minister drop that idea if he considered it necessary three years ago?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The reasons are set out in my speech.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree it is necessary to have good housing accommodation for military personnel.  Does the Minister consider the housing of military personnel takes priority over the establishment of the type of building he considers necessary to retain prisoners in?  Military personnel must have proper facilities.  There is also the question of the development of a high security prison which the Minister said three years ago was necessary and would solve the problem.  Since then, the whole question of law and order has been on the downgrade.  This is a typical example of procrastination by the Minister and the Government.</P>
      <P>It is easy to understand the volume of crime which has accumulated over the past three years.  The bully boys and the thugs and the vandals of every type are running riot because of a lack of decision by the Government.  The Minister has admitted he failed to carry out a function which he considered necessary three years ago.  The Minister and the Government have been irresponsible in allowing the law and order situation to deteriorate to the level at which it is today.</P>
      <P>The Minister said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The long-term solution to the problem is to build a highly secure prison unit for them but at the moment this is not possible.  There is no alternative, therefore, but to continue to hold them in military <Col N="1286" /> custody in the Military Detention Barracks, Curragh Training Camp.</P>
    <P>Would the Minister agree that the most objectionable place to hold prisoners is in military custody?  Throughout the years this has been so regarded by everyone and especially by the personnel who have to carry out this job. The Minister has shifted his ground on this matter.  He believed these measures were necessary three years ago but he did not equip himself to do the job.  Then he considered that the long term solution would be the building of a high security prison unit; then he tells us that the Curragh is being used because it is close to the military hospital notwithstanding the fact that prisoners can escape from there through the skylight and the toilet.</P>
    <P>Three years ago the Minister indicated that he thought the problem could be solved.  What about the women's prison in Kilbarrack?  The plans have been put on ice.  We are to have a high security unit capable of housing up to 30 high risk prisoners. We have no detention centres for young vandals.  The Minister must bear complete and absolute responsibility in all these matters.  Can he tell us why there has been a cut back? Why were the detention centres not provided?  Was it a question of finance? Did the Minister believe that the problems would go away overnight?  He let the prison security system run down through his lack of effort.  There must be provision for the young people being brought before the courts; there is need for a women's prison and a high security prison.  When we take these together we see the lack of dedication to law and order shown by this Government.  This is an area on which they pride themselves.</P>
    <P>It is a sad state of affairs that a Bill of this nature should come before this House.  As Deputies O'Malley, Collins and Moore have indicated, we on this side have been at one on the issue of ensuring law and order within the State.  In recent times the lack of control of the destructive elements in our society was brought about by a complete run down of security and the Bill indicates a period of decline over the past three years.  Everyone <Col N="1287" /> accepts that this has caused the situations which we face today.</P>
    <P>In relation to inquiries, will the Minister give an undertaking that the good name of the people involved will be cleared at the earliest possible moment?  This is a most important matter and it has been mentioned time and time again.</P>
    <P>I know that the Minister must be in difficulties with many of his Labour Party colleagues whose benches are deserted today, who have been vocal in the past on this issue and who participated in mob law and in protests of one type or another in this city not long ago.  We know the difficulties facing the Minister with his Labour Party colleagues.  This is an absolutely and completely irresponsible section of Government regarding law and order. We know the damage they did in the days when it was necessary and desirable to bring in new legislation such as that introduced by Deputy O'Malley. We know the protest they made inside and outside this House.  We know how they motivated the mobs; we know how they had the hire-a-crowd groups outside the gates of the House and elsewhere. It is very sad to think that Members of this House would participate in that type of activity which certainly makes justice a farce.</P>
    <P>Let us hope that before this debate concludes we will hear the voice of Labour&mdash;if there is any voice left&mdash;so that we will know how they stand in relation to law and order and the basic issues that have come before the House today and will come before it in the future.  It is necessary and desirable that they should make their policy known in these matters.  Will they continue if they are in Opposition, as they <Col N="1288" /> did in Opposition before, to impede responsible Ministers who endeavour to deal with the situations of the day and the threats to the institutions of the State and the security of the person? What is their long term view on this?  Have they one view in Government and another view in Opposition? Will we see the same type of irresponsible behaviour if they are pushed into Opposition?  Of course, the next time there will not be so many of them; their voice will not be so loud.  The public at large should have an indication of how these people stand.</P>
    <P>I know Deputies in my constituency who spoke long and loud about these problems and who from time to time have been mixing with people who are responsible for some of the most hideous crimes.</P>
