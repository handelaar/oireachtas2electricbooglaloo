      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to increase the statutory limit of the amount of grants which may be made to Córas Tráchtála to enable that body to continue the work of promoting, assisting and developing Irish exports.</P>
      <P>The Export Promotion Act, 1959, under which Córas Tráchtála were established, fixed at £1 million the total amount of grants which might be made to the board out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas.  Subsequent Export Promotion Acts raised this limit.  The latest one, in 1974, raised it to £25 million and the present Bill proposes to raise it to £45 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Export Promotion Act of 1959 set up Córas Tráchtála as a statutory <Col N="352" /> board to take over the functions of Córas Tráchtála Teoranta.  Since then Córas Tráchtála have made a notable contribution to developments which have brought total exports from the level of £130 million in 1959 to £1,857 million in 1976.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked that they be given out.</P>
      <P>The increasing pace of export promotion activities, involving necessary expansion of Córas Tráchtála's aids and services, both in volume and scope, together with the devaluation of sterling has naturally increased the board's rate of expenditure.  Payments to the board by way of grant-in-aid up to 31 December, 1976, amounted to £22,350,885, which left a balance of £2,649,115 unissued from the existing limit of £25 million.  This balance is not sufficient to meet the board's financial requirements up to the end of the present year in respect of which it is estimated that a sum of £4.3 million will be required.</P>
      <P>While the Bill proposes to raise to £45 million the limit of the amount of grants which may be made to Córas Tráchtála, the actual grant-in-aid provision to be made in each financial year out of this amount will, of course, continue to be included in the Vote for my Department which will come before the Dáil in the ordinary way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The House will be already aware of the role played by Córas Tráchtála in the expansion of exports, particularly industrial exports.  The aids and services provided for exporters are wide.  They range from information, advice and basic market research to specialist services in the fields of market research and design management, and from incentive grants for individual exporters visiting overseas markets to the organisation of national stands at international trade fairs.  These services are kept under constant review to ensure that at any given time the services <Col N="353" /> most needed by exporters are provided in the manner and in the measure which would be most useful and so as to make the best use of the funds available to Córas Tráchtála.</P>
    <P>The distribution pattern of our exports in 1976 continues the positive trend towards greater diversification. The UK is still our main trading partner but our degree of dependence on this traditional market is diminishing. In 1976 49 per cent of our exports went to the UK as against 56 per cent in 1974, and 66 per cent in 1971.  The share of exports to the other EEC countries, on the other hand, has increased from 18 per cent in 1974 to 27 per cent in 1976.</P>
    <P>For the first eight months of 1977 the percentage taken by the UK was down to 47 per cent even though still up in the absolute sense.  Our exports to the other seven EEC countries at £455 million represented an increase to 29 per cent of total exports compared with 27 per cent for the same period in 1976.</P>
    <P>Exports this year are buoyant and for the full year seem certain to exceed anything achieved in previous years. In the first eight months exports, at £1,567 million, represent an increase of approximately 43 per cent compared with the corresponding period of 1976. That gives us the highest rate of value growth in exports in the European Economic Community.  The main contribution came from manufactures.</P>
    <P>Ireland is involved in the worldwide movement towards freer trade and is progressively participating in a trading complex involving the EEC and a large number of other countries.  While these developments manifestly provide further opportunities for Irish exporters, they also create the need for an increasing degree of marketing intelligence and other facilities.</P>
    <P>Córas Tráchtála now have 19 overseas offices, in 17 countries and all five continents.  They are particularly alert to the requirements of Irish exporters to the EEC, which is of course our largest potential market.  Through their Brussels office they maintain close touch with EEC developments <Col N="354" /> and are well equipped to furnish exporters with expert advice and market intelligence in this sector.</P>
    <P>The consequential expansion and improvement of the board's services to meet the developing requirements of exporters inevitably results in increased expenditure.  Furthermore the cost of providing existing and new services is subject to the same inflationery pressure as other costs.  It is essential however in the interests of the continued expansion of exports that Córas Tráchtála have adequate funds at their disposal to provide the services which are greatly valued by exporters.  The increasing demand on the board's services has been matched by the significant growth in exports. For example, in 1974, the year in which the House last dealt with a similar proposal, total exports reached the then record figure of £1 billion, and they now exceed the £2 billion mark. While I do not, of course, wish to suggest that Córas Tráchtála were solely responsible for the growth in exports by £1.0 billion in this period I have no doubt about the important role played by them, particularly in the increase and diversification of our industrial exports, which in 1976 accounted for almost two-thirds of total exports.</P>
    <P>I am sure that the House will agree that Córas Tráchtála should have adequate funds for their work, on which the development of our exports depends so much.  It is with confidence, therefore, I recommend an increase by an additional £20 million of the statutory limit on the funds which may be allocated to Córas Tráchtála to enable them to continue their export promotion and development activities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Naturally, Fine Gael welcome and support this Bill.  The Minister gave a brief description of its purpose.  He said also, quite rightly, that Córas Tráchtála&mdash;like everybody else in the world today&mdash;have to bear the consequences of inflation as well as those of their own increased activities. In order to put that into some money perspective the House might be interested to see the extent to which <Col N="355" /> this inflation and the expansion of their own services have overtaken them.</P>
      <P>Since the original Act of 1959 there have been several other Acts with the same purpose as this legislation, all increasing the cumulative amount of money which the State was authorised to advance to Córas Tráchtála for their operations.  In the last decade these Acts have come at approximately three-year intervals.  With regard to the amount authorised by the Oireachtas in 1974 I see that over £13 million has been taken up.  That is a large sum in a period of less than three years because the date given by the Minister is still in 1976.  In the previous three-year period the sum absorbed was approximately £6 million and in the two-year period before that it was only £4,500,000.  I presume the additional £20 million for which authority has now been given will cover the needs of Córas Tráchtála for approximately another three years.  Nobody will grudge that money because the results of the export effort to which Córas Tráchtála have contributed heavily are amazing.  They leave us in the happy position of heading a table in the European league in the positive sense for once, rather than being, as we have been since we joined the Community, at the head of a league which is depressing and negative, such as the unemployment league.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The expansion of export trade has been extremely marked in the past year, as the Minister has pointed out; he gave percentage figures and also absolute figures.  In the first eight months of this year the increase was nearly an increase of a half compared with the first eight months of the previous year.  That increase is accounted for by a number of factors that are not controversial.  So far as the world outside Britain is concerned, it is partly due to the devaluation of the English £ to which we are linked, which had the effect of rendering our products that much more competitive in price-sensitive areas.  It also had the effect of depressing relatively the rate of growth of Irish exports on the <Col N="356" /> British market and this, in turn, in another aspect of the fact which the Minister mentioned, namely, that the growth of Irish exports in the world outside the British market was relatively much greater.  Naturally, the benefit of devaluation did not operate between us and the British and that may account in part for the much slower growth in our exports to that market and our correspondingly lesser dependence on it compared with the growth in exports to other markets.</P>
    <P>Another factor which has played a major part in the growth of exports has been the role and contribution of a large number of grant aided IDA-introduced export orientated firms.  Many of them are highly capital intensive in spite of the best efforts of the IDA and the consequence is that the very steep rise in industrial production and exports has not unfortunately had a great impact on our unemployment figures.  Nevertheless, the benefit to the country from these new industries in other respects is very considerable and the IDA should not be left out of the credit that is being distributed here this morning.</P>
    <P>Another factor which I hope the House will regard as non-contentious is the beneficent influence on our trading situation of the wage agreement reached last year, after a very long period during which the Government were being urged by people on all sides to &ldquo;do what the Government were elected to do&rdquo;, namely, &ldquo;to govern&rdquo;.  Although they had not the courage to say so, what these people really meant was that the Government should impose a wage regime by force of law.  None of them bothered to look ahead and to ask themselves what would happen as soon as that regime ran up against the first picket, as soon as it was confronted with the necessity to arrest and fine somebody for defiance of the consequential provisions.  In other words, we were being urged to behave much like Mussolini would have been inclined to behave 40 years ago.  The Government of the day withstood all this pressure.  They turned the other cheek to all the abuse and patiently sat down with the other partners.  In <Col N="357" /> this connection I must give credit to two former Ministers in particular, Deputy Ryan and Deputy O'Leary; they worked very long hours to secure that agreement on which rest a large number of the favourable indicators which we now see.  Another Government are getting the benefit of this and, no doubt, they will claim credit. I do not whinge or complain about that because that is what politics is about.  I suppose we may have got the benefit of certain matters when we came into office, but I think I am entitled to put on record the fact that one of the very important factors in producing the happy state of affairs which the Minister emphasised a few minutes ago was the achievement of the Government which I served in obtaining a reasonable national wage settlement.</P>
    <P>I wish this Government the same success; but whether they will have the same success in persuading the people that what looked like unconditional promises of tax concessions were not, in fact, unconditional but were conditional on the achievement of a moderate wage settlement, is much more problematical.  Certainly I do not wish them success in that.  It is bad enough to have been the victim of misrepresentation, but to wish a person success in concealing his misrepresentation afterwards is superhuman virtue which I do not possess.</P>
    <P>Córas Tráchtála cannot be praised highly enough.  Their achievements in the large scale are documented by the debates here in this House and by their own report.  I have had a few dealings with them personally in the last few years and I cannot speak highly enough of the impression they made on me with regard to the thoroughness and willingness to invest immense quantities of expertise and efforts in tracing potential markets.  There were one or two occasions during the time we were in Government when privately and as an ordinary individual I wrote to them and suggested that products which I had observed were not in common use on the Continent but which were in very common use here might be the subject of an export effort.  I could not describe to the House the trouble Córas Tráchtála went to in order to <Col N="358" /> check that possibility and document it.  I am sure it had nothing to do with the fact that I was a TD; I am sure they would have given the same attention to anybody else.  I compliment them on their public relations on the small scale as well as on their very conspicuous achievements on the large scale.</P>
    <P>The report mentions a relatively new undertaking, the Irish Export Agency that was established in late 1975.  It is a division of Córas Tráchtála and it has the job of securing orders on a commission basis for Irish exporters in distant markets in the Far East and in the Middle East.  This service has yielded a modest amount of sales in its first year&mdash;about £1,250,000&mdash;but it is only starting.  My information is that Irish exporters, who may be in a large way of business by Irish standards but are in a very small way of business by world standards, have much appreciated this new service and they have made profitable use of it. The suggestion which I have heard made by authoritative people is that it might be a good thing if the operations of this division of Córas Tráchtála were extended to cover markets that are not so far distant as the Far East but which are still a little out of touch.  It might cover markets which may come within the EEC in the near future, or may already be in the EEC, but where the Irish export effort has been somewhat halting, where it has not been as successful as it has been in the nearer continental countries.</P>
    <P>To make the thing concrete.  I have heard the suggestion made that in Italy the Irish exporting effort has not been as confident and as effective as in France or in Germany.  It is somewhat more distant, the distribution systems and the way they do things in Italy are somewhat different and the relative unfamiliarity and distance of the terrain make it a relatively daunting prospect for Irish exporters.  I pass on this suggestion, which I got from authoritative sources&mdash;that Córas Tráchtála might consider extending the operation of this division to cover markets which are not geographically so distant, which are big markets.  The Italian market is a very big market.  I might also add to Italy the three countries which are <Col N="359" /> potential members of the Community, which looks like being enlarged in the near future, Spain, Portugal and Greece.  The very same considerations which I mentioned in regard to Italy will apply there.  They are just that bit further away, geographically, than Britain, France or Germany and their way of doing things is just that bit more unfamiliar.  It may be that Córas Tráchtála would consider that the possibility of extending the Agency's operations into Europe, even into the EEC or prospective members of the EEC, might be fruitful.</P>
    <P>I notice also in their report that they admit that the efforts that they have made in Eastern Europe have been a disappointment.  I should like to read two paragraphs from the report which state:</P>
    <P>The Board continues to be disappointed with progress, or lack of it, in Eastern Europe, except for Poland and Yugoslavia where reasonable headway has been made. Exporters and Córas Tráchtála staff have worked very hard in that area but their efforts have been largely unrewarded considering the results to date.  The return on Córas Tráchtála resources deployed towards Eastern Europe allied to individual firms' activities there, is less than proportionate to what has been accomplished elsewhere.</P>
    <P>Eastern European markets accounted for only 0.72 per cent of total Irish exports, with a value of £13.5 million, in 1976.  The board takes the view that evidence of a commercial nature is required to justify the continuation of our promotional efforts in Eastern Europe.  If future commercial results are not satisfactory, we shall have no alternative but to deploy our resources elsewhere.</P>
    <P>That is very frank language and I am glad that Córas Tráchtála and other State bodies will use frank language like that when it is needed.  I am sure the Minister will agree with me about this, because I heard him say some fairly sharp things about our diplomatic relations with Eastern Europe <Col N="360" /> when he was in Opposition.  It seems to me a pity that, at the very moment when we have established a couple of resident missions in Eastern Europe and have established other diplomatic relations on a non-resident basis, Córas Tráchtála should be expressing disappointment with trade efforts and also talking about the possible redeployment&mdash;in other words closing down&mdash;of the offices which they have got there.  They have got offices in Moscow and Warsaw.</P>
    <P>I will not tell Córas Tráchtála their business; but in the global national picture it is a pity that just after we have gone to the trouble at very considerable expense of setting up diplomatic representations with those countries, the main purpose for which the representation was established being the improvement of trade relationships, Córas Tráchtála are more or less prepared to throw their hats at it.  That is not the fault of Córas Tráchtála.  The problems of selling in communist countries are quite different from the problems of selling in capitalist countries.  Nobody disputes that and quite separate considerations apply.  It seems to me a sad thing that it should be so.</P>
    <P>The Eastern European countries with which we have got relations were very keen that these relations should be established.  The initiative in this regard by no means came from us&mdash; as I am sure the Minister, who was in Government at the time when decisions in principle were taken, will agree.  The value for the USSR or Czechoslovakia in having a representation in Dublin is of a quite different kind from the motive we might have in maintaining representation in Moscow.  We are not there to present a front for the capitalist or democratic world.  We may do that in a minuscule way but that is not our purpose.  If it were, we would make ourselves ridiculous by attempting to carry it out.  A small country like this cannot do anything of that scale, least of all in a country where communications are so rigidly controlled as they are in Russia.</P>
    <P>It is problematical what the Irish Embassy in Moscow can achieve but as <Col N="361" /> a gesture of anxiety to smooth détente and relations in the European world and the world generally the thing probably has a certain value.  The purpose of an Eastern European representation here is quite different, as can be seen from the enormous contrast&mdash;to which the Minister drew attention when he was is Opposition&mdash;between the size of the mission which is maintained in one capital compared with the mission maintained in the other.  The personnel attached to the USSR Embassy here is ten or twelve times larger than the personnel attached to our Embassy there.  Their purposes are of a quite different order.  I need not explore them; it would be an impertinence and a discourtesy to do so.  They are in no way dependent on the achievement of a beneficial trade relationship.  I have no doubt that even if the trade imbalance <i>vis-à-vis</i> the USSR were entirely in our favour the USSR Embassy would still be there with exactly the same personnel.</P>
    <P>When I was Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach I replied a few times to questions, the most recent occasion being October, 1976, about trade balance between us and the USSR and other European countries.  The thing was unsatisfactory with all of them. There may have been one or two years when by accident we had a favourable trade relationship with one or two of those countries.  Our trade relationship with Eastern Europe is, by and large, very disappointing, as Córas Tráchtála say.  I have the figures here which I gave in answer to a question from the Minister, when he was in Opposition in October, 1976, which showed an immense imbalance.  There were a couple of years, notably 1975, in which the imbalance was not so bad; I believe this was due to a sudden wool famine in the USSR which enabled us to export very large quantities of wool there.  In 1976, in the first seven or eight months about which I replied&mdash; the picture at the end of the year was no different&mdash;the imbalance was immense. Between January and August, 1976 the imports from the USSR were £13,857,000 and our exports there had not even reached the £1 million mark. That is a very serious imbalance.  I <Col N="362" /> have no authority to say this, as I have not consulted my party leader or Foreign Affairs spokesman about mentioning it: but personally I believe that where the main purpose from our point of view of representation in Eastern Europe has been so grossly disappointing, notwithstanding frequent prodding, we ought to review our diplomatic representation in that area in the same way that Córas Tráchtála are thinking of reviewing their commercial representation there.  I will say no more about it than that, because it is not my responsibility.  I feel I have to that extent in this particular matter, if on few others, a sympathetic ear across the way, and I do not think the Minister will differ from me in echoing the disappointment of Córas Tráchtála that matters should be as they are.</P>
    <P>The last thing I want to say has a bearing on the relatively new dimension which Córas Tráchtála have developed in regard to their contribution towards our development aid effort.  It is associated with a group which carries the name DEVCO.  It makes its skills available to the developing world through this umbrella.  It is a very good thing that the semi-State bodies have responded so enthusiastically to the suggestion of setting up an umbrella agency which would channel their skills and expertise into the developing world.  It seems a peculiarly appropriate thing for Ireland because we had been a developing country&mdash; and measured by many standards still are&mdash;and we had to pull ourselves up by our own bootlaces.  We are now in a position to teach to the people of other countries many of the things we learned, in the development of hydro-electricity, bog development, foreign marketing, the attraction of foreign industrial investment and the operation of customs free zones.  The efforts of the semi-State bodies in that regard cannot be too highly praised.</P>
    <P>To some extent this is an area of potential relief for our unemployment problem, certainly at the white collar level.  People are rushing through secondary school and into university looking for degrees in business management, commerce, accountancy and <Col N="363" /> disciplines of that kind.  We know that they cannot all be absorbed in Ireland, and unless we apply a rigorous system of entry to the universities many of these people will be very disappointed young adults and no conceivable amount of economic growth will provide enough jobs for them.  The potential for a good and rewarding career in the developing world under the umbrella of the semi-State bodies such as CTT is something we ought consciously to take into account in our planning for the reduction in the overall unemployment picture and for the reduction of the potential unemployment in this white collar area.  I join the Minister in commending the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I commend the Minister for the speedy introduction of this Bill, which has the full support of the Labour Party.  In fact, one can say that CTT have been one of the outstandingly successful State-sponsored bodies and have made a very positive contribution to the growth of Irish exports.  It is easy to set up a State-sponsored body and build an elaborate office in Sandymount and staff it with a lot of reasonably well-paid public servants and hope that an export drive will develop.  It is a different thing to staff some 19 offices throughout the world, to administer these offices by and large from Dublin and to ensure that the staff there bring about a growth in exports, particularly manufactured exports, to these 19 locations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The vast majority of politicians have never worked in factories and have never been personally involved in the export of goods and services. Unfortunately, the vast majority of us do not speak foreign languages and we are not trained in the ways of exporting. It was only during the past 15 or 20 years that young people worked abroad in CTT offices.  Many of them are of my own generation and I have the highest regard for those who are prepared to accept assignments as trade advisers, spend years living abroad, learn foreign languages and accept a status which is not held in the highest esteem.  There are not many Irish <Col N="364" /> people who are prepared to do that, particularly as public servants.  It gets under my skin when I hear people, including some in the private sector, making ideologically snide remarks about the role of the State-sponsored bodies, while at the same time they are only too glad whenever the occasion arises to dash for assistance to CTT or the IDA, accept that assistance and export successfully.  One would have to squeeze blood out of them to get them to admit that State-sponsored organisations such as CTT have a dynamic and innovative contribution to make within a mixed economy.  One reads in some of the quasi-political columns the reports of the chairmen of major companies who frequently avail themselves of the services of CTT.  One finds this back-handed compliment to the role of State-sponsored bodies, particularly CTT, the IDA, the IIRS and others who are directly involved in the manufacturing area.</P>
    <P>It is important that we should stress that we provide free of charge to overseas buyers and importers a wide range of facilities and a comprehensive advisory and information service on Irish merchandise and sources of supply. Those of us who have had recourse to the Irish Export Directory in the Dáil library or elsewhere know that CTT are making a major contribution.</P>
    <P>I am pleased that my colleague, Deputy Kelly, referred to the role of CTT <i>vis-à-vis</i> DEVCO.  I have the greatest regard for the individuals in CTT, the IDA or the IMI who have accepted assignments abroad under the auspices of DEVCO and other agencies and have made a contribution of technical assistance to the underdeveloped world.  These assignments are very arduous.  Recently I met a number of persons who have been abroad and certainly they have earned their money. It is not easy to go abroad and leave one's family for, perhaps, 18 months, coming home once or twice during that period.  These people deserve the regard of this House and it is time that we paid tribute to them.</P>
    <P>It is self-evident that there has been a major growth in industrial exports <Col N="365" /> during the past five years, particularly in 1976. and CTT have made an important contribution to that growth.  It is difficult to quantify that contribution precisely because we would have to segregate the IDA firms and the contribution they make.  If one could segregate the IDA contributions one would see the precise contributions of both the IDA and Córas Tráchtála.  That is not to say that the Córas Tráchtála contribution has not been of major benefit to the country.</P>
    <P>It is equally important that we should recognise the extent to which Córas Tráchtála have assisted in the diversification of our exports.  For example, in 1966 we exported 64 per cent of our merchandise to the UK.  In 1976 that figure was down to 48 per cent.  In 1966 our exports to the EEC were only 11 per cent.  Today our exports to the EEC are 27 per cent. The diversification of our industrial exports is an encouraging feature which is of importance to us and I welcome it.  At the same time, I would stress that 50 per cent of our exports still go to Britain.  In that regard the indications are that the economic upturn in the UK economy will continue to benefit our exports.</P>
    <P>One point made by people working in Britain is that the political situation has affected the growth of our exports to Britain.  There is no doubt that there has been resistence in certain areas.  For instance, in south Dublin an ESB transformer has borne the words &ldquo;Brits Out&rdquo; for the past six months.  Within half a mile of the transformer there are three major industrial plants which are frequently visited by British buyers.  One of them remarked to me that it is not very encouraging to have to pass this sign on each occasion he visits the plants. The casual acceptance of such slogans by local authorities does not help the growth of our exports.</P>
    <P>The genuine desire of the political parties to enact legislation of this nature could be jeopardised by the current disquieting spate of industrial disputes.  These disputes, in which there is an needless degree of internecine friction between individuals, particularly <Col N="366" /> in plants geared solely to exports, could affect industrial growth.</P>
    <P>I commend the Minister for introducing this essential legislation.  In their manifesto the Minister and his colleagues referred vaguely to consideration being given to a new credit export finance corporation.  One would be interested to know the precise relationship that would have with the current CTT operation and whether the Minister and his colleagues have given any definite consideration to the proposition.</P>
    <P>I support the Bill and look forward to a spurt in CTT's work for the country, work which, in a mixed economy, one of our State-sponsored bodies can be said to be making a major contribution.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister on his appointment and wish him luck in this very tough Department. I also wish to pay tribute to the CTT for the excellent work they have done.  It is extremely important to reassert as often as possible that the success of CTT depends entirely on our rate of inflation.  It is clearly understood that exports will dwindle if inflation is not held within reasonable limits.</P>
      <P>When he was referring to the national wage agreements which were successfully negotiated by the previous Government, Deputy John Kelly could have been more generous and stated that the first national wage agreement was negotiated by a Fianna Fáil Government. As a party Fianna Fáil are against statutory wage agreements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>It was also Fianna Fáil who made the first inflationary pay handout of 12½ per cent in 1964 in order to win two by-elections.  That is when inflation really got off the ground.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>It was under a Fianna Fáil Government that the first national wage agreement worked in this country. It is agreed that national wage agreements are the best means of controlling inflation.  It is less than two years since the former Taoiseach referred to the fact that 50 per cent of inflation was home-induced and could not be blamed <Col N="367" /> on the increasing cost of raw materials. It is important that we keep our costs down.  Manufacturers deserve much credit for this because CTT, if they are to be effective, must be backed by manufacturers who are as enthusiastic as are CTT in this regard.  However, all the incentives put at the disposal of manufacturers can be nullified by unreasonable wage demands.  I am sure I speak for everyone in the House in expressing the wish that another national wage agreement can be negotiated successfully.  The trade union movement here must consider carefully what is happening in Britain where, because certain sections of trade unions have ignored the interest of the country, the workers are beginning to turn on the unions.  A similar situation could develop here should the trade unions endeavour to challenge the Government in their efforts to reach reasonable settlements in wage agreements.</P>
      <P>We may take it that at least 90 per cent of the working population are anxious to continue in employment and that they are aware that unreasonable wage demands could put them out of work.  Consequently, the setting of guidelines in this area is as much a matter for the trade union movement as for the Government.  The workers, too, must realise the necessity for the trade unions to be reasonable and responsible.  The negotiations in respect of the next agreement are likely to be tough but I am optimistic enough to believe that the trade unions will do their part in keeping inflation under control.  The figure in respect of inflation has been reduced considerably since this Government came to office.  This is due partly to the removal of the road tax on motor cars and next year there will be the total abolition of rates on private dwellings, effecting a considerable increase in real incomes. This net increase in incomes will not mean that the people concerned will have to pay more income tax since they did not get relief in respect of rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill signals growth in the manufacturing field.  We want this growth to continue.  I should like to think that the Minister would be in a <Col N="368" /> position to bring forward a similar measure again in a few years' time seeking an increased amount of money, not as a result of inflation but in order to enable CTT to open offices in other countries.  Deputy Kelly referred to the closing of offices in certain countries where the balance of trade deficits are very much against us.  There is some merit in that idea.  However, in a situation in which, for instance, the products we were selling in a trade deficit situation were products that could not be sold anywhere else because of surpluses, it might be worth while leaving the office open.  In any case, we must be very careful in our negotiations with countries in which we are planning to open offices for the purpose of extending our trade.</P>
    <P>At a recent fair in Germany the total value of orders placed with Irish firms amounted to £7 million.  Much credit for this phenomenal success must go to CTT for having provided the necessary facilities for the manufacturers who exhibited at the fair. Within the past few weeks at a clothing fair here at home, one firm succeeded in getting orders to the extent of £1 million worth of goods.  All this indicates our ability to compete successfully. Our products are of a high quality but we must keep an eye on price levels because it is very important that we do not price ourselves out of the market.  It appears now that a certain discipline is manifesting itself in this area.  Much is heard of the differences between private enterprise and State enterprise, for instance, that the problems are not as many in private enterprise firms as is the case in semi-State bodies.  One could instance CIE and the ESB.  From certain sections we hear calls for the nationalisation of all industry but I am a great believer in the private enterprise system so long as it is given sufficient incentives.  If we can be relied on to keep our word in respect of tax concessions, for instance, to be able to assure manufacturers that such concessions will not be removed by some future Government, we shall be able to continue to attract industry into the country.  Unfortunately, this was not the case in respect of the mining industry.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="369" /> Deputy Desmond referred to such slogans as &ldquo;Brits out&rdquo; on some walls in the Clonskeagh area and he expressed the opinion that British visitors to the factories in the area would find such graffiti offensive.  I am sure British businessmen are mature enough to realise that we, too, have our lunatic fringe and that such activity does not reflect the views of the people as a whole.  There is no shortage of graffiti in Britain, either.</P>
    <P>One of the great ambitions of this small country has been to lessen as rapidly as possible our dependence on the British market.  Recent figures show that we have been successful in this regard within the past few years. The Minister told us that in 1976, 49 per cent of our exports went to the UK, compared with 56 per cent in 1974 and 66 per cent in 1971.  This is one of the benefits of our membership of the EEC.  It was something that we told the people about when we asked them to vote for membership.  The advantage of this reduction in our dependence on the British market enables us to diversify our exports.  Despite these changed circumstances we still need the British market and must continue to sell as much as possible in that area.  As our nearest neighbour Britain is the most accessible market to us.</P>
    <P>In conclusion there is one other point I should like to make.  When Deputy Kelly was referring to wage agreements he forgot to mention that they imposed a statutory wage freeze on the banks and this was something that we had never done.  It is not for them to point the finger at us.  I have made the points I have wanted to make.  I am delighted with the work that Córas Tráchtála are doing and continuing to do.  Genuine praise has come from all sides of this House for the last few years whenever a similar topic has been before us.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. F. O'Brien Mr. F. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to wish Deputy Máire Geoghegan-Quinn well in her new appointment.  It is a very important one and I have no doubt she will be very effective in that role.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am pleased to support the granting of these additional moneys for Córas <Col N="370" /> Tráchtála, who have been one of our greatest successes.  They have projected our goods in every part of the world in a very positive way.  We could be manufacturing here but without an effective sales force and agencies to go abroad and sell we would have our warehouses full of stock that we could not dispose of.  Without a good sales force there cannot be an effective export situation.  The figures speak well for themselves and show that over the last few years our exports have been increasing rapidly.  It is heartening to see that we are ahead of our competitors in Europe in this area.  That is due in no small measure to the expertise and dedication of the people in Córas Tráchtála.  This must be said because quite frequently in this House we knock semi-State bodies, sometimes justifiably, but where credit is due we should stand up and give it.</P>
    <P>I would like to see the Department of Foreign Affairs playing a role where Córas Tráchtála may not be useful. That Department should recruit people with business expertise and place them in the various offices.  We have a lot of such talent and one way of using it is to employ these people in the various offices as trade ambassadors abroad, thus ensuring that wherever they are Irish goods will be projected. We are an island country, we are vulnerable, and the only way we can live is by exporting.  If we do not export we die.  In the past people had ideas that we could be self-sufficient and live within our own four walls.  That myth has been long dispelled.  Our people want a higher standard of living and the only way we can achieve that is by getting into world markets and disposing of our products there.</P>
    <P>In passing I would like to pay a tribute to the IDA.  Both the IDA and Córas Tráchtála, while two separate bodies, are intertwined and have a lot in common, one developing the job potential within the country and the other selling the products manufactured by our various companies.  This relationship is working very well.  As previous speakers have said, while the IDA and Córas Tráchtála are doing their job very effectively, we here have the bigger role to play to ensure that <Col N="371" /> we remain competitive in our prices. The world has become a hard business place and if we are not able to compete we may move over and let somebody else who can do so.  That is one of the reasons why over the last few years our exports have risen dramatically despite the inflation which was world-wide and of which we had our share.  We improved, and this was reasonable.  Why?  Because we were able to negotiate reasonable wage agreements.  The last speaker mentioned at one stage that workers were moving away from the trade unions because they were not responsible.</P>

      <P>The trade union movement are a responsible movement and they have proved that over the years in the way they have negotiated. A number of times in the best interests of the country and to ensure that employment was maintained at as high a level as possible, they have had to talk their members into accepting a little less than the members hoped for. With regard to the statutory wage agreement I think it was introduced <i>vis-à-vis</i> the banks because many groups of people were behaving irresponsibly.  In this case I cannot say the workers behaved irresponsibly but the banks did.  They wanted to break away from these national wage agreements and to push the country into economic chaos.  That is what they were doing on the one hand and on the other hand they were telling the Government that they were spending too much money and were not controlling the economy.  These were people who at one stage were critical of the Government and yet were prepared to be most irresponsible.  A Government has to govern.  I am talking about only a very small fraction of the work-force. The great majority of the work-force were prepared to accept the line of the <Col N="372" /> national wage agreement.  They were in a perilous position and there was no alternative.  The Government did not put anybody in jail.</P>

      <P>Getting back to the straight and narrow again and talking about the whole area of exports, I wonder whether Córas Tráchtála would feel that it might be economic for them to have an office with a full regalia of staff and to employ some type of agent.  Export firms do that and they have agencies within other countries.  Do Córas Tráchtála, where they would not consider it economic to set up their own office, employ an agent to look after their interests?  Export firms have agencies in other countries.  If Córas Tráchtála do not appoint such agents, they should consider doing so with a view to encouraging Irish exports and as business expands eventually setting up their own office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One thing I am pleased about in regard to Córas Tráchtála and other State agencies is that they will be coming under the scrutiny of this House by way of the Committee that was set up and which I hope will be reconstituted.  While I have been complimenting Córas Tráchtála and the IDA, I believe that when this House votes money to such organisations it has the right to examine all aspects of them.  I have no doubt that Córas Tráchtála would welcome any such scrutiny, which is necessary to ensure that all our agencies are operating with the maximum efficiency.  When industrial disputes and major problems <Col N="373" /> affecting semi-State bodies arise, such bodies tend to isolate themselves.  I am sure when this examination has been carried out we will all be satisfied with the performance of these bodies, but it is important that the examination should be carried out.</P>
    <P>Again I welcome this motion increasing the amount to be voted from £25 million to £45 million.  I think it will ensure the continuance of exports, and I hope it will create many more jobs and lead to further economic growth.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to thank the House for the welcome that has been given to this Bill and for the various remarks that were made in support of and in appreciation of the efforts of CTT to promote exports since their establishment.  The export figures in recent years, as has been remarked, have been extremely commendable, but it is worth bearing in mind that, with the exception of the British market, our exporters have had over the last couple of years particular assistance in export markets because of the devaluation of sterling against the currencies of countries to which they are selling.  This tendency for sterling to lose its value appears happily to have come to an end and there is a movement in the opposite direction discernible in recent months. It is only right to sound a note of warning now that this may well have its effect on our export figures in the latter part of this year and in 1978.  I hope our exporters will continue their efforts notwithstanding, or indeed because of, this possible change in exchange rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Among a number of the matters which were mentioned here today was the question of the export agency which CTT established a year or so ago.  Its functions have been somewhat limited up to now.  It has been confined to selling directly on behalf of small companies which could not establish an export organisation of their own within their company, and its functions have been limited also to rather distant markets such as the Far East where small Irish firms, in <Col N="374" /> particular, could scarcely undertake any marketing operation.</P>
    <P>I have encouraged the board of CTT to consider strengthening the Irish Export Agency by increasing the number of personnel who are involved, by widening the range of products which it covers and perhaps also by extending the areas of its operation which at the moment are primarily the Far East and the Middle East.  One market in particular which has scarcely been touched at all by Irish exporters is the South American market, where there must be opportunities. However, I do not want Irish industry in general to get the feeling that CTT are now setting up a direct selling organisation which will do the work for them.  I would urge the firms concerned to realise that the primary export effort must be made by themselves and that this agency is designed only to assist small firms and to assist them in markets which would otherwise be very difficult or almost impossible for them to operate in.</P>
    <P>The primary function of CTT is not as a direct selling agency.  It is a promotional agency to give advice and assistance of various kinds to firms who are primarily engaged in exporting their own products.  Nevertheless, I look forward within these limitations to an extension of the activities of the agency.</P>
    <P>I look forward to more small Irish firms&mdash;by &ldquo;small&rdquo; I mean, generally speaking, firms of the size that would be regarded as small industries by the IDA&mdash;availing of the services of this agency in selling to the more remote markets.  It is not envisaged that at any time this agency would operate in Europe either inside or outside the EEC, because the European market, relatively speaking, has easy access for even small firms.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kelly spoke of the position of our trade with Comecon countries. I referred to this last August when I gave some indication of the Government's feelings in this respect.  I support the views expressed by CTT in their 1976 report issued a few months ago.  Those views were cited by Deputy Kelly today.  We continue to stand in a very serious imbalance in <Col N="375" /> our trade with Eastern European markets generally.  The imbalance is not any better proportionately than it was in 1971-72 before we opened resident diplomatic relations with the USSR and opened up our contacts with Eastern Europe generally.</P>
    <P>It is a matter of considerable disappointment to the Government that notwithstanding our embassy in Moscow, in the past four years or so there has not been any improvement in our balance of trade with Russia and Eastern European countries generally. This exists notwithstanding considerable efforts at the political level by my predecessor and by the former Minister for Foreign Affairs to improve that situation.  I can only repeat what I said in August, that unless there is an indication at an early date of a political will on the part of Eastern European Governments to bring about some degree of progress towards equalisation of trade between them and Ireland, the Government and CTT will have to think again about the degree of effort that should in future be devoted to trying to sell in Eastern European markets.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The position of trying to sell in Comecon countries is quite different from selling in a free democratic country where one is free to approach individual firms and organisations in an effort to sell one's products. There is no such freedom in Eastern European countries where one is dealing with a Government-directed centralised agency, or agencies, and unless political decisions are made in these countries that there should be an effort to bring about equalisation of trade with Ireland or, for that matter, any other Western countries, then that equalisation will not take place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems strange that we as the only non-member of NATO in the EEC should continue to suffer such an extremely adverse balance of trade with Eastern European countries generally.  I hope it will be realised that this imbalance cannot be allowed to continue and that steps must be taken to rectify it.  There is nothing further <Col N="376" /> we on our side can do.  As I have said, it is a disappointment to us that the opening of resident diplomatic relations with an exchange of ambassadors has not led to any improvement in the trade situation.  I do not think we can wait a great deal longer for these developments to take place. If they do not we will have to concentrate our efforts on encouraging efforts in markets which are more likely to be lucrative.</P>
    <P>It must be emphasised that for us exports are not just figures on paper. In a very real way they represent jobs here, the creation and retention of jobs, and jobs represent the national priority from the point of view of this Government.  Therefore, CTT and our export efforts generally will have the fullest support in our endeavours to develop export markets.  There are few countries in which exports play such a fundamental part in job creation and retention as here, a small country with 3.5 million people. Any hope for expansion or improvement here rests almost exclusively on the need to expand our foreign trade.  Up to 50 per cent of our GNP derives directly from foreign trade and the significance of this proportion can only be realised fully when one remembers that the corresponding US figure is in the region of 6 per cent.  We are a very open economy, fiercely dependent on our freedom to trade with other nations and, generally speaking, anxious to see the trading avenues of the world kept as open and free as possible because, in the long run, we must be the gainers rather than the losers by a movement in the world towards freedom of trade.</P>
    <P>The special section within CTT was referred to, the section that gives aid to developing countries.  This is referred to within CTT as technical assistance and I am happy to say that that small section has assisted 51 developing countries either by providing assistance in the countries concerned or services here such as training for the benefit of nationals of those countries.  Such activities are important in an international sense but there can be no question of them <Col N="377" /> being allowed to impinge unduly on the export activities of CTT.  The services I have been talking about generally speaking are provided without cost to this country because there is full recoupment from various international agencies of the cost of the limited number of staff involved.</P>
    <P>Deputy F. O'Brien suggested that the Department of Foreign Affairs might consider the business expertise available when sending officials to our embassies abroad and he suggested that such people could act as trade ambassadors where CTT personnel may be thin on the ground.  That is a suggestion I shall certainly convey to the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  It would, of course, be a matter for him to decide on.  The suggestion is not entirely novel inasmuch as other countries operate in this way.  I should certainly like to see our foreign diplomatic representation broadened to some extent to take account of the fact that our trading interests are perhaps one of the most important interests abroad and so a greater trading emphasis in our diplomatic representation might not be out of place bearing in mind what other countries do in this regard.</P>
    <P>I have covered the majority of the points made but if there are any points to which I have not actually replied I shall be glad to convey whatever information is required privately to the Deputies concerned.</P>
    <P>I am obliged to the House for the welcome given to the Bill.  There is, I think, a general realisation of the importance of the work which CTT are doing and a general appreciation of the successes they have achieved.  We should not see the work of CTT in trying to promote exports as something separate from the tremendous national task of job creation.  CTT have made a very substantial contribution to the creation and maintenance of jobs in encouraging and enabling firms to move into export markets particularly in the realm of manufacturing industry. Such firms have been enabled thereby to expand in a way in which they could not have expanded without the help of CTT.  I look forward to CTT <Col N="378" /> further intensifying their work and that body can be assured of my help and co-operation at all times as they have, indeed, the help, goodwill and co-operation of Members on both sides of the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Colley) George Colley">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Colley)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to raise the statutory limit on the borrowing powers of the Industrial Credit Company and to bring up to date the formula for converting into their equivalent in Irish currency borrowings by the company in foreign currencies and guarantees of borrowing in foreign currencies given by the Minister for Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="379" /> The Industrial Credit Company was set up in 1933 to provide industrial credit mainly of a long-term nature. Since its establishment there has always been a statutory limit placed on the extent to which it may borrow for the carrying on of its operations, and this limit has been extended from time to time as occasion required by amending legislation.  The existing limit on borrowing is £75 million. Outstanding borrowings now total £72 million and are rising rapidly as the company's business continues to expand. On the basis of firm commitments already entered into by the company it is probable that the statutory limit will be reached by mid-November, 1977.  It is essential, there-fore, that the present limit be raised to enable the company to continue its very useful work.  The new limit proposed in section 2 of the Bill is £200 million.  An increase of £125 million may be considered to be very large. ICC business is, however, steadily growing and is at present at a level of above £30 million per annum and it is likely that this growth will continue. Lendings of £30 million would involve borrowings by the company of some £25 million.  Hence an increase of the limit on borrowing to £200 million should suffice to enable the company to borrow its requirements for a further four to five years before Oireachtas approval has again to be sought.  I do not think that Deputies will regard this period as too long.</P>
    <P>For the purpose of determining to what extent any particular borrowing in foreign currency counts against the statutory limit which is expressed in Irish currency, existing legislation had incorporated in it a formula for converting the foreign currency into Irish currency.  The existing formula provides that the basis for conversion shall be the International Monetary Fund parities in operation at the date of borrowing.  This formula is no longer appropriate because of the increasing number of exchange rate changes and the prevalence of floating rates at present, and it is proposed to up-date the formula in the manner set out at section 2 (b).  A similar updating <Col N="380" /> is necessary in the case of the formula for converting into Irish currency borrowings in foreign currency which are guaranteed by the Minister for Finance pursuant to powers conferred by existing legislation. The new formula is to be found at section 3.</P>
    <P>In the year to December, 1977, the company has budgeted to provide financial facilities totalling £30 million for industry.  In the previous 12 months the company disbursed £27 million which was in itself a record figure. Of the £30 million which the company will advance up to December next, £5.3 million relates to loans for the building of new vessels within the country and will be disbursed by its subsidiary company, Shipping Finance Corporation.  The balance will be disbursed by the ICC itself for the benefit of industry in general.  Most of the capital needed by the ICC is secured from non-Exchequer sources and it is hoped that this position will continue. The capital required for the operations of the Shipping Finance Corporation is provided by the Exchequer as it is re-lent at a subsidised rate of interest.</P>
    <P>Over the last decade the ICC has expanded its activities considerably. The company's main activity is the provision of longer term loans but it also offers a wide and sophisticated range of other facilities to meet the complex demands of industry.  These include share investment in industry, capital underwriting and issuing house services, hire purchase facilities for plant and machinery, equipment leasing and finance for distribution.  In addition to the provision of capital it has also a subsidiary company, Mergers Limited, which specialises in the field of mergers and takeovers by undertaking share evaluations and by advising in negotiations for mergers between firms.  As I have already mentioned, it is also concerned with shipbuilding finance through its other subsidiary company, Shipping Finance Corporation.</P>
    <P>In view of the need for higher industrial investment to promote economic growth, there will be a continuing and increasing demand for the facilities provided by the company, particularly in the climate of greater <Col N="381" /> optimism which is currently manifesting itself.  I am most anxious, there-fore, that the company should be in a position to contribute to industry the financial and organisational expertise which it has built up over the years in addition to financial assistance. The present legislation, when enacted, will enable the company to maintain an appropriate flow of funds to industry.</P>
    <P>Because of the probable high rate of demand for industrial finance over the next few years, as industrial investment continues to recover and because of the capital intensive nature of modern industry, it may not be easy for the company to procure without recourse to the Exchequer all the funds which industry is likely to require. In seeking funds from the Exchequer the company's requirements would have to be balanced against demands on behalf of other important services.  It is hoped therefore that the initiative shown by the company in the past in raising capital from non-Exchequer sources can be maintained and intensified.</P>
    <P>For over 40 years the ICC has been to the fore in the financing of Irish industry.  Many of the successful industries established over that period started from modest beginnings with the assistance of finance provided or arranged by the company.  Facilities are provided for the establishment of new industries as well as the expansion of existing firms and the company has a tradition of giving special attention to proposals in regard to small projects. The continuing increase in the demand for the company's facilities is proof that its importance has in no way diminished with the emergence of present-day financial institutions in the private sector.  The present legislation will enable the company to continue its important role in the development of the economy and I confidently recomend the Bill for the approval of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill and I am very heartened to see that the ICC have so expanded their business and have such confidence in the country and the basis on which <Col N="382" /> industry can expand and grow that they now seek to increase from £75 million to £200 million the amount of money they require.</P>
      <P>Before dealing with the Bill, I should like to say that two people died in the past year who had a very significant bearing on the growth of the ICC&mdash;Dr. Beddy and Mr. Denis Herlihy, both past chairmen.  Both were products of the Department of Industry and Commerce and were both exemplary public servants inside the Department and in the less rarefied atmosphere of the commercial world. There are many such people in the country&mdash;I mention these two particularly because they were associated with the company&mdash;who began their careers as civil servants&mdash;one very eminent one has been elevated to the Seanad in the last six weeks&mdash;and who moved out afterwards and contributed very greately to the progress of the country.  There is a long list of them and I should like to pay tribute to all of them, but particularly to the late Dr. Beddy and the late Mr. Denis Herlihy.</P>
      <P>In welcoming the Bill I want to make a few points about it.  When the company was set up the Minister guaranteed a proportion of the fund and this remained up to the 1974 amendment of the Act.  At that time the amount of money required was raised from £30 million to £75 million but the guarantee was also raised at that time from £30 million to £75 million.  Now the Minister is raising the amount of money from £75 million to £200 million.  Why has that change been made on this occasion back to the position as it was prior to 1974?  Perhaps there is a reason for it, but in view of the very impressive amount of money the ICC now require they may need the guarantee for the total sum involved.  Perhaps the Minister would clarify that in his reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A measure of the success of the ICC over the past 4 years is the number of amendments there have been to the Act.  Originally, they were limited to borrowing the equivalent of £12 million. This was increased in 1971 to £30 million and to £75 million in 1974. Now it is £200 million.  As the chairman <Col N="383" /> of ICC said in the latest report, which was out almost exactly 12 months ago, 31st October, 1976, they had seen even at that stage&mdash;and this report I think came to the general meeting earlier this year&mdash;on the accounts up to the end of 1976 a significant improvement in the economic atmosphere.  He was concerned even then about that situation and I presume that it was as a result of discussions they then had that they came to the Minister requesting that the amount of capital should be increased to £200 million.</P>
    <P>Section 2 also changes slightly the limitation of power to borrow the foreign currency.  From memory I think this is not original, that it also happened in the case of Aer Lingus.  Perhaps the Minister would enlighten me on that point.</P>
    <P>I was quite shattered when the previous Minister came into the House seeking to have this amount raised from £30 million to £75 million.  At that stage, the borrowings were £22 million, roughly 75 per cent of the amount available to the company.  Now they have gone almost to the brink and there is considerable urgency about the passing of this Bill.  I can assure the Minister I will facilitate him in every way, but evidently we have run into a technical difficulty as regards the operations of this House.  I think more money will be required by mid-November and it may be that the Bill will not have passed through the two Houses by that time.  The Minister can be assured of my co-operation in getting it through the House as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>I have been asked to make a small technical point.  In his private capacity the Minister might be better able to answer it than I am to make it.  It is about the desirability of including a subsection on which certified lawyers could rely to the effect that a certificate by a Minister that his guarantee in any particular case did not extend his £75 million limit and that the borrower could rely on this in some way.  It is a technical point which would allow lawyers to assure companies with whom they were negotiating that the guarantee <Col N="384" /> by the Minister was effective and that the money involved did not extend over the £75 million but, if there was a shortfall at that stage, the firm involved might find themselves liable for part of the debt over the £75 million. It is a lawyer's point and probably the Minister would appreciate it better than I would.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned mergers and he also mentioned The Shipping Finance Corporation.  I see that 24th January, 1977, was the date of the annual general meeting of the ICC.  In his address the chairman said:</P>
    <P>During the year, Irish National Trading Corporation Limited was set up.  This is a partnership between four major concerns in the private sector and the Government; we are holding the Government's 20 per cent share and are represented on the Board of the new company by our General Manager.  We believe that the company's services will be of considerable benefit to Irish industry, particularly to small and medium-sized firms which could not readily afford to set up elaborate export organisations for themselves.</P>
    <P>I would be interested to know how this company are doing.  The previous Minister made the point, reasonably legitimately, that CTT were not there to sell goods but to open markets.  They are a promotional body and the major effort towards selling goods outside the country must come from firms involved themselves.  The company were set up in response to that need, where small and medium-sized firms could not afford the sales services, market research and pilot schemes necessary in, perhaps, very distant parts of the world to export goods.  As the previous Minister said a few moments ago, exports are jobs.  We are all concerned about jobs and getting the highest rate of employment possible.</P>
    <P>I am anxious to know from the Minister exactly how this rather novel method of Government and private sector involvement in exporting and in helping small firms is working, and whether the high hopes referred to by the chairman in January have been realised.  I am not sure why, but originally the board of The Shipping Finance Corporation were separate <Col N="385" /> from the ICC.  They appear from the copy of the accounts I have here to have now been merged into the ICC. There may have been a good reason for that.  In the maritime and shipbuilding industry there is a separate kind of mentality, or psychology, or business acumen which needs to be applied to them different from that applied to ordinary commercial dealings engaged in by landlubbers generally. Members of the board of The Shipping Finance Corporation and, I presume, their staff would have had this rapport and sensitivity about shipping and maritime matters generally.</P>
    <P>The last ship financed by The Shipping Finance Corporation was a Danish ship to be built in the dockyard in Cork.  The type of finance needed is somewhat different. Generally speaking, I understand what happens is that the ship is mortgaged to the finance company, in this case the Shipping Finance Corporation, to the extent of 70 per cent, or so, and the balance is unsecured.  Now The Shipping Finance Corporation may be looking for more than that.  There is a danger because of the merger of the two boards that this may happen: they may be applying the normal different and more rigid rules of banking and the money market to shipping which needs a different approach and a more sensitive and a softer approach.</P>
    <P>As I say I am not sure why the two boards were amalgamated.  The Minister might discuss with the board the desirability of again separating the board of The Shipping Finance Corporation and allowing them to engage in this delicate and different matter which needs a more sensitive approach than is normally given in commercial dealings and in banking. This is particularly important at the moment because of the dockyards here which will be requiring orders and because of the fact that Irish people should be encouraged to get into shipping. A regrettably high proportion of our trade is carried by foreign-owned vessels.  I hope more Irish people will be encouraged to get into shipping because of the profits involved because, in the end, that is the motivation of anybody who invests money, and <Col N="386" /> that they will be shown the possibility of making profits by The Shipping Finance Corporation and encouraged to invest in ships to be built in this country.  I do not think any of our shipping yards would want preferential treatment in that regard.</P>
    <P>There is another point I should like to take from the chairman's address. It should provide the ethos in which the ICC operate and it should provide their motivation.  In a company established as long as this company, 40 years, there would be a danger that unless they kept themselves continuously aware of the difference of their function from that of the normal commercial banks, they might tend to drift towards absolute security with regard to the money they lend.  They were not set up for that.  I was very pleased that the chairman in the paragraph under the heading &ldquo;The Year Ahead&rdquo; said:</P>
    <P>(d)  For an environment which welcomes enterprise, there should be facilities for those with good ideas or new inventions who lack sufficient capital to bring those ideas or inventions to fruition.  We have accordingly ear-marked a proportion of our funds for financing what are generally described as &ldquo;venture capital&rdquo; propositions.  One of the difficulties of such propositions is that the failure rate is very high indeed.  In considering those which come before us, we shall try to blend reasonable business prudence with a willingness to take risks somewhat above the average.</P>
    <P>That sums up the attitude the Industrial Credit Corporation should have. The normally well secured collaterally-backed loan can be got from a commercial bank but what is called in that publication &ldquo;venture capital&rdquo; is what is needed.  I accept that the ICC in such a case can run a risk.  We do not want them to be foolish and give money to every hare-brained scheme put before them but there is a grey area between the hare-brained and the absolutely secured risk.  History is littered with examples of people who had good ideas but found it very difficult to get the capital to back them.  If the ICC are now going to <Col N="387" /> deliberately set aside part of their funds to see that people who would find it extremely difficult, if not impossible, to get money from the ordinary commercial sources to back their faith in themselves and their new venture, then the corporation are on the correct lines.  They are underlining again the reason why they were set up and, for that reason, I am happy to agree that the House should extend their borrowings from £75 million under the 1974 Act to £200 million, as proposed by the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickKerrigan" hpid="Mr. Kerrigan Mr. Kerrigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kerrigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill. In doing so I am aware of the work carried out by the ICC over the years. There is no doubt that they proved helpful to industry through good and bad times.  In accepting this Bill we are showing the company we have faith in them.  In relation to the £5.3 million for the building of new vessels here, I am to take it that this figure is a once-off or is it a continuing proportion of the £200 million over the year?  It is essential that we improve our position with regard to the carrying of our imports and exports in our own ships and that we take a higher percentage of this by increasing our merchant shipping capacity.  The more adventurous we are in helping small industries the better and while the record of the ICC has been second to none in this regard I hope they will not lessen their effectiveness in this field.  I hope they help smaller industries more.  I wish the Minister well in his future dealings with the ICC and I am pleased to support the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill and I should like to congratulate the Minister on his appointment as Tánaiste and Minister for Finance.  We welcome the Bill because it is a mark of our confidence in ourselves.  The Minister encouraged the company to borrow from non-Exchequer sources and in my view this is essential.  We are reaching the stage here when we look to the State for everything, particularly with regard to money, and, therefore, it is a healthy sign to hear our Minister urging the ICC to borrow money outside <Col N="388" /> Government circles.  As the money will be loaned to a concern who are aiming to provide more employment, we should suggest to the corporation that they involve themselves more in the everyday lives of our people.  Few people know anything about the ICC. There is a great opportunity also for the trade unions to invest their money in the ICC and encourage their members to do so.  We would then have this unity of purpose whereby a semi-State concern would have the backing of our trade unions.  In return the trade unions could expect a double award. They would see their money being used to provide employment and also earn a good return on it.  If we are to solve our unemployment problem every facet of our society must become involved.  It is not good enough to leave everything to the Government. The Government must be supported by everybody.</P>
      <P>The ICC played a noble part in our history.  The Bill seeks to amend an Act passed in 1933 when our industrial revolution started.  Since then many things have been done but when we look at the unemployment figures we realise the great task facing us all.  I view the Bill as a sign of our earnestness to get on with the job of building up our economy and affording an opportunity to everybody to have a worth-while standard of living.  I should like to draw the attention of the Minister to subsection (b) of section 2 which states:</P>
      <P>(iii)  money so raised or borrowed in a currency other than the currency of the State shall be deemed to be the equivalent in the currency of the State of the actual money raised or borrowed,...</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I raise this matter because when on a trip to Eastern Europe recently a number of us found that Irish money was not accepted.  In most cases the people insisted on being paid in American dollars.  For people so anti-American I was surprised to hear them insist on being paid in American dollars.  In some cases we were told that American dollars were not worth anything.  They flatly refused Irish money and in many cases refused British money.  Will the Minister investigate <Col N="389" /> this matter and tell us if our money is being recognised and honoured abroad.  On that occasion I did not see any Irish products on display.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">

    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>We saw very few but I saw Scotch whisky on display.  They would not even sell Scotch whisky for Irish money.</P>
      <P>I welcome this Bill which is another chapter in our drive towards a better economy and a better way of life.  I would ask the Minister to bear in mind the points I made and to extend an invitation to the trade unions to look at this investment.  I would not attempt to suggest to the trade unions how they should spend their money, but they might just think about this. I know that many of our 93 trade unions are not rich, but some are solvent and in the past, they contributed to Government loans.  Today, when we need more jobs, is an ideal time for the unions and the employers' associations to invest in the ICC and help in the employment drive.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to delay the House.  I welcome this Bill and would like to add my voice to those of other Deputies who praised the important role ICC play in the development of the economy.  It is vital that a Bill like this is brought before the House to allow the company to continue their good work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister spelled out the various facilities given by this company, which include share investment in industry, capital underwriting, issuing house services, hire purchase facilities for plant and machinery, equipment leasing and finance for distribution.  Would it be possible to extend the facilities of ICC to incorporate bond financing?  I am thinking now of small companies who are procuring overseas orders.  They are finding it very difficult to come up with the necessary insurance or contract bonds.  I have been giving some thought recently to how some of these companies might be able to get around this difficulty; it is not insurmountable <Col N="390" /> but it is causing a number of problems. That is why I am asking if, within the establishment order for ICC, it would be feasible to come up with the financing of bonds.</P>
    <P>I note that the subsidiary company, Shipping Finance Corporation, is involved.  It is essential that capital be made available for shipbuilding because at this moment many of our vessels need renewal because of age. Capital must be made available to enable owners to go ahead with the renewal and improvement of their vessels.</P>
    <P>I would like to take this opportunity of wishing the Minister well in his appointment.  He has a difficult task but I know he is extremely competent and will be able to deal with them. Tá súil agam go n-éireoidh go geal leis san Aireacht agus guím dea-ghuí ar a obair.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister on his appointment and wish him well.  Like other Deputies I welcome this Bill to increase the borrowing powers of this company.  I should like to direct my remarks to selling this company to the Irish people who have money to invest.  As Deputy Moore mentioned, very few people know the good work this company are doing in financing industries and shipping.  If anybody has money to invest he would be very patriotic if he invested it in this company.  I do not know how much capital trade unions have to invest, but any Irish group who have money should be encouraged to invest it in Irish companies, such as the ICC and the ACC, which are likely to provide many jobs.</P>
      <P>Shipping was mentioned here.  Many of the older generation know what Irish Shipping did for this country during the Second World War.  They played a vital part in helping to maintain our neutrality during the war. Many of these ships are getting old and need to be replaced.  It is essential that we should always have a good fleet and we should encourage everybody importing or exporting goods to use Irish ships.  Therefore every encouragement should be given to this company to finance the replacement of these ships.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="391" /> When we talk about financing industry we should place greater emphasis on small industries.  It is in this area that this company could take the odd risk.  If you take a risk to finance a big company the risk is very high and we know many such companies went down the drain.  There are a number of small companies which could employ a few people.  Our unemployment situation makes us, perhaps, too ambitious: unless we hear of an industry which is prepared to make a big impact on our unemployment situation we do not think it is of much use.  For that reason loan companies may not be included to even consider helping small businesses.  If we had a very large number of small businesses employing two, three or four people we might be on better wicket.  Again I would ask that greater emphasis be placed on financing small industries. In my view it is up to every Irishman, woman or group who has money to invest to make sure that it is invested in companies like the ICC and the ACC.  I welcome this Bill.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I also expressed my thanks on behalf of the ICC to all the Deputies who participated in this debate and I thank them for welcoming the Bill. The reaction from all sides of the House is a good measure of the appreciation there is of the tremendously important and successful work which the ICC have carried out over the years in which they have been operating.  In the early years they operated very much on their own.  One of the reasons for their foundation was that at that time it was difficult for Irish industries starting up to obtain the necessary finance and capital from the normal commercial sources.  We have come a long way since that time and to some extent the ICC are now competing with commercial banks.  As far as I am concerned that is a good thing and it indicates the development which has taken place in the general thinking in financial and commercial circles <Col N="392" /> over the years.  This change was brought about in no small way by the ICC.</P>
    <P>I wholeheartedly join in the very warm tribute paid by Deputy Barry to the late Dr. Beddy and to the late Mr. Denis Herlihy.  I had the pleasure of knowing both of them personally and the pleasure of appointing the late Mr. Denis Herlihy as chairman of the ICC.  I fully agree with Deputy Barry's assessment of their dedication and of the importance of the role they played in the ICC and of the other many facets of their careers.</P>
    <P>In the context of the general welcome for this Bill a number of points were raised.  Deputy P. Barry asked whether the change embodied in this Bill in regard to the formula for calculating the amount of borrowing in foreign currency had been made in other cases. It has been made in a number of cases.  Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann is one example but there are a number of other examples where the same formula is being used.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Will it be extended to other State companies?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, as the opportunity occurs.  This is a small point but in the absence of it we could find ourselves without any certainty as to whether a State company was or was not exceeding its statutory limit of borrowing power.  The Deputy also raised the point as to why we were not proportionately increasing the amount of borrowing by a company which the Minister can guarantee.  Consideration was given to this question in the preparation of the Bill.  At the moment the guarantee limit is £75 million whereas the actual amount guaranteed is only £26 million, so it does not appear that there is any necessity to increase that limit at the moment.  I assure the Deputy that that is the only reason and that there is no question of principle involved and that if it was necessary to increase the limit it would be increased.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>If what the Minister says is correct this will not come back to the House for four years.  It would have to wait until then.</P>

    <Col N="393" />
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>That is true, but on the figures worked out on a somewhat similar basis to the one on which we worked out the £200 million it would not appear to be necessary to increase the existing limit of £75 million on the guarantee for that period.  If any problem arose this could be done, but no problems are anticipated.</P>
      <P>Deputy Barry also raised what he described correctly as a technical point in regard to a certificate by the Minister as to the statutory limit not having been exceeded.  I am not quite sure of the significance of the point raised but I will certainly look into the matter and see if it is necessary to make provisions in that regard.  These provisions can be made between now and Committee Stage if necessary.  The Deputy will appreciate that as regards the question of the guarantee in relation to the ICC we are well within the statutory limits and as regards the overall borrowing by the ICC this Bill should provide adequate statutory cover for the borrowing by the ICC.</P>
      <P>Deputy Barry also raised a question about the Irish National Trading Corporation Limited and asked in effect how it was progressing.  This company is largely under the auspices of the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy and it was established only quite recently.  An assessment of its performance might be difficult at this stage, but I will undertake, having made the necessary inquiries in so far as any assessment is possible, to communicate the result to the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Barry and others who spoke raised some questions in connection with Shipping Finance Corporation. Shipping Finance Corporations is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Industrial Credit Company but has a separate board.  It was established in 1961 and was always, since its establishment, a subsidiary of the Industrial Credit Company.  The shipping finance provided by that company is very competitive.  Indeed in to-day's world it would need to be because we all know that the whole of the shipbuilding industry is so competitive it is very difficult to engage in without losing money.  My own suspicion&mdash;I <Col N="394" /> cannot say this from firm knowledge &mdash;is that shipbuilding is very heavily subsidised by Governments all round the world.  There may be some yards which are not being subsidised, but if there are I am not aware of them at present.  It makes the position of Irish shipyards all the more difficult. However, Shipping Finance Corporation do provide finance at very competitive rates.  Up to 70 per cent of the cost is advanced and security for that amount is sought.  As I indicated in my opening speech, they provide subsidised interest rates.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kerrigan, I think, raised this point also.  I want to tell him that the £5.3 million referred to is a once-off operation to finance the building of a ship.  It is a question really of getting the business in the shipyard. When it is got Shipping Finance Corporation are there to finance it on concessionary terms.  For instance, an 8 per cent rate of interest is charged repayable over seven years.  Even in current terms&mdash;that is, in terms of falling interest rates&mdash;that is competitive.</P>
    <P>There is one point Deputy Barry touched on in regard to the financing of shipbuilding about which I want to say a word.  In effect I think he was urging that we should be as helpful as possible in regard to the financing of shipbuilding.  There is one aspect of this perhaps I should mention, that is, that in the course of the last few years a change was made.  I was reminded of this by what Deputy Barry said about perhaps the purchase and lease-back of a ship&mdash;that kind of arrangement about which he spoke. In recent years there was a method of financing shipbuilding done by some commercial banks the practical effect of which was that the bank got the benefit&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;on what seemed to be terms that would not have been available otherwise.  Indeed in one case I do not think the ship would have been built&mdash;certainly not for quite some time&mdash;had that facility not been available.  However, my predecessor decided that that was not a good thing. He had an objection to this facility being made available technically to a commercial bank when it was intended for a shipping company and he made changes in the law which precluded that kind of operation in the future.  I questioned it on a few occasions but my predecessor insisted that he was taking the right course.  I am not convinced that he was and I propose taking another look at that situation. I mention that merely incidentally to the point raised about the whole financing of shipbuilding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies Barry, Moore and Callanan referred in the course of their contributions to the necessity for the Industrial Credit Company to give assistance to small firms and in the case of venture capital.  As indicated in the report of the company, a certain proportion of the company's available resources is set aside for venture capital schemes.  I support this approach fully as do the Deputies who spoke on this.  I think I indicated earlier that when the Industrial Credit Company were founded they were needed to provide capital for what would then have been regarded as venture capital which was not available in the main from commercial banks and other sources at that time. Despite their growth and respectability &mdash;if one may call it such&mdash;I am very pleased that the Industrial Credit Company are still setting aside a certain amount of their resources for venture capital.  It is not sufficiently realised how important this is in our economy, particularly today when we have such a major problem of unemployment.  Given the basic economic system we operate there are no more important people here today than <i>entrepreneurs</i> who will get business going and create employment. &ldquo;<i>Entrepreneur</i>&rdquo; is a term some people would think of as being derogatory; others would think of it as describing people engaged in a very <Col N="396" /> big way of business.  I do not mean it in either sense at all.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am saying this is the sense in which it is frequently used.  I am using it in the sense of the kind of person who has in his or her makeup the ability to start a business and make it successful.  It is not realised that the proportion of the population with this ability is quite small.  Very few of us in this House have it; there are some of us who have but very few. That is not necessarily a criticism of us.  Neither is it a criticism of that small proportion of the population who have it that they have it.  It is time we realised, certainly in our present circumstances, that they are the most important people in the country, that we have got to encourage people with that ability to get up and go and put everything they have into the establishment and expansion of successful business which will create employment.  They are the two requirements: business has to be successful and has to create employment.  The role of the Industrial Credit Company in helping such people can be vitally important.  That is why I welcome the setting aside of a proportion of their resources for venture capital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nevertheless, I want to be quite realistic about this.  The Industrial Credit Company can do a great deal; but there are people who have the ability to start off a business who would not get assistance from the Industrial Credit Company in the normal way even under the venture capital provisions.  I think it was Deputy Callanan who touched on this point.  We tend to think in terms of a big industry.  What we do not realise is that a man with a particular skill living in a small village who starts up a business and employs two or three people is vitally important in the context of that village.  There are people capable of this throughout the country. I do not think the ICC are geared to deal with such people and, to that extent, perhaps I should not be talking about this matter but of the importance of encouraging this kind of skill, <Col N="397" /> industry and entrepreneurial spirit.  It is so important that I hope I will be allowed to speak on this topic for a moment or two.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>As Minister for Industry and Commerce.  When I set up the small industries scheme of course the question of financing these people was one of the major problems.  I had detailed discussions with the ICC at the time and I could see part of their difficulty.  Let us not forget that the ICC are an institution that borrow money very successfully from the public.  If they were to be talked of as a body that in the course of their business invested a good deal of their resources in very risky ventures, they would not collect money from the public in the way they do at the moment.  At the time the ICC made certain arrangements to try to assist. A committee was set up&mdash;I think it is still operating in regard to the small industries programme&mdash;which brought together representatives of the ICC, CTT, of the IIRS and other State bodies who had certain expertise.  They assessed these projects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as I am concerned, if somebody has a certain skill or a good idea which can be exploited but if he has no money to do this, we should be in a position to provide the capital to get him going.  I do not think that is a function of the ICC, and this is really the point I am trying to make.  The ICC can go a good distance but the function to cover that kind of case has to be one developed under the small industries programme of the IDA.  This matter has been mentioned by Deputy Callanan and others.  That is not to say that the case I have mentioned should not be met; it is vitally important that something should be done but <Col N="398" /> I think it has to be done under the small industries programme of the IDA.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister spoke about the risk involved.  I am referring to small firms.  If there is no risk involved why not give them the money?  There is severe risk with large companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I mentioned the case of a person who might start up a small business largely dependent on the special skill of one individual.  If such a person goes to the ICC he has no balance sheet, no record and no past performance to show them.  It is very difficult for a company such as the ICC, who are engaged in taking deposits from the general public, to enter to any great degree into that kind of business.</P>

      <P>If the IDA can give State money to Mr. X by way of grant, then the ICC, using that assessment by the IDA, can lend money. However, that may be another debate for another time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The ICC assessment is, or should be, part of the whole assessment of these projects.  In fairness I should say that at the time I am speaking of the commercial banks came in and said they were prepared to finance such projects, even without collateral, on the basis of the assessment by this committee which included the ICC.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The ICC were not willing to engage in that work but the commercial banks were willing. That does not add up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am speaking of a situation which obtained nearly ten years ago and the position at that time was as Deputy Barry has described it.  I hope the situation has improved since.  I can understand the difficulties but that is the situation.  I want to make clear to the House that, whether the ICC can or cannot do it, I am convinced that these facilities should be made available through one or other form of State organ to ensure <Col N="399" /> that such projects get the necessary financial support.</P>
      <P>Deputy Moore made a very interesting and valuable suggestion with regard to the trade unions who have money to invest to consider investment in the ICC.  Like Deputy Moore I do not wish even to appear to try to tell any trade union what it should do with its funds but certainly I would join with him in drawing the attention of the unions and of anybody else who has money to invest to the attractive rates of interest offered on deposit by the ICC.  Of course this is fully guaranteed by the State.  The deposits of the ICC collected from the public generally stand at about £18 million at the moment.  For the various reasons outlined by Deputy Moore I think it would be most appropriate if trade unions were to invest money in the ICC.  Again, I want to stress that where trade unions invest their money, the circumstances in which they invest and the matters they must take into account are entirely questions for them, but in so far as this option is open to them I strongly recommend the ICC to them, as did Deputy Moore.</P>
      <P>With regard to the point raised by Deputy Murphy concerning bond financing, this is largely a question of export credit financing.  The Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy is at present considering the whole situation with a view to reducing the impediments in the way of exporters, namely, the whole question of performance bonds and the difficulties experienced by Irish firms in obtaining them.  I do not think the ICC could have any role in that regard but I will ensure that the Deputy's comments are brought to their attention so that the matter can be examined to see if they could have role in it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I trust I have dealt with all the major points raised.  I repeat my appreciation of the welcome given to this Bill by all sides.  The work of the ICC and the success that has attended that body is held in high esteem and the welcome given to this Bill is a measure of that esteem.  I <Col N="400" /> feel confident commending the Bill to the House for a Second Reading.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>Last night I welcomed the large sum of money, £350 million, which is mentioned in the Bill.  There is a danger in this, because of past history, that when people read about the vast amount of money which it is proposed to spend they will think they are getting their telephones immediately. We know that this is not possible. I remember about two years ago when a new telephone exchange was erected in my area there was a lot of publicity about it.  The people in the area thought that there would be no more waiting for telephones but we still have a long waiting list.</P>
      <P>I know the Minister and his Department are concerned about satisfying the demand for telephones.  Would it be possible for the Department to tell people who apply for telephones that they can expect to have one in six months or that they may have to wait for six years?  Could the Department decide that particular applications would be satisfied in a certain length of time?  Perhaps the Minister might consider having a system of priorities where an application would be vetted, put into a certain category and given a certain priority.  While the shortage lasts, we must decide on a list of priorities in order to be fair and just to all the applicants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="401" /> I imagine that certain priorities are laid down in the Department but in our ever-changing society we find that the telephone is assuming a new role. It was invented to help commerce and industry.  Many years ago it was a status symbol to have a telephone but that is no longer the case.  A telephone is the lifeline for elderly people and many others who live alone particularly in isolated areas.  It means a lot to them to be able to ring their friends or relations, the clergy or even the gardaí when necessary.  We have many people competing against them who require telephones for business reasons. We can also understand their anxiety for telephones.  I am sure most Deputies get letters from firms in their areas complaining because of the lack of an adequate telephone service or extra lines and we are told that this hampers their efforts at expansion.</P>
    <P>I believe that a points system would be of great value in deciding which applicants for telephones should get them first.  This could be worked on similar lines to the points given to applicants for houses.  An applicant for a telephone could be given points for the location of his house if it is in an isolated area, if the person is living alone and also if it will help to combat crime.  The Government are helping people to pay their rent and encouraging them to use telephones.  The place where a person lives can have a big bearing on this matter because there may be cables in the area which are fully utilised.  The question arises then whether new cables should be added to provide telephones for people. There could be a points system for private users and one for industrial and business users.  The business people could make the case that if they get more phones in they can increase their labour force.  They could even make the case that they require the telephones to increase their sales or even to maintain their present sales.</P>
    <P>The Minister will have no trouble in spending the money although from time to time we may have different views on who should be given priority. The Minister told us yesterday that the telephone is the most important communication link in the world today. <Col N="402" /> We know that a hot line exists in telephone communication between certain capitals.  While I agree that the Defence Forces or the Garda should get priority, the telephone may be the hot line between an old person living alone to the Garda, which may even mean survival for that person.</P>
    <P>I hope that the money will be spent in the best way possible and as quickly as possible.  People write to Deputies every day of the week about the installation of telephones.  When we send the request to the Department we receive replies which we pass on to those people.  They go on hoping that they will eventually get their telephones.  It is important that we intensify our efforts to provide more telephones and that the Department use the most up to date installation methods.  We can learn a lot from the Continent where they have a greater number of telephones than we have. This is understandable because they were industrialised long before we were.  The economy in Sweden is in a very good state at the moment.  One of their main industries is the manufacture of telephone instruments.  They may have certain raw materials which they can use in their manufacture.</P>
    <P>We should try to find out how much of our equipment could be manufactured here because £350 million is quite a large sum, even in these days of inflation.  We may have to import the vast bulk of the equipment but there are firms here in that line who could expand if they were approached by the Department.  Every effort should be made to ensure that any part of this equipment which could be produced here will be used. That would serve our drive towards greater employment and a more efficient telephone service.  We all know that even though we drive on at an increased rate there will still be a long waiting list for telephones.  The population is growing and the economy is becoming more prosperous and the demand for telephones will increase. We must carry on with the provision of telephones until some other type of communication is developed.  I do not see any sign of that at the moment.  However, we <Col N="403" /> should examine the methods being used on the Continent and try to apply them here.</P>
    <P>In neighbourhoods where telephones are scarce the Minister should consider an intensification of the drive to provide more public kiosks.  In the newer suburbs there may not be many private telephones and it would be beneficial if people who are awaiting private installations could have access to public telephone kiosks.  Progress has been made on the provision of these kiosks but in some cases they have been smashed by vandals.  In this city we hear recurring reports of crime and violence but in my opinion this is tapering off.  Following much agitation a public kiosk was erected in my own area.  I asked people if we could join in keeping an eye on it so that it would not be damaged.  I am pleased to say that up to this week it has not been damaged in any way and it has been there for over a year.  This service is very much appreciated by the people and is very well patronised.</P>
    <P>One may question the policy that a kiosk should pay for itself.  One can understand that in the days of colossal losses there was a desire to recoup as much as possible.  A telephone kiosk gives a great return in the social sense, even if it does not give a return in actual cash.  Anything that makes for better living is a social instrument and the telephone may certainly be regarded as such, especially for people living alone who may be confined to their homes.</P>
    <P>The opinion was voiced some years ago that the telephone service should be run by private enterprise.  While I am a private enterprise man, I do not think this would be acceptable to private enterprise at the moment.  Five years ago it would have been acceptable because at that time the service was making a profit.  The fact that it does not do so now is due to many reasons but I am not too worried about that aspect.  We are living in times of economic stress.  Methods may be used now which would not have been necessary in the palmy days of the sixties.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="404" /> The Government have recognised that the people are clamouring for telephones.  I am sure that if people were told they would have to pay more tax for telephones they would not kick very much against it.  The service is not adequate but we are providing more money for its extension. If one tries ringing a number in the city from this House between 3.30 p.m. and 5.00 p.m. one meets with complete chaos on the line.  That happens almost every afternoon.  The staff are very courteous and they do try to help but one can feel one's blood pressure rising.  The service has been examined by organisation and methods experts and they have improved matters but it is still not satisfactory. One could argue that the demand for more telephones is a healthy sign that the economy is alive and vibrant and an air of expansion prevails.  This is true but even when this Bill becomes law it will not improve matters to the extent that it will wipe out the waiting list for telephones.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's statement that the proposed expansion will create 7,000 extra jobs.  This is good news as most of these jobs will be of a skilled and semi-skilled nature.  It is not the Minister's main duty to provide employment but we should try to provide a scheme for the training of young people in telecommunications. While old crafts may die the telephone service will go on for many years.  The technical advances being made in telecommunications should ensure a rewarding future for any young person entering this field.  In their anxiety to provide employment I have no doubt that the Government consider each Department.  Apart from the investment aspect, the public will consider that the Government are enlightened in providing money for the telephone service and the employment of young people.  As well as that the Minister should consider training more young people in telecommunications.  This training will prepare them for future employment in the Department and elsewhere.  There are many companies engaged in the installation of internal telephone systems.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="405" /> The Department should ask the universities to become involved in this expansion programme.  Our universities have reputable schools of engineering and we could draw on their knowledge in order to expand the programme.  It would be self-defeating to employ people for the sake of employing them. Therefore, we should not omit any source of help such as the university engineering schools and the larger private engineering firms.  This is a great opportunity and I know that the Minister will use it to fulfil the demands made on the Department. This is an opportunity to bring our telephone service up to the standard that exists in Europe but it will call for more investment.  This Bill provides for £350 million and I hope the Government will have no difficulty in finding that amount.  We have borrowed from outside sources and we can do so again because a good return on borrowed money can always be defended.  We cannot meet all our requirements from internal sources.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister success in his efforts.  We are moving into an age of satellite stations which will bring constant change.  It will be a time of great challenge for our engineers and craftsmen but it will be an exciting time.  I support this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. J. Leonard Mr. J. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish the Minister well in his new office.  We cannot help but sympathise with him for the problems which he has inherited.  The Minister's statement gives us much hope.  He said he would increase the annual rate of connections from 45,000 to 85,000, increase the number of automatic exchanges and provide for progress to a full automatic system as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>Until recently only one of the four towns in my county had an automatic system and that town was connected to the Dundalk exchange.  Not alone have we three towns in the county with manual exchanges but we have some major industries without automatic telephone systems.  This must have an adverse effect on businesses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An additional drawback is the long delay&mdash;normally three years&mdash;in attending to applications for connection. <Col N="406" /> The problem in this regard is likely to worsen because of the increasing numbers of people seeking telephones.  However, this Bill promises some hope in that respect.  There are many instances in which people living in remote areas are victimised because of the policy of the Department not to provide telephones in such areas. This is a hardship in so far as there may be people in those areas conducting business on a small scale and for whom a telephone service is essential.</P>
    <P>Although an automatic exchange was opened more than a year ago in Monaghan, telephones in sub-post offices in the hinterland of that area have not been changed to automatic operation.  This is regrettable.  In Emyvale, for instance, an exchange has been erected but the connections have not been made yet.  I trust that this matter will be given priority because in that area there are 154 subscribers and this constitutes a heavy load on the local exchange especially in an area in which there is a duck farm, a shoe factory and a number of furniture factories. Business at these places is being affected because of the delay in opening the exchange and much inconvenience is being caused, too, to the other people in the area.  I am not familiar with the Telex system but I understand that there are problems associated with it in local exchanges that are still operating manually.</P>
    <P>The system whereby, in order to be given priority, an employer must have a certain number of workers on his payroll should be examined closely because there are many cases in which people such as agricultural contractors who, although they are not giving much employment, are providing necessary services but are not considered priority cases.  The Department should be sympathetic in this regard.</P>
    <P>A telephone may be essential to the success of a very small industry.  It is common to see people waiting at telephone kiosks in rural areas for up to an hour in order to make calls.</P>
    <P>Another group of people who should be considered sympathetically are <Col N="407" /> those living in remote Border areas. At the height of the violence these people would have been much happier if they had telephone services but they got no hearing from the Department. However, now that the incidence of violence in that area has lessened to a great extent there is not the same need for telephones but, at the same time, these people should not be overlooked.</P>
    <P>Previous speakers have referred to the guarantee system whereby a local authority, by guaranteeing the payment of a certain sum, could have kiosks provided in their area by the Department.  A couple of years ago we in Monaghan County Council, having regard to the demand for telephones and to the long delays experienced in respect of installations, decided to avail of this system in order that 20 telephones would be erected throughout the county.  Our problem has been in reaching a decision on the locations of these kiosks.  We had representations from many areas in this regard but we decided to site the kiosks in villages or near churches or other places where people would congregate but we endeavoured in the main to site the kiosks in areas that would facilitate the farming community who must have access to telephones in order to call artificial inseminators for instance.  We also gave consideration to areas in which there were agricultural contractors. This is another system that the Department might reconsider since it can raise problems for local authorities.</P>
    <P>Recently the Minister for Health and Social Welfare announced the intention of abolishing telephone rentals in respect of pensioners.  This is a very welcome innovation and will mean a lot to old people especially in rural areas where a telephone service is so important to them.  Again, we have continually coming to us young people who are away from home, especially when on holidays during the summer months, asking us as public representatives to intercede in their application for telephone connection to their parents.  Over the last few years with the increasing <Col N="408" /> costs to be met by the applicants this provision certainly is going a long way towards easing that burden and I welcome it.  Public representatives can take some satisfaction out of this speaking up because it is through those manual exchanges that we have to get in contact with this city.  Daily we put through calls and there is an amount of delay.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister for introducing this.  It will not cure all the ills; it will certainly not solve all the problems, but it will go part of the way towards doing so.  The Minister said:</P>
    <P>The programme proposed in connection with the 1973 Act envisaged that a target of 460,000 subscribers' lines would be reached in 1978.  It has not been possible to speed the connection rate sufficiently....</P>
    <P>He went on to talk about the underground and overhead lines that had to be provided.  If one is driving to Dublin along that national primary route there is hardly a day when there are not P and T workers to be seen working on those underground lines which are in conduit.  In most cases this work is not on connections.  Seemingly there are faulty lines underground.  I hope that this system will be improved so that there will not be the number of breakdowns that are plaguing the system at present.  The repairs with the cost of labour and materials are quite enough for that section of the Department which deals with installation and replacements.  Having to repair cables that were laid only a few years ago is a matter needing serious consideration.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister well and congratulate him on the introduction of this Bill which provides for this service and the improvement of the services. It is heartening to see the number of jobs that will be provided by it.  This is a much needed improvement at present, not alone from the labour point of view but also from that of the technicians.  The Department of Posts and Telegraphs are very good employers. They have made a good job of training many technicians in my area.  Some young men have made this occupation their career in the Department <Col N="409" /> of Posts and Telegraphs where they have remunerative employment. That is to be commended.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancisTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill which I hope will make adequate provision for the next five years.  The expenditure incurred in the last period was high and due to inflation we ran out of money.  Nevertheless, significant progress was made since 1973. About 670 telephone kiosks were installed, technical equipment was improved, as were trunk lines in the areas where modernisation was necessary. There is a growing demand from the public for improved services which is typical of our present age and society and it is an outcome of that relative affluence with which we are endowed that the public seem simultaneously to demand telephone services. To provide those we have to spend huge capital sums.  It is difficult to please everybody.  I hope the Minister will be able to go a long way towards doing so, and I have confidence that he and his Parliamentary Secretary will do the job and approach it with an understanding of all the problems which they are expected to overcome. It is vital in a small island like ours that proper lines of communication be maintained both internally and outside. This is vital in many areas, particularly in industrial development.  It is vital to tourism and socially it is an amenity which most people at present expect.</P>
      <P>I live on the west coast in County Clare, an area remote from the centre of activity here in Dublin.  Generally speaking the quality of the service provided there by the Department of Posts and Telegraphs in all its different branches is quite good.  The understanding and sympathy of all the staffs in the post offices and telephone exchanges is of the highest standard.  One rarely has to complain and I marvel at the continual courtesy which one receives from people who are doing a difficult job with extreme patience. Both installers and technicians in this area are vital.  They come to remedy faults in all kinds of weather without the slightest hesitation and they try to please subscribers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will refer briefly to some of the <Col N="410" /> main complaints to which one has to listen.  They are chiefly from industrialists, mainly foreign industrialists who come into the country. Whether or not they are accustomed to a better service in the countries they come from I do not know, but they complain occasionally very loudly and clearly about not being able to get through to the different areas where they want to make contact.  Telex communication is not available to many industrialists but the Minister and his staff should give every consideration to providing for industrialists a service which is adequate and which will encourage others to come into the country.  There are some things that industrialists treat as priorities. They like good communications, good road structure, good railheads, being near airports and so on.  If we can give them good communications out of their businesses with their customers we would be doing a lot.  This is provided but there should be no delay in seeing that anything that can be done to help will be done as rapidly as possible.</P>
    <P>This country depends on tourism in a major way and visitors at seaside resorts all over the country often find difficulty in making contact by telephone with their friends at home or with those with whom they are in business.  I would ask the Minister to endeavour to give the very best service to our visitors at holiday resorts.  As regards the social aspect of the service, both young and old have a particular liking for using the phone. Public demand is growing all the time. This Bill, involving a sum of £350 million to be expended over the next five years, would seem to make adequate provision for telephone development. If inflation can be reduced it should be more than adequate to bring the service up to the standard we would all like to see.</P>
    <P>In regard to the installation of telephone kiosks in rural and remote areas, I would like the Minister to consider the question of the guarantee which his Department demand from local authorities, particularly county councils, in areas where the necessity for telephones is great but the number of subscribers is low.  In such areas the <Col N="411" /> council has to subscribe to the cost of providing the service.  Generally speaking, council members are not keen on accepting a responsibility which they think should be borne by the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  Kiosks are still required in remote areas, by the old and by people engaged in agriculture, particularly in dairying districts, and again in tourist areas. Therefore I would ask the Minister to consider removing the obligation on councils to subsidise the Department in this respect.  It remains for me to wish the Minister a very quiet period in office with many successes both for himself and his Parliamentary Secretary.</P>

    <P>I do not think it is necessary for me to translate what I have already said in Irish into English.  It is pleasant to find that in the 21st Dáil it is possible to use the Irish language and to be understood to a greater degree than ever before by the Members of this House.  Certainly I do not have to translate it for the two spokesmen of the Opposition who congratulated me, but I would like to repeat in English that I appreciate very much their congratulations and their offers of support during my term of office as Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.  I would like to thank all of the Deputies for their good wishes and for their kind remarks. I extend my thanks also to all those who spoke in the debate for their very constructive contributions on this important Bill.  The general tenor of the contributions indicates that the measure has got the support of the entire House, and this should encourage my Department to push ahead with the varied and complex tasks connected with bringing the telecommunications service up to the level which is necessary for the development of a modern economy.</P>
    <P>In my opening speech I endeavoured to give an idea of the position as I saw it in as much detail as possible.  I endeavoured to point to what had been done during the years and to emphasise that although a considerable amount had been done the problem facing us is still an immense one.  I went on to underline what we propose to do to meet all the problems.  I dealt with these matters in a detailed way in order to present Deputies with an opportunity to discuss the Bill in the way they would have liked to deal with it, and I am glad that the discussion we have had illustrates this.</P>
    <P>The Government have announced that they regard job creation as the most urgent task facing us.  Many more new jobs are needed not only to reduce <Col N="413" /> the present high level of unemployment but to make provision for the considerable number of school leavers who will join the labour force in the next decade.  Basic to a programme of rapid job creation is provision for an infrastructure which will facilitate expansion of existing manufacturing and commercial concerns and which will make the country more attractive to foreign investors.  A modern efficient telecommunications service is an essential element of such an infrastructure.</P>
    <P>Deputies stressed that towns in which the telephone service is less than satisfactory are at a serious disadvantage in their effort to expand local job opportunities.  I agree, and I propose to press forward with development plans with all possible speed.  As far as I am concerned nothing that can be done to improve matters will be left undone.  Of course it would be unrealistic to expect too much too soon.  I do not say that because of any lack of a sense of urgency in relation to this work.  Part of my opening speech was interpreted in that way last night by Deputy Enright.  I assure him and other Deputies that I am well aware of the urgency, and even Deputies who have been in the House for a relatively short time will appreciate this from the correspondence they get in relation to the telephone system.</P>
    <P>As I said in my opening speech, it takes a long time to achieve the momentum for a spectacular breakthrough in the telecommunications business.  Capital investment on a large scale, long term advance planning and major development work over a number of years are necessary to expand and to modernise the telephone system, particularly one such as ours which is still relatively undeveloped.  I quoted the scale of investment that is still necessary in Britain and the time it has taken in France to achieve a breakthrough as an indication of the magnitude of the task facing the Department.  Continuing intensive investment during a number of years will be needed before we will have a service equal to the best elsewhere.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="414" /> I now turn to the comments, suggestions and criticisms made by Deputies on both sides of the House. Deputy Corish mentioned the problem of vandalism, which is not of course unique to this country.  Many other telecommunications administrations throughout the world are wrestling with it.  Britain has tried out numerous schemes to prevent vandalism in kiosks, particularly in urban areas, but I understand these efforts have not been wholly successful. I agree with the Deputy but I would point out that the Department have taken steps to minimise the damage to kiosks by vandals. Various measures have been taken to render kiosks less susceptible to vandalism, including the fitting of steel plates to coin boxes, the use of large sheets of plastic material instead of glass, provision of better lighting and the fitting of a specially reinforced coinbox.</P>
    <P>I think the Deputy asked for information about the cost of repairing such damage.  It is very high.  The cost of repairing damaged kiosks in Dublin, where the incidence is greatest, was about £84,000 in a recent year and according to our information it appears to be running at the same level this year.  The number of cases of extensive physical damage to kiosks has diminished in the last few years as a result of the installation of strengthened coinboxes, but those who spent their time at that kind of vandalism have changed over to making the coinboxes inoperable by other means.  Special maintenance attention is given to public telephones.  Those in Dublin city centre and suburban areas are inspected daily, Monday to Friday, and in the remainder of the State maintenance attention ranges from daily maintenance in the cities and larger towns to weekly inspections in the more remote areas.  Reports in respect of public telephones are given priority attention in all areas.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Deputies who said it would be a useful exercise to direct public opinion towards this type of vandalism.  The public should be informed that not only is this kind of vandalism creating a serious social <Col N="415" /> problem in many areas but that it is also responsible in many instances for loss of employment.  The public at large might make it clear to vandals that they will see to it such hooliganism will be stopped.  We had an example of this recently in Croke Park during an all-Ireland final when a small group were intent of creating problems but the adults in that area soon put a stop to it.</P>

      <P>A system of the nature envisaged in the question could not possibly be sustained by our community in the foreseeable future.  It is the Government's aim, in accordance with their manifesto, to provide a first class service which will secure the highest possible standard of physical and mental health for all the people and ensure that no person will be denied medical care because of inability to provide for it out of his or her own resources.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that the health services have within them a number of services based on the free no-means-test principle and <Col N="416" /> that the majority if not all of them stemmed from a general principle established by Fianna Fáil legislation during the years?  Would the Minister say why it is that he has now decided to depart from this general principle in relation to this most important section of the general medical services?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think I have departed or am departing from any general principle.  What the Deputy suggests in his question is of a most sweeping and far-reaching nature.  He suggests a free no-means-test general practitioner, medicine, dental and hospital scheme.  It is a question of priorities. As I said in my reply, I know that our community just could not afford now or in the foreseeable future a comprehensive scheme of that order. We just have not got the economic resources to support it.</P>

      <P>Persons covered by medical cards obtain their prescribed medicines free of charge.  Thirty-nine per cent of the population are covered by this scheme.  Persons suffering from prescribed long-term diseases and disabilities obtain medicines for the treatment of these conditions free of charge.</P>
      <P>The great majority of the remainder of the population are eligible for a refund when the cost of medicines used in a calendar month exceeds £5.00. The maximum monthly cost to such persons will not exceed £6.50.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Cover may be obtained under the Voluntary Health Insurance Home Scheme for abnormal medical expenses occurring outside hospital, including the cost of prescribed drugs and medicines, if the cost for a single person exceeds £35 or for a married couple £50 per year.  These schemes have eliminated or reduced the burden of the cost of medicines and I am not aware of widespread distress.  Health <Col N="417" /> boards can, and do, consider individual instances where there may be hardship and they will continue to do so.</P>

      <P>The long term illness scheme is reviewed from time to time and coeliac disease is among the conditions considered in these reviews. While it has not been possible to include it in the prescribed list of diseases there is already assistance available to help offset the cost.</P>
      <P>Persons with coeliac disease who are the holders of medical cards obtain prescribed gluten free products free of charge.  Persons with limited eligibility may include, in claims for refund of part of their expenditure on medicines, the cost of gluten free products purchased from retail pharmacies.

      <P>The Eastern Health Board are giving urgent attention to the outstanding problems in the Dublin area and I am hopeful that these problems will soon be resolved.</P>
      <P>I would, of course, like to point out that health boards already provide or support the provision of a wide range of services for battered wives and their children.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>That is one possible approach but in the Dublin situation we are primarily concerned with the immediate accommodation problem and I think we will have that solved very soon.  As the Deputy knows, to use a cliché, this is only the tip of the iceberg because the problem goes much deeper than merely accommodating wives and children and I would hope that the fundamental causes of the problem could be tackled on some broader basis.  Apart from the Deputy's suggestion about local authority housing, there will always be a need for some refuge to which people can have access in certain circumstances.  Another factor that must be taken into account is that very often wives and children can go back to the family homes after a period of time and, therefore, what we are really concerned with is a temporary refuge where these people can find succour and support.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Deputy Browne, I too appreciate the Minister's concern. The problem in the Harcourt Street shelter has become intolerable because of the number of long-term residents who are unlikely to go back to their own homes and who do not qualify for local authority dwellings because their spouses are already tenants of these local authority houses. I am asking the Minister to consult urgently with his colleague, the Minister for the Environment, to see if the problem can be alleviated, if not solved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Question Nos. 14 to 18, inclusive, together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The catchment area of Beaumont Hospital for general purposes comprises <Col N="425" /> mainly the north eastern portion of Dublin city and county, with a population of 210,000, but it will cover a much wider population for certain specialties.  The hospital is being planned on the basis of a bed complement of 730 beds.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister indicate if the area of Ballymun is being included in the catchment area for the hospital at Beaumont and also whether the number of bed places meets with the agreement of the medical members of the proposed new board at Beaumont?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Unless I misheard, I do not think the Minister answered the question as to when building will commence and the projected date of completion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I have another question on that.  The bed complement in the projected hospital is worked out as accurately as possible on the basis of certain standards of measurement.  There has been a good deal of discussion among the various bodies and individuals concerned and 730 has now been finally accepted by all the parties involved as the right number and the hospital is now proceeding on that basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The catchment areas are not defined that rigidly.  If the Deputy is concerned about the convenience of the people of Ballymun, I think it will be largely determined by themselves.  Beaumont will be quite convenient to them but the Mater Hospital, the other major hospital, would probably for some of them be equally convenient.</P>

      <P>Perhaps I should read it all again.</P>
      <P>The catchment area of Beaumont Hospital for general purposes comprises mainly the north eastern portion of Dublin city and county, with a population of 210,000, but it will cover a much wider population for certain specialties.  The hospital is being planned on the basis of a bed complement of 730 beds.</P>
      <P>The design for the nearly completed hospital at Wilton, Cork, is being used for Beaumont Hospital and this has enabled the project to be developed rapidly.</P>
      <P>The site appraisal and survey has been completed and preliminary site engineering work will start this month.</P>
      <P>The main building contract is scheduled to commence in January, 1978, and building will proceed as rapidly thereafter as possible.</P>
      <P>Planning of the proposed new hospital at Tallaght is at a preliminary stage.  The bed complement of the hospital has not been established.  This will be related to the catchment area and the population to be served by the hospital and these have not been finally determined.  It is envisaged however that for general purposes the hospital will serve the needs of the western developing areas of Dublin as well as parts of counties Kildare and Wicklow, with a much wider population being served for some specialities.</P>
      <P>It is not possible at this stage to indicate when tenders for the construction of the hospital will be invited.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The board of Beaumont hospital are operating on the principle that any alterations or changes that can be made without interfering with the progress of the hospital will be made by the design team but no major alterations will be undertaken. Within the context of the overall contract it will be possible for the design team to make some changes to suit particular requirements provided they do not interfere with the expeditious pursuance of the contract.</P>

I accept that the Minister is under the pressure of speed in relation to Beaumont but does he think that even at the risk of some delay it would perhaps be appropriate to look at some major changes that might be required in plans to ensure that this new hospital in the Dublin area meets all modern requirements?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The dental services available free include extractions and <Col N="431" /> fillings and other remedial care and the supply of dentures.  Free dental treatment is available to children for defects noticed at child welfare clinics and school health examinations. Health boards also provide dental care &mdash;including the provision of dentures&mdash;for medical card holders and their dependants but, as the priority lies in the care of children's teeth, this has not yet been developed into a comprehensive service.</P>
      <P>Insured persons who meet the required contribution conditions may have fillings and extractions free of charge under the dental benefit scheme of the Department of Social Welfare.  The health boards, to provide their services, employ 184 whole-time dentists and part-time dentists to the equivalent of 28 whole-time posts. Thirty-three extra whole-time posts have recently been approved, together with extra ancillary staff.  In the social welfare scheme there are contracts with 530 private dentists.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>As soon as possible. It is a question of priorities.  The Deputy will understand that if resources are limited, which they are and it is not just a question of money, it is better to take the younger children and devote your efforts to dealing with them.  Until you have that job done, it would not be too wise to extend in other areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. Mitchell Mr. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not agree it is absolutely unacceptable that children in primary schools, students over 16 years of age and apprentices qualify for dental services while those <Col N="432" /> under 16 years of age in secondary school do not qualify?  Is that not something which could be remedied pretty quickly if the Minister had the will?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">

      <P>This is a matter for the chief executive officers of the health boards who agree income guidelines to assist them in assessing applications for medical cards.

There are actions I can take in the matter but in spite of what the Deputy says the overall percentage of the population covered by the general medical service has been increasing steadily.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that because of the length of time between reviews the basic categories have from time to time become ineligible for medical cards because of increases granted under national pay agreements? Would the Minister consider advising CEOs of health boards to carry out a review every three months or six months rather than annually?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>That will have to be taken into account when the guidelines are being reviewed.  Over and above all <Col N="436" /> this, the CEOs still have discretion in cases of hardship.  The guidelines are only guidelines but the responsibility to avoid hardship still rests with the CEOs.</P>

    <P>The qualifications necessary for such appointments are a matter for the authorities of the residential homes but I understand that, for posts of <Col N="438" /> responsibility within a home, candidates would in practice have to possess relevant experience and would desirably have a formal qualification in child care or other relevant discipline.

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not those figures with me but in so far as the grafting operation is concerned most of the things involved consist of sanctions to start projects.  Many of them will not start spending money until next year.</P>

      <P>The person referred to in the Deputy's question paid social insurance contributions from 1968 in respect of employment as a skipper owner.  He claimed unemployment benefit in October, 1976.  The question whether his employment as a skipper owner was insurable for the purposes of the Social Welfare Acts was referred to a deciding officer who ruled that it was not insurable.  This decision was upheld by an appeals officer whose decision is final and conclusive unless it is revised in the light of new facts or fresh evidence or on appeal to the High Court on a point of law.  I am not empowered to intervene in decisions of deciding officers or appeals officers.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Faulkner)</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Corish referred also to the categories of applications for telephones which are afforded priority treatment and suggested that they be publicised more.  The priority <Col N="479" /> categories have been outlined in this House on a number of occasions.  They have remained largely unchanged for quite a considerable time.  I shall quote them again.  The following is the list of priority categories&mdash;I should like to point out that they are not necessarily in order of relative priority&mdash;services involving safety of life, that is hospitals, ambulances, fire brigades and life saving generally; Members of the Oireachtas and diplomats, public services, including central and local authorities; persons engaged in health services including doctors and nurses; clergymen engaged on parochial duties; industrial, commercial and other undertakings providing a significant amount of employment; businesses and professions having a particular need for telephone service; national unions and associations; existing subscribers moving to new premises.  Then there are the other applications in respect of which really exceptional need can be shown, for example, on health or distress grounds.  We would all agree that services involving safety of life should have top priority.</P>
      <P>I should like to concentrate as much of the priority as possible in present circumstances on industrial undertakings capable of or likely to provide employment.  At present priority is given where they employ at least four people.  I take a particular interest in that aspect of it.  It will be understood that, even where people could claim to be on this priority list, there can be circumstances where it is not possible to provide them with the service as quickly as we would like.  There may be technical or other reasons making it impossible at a given time to make the service available.  However, we will do the best we possibly can in relation to any particular priority situation.</P>
      <P>I might point out that at present about 45 per cent of applicants are within the priority area.  Were I to accede to the number of requests I receive to include others on the priority list it would negative the whole idea of priority and we would be left with a situation in which everybody was on the same level with no priority list at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="480" /> The House will appreciate that because of these priority lists, which are generally acceptable, there can be many people who are not on them and whose telephones are not installed as quickly as they might be otherwise because of people on the priority list moving in ahead of them.  There may be occasions when, for technical reasons&mdash;perhaps there are not cables available, they are over-loaded or some other reason&mdash;it may not be possible to provide a service at a given time.  I and other Members of this House know that this is not always understood by the public.  I do not know how many people have come to me explaining how very simple it would be to instal a telephone for them because telephone wires happened to be running at the bottom of their garden; or perhaps because the neighbour next door was leaving, the telephone was being taken out, the neighbour wanted nobody more than this person to get the telephone. They expected it to be installed in spite of the fact that, perhaps they had not applied for it until they knew the neighbour was leaving when perhaps somebody down the road had been waiting three years for installation.</P>
    <P>I want merely to explain the problems we encounter.  I know every Deputy is well aware of them.  We would be anxious to be in a position to provide a telephone when an application comes in.  It is towards this desirable objective that we hope to move but it will take some considerable time before that goal is achieved.</P>
    <P>Quite a number of Deputies referred to the need for kiosks in new housing estates.  They pleaded that, in deciding whether a kiosk should be provided, the social need as well as economic considerations be taken into account. The settled policy for many years has been that kiosks are provided in urban areas only where they are likely to pay their way and where existing public telephones in the area are regarded as inadequate.  Of course, this does not mean that the Department wait to provide a kiosk in a new housing estate until the level of the development is such that a kiosk in the area would be immediately self-supporting. <Col N="481" /> The policy is interpreted fairly liberally.  If it is clear from the housing development plans for an area that a kiosk would be likely to pay its way within a reasonable period, and there are no other kiosks within a reasonable distance, then one is provided once a fair number of houses in the estate have been occupied.  However, I would not favour a change from the basic policy of providing kiosks in urban areas only where they are likely to pay their way.  It is true to say that this policy has stood the test of time and, by and large, has enabled the demand for public telephone facilities in towns and cities to be fairly met.</P>
    <P>While dealing with kiosks, I might refer to the rural kiosk policy on which there has been a considerable amount of comment.  This policy in rural areas has been followed since 1969.  In general, kiosks are erected in rural areas in replacement of telephone booths in rural post offices.  Eight hundred and seventy seven kiosks were provided under this programme.  There are still a number of telephones in rural post offices where kiosks have not been provided. It is felt generally that they have been provided in all the areas they are most likely to be remunerative.</P>
    <P>With regard to the provision of the telephone kiosk under guarantee it is reasonable to expect the local authority to help out.  At present kiosks are available in most rural areas where there are post offices.  A case was made for the provision of kiosks in out-of-the-way places.  All Deputies would agree that were I to ask each and every one of them to tell me of an area in their constituency out-of-the-way and in need of kiosks, every one of them would be able to cite me 40 or 50 instances. The question is where would we stop? In circumstances where a local authority feel that they should provide this sort of social amenity it is only reasonable to expect that they would help out.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Donnell urged that the maximum amount of equipment and materials used in the telephone service should be manufactured at home.  The present position is that approximately 50 per cent of the telephones and stores <Col N="482" /> used by us are manufactured in Ireland. I agreed with the Deputy that this trend should be encouraged.  I have no doubt that my colleague, the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy, is aware of the potential of job creation in the development of the telecommunications manufacturing industry and he will have my support in any efforts to encourage further expansion of the industry.  In addition, I hope that the Irish companies who are presently engaged in the manufacture of telecommunications products will endeavour so far as possible to develop their range of such products so that in the future we can buy a higher percentage of what they produce.</P>
    <P>Deputy Smith asked that the priority categories be reviewed.  He was particularly concerned about the need of new business for telephones at the outset in order to develop their employment potential.  As I mentioned earlier, under existing procedures businesses providing full-time employment for four or more people are afforded priority in the provision of telephones. With regard to some types of business where a telephone is crucial, priority is afforded from the outset irrespective of the employment content.</P>
    <P>As I said earlier, I should like to be in a position to give priority treatment to all business applications.  The priority categories at present account for almost 45 per cent of all applications and any significant increase in these categories would lessen the value of priority treatment for all.  The result would be that the more urgent applications would receive less prompt treatment than at present and this would be undesirable particularly as the service is not always provided as promptly as I would like.</P>
    <P>Deputy Smith also referred to the delay in the proposed conversion of Roscrea exchange to automatic working. This delay is due to the need for extra trunk equipment in Portlaoise which cannot be installed until a new exchange building has been provided there.  Other exchanges which are dependent on extension of Portlaoise exchange were referred to; Deputy Enright mentioned Birr and Rathdowney <Col N="483" /> and Deputy Murphy mentioned Baltinglass.</P>
    <P>Portlaoise is the main trunk switching centre for a large number of exchanges in the midlands.  Plans were initiated more than seven years ago to provide a new trunk exchange but there was considerable difficulty in obtaining a suitable site until a large building became available and was acquired in 1973.  The Commissioners of Public Works advised that major structural alterations were necessary to render this building suitable for the trunk and other equipment it was to house.  The planning of these alterations proved much more difficult than had been expected and earlier this year the commissioners decided to carry out an interim scheme.  Work on this scheme is now in progress.  The commissioners expect that accommodation for the equipment will be ready early next year and, on that basis, the installation of equipment is expected to be completed early in 1979.  Conversion to automatic working of the telephone exchange in Roscrea and the other exchanges in the general area will follow as soon as possible after that.  I have dealt with this matter in some detail to explain exactly what are the problems.</P>
    <P>Deputy Briscoe mentioned the need for a public telephone in Rutland Grove.  I shall write to the Deputy about this matter.  Both he and Deputy Moore suggested that where telephones cannot be installed in new housing estates because of lack of underground cable a telephone kiosk should be provided and served by overhead lines. I have considerable sympathy with this suggestion.  It may be taken that if the lack of underground cable was the only barrier to the provision of a telephone kiosk and where such a kiosk could be served by an overhead route this would be done.  Very often in new housing estates it is quite difficult to obtain a site for a kiosk.  There is the problem of locating the most central point for the kiosk and frequently the development of footpaths lags behind the construction of the houses.  Where conditions necessary for the provision of a kiosk are met it is very rare that the erection of the <Col N="484" /> kiosk is held up because of lack of underground cables.  It is simply because there are other difficulties and perhaps in some instances the Deputies themselves might be able to help out in relation to them.</P>
    <P>Deputy Briscoe referred to the problem of vandalism.  This matter was raised earlier by Deputy Corish and I have replied to it.  A number of other Deputies also expressed concern.  In my comments before Question Time in reply to the matter raised by Deputy Corish I explained the steps that had been taken by my Department to deal with this problem.  The extent of the concern expressed here about this matter indicates a need for the Department to devote more time to it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Vivion de Valera made a very thoughtful contribution to the debate.  He referred, as did others, to the matter of subsidising telephones for underprivileged groups.  This is a matter for the Minister for Social Welfare in the first instance and I will bring the various comments made to his attention.  Deputy de Valera also referred to the problem facing the Department because they are not in a position to put aside money from profits for their capital requirements. This is so.  However, I should like to underline the fact that this does not mean that the telephone system has not been profitable.  For 40 years it was profitable and it was only in recent years because of the high capital borrowing and high inflation that the situation arose where losses occurred. I expect this will continue for some time but I can visualise in the future the telephone service returning to profitability.</P>
    <P>Deputy de Valera also referred to the employment situation and I should like to make a few remarks on that. He said he feared that the extra jobs provided under the capital programme would not be needed when the development programme was completed. The five-year programme that will be made possible under this Bill represents one stage in the development of the telephone service.  Further programmes necessitating more rapid development in future decades will be required and more intensive automation <Col N="485" /> will reduce the manpower needs, but in our development situation at this stage there is no risk for many years ahead of the problem of overstaffing arising.  However, the Deputy made an important point that will need to be borne in mind in the future.</P>
    <P>I would also like to stress that a good telecommunications service is of very considerable assistance in helping to provide further employment in other spheres.  As I mentioned in my introductory speech it is expected that about 7,000 additional jobs will be created under the development programme for which the extra capital is proposed. Most of the extra jobs will arise on the engineering side, in technician, installer, labour and trainee grades. There will be more jobs for engineering graduates too and some in the clerical and administrative grades.  The extra jobs will be created as quickly as possible but there are limits to the numbers that can be usefully absorbed at any given time.  The aim is that there will be a build-up of recruitment over the five year period according as extra staff can be used productively.</P>
    <P>It is perhaps rather naïve to suggest, as appears to have been suggested, that the 7,000 new jobs to be provided as a result of this Bill, could not be counted as part of the Government's job creation programme.  I suggest that the initiation of a Bill is hardly sufficient in itself to create jobs.  The jobs will result from the effective implementation of the development works made possible by the Bill.  I hope to ensure that these works are effectively implemented.  I have no doubt that should I fail to do so that I will be criticised for being unsuccessful. It should be obvious that it is the actual implementation of the programme and the manner in which it is carried out that will effectively provide these extra jobs.</P>
    <P>Deputies Callanan, Enright and Filgate suggested that rural areas are not getting their fair share of telepone installations.  They referred to the long waiting lists in many rural areas. I am afraid that, unfortunately, there are very long waiting lists in urban areas as well.  I see from a list that I <Col N="486" /> have here that some of the oldest applications refer to the Dublin 01 area.  As far as I can see approximately half of those on the waiting lists are in Dublin and Cork and the other half in the remainder of the country.  I do not want to boast about the fact that there are people in Dublin waiting for telephones.  I am simply underlining the fact that the problem applies equally to the city and the larger urban areas as it does to the rural areas.  I would also like to point out that most of the oldest applications in the rural area are those involving abnormal construction work. Steps have been initiated to accelerate the clearance of the backlog of long line cases which have built up over the last few years.  The aim is to reach the stage where such applications will be dealt with under normal clearances. I hope that with the increased recruitment which is now going ahead that that will be reached over large areas of the country by the end of next year.</P>
    <P>Deputy Filgate referred to the inability to make calls from coin boxes to places such as America. Unfortunately this is the case because of the technical limitations of the existing box.  I would like to refer to my opening speech in which I indicated that it is hoped to introduce a new type of coin box during the programme period and that it will be possible to make calls to all countries from the new box.</P>
    <P>Deputy C. Murphy asked me about Arklow exchange.  A major extension is planned but it requires a new building. In the meantime a mobile exchange will be brought into service probably about the middle of next year.  The Arklow/Dublin radio link, to which Deputy Murphy referred last night, has been a problem for some time now.  Breaks in transmission occur in the link due to fading of the signal in certain weather conditions. Arrangements have been made to replace this link by one of greater capacity which will be routed over a different transmission path and have improved safeguards against fading. The necessary equipment is on order and the new link is expected to be in service about the end of next year. <Col N="487" /> In the meantime, the existing link is being given special maintenance attention.</P>
    <P>Deputy W. O'Brien asked about the prospects of providing an automatic telephone service at Abbeyfeale, Newcastle West and Rathkeale.  Abbeyfeale exchange will be converted to automatic working before the end of this year and the other two exchanges in about two-and-a-half years.  The Deputy also referred to the delay in re-erecting the kiosk at Adare.  This kiosk was demolished by a motor vehicle last year.  The county council and the Adare Tidy Towns Association asked to have the kiosk erected on a different site.  Finally, a site suggested by the county council was generally agreed as the most suitable. Arrangements were on hand to provide the kiosk there recently but the Tidy Towns Association asked that it be re-erected on the original site.  All I can say is that my Department are prepared to re-erect the kiosk either on the original site or on the site recommended by the council but we will defer to local preferences as between the two sites.  We have already advised both the county council and the Tidy Towns Association of the situation.  We will erect the kiosk promptly when the site question has been resolved locally.</P>
    <P>Deputy Moore referred to the poor service on the telephone installation in Leinster House.  The present private automatic branch exchange serving Leinster House is now fully loaded and cannot be extended further.  It is expected that an order for a new installation will be placed in the near future but I am afraid it is likely to be 12 or 18 months before the new installation is in service.  We will, however, deal with it as promptly as we can when the order is received. Deputy J. Leonard asked when the Emyvale exchange will be converted to automatic working.  It is expected that Emyvale will be converted to automatic next year.</P>
    <P>I hope I have dealt with all the main points raised.  I would like to say again that I am grateful to all the Deputies <Col N="488" /> who have contributed to the useful and wide ranging debate on the Bill. My Department will consider in detail the many criticisms, suggestions and comments that have been made.  The number and variety of these reflect the importance attached by Deputies on both sides of the House to the telephone service and a general consensus about the need for continued improvement and expansion of the service. Enactment of the Bill I believe is a necessary step towards achieving this. I commend the Second Stage of the Bill to the House.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>

      <P>That Dáil Éireann takes note of the Report: Developments in the European Communities&mdash;Tenth Report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputies are aware, these reports are required by section 5 of the European Communities Act, 1972. This Act provides that the Government shall make a report twice yearly to each House of the Oireachtas on developments in the European Community. The House will be aware that over the past few years almost two years elapsed before the House had an opportunity of debating these reports, which were published twice each year as required by the Act.  As I mentioned during my time in Opposition, this was unsatisfactory and I feel that the spirit, if not the letter, of the European Communities Act, 1972 cannot be implemented unless the House has an opportunity as soon as possible after the publication of the report to debate the issues contained in it.  It is for that reason that I am bringing this motion before the House within a matter of weeks after the publication of the latest <Col N="489" /> report.  I hope that we will be able to continue this process so that the debates in the House will be as contemporaneous as possible with publication of the reports.</P>
    <P>The Tenth Report is the second report to be published in 1977.  It summarises significant developments in the various areas of Community activity from 1st January, 1977 to 30th June, 1977 and includes a review of the European Councils held in Rome in March, 1977 and in London in June, 1977.  Developments in relation to the common fisheries policy up to mid-July, 1977 are included in the report.</P>
    <P>I intend to confine myself at this stage to a factual analysis of developments in the period covered by the report, namely to 30th June, 1977.  As all Deputies will appreciate, that was prior to the change of Government and I will not be dealing with matters that have arisen since the change of Government. If Deputies wish to raise matters which can be related to the report and which refer to subsequent developments I will be happy to deal with those matters in my reply.</P>
    <P>The report deals with the development of the European Communities including European political co-operation, the main policy decisions taken by the Community, important legislation enacted by the Community and significant proposals for Community action.</P>
    <P>For ease of reference Deputies will find as annexes to the report a list of ministerial regulations made under the European Communities Act, a table showing subsidies, grants and loans received or awaiting decision during the period under review, lists of meetings of the Council, plenary sittings of the European Parliament, plenary sessions of the Economic and Social Committee, Irish members of Community bodies and visits concerning Community affairs.</P>
    <P>During the period under review, Portugal submitted an application for membership of the European Communities. Since then, as the House knows, a further application has been received from Spain.  There are, there-fore, three applications for membership before the Community and the effects <Col N="490" /> of accession of these three countries could have a far-reaching impact upon the future development of the Community. So far accession negotiations have begun with only one of these countries, namely Greece, and although the other two applications are still under examination by the Commission in accordance with the provisions of the Treaties it would be a mistake if we were to deal in isolation with each of these applications on its merits without bearing in mind the overall consequences for the Community and for its common policies of an enlargement involving all three countries.</P>
    <P>There are clearly good political reasons for having all three countries as members of the Community and in this sense Ireland in common with our partners has welcomed the applications for membership.  Clearly, the strengthening of democracy throughout Europe is a highly desirable objective.  But we must also be mindful of the overall consequences of enlargement and ensure that not only will we create a larger Community but a better one. We are particularly concerned that enlargement should strengthen the cohesion of the Community so that it may all the better be able to achieve the ultimate goal of political and economic integration.  In Ireland's view, enlargement must be a means for moving the Community onto a higher plateau and this presupposes an efficiently working Community with the additional resources required to maintain and expand the benefits of common policies to new entrants and existing member states alike.  These are the criteria which govern Ireland's attitude to enlargement and which will guide our approach to any accession negotiations. This view is, I believe, shared by a majority of the other member states who, like ourselves, are concerned that enlargement must lead to an improvement of the Community as a further step along the road to ultimate European union.</P>
    <P>In the area of European political co-operation the Nine, in accordance with the inter-governmental procedures established for this co-operation, continued to meet regularly at ministerial <Col N="491" /> and official level to consult on and as far as possible to co-ordinate their foreign policy positions.</P>
    <P>Particular attention has continued to be paid to the situation in Africa.  In a general declaration on Africa on 18th April, 1977 the Foreign Ministers of the Nine expressed concern at the situation in Namibia, Rhodesia and Zaire, reaffirmed their willingness to co-operate with any African state in the rejection of attempts by any state to set up a sphere of influence in Africa, reiterated their support for the Organisation of African Unity and reaffirmed that they would do everything possible to promote democratic majority rule and non-racial government for the peoples of Southern Africa.</P>
    <P>Earlier, on 31st January, 1977 the Foreign Ministers expressed their deep concern at the attitude of the illegal Rhodesian authorities which had endangered efforts to find a solution to the situation in that country.  They appealed to all the parties concerned to continue to seek a negotiated settlement which would result in an orderly and rapid transfer of power to the majority in Zimbabwe and confirmed their intention to comply strictly with their obligations in relation to sanctions.</P>
    <P>As an expression of their continuing concern over the situation in Namibia, the Nine made a <i>démarche</i> to the South African authorities in February which set out once again the essentials of a settlement which would gain international acceptance.</P>
    <P>To mark the International Day for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination on 21st March, 1977 the Nine sent a message of support to the chairman of the United Nations Special Committee against Apartheid.</P>
    <P>In May, 1977 a statement on behalf of the Nine was delivered at the United Nations Conference in Maputo, Mozambique on Namibia.</P>
    <P>The Nine continued their consultations on matters arising from the Final Act of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE) and <Col N="492" /> the co-ordination of their positions in preparation for the CSCE review meeting which commenced in Belgrade on 4th October.  The purpose of this meeting is to review the extent to which the 35 participating states have implemented the provisions of the CSCE Final Act, which contains a declaration of principles guiding relations between the participating states and detailed provisions aimed at encouraging contacts and co-operation in the security, economic, humanitarian, educational and cultural fields, and also to discuss means of facilitating and improving implementation.</P>
    <P>The Nine continue to meet frequently to discuss Middle East topics. Following the European Council meeting of 29th and 30th June last, the Nine released a statement outlining their common approach to the question of a resolution of the Middle East conflict.  The statement represents a milestone in the evolution of the Community's Middle East policy and reflects the development which has taken place in Nine thinking since the last such declaration in November, 1973.</P>
    <P>In the period which is covered by the Tenth Report a development of major significance took place when, on 1st June, 1977, a new treaty, commonly known as the Budgetary Powers Treaty, came into effect following its ratification by the member states.  This new treaty amends certain financial provisions of the treaties establishing the European Communities and of the treaty establishing a Single Council and a Single Commission of the European Communities.</P>
    <P>The major significance of the new treaty is that it accords to the European Parliament the explicit right to reject the draft Community budget as a whole and to request that a new draft be submitted to it.  Another power which the new treaty grants to the Parliament is the sole right, acting on a recommendation from the Council, of giving a discharge to the Council in respect of the implementation of the budget.  This power of discharge, which in effect amounts to <Col N="493" /> a power to declare the accounts for each year finally and duly closed, was previously exercised jointly by the Council and the Parliament.  In addition the new treaty makes it obligatory for the Council to consult the Parliament and to obtain the opinion of the new Court of Auditors before it makes financial regulations relating to the management of the budget of the Communities.  Hereto-fore the Council could make financial regulations without consulting either the Parliament or the Audit Board. Another significant provision of the new treaty is that it is now more difficult than previously for the Council to reject a proposed modification by the Parliament to the Community budget where such a modification would not increase the total expenditure of a Community institution, that is in cases where a proposed increase in expenditure would be offset by a reduction elsewhere.  This is because the new treaty provides that in such cases in future modifications will stand accepted unless the Council votes by a qualified majority, namely 41 votes out of 58, to reject them.</P>
    <P>The treaty also provides for the creation of a Communities' Court of Auditors to replace the existing Audit Board.  The new Court of Auditors which is expected to commence operating shortly will consist of nine full-time members appointed for a six-year term of office by the Council after it has consulted the European Parliament. The court is intended to have a greater authority and independence than the outgoing Audit Board and its powers are incorporated directly into the treaties rather than, as in the case of the Audit Board, mainly in financial regulations.</P>
    <P>The powers that the Court of Auditors will have at their command will be extensive.  For instance, in exercising its powers of investigation the Court of Auditors will be able to examine all revenue and expenditure of all bodies set up by the Communities in so far as the relevant constituent instrument does not preclude such examination.  It is empowered to carry out on-the-spot audits if necessary in both the institutions and <Col N="494" /> in the member states.  In the latter case the audit will be made in liaison with national audit offices or competent national departments.  The Court will have the authority to ask for any document or information, necessary to its task, from Community institutions, national audit offices or competent national departments.  It may also, on the request of an institution, submit observations or deliver opinions on specific questions. The Court will assist Parliament and the Council in their exercise of powers of control over the budget.</P>
    <P>The purpose behind the creation of a Court of Auditors is to meet the difficulties created by the increasing size of the Community budget and the need to ensure more effective control over the financial management of the Community.</P>
    <P>While the effects of the new treaty will be immediately to strengthen the budgetary powers of the European Parliament it is expected that these powers will assume a much greater significance when placed in the context of a Parliament which will be elected directly by the people of the Community in May or June, 1978.  I might say in that instance, hopefully in May or June, 1978.</P>
    <P>As the House is aware, the various member states have for some time now been preparing the domestic legislation necessary to provide for the holding of direct elections.  Here at home the European Assembly Constituency Commission have presented their report and this report has been adopted by the Government who will soon introduce a Bill on direct elections.  Once that Bill has been passed into law the way will be clear for the holding of direct elections in Ireland.</P>
    <P>It should be noted that the target date fixed by the Rome Summit was May or June, 1978, and we have consistently expressed our support for that target.  As I have indicated, despite the change of Government we will certainly be ready to fulfil our obligation.</P>
    <P>The Fourth United Nations Conference on Trade and Development <Col N="495" /> which was held in Nairobi in May, 1976, adopted a resolution&mdash;Resolution 93&mdash;on an integrated commodity programme which called for negotiations with a view to commodity arrangements being drawn up in respect of 18 named commodities.  The resolution also called for steps to be taken towards the negotiation of a common fund.  In the period under review Ireland as well as the other Community member states participated in negotiations on the integrated commodity programme, specifically on a number of commodities in the programme. In relation to the common fund a United Nations negotiating conference took place in March, 1977, and was adjourned without reaching agreement on the question of a common fund.  However, within the Community itself agreement was reached at the European Council on 25th/26th March, 1977 on the principle of the establishment of a common fund.</P>
    <P>This agreement enabled the Community together with the other industrialised countries represented at the final stages of the Conference on International Economic Co-operation in Paris to reach agreement on the principle of the establishment of a common fund.  It is a source of satisfaction that the Community spoke with one voice and played a positive role at the conference which concluded on 2nd June, 1977.  It is to be hoped that this agreement on the principle of the establishment of the common fund will give an impetus to the work of the United Nations Negotiating Conference on a Common Fund which is to resume in Geneva in November. It is indeed my hope that the agreements reached at the Paris conference will lay the foundations for further agreements in the North/South dialogue in the future.</P>
    <P>In the context of the Community's overall Mediterranean policy, Co-operation Agreements were signed between the Community and the Machrek countries, Egypt, Syria and Jordan, on 18th January, 1977 and with Lebanon on 3rd May, 1977.  An additional protocol and a financial protocol to the Community/Israel agreement were signed on 8th <Col N="496" /> February.  This extension of the benefits of the Community's Mediterranean policy, involving trade, financial assistance and economic and technical co-operation is a welcome development. The successful implementation of these agreements will contribute to a more balanced relationship between the Community and its Mediterranean partners.</P>
    <P>An additional protocol and a financial protocol to the Community/ Cyprus Association Agreement was also concluded in June extending the agreement until the end of 1979.</P>
    <P>The Community's imaginative policies in its relations with countries of different stages of development, exemplified by the Mediterranean co-operation and the Lomé Convention, have my support.  The value and effectiveness of these policies are illustrated by the desire of so many countries to participate in such agreements. I know that I speak for all parties in the House on this question, as evidenced by the wholehearted approval given by this House yesterday to motions on the accession of three new states to the Lomé Convention.</P>
    <P>The &ldquo;Tokyo Round&rdquo; of international trade negotiations, known also as the &ldquo;MTN&rdquo; under the auspices of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) was launched in September, 1973.  Very little real progress has been made in the negotiations since 1975 mainly because of the unfavourable world economic climate and, more recently, the US election and change of administration there.  The most difficult issues between the developed countries concern the EEC and US and they relate principally to agriculture and tariffs. The problem of differential treatment for developing countries is also very difficult.  The main areas of the negotiations are agriculture, tariffs, non-tariff measures, safeguard system, developing countries and raw materials.</P>
    <P>The deadline for completion of the negotiations has been successively extended. However, at the Downing Street Summit in May, the major participants committed themselves to seeking substantive progress in 1977 <Col N="497" /> With a view to giving new impetus to the negotiations, President Carter's Special Trade Representative, Mr. Robert Strauss, at a meeting with the European Commission in Brussels on 11th July, proposed an accelerated timetable which envisages the conclusion of the negotiations in 1978.  The attitude of the Community to the time-table is one of overall positiveness tempered by a concern to ensure that balance in the results is maintained.</P>
    <P>The prospects for the negotiations, in the light of these developments, are better than has been the case for some time and if the current political will can be translated into positive action there should be considerable progress in the next six to nine months. Negotiations on the crucial area of tariff reductions are now entering a substantive stage.</P>
    <P>The agriculture sector continues to benefit very substantially from EEC membership.  Payments to Ireland under the FEOGA Guarantee Section amounted to over £104 million in the first half of this year.  Community funds will also be made available for an accelerated programme to eradicate brucellosis, tuberculosis and leucosis in cattle.</P>
    <P>The Community has a continuing large surplus of milk and milk products and on 16th September a co-responsibility levy of 0.9p per gallon on milk was introduced.  This is to be paid by milk producers to Community funds and used to improve the market outlets for dairy products.  It is understandable that dairy producers are reluctant to pay the levy but it should be noted that any increase in the market for dairy products must be of benefit to Irish dairy farmers in the medium and long term.</P>
    <P>Earlier this year due to a wide divergence between the Irish and UK green £s and the fact that certain processed agricultural products were not covered by the Community MCA system Irish biscuit and confectionery manufacturers were placed at a severe disadvantage compared to UK manufacturers of the same products.  To safeguard the interests of the Irish manufacturers it was necessary to take <Col N="498" /> national measures imposing duties on the goods in question until the Commission eventually introduced an MCA system for these products on 4th July, 1977.</P>
    <P>Due to the relative strength of the £ at present Irish MCA payments are at a relatively insignificant level and we are still expecting Commission proposals on the future of the MCA system.</P>
    <P>The Commission are expected within the very near future to produce revised proposals amending and improving the directives on structures.  We are, of course, anxious to see these proposals and intend to press for the reform of the directive on structures.  Ireland's case against France regarding restrictions on the admission of sheepmeat to the French market is at present proceeding before the European Court. There have, of course, been more contacts with France in recent months regarding the overall situation.</P>
    <P>As regards Fisheries the report covers a period when, following on the failure of the Council of Ministers to reach agreement on a revised common fisheries policy in the new situation resulting from the extension of exclusive fishing limits, by concerted action of the member states, to 200 miles as from 1st January, 1977, efforts were made to implement interim measures to conserve fish stocks.  In addition, interim arrangements were agreed for Third Countries who had traditionally fished in the extended waters of Community states such as Ireland, for example the USSR and Spain for whom temporary autonomous quotas were fixed; these have since been renewed at intervals.</P>
    <P>Because of the relatively very large area of water which now falls within Ireland's jurisdiction the question of interim conservation measures was of particular interest to this country and the period under review was characterised by very intense activity in this respect.  The view was taken that a system of conservation based on quotas alone was not sufficient to protect stocks around our coast or allow the Irish fishing industry to develop.  This continues to be our position, as <Col N="499" /> evidenced by the specific conservation measures such as the closure, temporarily, of certain herring fisheries which have been taken recently.</P>
    <P>The report describes fully the unilateral measures in regard to size of boats taken earlier in the year, the reaction of the Commission to those measures and the court action which ensued and resulted in the measures being suspended.  I do not wish on this occasion to enter into a discussion on the merits of that episode.</P>
    <P>I would, however, like to say a word about the alternative &ldquo;fishing plans&rdquo; scheme mentioned in the report.  This alternative was not found to be workable as an interim measure.  This does not necessarily mean that such a concept is to be rejected for all time. Something of the sort with an effective licensing system might well form part of the permanent regime to control fishing effort outside the exclusive coastal band which we are seeking.  It was not, however, satisfactory as a hasty expedient.</P>
    <P>Before I conclude, I should like to say that the Minister for Fisheries and I shall be having what I am sure will be very useful discussions with Commissioner Gundelach here in Dublin tomorrow in preparation for the special meeting of the Council of Ministers on Fisheries to be held in Luxembourg on 24th and 25th October.  It is the earnest desire of the Government that a satisfactory agreement, taking a full account of our unique circumstances, on a revised common fisheries policy be reached as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>In the period under review, the recovery from the economic recession continued but at a moderate pace.  The weakness of investment has been an important cause of the slow recovery. Unemployment throughout the Community is still at historically high levels, and there is continued concern at the number of young people among the total.  Industry is still running well below capacity, and while inflation has slowed marginally in the first half of this year, it remains unsatisfactory. Prospects for 1977 suggest a growth <Col N="500" /> rate of about 3 per cent.  By comparison projections for the Irish economy indicate a growth rate of almost 5 per cent this year.</P>
    <P>In March of this year the Council adopted the Fourth Medium-term Economic Policy Programme, which provides the framework for Community action in the economic field from 1976-1980.  The programme states that the restoration of full employment must be the prime economic policy objective at Community and national level during the coming four years. The programme also contains guidelines for a minimum annual average growth in GNP of 4.5 to 5 per cent during the period, with a reduction of inflation to a maximum of 4 to 5 per cent by 1980 in all member states. However, it is fair to say that there is considerable concern that the targets adopted for the medium-term will not now be attained.</P>
    <P>In order to promote greater economic growth and employment the board of governors of the European Investment Bank have approved an increase in the bank's activities.  In June this year a loan from the EIB to Ireland of £10 million was approved.  This will be used towards financing the Cork Harbour and City Water Supply Scheme.</P>
    <P>On regional policy, one of our main criticisms against the Community has been the lack to date of a comprehensive regional policy backed by an adequate regional fund to meet the problems of the increasing disparities between the richest and poorest regions of the Community.  The elimination of such disparities we have always seen as an essential step on the road to economic and monetary union.  Since our accession the gap between the richer and poorer areas of the Community, far from narrowing, has widened.  Obviously, this will be a matter of major pre-occupation for the Government in our involvement in the Community in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>As Deputies are aware the European Regional Development Fund was set up three years ago with a ceiling of 1,300 million units of account of which we were to get an effective 6.5 per <Col N="501" /> cent of £35 million.  This was completely inadequate for our needs and we thought and said so at the time.  The Commission now propose to endow the fund on an annual basis but the figure mentioned for 1978&mdash;750 million European units of account&mdash;does not meet one of our basic criticisms&mdash;the lack of a real fund.  Even if this figure were accepted it would limit the maximum amount that would be committed to Ireland at about the £25 million mark next year.  This should be compared to our total capital budget for 1977 which exceeds £600 million.  I can assure the House that we will continue to strive for a real fund to be adopted.</P>
    <P>At the moment negotiations are going on in Brussels on revised regulations under which the fund would continue after the 1st of January next. These include a radical departure on the existing regulations in that they propose that the fund should include a section under which the fund would aid member states on a non-quota basis. We welcome this idea in principle as we consider it introduces an element of flexibility into the present system. However, we are insisting that its use should be confined to the already designated regions and to problems of a regional nature.</P>
    <P>As Deputies can see from the Tenth Report the Commission have also tackled the question of regional policy by setting down the guidelines a Community Policy in this area should follow and endeavouring to build up a system whereby the regional policies of the member states would be better co-ordinated.  A draft resolution formalising such a scheme is at present under discussion.</P>
    <P>The regional fund also has a part to play in cross-Border economic co-operation. Already funds from it have been used to finance a study on communication in the Derry-Donegal area which should be released fairly soon. The Government will then examine its recommendations to see how feasible they are and what role they can play in future cross-Border co-operation schemes.  In addition, we have a number of other projected studies in the pipeline.</P>
    <P>So far as social policy is concerned, <Col N="502" /> I need hardly remind Deputies that the major social problem facing the Community at the moment is unemployment. At the moment there are 5.4 million or just more than 5 per cent of the Community's labour force out of work.  Ireland has the most serious figure with 9.4 per cent of our labour force unemployed.</P>
    <P>During the period under review there were two major conferences on the problem.  The Standing Committee on Employment consisting of the Ministers for Social Affairs of the Nine plus the Social Partners and the Commission met in early May and discussed the question.  The Tripartite Conference which has the same membership as the SCE with the additional attendance of the Ministers of Finance of the Nine met at the end of June.  Finally, the two European Councils that took place&mdash;at the end of March and June respectively&mdash;discussed also the problem with particular reference to what the Community as a whole could do about it.  The points covered included borrowing at the national and international level, reduction in working hours, longer schooling periods and earlier retirement.  It was agreed by the Tripartite Conference that the Commission would undertake a programme of studies on the following four points:</P>
    <P>1.  What are the cost effectiveness and implications for industrial output of work-sharing schemes?</P>
    <P>2.  What is the role of employment creation in the tertiary sector in the present context?</P>
    <P>3.  What changes are necessary in the pattern of investment in the EEC in the light of increasing competition and the Third World?</P>
    <P>4.  What could be done to promote both public and private investment which would create rather than do away with jobs?</P>
    <P>In addition the Commission is to keep the overall situation regarding employment, investment and growth in the Community under review.  It was envisaged that a further tripartite conference would be held to consider <Col N="503" /> these reports when they were ready perhaps in the new year.</P>
    <P>The first six months of the year also saw the review of the Social Fund regulations getting under way.  This fund was originally set up in 1961 and revised in 1971.  It is primarily concerned with training/retraining schemes.  We have benefited from it since accession.  In the past four-and-a-half years over £50 million has been committed by the fund to projects in Ireland of which nearly £20 million has actually been received.  Somewhat in the region of 12,000 received training from AnCO last year as a result of its aid.  While this situation is reasonably satisfactory from our point of view I would like to say that I am concerned that people are not just being trained for the sake of being trained and this is a point we are keeping under constant review. Ideally the training should be linked to existing demand for skilled labour.</P>
    <P>The fund is at present under review but no final decision has yet been reached on the final form of the new regulations.  They should however include a number of improvements from our point of view.</P>
    <P>I hope that this analysis will enable the House to have a reasonably up-to-date discussion on events within the European Community during the period covered by the report, namely up to the end of June.  Of course it does not cover the period in respect of which we have had responsibility to represent the country within the Council of Ministers.  Much of what I have said obviously happened before we were in Government and does not represent the input of our policies to the Community.  However, as I have indicated, if Members wish to raise in a general way matters which have arisen since I will be glad to report to them and to indicate what I see as being the new direction which the Community have taken even since the end of June, directions which I might say at this stage are regarded as being very encouraging and reasonably optimistic.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the Minister for his statement, which is <Col N="504" /> very helpful.  While he is right in saying that the report does not cover any period of this year during which he had ministerial responsibility, he has been generous enough in his comments to refer to a number of current activities including the meetings tomorrow with Commissioner Gundelach.</P>
      <P>This is my first time to make any contribution at all on this subject. I had other responsibilities during the last four-and-a-half years.  I would like to preface my remarks by saying that certainly it is desirable to have a debate as soon as possible after publication of the report so that the debate has relevance to present developments and future activities.  I would also like to see some debates in this House on the reports of the Joint Committee of the Oireachtas dealing with EEC legislation.  I understand that no such debate has ever taken place.  That Committee are looking at the drafts of future legislation and certainly looking very much into the future where in the nature of the 1972 legislation the reports which are issued by the Department of Foreign Affairs are historical reports.  It is always difficult to find time, and the Opposition as much as the Government will indicate from time to time what they consider to be their priorities. Those priorities are, quite frankly, often times related to what is considered to be politically advantageous at any particular time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be highly desirable that at this early stage of this Dáil we would make a resolution, and throughout the Dáil respect the resolution we now make, to have debates on European affairs more frequently.  I believe that if we make that resolution we can probably also make and respect a resolution to make our contributions short.  That would be very helpful. It is important that we should do it now, more important than ever before because of the imminence of direct elections to the European Parliament. There is a danger, unless our people see the European Parliament as being related to their welfare and as having an impact upon their present position and future prospects, that they may not vote as heavily as they ought to vote <Col N="505" /> in that election.  Therefore I would hope that between now and whenever the elections will take place there will be a number of useful and constructive debates on European affairs in this assembly of ours.  If we would agree and if it could be done procedurally&mdash;I would imagine it can&mdash; we could whenever we are debating the reports of the Minister for Foreign Affairs also take such reports of the Joint Committee as Members may wish to raise here.  It would be a useful opportunity for us to get the thinking of the Minister and of the Government on a number of issues which may arise in the course of the workings of that Committee.</P>
    <P>There are two very significant developments facing us in the European Community.  One is the application of the three prospective members, Greece, Portugal and Spain, and the other is the European elections. Taking the application of Portugal, Spain and Greece first, we in Ireland have a general agreement that the presence of those countries in the European Community is very much to be desired.  It will help to strengthen the European Community and make the Community what they are not yet; although they claim by their title to be European they are not yet European. They are only part of Europe, though admittedly perhaps the most significant part, including, we may say with all due modesty, ourselves.  However, just as the Council of Europe now is about to extend to 21 countries, it is highly desirable that ultimately we would see a community of Europe which will be as all-embracing as the Council of Europe is at present.  In fairness to the prospective members and to existing membership it is essential, however, that the institutions of the Community would be strengthened either before the advent of the new members or concurrent with their membership.  If the Community are to receive three new members in their present state there is a real danger that the Community will be considerably weakened.  Indeed, at least one member state&mdash;to wit, Britain&mdash; appears to anticipate with some joy the possibility that the extension of <Col N="506" /> the Community from The Nine to the 12-member entity would in some respects weaken the Community.</P>
    <P>In some circles the view appears to be gaining strength that it would be desirable for the Community to be little more than a free trade area A free trade area in which a country like ours is not given an effective voice in determining policy would not be to the advantage of this country. We must therefore insist that at all levels of the Community, in the Council and in the Parliament and in all our contacts with the Community. any extension of membership of the Community will not be allowed to weaken the Community.  Indeed we should use the arrival of the new members as an occasion to strengthen the institutions of the Community at all levels.  If we do that we have very little to fear from the new membership. As far as Ireland is concerned we would have a great deal to gain. We have not been blessed with as much sun or the same climate as the Mediterranean countries who are now applying, so we have little to fear from the point of view of competition with their agricultural products.  However, if the common agricultural policy, which is a cornerstone of the Community, is to be weakened in some way or other because of the problems which may arise in competition between the prospective members and France and Italy, that could operate to the disadvantage of this country.  That is something we must not allow.</P>
    <P>We have a very good reason for not allowing it apart from our own problems.  We can point to the failure of the Community to produce a worth-while regional policy.  The Regional Fund is a mere pittance.  It was barely sufficient to justify the expectations which existed in this country and in other countries at the time of our accession to the Community. Admittedly, when the Regional Fund was constructed, all countries, including those who are now in surplus, were in a state of economic trauma following the oil crisis of 1973-74.  In that situation there was a natural reluctance to commit to the Regional Fund <Col N="507" /> significant sums of money which, of course, are a drain upon taxpayers and the Exchequer in other countries. But these countries that are called upon to make a net contribution to the Community are gaining immensely from the free trade market for their products, and they would not be in the healthy position they are in to-day if the Community did not exist.  This ought to be put in the balance against the understandable reluctance they may have about making a net contribution to the Community.  The amount of finances they are asked to contribute is only a small part of the profits which have accrued to the surplus countries by reason of the existence of the Community and the privileges which they have enjoyed in that market as a consequence.</P>
    <P>The Commission has proposed an increase in the Regional Fund for next year, and it is to be assumed that Parliament will not diminish that sum; in fact Parliament is likely to demand an even greater amount of money for the Regional Fund next year.  It will ultimately go back to the Council of Ministers and I hope we will not once again at the Council of Ministers have a number of countries strongly opposing a realistic Regional Fund.  If they continue in the future with the policies they have advanced and enforced in the past, then the gap between the better-off areas in the Community and the poorer ones, as the Minister said, will increase considerably and the corrective action which will be necessary in the years ahead will be much more costly and much more painful than anything which may now be required to gradually assist the poorer regions to move towards a level of economic well-being comparable to that which is obtainable in the centre.</P>
    <P>To return to the question of the application of Portugal, Greece and Spain, I would like to remark that the countries in question have just emerged from periods of dictatorship. There is an understandable anxiety in many parts of Europe that there should not be in the Community any member which failed to respect the <Col N="508" /> democratic way of life.  However, the Rome Treaty does not visualise any breaking away from the Community. It will be recalled that, during our own debate here before entry, one of the arguments advanced by the opponents of the Community was that once Ireland went in it would always be within the Community and unable to come out.  That is because the Rome Treaty visualises the European Community as a permanent institution and also imposes upon anyone who accepts membership the obligation to remain. If that obligation to remain exists, parallel to it is the non-existence of any exit in any such circumstance at all.  Therefore we want to ensure that any country that enters the Community undertakes on a permanent basis to maintain a democratic system of government.  If it should fail to observe a democratic system of government we will have to provide some means whereby the membership of that country should be terminated, or &mdash;maybe that is too strong a suggestion to make&mdash;we should certainly provide that the rights and privileges of membership of such a country which engaged in dictatorship would be suspended while the democratic processes were not observed.</P>
    <P>This will mean that we ourselves, in common with other countries, must make a pledge to maintain our democrtic systems.  I am sure that is not something that any party in this House or any responsible section of the Irish people would hesitate to give.  We will have to give it; others will too and, as a consequence, the Community will be politically strengthened and be better off.  The Minister, I think, said that we should ensure that the accession of new members would make the Community better off.  I agree with him in that, but we must certainly see that if it does not make it any better than it is at the moment, it is not in any way worse either economically, socially or politically.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the Court of Auditors.  That is a baby that has had a long period of gestation.  I am not sure whether it will be necessary to induce its birth.  The Minister may perhaps know whether Parliament has <Col N="509" /> this week approved the nominees to the Court of Auditors.  I understand that Parliament was to consider the matter this week, but I certainly hope there will be no further delay.  I recall that as far back as last February or March we were under considerable pressure to nominate an Irish member for that court, and it was being said at that time that unless we nominated an Irish member there was a possibility that Ireland would not have a member on the Court of Auditors which is composed of nine auditors.</P>
    <P>The particular agreement which establishes the Court says that it would not be necessary to give each national state a member of the Court, but in practice I am glad to say each nation state has been given a member on the Court.  However, a number of countries delayed long after February or March last in making their nominations.  I think it was only two months ago that the last nomination from Britain was made.  It is very disappointing that an institution which should have been in being many months ago has not yet been brought into operation.  Ireland&mdash; Deputy Dr. Garret FitzGerald in particular&mdash;was most insistent that a Court of Auditors be established, because we were appalled at the ways in which some of the European money had been handled.  I am glad to say that our public finances in Ireland are managed on a much better basis than a great deal of Community funds have been handled in the past.  It was because of our anxiety and anxiety also in Britain that Community funds should be handled properly that we were so insistent that the Court of Auditors be established.  It is now over six months behind the time scheduled for its coming into being, and I hope this week will see the end of that delay.</P>

      <P>I am relying on the script.  Perhaps I was reading something else at the time.  I do not think he used the word &ldquo;possibly&rdquo; in the script.  I he used it I think he was quite right to do so.  Of course it is highly desirable that the European elections should be held, and it is not at all satisfactory that one member country, in this case Britain, should be the cause of delaying them.  If I understand the position in the French legislation, which has already been adopted, France is quite willing to participate in direct elections to the European Parliament provided all other countries accept the obligation as well.  That is a fair enough principle.  I would hope that our legislation would be in the form which we introduced when we were in Government, that is, that we would not make it conditional upon participation by other countries.  It is highly desirable that we would give our people the opportunity to select their representatives in the European Parliament.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are possibly one of the most conscientious of European countries. On a recent occasion in Brussels and during discussions here last week with European journalists it was remarked that the Irish newspapers, television and radio give more publicity to the activities of the Commission than those of other countries.  This is a healthy sign which shows that we are anticipating the Europe of the future and that we realise the great significance of membership to us.  If this healthy atmosphere is to be maintained it is highly desirable that we should have a very heavy poll in the elections, whenever they take place, but if Britain continues to delay European elections I fear a certain amount of <Col N="511" /> cynicism and disappointment may pervade here and in other countries.</P>
    <P>It is high time that Britain stopped trying to have the best of both worlds. For the first time in their history, the British people had a referendum to decide whether they should embark on an important line of political and economic policy and there was a very substantial majority in favour of British membership.  Now that Britain is a member it is high time that she would play a full part, not a reluctant or a protesting one.  That involves that she would accelerate the legislation necessary to permit her to have direct elections next May or June.  Understandably, it may be that the anxieties of a domestic election in Britain next year may upset the programme of legislation but it is greatly to be desired that if the direct elections do not take place in May or June they will certainly take place in 1978, and I would urge the Minister and anyone else who is a member of any institution in the Community to maintain pressure on Britain to ensure that the rest of Europe, which wants direct elections, can have them so that the European Parliament will have more significant powers in the future.</P>
    <P>Perhaps Britain wants to be ruled by Westminster and by Westminster only.  So be it.  We have our attachment to our Dáil and Seanad.  Each member country has a pride in its national institutions, but we must think as Europeans as well as nation states just as people in counties and parishes have to think on a national basis. Our scale of thinking must be broader than in the past and that involves, logically, direct elections to the European Parliament and greater powers for that Parliament.</P>
    <P>It may be thought by some people that the direct elections will not be of great significance because of the limited powers which so far have been given to the European Parliament.  I can understand that point of view. That Parliament has quite considerable power to influence the Commission and the Council just, indeed, as members of the Opposition in our Parliament have powers to influence <Col N="512" /> legislation and public opinion.  Both public opinion and the utterances of the Opposition, if not always with acknowledgement, help nevertheless to mould Government policy and in specific cases to amend legislation. Similarly with the European Parliament; although its powers in the past have not been as great as those now being conferred on it, it has been influencial in pressing the Council of Ministers to adopt particular lines of policy.  I had that experience during my four years as a member of the Council of Ministers.  Although the utterances of Parliament have not been always reflected in decisions of the Council or of individual councils, there have been occasions when Ministers under the pressure of criticism in Parliament have changed the courses they had intended to take.</P>
    <P>If Parliament were directly elected it would have to be respected even to a greater extent in the future, and in the course of time a directly elected Parliament will be very likely to get additional powers.  The significant power which has been given to it is to reject the budget put before it by the Commission. Up to now it has only had limited power in relation to the budget. Of course it is right that in any area of political jurisdiction the control over the budget should lie with the people who are directly elected and directly responsible to the electorate.  The Members of the European Parliament will have a five-year period of office and will then have to answer to their constituents in their individual countries for the way they have discharged their duties.  I am convinced that parliamentarians elected with a mandate to go to the European Parliament will insist on getting greater powers than those which have been given to them so that at the end of their period in office they can justify the confidence placed in them by their people.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke about the MCA system proposal.  This is very urgent although perhaps not so urgent as it was last year when the pound sterling and the Irish pound were less healthy than they are.  Nevertheless, the complications which arose in the last few years from fluctuations in currencies <Col N="513" /> were enormous and operated in different ways to the disadvantage of Ireland and particularly those engaged in the export of agricultural goods.  The problems thrown up by this fluctuation could not be answered by adjustments of the green £ or the green kroner or mechanisms of that kind. They simply helped to alleviate the problems.  It should be realised that when the MCA system was first established nobody visualised that currencies would fluctuate in the crazy way <Col N="514" /> they did.  That experience can occur again and on that account we should press the Commission to bring forward proposals.  The likelihood is that if and when they come forward it will take up to two years before the Council of Ministers can resolve all the technical difficulties.</P>

      <P>A widow's non-contributory pension at the maximum rate was in payment to the person named by the Deputy up to 28th July, 1977. Following a reinvestigation of her means it was ascertained that her income, derived from a holding of land, had increased substantially since the date of the last assessment in her case and her rate of pension was reduced accordingly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="461" /> Representations made by the Deputy were accepted as an appeal on behalf of the widow.  Before referring the case to an appeals officer it was decided to make further inquiries regarding the assessment of income from the holding. These inquiries are being expedited and it is hoped to have the matter placed before an appeals officer within the next ten days.</P>

As, however, the certified incapacity is the same as that which appeared on his certificates in respect of a previous claim which had been disallowed from 30th March, 1977, following examination by a medical referee of my Department who expressed the opinion that he was capable of work, a decision on his current claim has been withheld pending a further examination by a medical referee.  This examination has been arranged for 21st October, 1977, and a decision on the claim will be given in the light of the medical report on this examination.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment if he will state in respect of the superannuation scheme recommended in the Interim Report of the Working Party (Prl 6415), (a) the principal changes recommended (b) the date on which the detailed instructions on the operation of the scheme were issued to local authorities and (c) if his Department will arrange for a reprint of the Report in the form of a booklet on the lines of recent publications of the Department of Labour on protective legislation.</P>

      <P>The Report of the Working Party on Local Authority Superannuation contains a total of 33 recommendations, the majority of which will be applicable as a package, on the basis of options by pensionable officers and pensionable servants. The relative importance of each recommendation will depend on the particular circumstances of the individual.  Among the more important recommendations made in relation to officers are the payment of maximum lump sums after 40, instead of 45, years of service; the preservation of accrued superannuation benefits for those who resign voluntarily before age 60; and the facility to allow persons who would have short service on retirement to purchase additional years of pension credit.</P>
      <P>The pension rights of servants are being brought into line as far as possible with the pension rights of officers, and, in their case, the more important recommendations provide for the payment of lump sums on retirement, calculated on the same basis as for officers; the coordination of pensions with Social Welfare pensions in respect of service on or after the operative date; improved arrangements for the reckoning of service; and the addition of years to service in cases of early retirement on the grounds of permanent infirmity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Detailed instructions on the operation of the scheme giving effect to <Col N="473" /> the recommendations contained in the report have not yet been issued to local authorities, but the intention is that each pensionable employee will be provided with a copy of the scheme and also with an explanatory memorandum designed to assist him in understanding the effects of the scheme and in deciding whether or not to have it applied to him.  Copies of the actual report are available for purchase at the Government Publications Sales Office; while these are in stencilled form at present, a printed <Col N="474" /> version should be available not later than 1st November.</P>
