      <P>In the original question I asked for the number of persons registered at each employment exchange in Dublin city and also the number registered in Ballyfermot. Could the Parliamentary Secretary indicate how many people are unemployed in area No. 10 of Dublin?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Parliamentary Secretary aware that there are over 1,700 persons, not including school-leavers, unemployed in Ballyfermot, and that the organisations operating in Ballyfermot are anxious that information would be made available to them from Government sources?  Is he further aware that I obtained information here in the House from the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Welfare some time ago about the number <Col N="860" /> unemployed?  How can the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance indicate now that he has not got that information?  Is it that the Government do not want to produce the appalling figures to the House and to the people?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brosnan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he will provide additional facilities and staff at St. Mary's Orthopaedic Hospital, Gurranebraher, Cork, to cope with the increasing demand for hip-replacement operations in the Southern Health Board area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Corish) Brendan Corish">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Corish)</NameTxt>
      <P>The provision of additional facilities and staff at St. Mary's Orthopaedic Hospital, Gurranebraher, Cork, is a matter for the Southern Health Board in the first instance.  An additional house officer was appointed to this hospital early in 1976, bringing the total medical staff to three orthopaedic surgeons, three registrars and three house officers.  There are no proposals before my Department for additional facilities at this hospital.</P>
      <P>The board recently submitted proposals under the special job creation programme for additional staff for the board's various services and these include requests for some additional nurses, attendants and a physiotherapist for St. Mary's Orthopaedic Hospital.  These proposals are being examined in my Department at present.</P>
      <P>I understand that the Southern Health Board recently discussed the question of waiting lists for hip-replacement operations at this hospital and that a report in the matter is being prepared by the board's staff.  I should mention that a number of improvements have been carried out in St. Mary's Orthopaedic Hospital in recent years.  A new plaster theatre was provided in 1973 and a five-bed recovery room in 1974.</P>

      <P>Detailed planning of the new Tralee hospital by the design team is proceeding but is not expected to be completed until the end of 1977 so that the question of the commencement of building work will not arise this year.

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Minister for Local Government (Mr. Tully) James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Tully)</NameTxt>
      <P>No such directives have issued.  The invoking of a bond where an estate is not completed in compliance with the relevant planning permission is a matter for the planning authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the hardship caused to so many residents of estates not only in Cork but throughout the country, would the Minister consider having a uniform approach among the local authorities and issuing a directive to advise them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>They have been advised, and the Local Government (Planning and Development) Acts, 1963 and 1976, enable planning authorities to attach a condition to a grant of planning permission requiring the giving of security for the satisfactory completion of housing estates, and enforcement action, including where appropriate, action on foot of any deed of covenant and bond may be taken by the planning authority where an estate is not completed in accordance with the terms of the relevant planning permission.  There is nothing further we can do.  This has been brought to the notice of local authorities <Col N="863" /> on a number of occasions.  However, if Deputy Fitzgerald has any particular instance in mind where he feels the local authority are not doing what they should do, perhaps he would bring it to my notice and I will remind them of their responsibilities.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government if it is proposed to regulate the use by breakdown or recovery vehicles of flashing lights when they are towing other vehicles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The lighting requirements relating to the use of vehicles are contained in the Road Traffic (Lighting of Vehicles) Regulations, 1963 to 1970.  They do not provide for the use of flashing lights in the circumstances indicated by the Deputy, and I do not intend to amend the regulations to provide to that effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that many breakdown and recovery vehicles as well as some large vehicles which carry wide loads are using such flashing lights?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="864" />
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I have noticed that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware also that a number of prosecutions are pending in this regard and that the motor traders have been in touch with his Department on the matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that the law does not allow the use of these types of lights on vehicles other than those used for specific purposes.  A number of organisations have sought permission for the use of various types of flashing lights but such requests are refused because article 2 of the Road Traffic (Lighting of Vehicles) (Amendment) Regulations, 1967, permit the use of yellow rotating lamps on certain classes of vehicles owned by the Minister for Transport and Power while article 52 (18) of the same regulation permits blue flashing lights on ambulances, fire brigade vehicles, vehicles used in the delivery or collection of human blood and on Garda vehicles.  The EEC Directive relating to lighting and signal devices for mechanically propelled vehicles adopted in July, 1976, specified all the lighting requirements considered necessary in the interest of road safety. Flashing lamps of the type referred to by the Deputy are not provided for.</P>
      <P>I am aware, though, that amber flashing lights are permitted in Britain and Northern Ireland for breakdown vehicles.  Since it is almost certain that the EEC will impose a ban which will prevent the use of such lights even in Britain and Northern Ireland, we do not propose to change the regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>It is obvious that breakdown and recovery vehicles use these flashing lights.  Indeed, I would consider it advisable that such vehicles would be equipped with lighting of this nature in order to give warning to motorists.  As a man who is on the road frequently, I am sure the Minister will agree and that it is only a matter of providing accordingly in the regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter is not as simple as that.  As I have said, a number of other organisations have requested <Col N="865" /> permission to use these flashing devices but they have been told on all occasions that the EEC regulations exclude them.  It would be foolish to make provision in this regard now and then to have to change the regulations in, say, 12 months time after the EEC had made an order to the effect that the use of such lights was to be discontinued. The best course to adopt is to let people know they are not entitled to use such devices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the purpose of the question because, in addition to these lights being used by breakdown and recovery vehicles, they are being used by many large transport operators who perhaps are not aware that what they are doing is illegal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brosnan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government if he will request Cork County Council to make a special contribution to the Whitegate extension group water scheme to <Col N="866" /> cover the increased costs incurred by the group in meeting the requirement of the council of laying larger piping, laying it along the public road and installing hydrants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Cork County Council required this group to use 4 inch asbestos cement piping in lieu of 4 inch hard plastic piping, which would have been less expensive for the group.  The additional cost involved was provisionally estimated at £1,000. On 14th July, 1976, my Department wrote to Cork County Council agreeing that the amount involved might be defrayed by the council out of the loan for the Whitegate regional extension scheme.</P>
      <P>I understand that the council have not been asked to contribute further financial assistance in respect of any of the items referred to by the Deputy, as the normal State and local authority grants, combined with local contributions, should have been adequate to finance the cost of these items.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two proposed group water schemes in the Lisacuil area which will be served from feeder mains already laid by Roscommon County Council.  Water will not become available, however, until the augmentation of the Ballinlough-Cloonfad public supply.  I understand that the county council are carrying out the necessary augmentation work and that they hope that it will be completed later this year.</P>
      <P>No proposal for a group water scheme in the Moyne area has been submitted to my Department.  The area will, I understand, be supplied from a feeder main which Roscommon County Council propose to lay to Cortoonmore.  The county council's proposal was approved by my Department on 24th February, 1977.</P>

This is the big problem which the Minister must be aware I have been raising with the Department of Local Government and the Department of Lands over the past three years with no result.

      <P>I have received reports that Derry Pier and Harbour Commissioners have decided to close Carrickarory Pier, Moville, County Donegal, to commercial traffic, because of its deteriorating condition.  Available information indicates that the pier is not used to any significant extent for commercial traffic or for fishing.  I have no power under existing legislation to acquire this pier.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that this matter is quite important to the community there whether or not it could be regarded in national terms as of importance?  Is the Minister further aware that coal and fertilisers can be landed at £1 a ton cheaper at Carrickarory Pier than if it is discharged further up the river in Derry?  Is the Minister also aware that if this pier were in the hands of the State, as it should be, and was properly repaired and maintained, it would be of great use to the fishermen of the area as well as to the commercial life and would relieve the over-burdened Greencastle Harbour facilities, which it has been promised will be extended but it looks as if they will not be extended for many more years?</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> As the Deputy probably knows, Carrickarory Pier and Moville Harbour are under the control of Derry Port and Harbour Commissioners.  My information is that Moville Harbour was recently repaired and the Department of Agriculture gave a contribution of £87,000 and some contribution was also made by Derry Harbour Commissioners. In regard to Carrickarory Pier which is in the harbour but about a mile south of the town, the information I have is that the use being made of it is insignificant.  In regard to the Deputy's proposal that this pier and presumably the harbour should be taken over by the State or, perhaps, by Donegal County Council, legislation would be necessary to do this and the records show that this has been considered at various times over the past 50 years.  It was considered as recently as 1970 when the then Minister apparently decided to take no action.</P>

      <P>In the circumstances of the isolation of the Inishowen Peninsula and while the movement and the landing of goods at that pier may appear small in national terms, in view of the fact that it is much cheaper and that it serves this peninsula in a particular way, would the Minister give a further thought to its importance relative to the area that it serves? What is now to be done about this pier that we do not own, which is proposed to be abandoned by the Derry Harbour Board?  In any previous examinations there was no question of its either falling into disrepair or disuse, as is now proposed.  It is now not being used officially, due to its condition.  Will the Minister urgently examine this situation with a view to promoting the necessary legislation to acquire this pier?</P>

      <P>Would the Minister find out on the spot just how useless is the £87,000 that was spent at Moville?  Time and again I tried to get that money spent on the other side of that headland.

        <i>(Cavan):</i> Deputy Brennan seems to be under the impression that it is proposed to close down Moville Harbour.  That is not so; it was recently repaired and there is no question of closing it down.  I take it that Deputy Brennan's question also refers to Carrickarory Pier, <Col N="873" /> and on the basis of that, legislation would be necessary to take this over. This matter has been considered several times and I cannot help thinking that both Deputy Brennan and Deputy Blaney as members of a former Government had every opportunity of considering the matter.  I am sure they did consider it but a decision was taken as recently as 1970 by my predecessor to do nothing about it.  It is right that they should say that recently an application has been received from Donegal County Council for a grant towards the repair of Carrickarory pier.  I am not in a position to say what decision will be given on that because it is still under consideration. It will be considered and a decision will be given.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>A case can be made out for that.  However, it comes rather badly from those benches in view of the fact that it was the Fianna Fáil Administration who incorporated in the Prices Act, 1958, the exclusion from price control legislation of charges in respect of activities carried on by or on behalf of a Minister of State.  In October, 1971, the then Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy Lalor&mdash;and I am happy to see him in the House&mdash; established the National Prices Commission whose powers did not extend to an examination of charges for such services as the Post Office, carried on by a Minister of State.  Subsequently the Prices (Amendment) Act, 1972, brought certain charges previously excluded for activities of semi-State bodies under the price control legislation, <Col N="875" /> but the continued exclusion of Post Office charges from control legislation was a fully deliberate decision. Speaking in the Dáil on 11th July, 1972, the then Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy Lalor, said that he considered it would be inappropriate that the activities of the various Departments of State, local organisations, vocational education committees and harbour authorities should come within the scope of the Prices Act as that would lead to unacceptable confusion as to the functions and responsibilities of various Ministers.</P>
      <P>This Government have, however, sought to bring in the National Prices Commission in a broad, general way, not in the fixing of charges but by way of a consultancy study commissioned by them to be carried out and this was considered by my Department.  The study was published in 1976 as Occasional Paper No. 21 and if the Deputy is not in possession of a copy I would be happy to provide him with one.  It says on page 64, paragraph 4.3.1:</P>
      <P>The Size of Price Increases.</P>
      <P>Increases in the Department's charges have not been large enough to cover the rise in its own costs, as shown in Appendix V.  With one exception they have also lagged below those in the wholesale price index (perhaps the best gauge of the business community's measure of what is reasonable) and in the consumer price index.</P>

      <P>The above table shows that the index of postal charges....has been ahead of the wholesale and consumer price indices for only two short periods.  Telegram charges have been below the indices throughout, and telephones on which the loss has risen to a very substantial level, have also risen in price by less than the indices.</P>
      <P>Any reasonable person who reads that consultancy study will have to conclude that increases in charges recently sanctioned were in no way excessive.</P>

Following this application, the first phase of the work, comprising science and home economics facilities together with improvements to toilets and cloakrooms was completed in 1974.

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to <Col N="890" /> take Questions Nos. 26, 27 and 28 together.</P>
      <P>The strength of the Garda Síochána in the City and County of Waterford in mid-1975, was 159.  In mid-1965, it was 152.</P>
      <P>The deployment of Garda resources is a matter to be decided by the Garda authorities, the precise arrangements for policing particular areas being made by or in consultation with the local Garda officers.  I am aware that the Garda authorities consider foot-patrolling to be a very important part of Garda activity and that they ensure that it is practised on as wide a scale as is possible having regard to the available resources.  Extra foot-patrols have been established recently but it would be contrary to practice to give particulars.</P>
      <P>I might mention in this general context that provisional figures indicate that, while more indictable crimes were committed in the cities of Dublin, Cork and Limerick in 1976 than in 1975, fewer were committed in the cities of Galway and Waterford.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware of the present serious situation in Dublin city as regards break-ins? The Garda authorities have informed me that they are inundated with reports of break-ins and there is widespread vandalism.  People are reluctant to come into the city at night.  It seems that the situation calls for further remedial measures and surely the Minister could take some steps to deal with that position?  Traders are also concerned and have made representations to the Minister so far without any success.  The situation has deteriorated.</P>

I do not think it is correct, as the Deputy says, that people are afraid to come into the centre of the city. <Col N="891" /> There is no reason for them to be afraid because the task force has been deployed in those areas with considerable success, according to the information which I have from traders in that part of Dublin.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the debate this day week the position in regard to the Companies Office file on this company has clarified itself a little further and there have been further developments. Some further expensive charges have <Col N="909" /> appeared on this file in favour of a new bank which has come on the scene for the first time&mdash;the Ulster Investment Bank Limited&mdash;and a further charge to one of the existing banks.</P>
      <P>In addition, I received in the post this morning from my searchers a letter enclosing copies of the three annual reports for 1974, 1975 and 1976 for this company.  They told me these reports became available on the file for the first time last Thursday, 4th March. They were not filed on the 24th January as the Minister stated in this House. Apparently the three reports were filed for the first time on the 25th February, 1977, and were made available to the public for the first time last Thursday.</P>
      <P>In the short time at my disposal I have examined these documents, which are of considerable interest.  I shall have to refer to them, perhaps, in some detail, at this stage and at later stages.  The first thing that appears is that there was a major change in shareholding in this company about which we were never informed by the Minister.  So far as one can judge from the returns filed, that change in shareholding took place on 12th December, 1975, the date of the signing of the secret agreement between Bula Holdings, Patrick Wright, certain other parties and the Minister.  On that date Bula Holdings, the unlimited private company whose shareholders we do not know, transferred 800,000 shares to a company called Norofin Nominees Limited, having its address at Norofin House, 7-8 Wilton Place, Dublin, 2.  This company, I understand, is a subsidiary of the Northern Bank Finance Corporation Limited which, in turn, is a subsidiary of the Northern Bank Limited, which is a subsidiary of the Midland Bank Limited.  We have the situation, therefore, that the registered ownership of 800,000 shares is under the effective control of the Midland Bank Limited, one of the major London clearing banks, and the other 200,000 are under the control of the executors of the late Patrick Wright. There are a number of matters about which we were never informed.  We have a new director who has been there for some time, but we were not informed of that fact.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>No, it is Mr. Cathal Young.  He may be representing the Midland Bank, I do not know.  He appears to have come on the scene about the same time as the Midland Bank became registered as owners of 80 per cent of the shares in Bula Limited.  It is strange that we did not hear about this fact before.</P>
      <P>The matter I want to deal with in particular, as a result of this major change of shareholding in the company into Norofin Nominees Limited is to ask the Minister what is the position now about the enforcibility of the secret agreement of the 12th December, 1975?  The agreement was made between Bula Holdings, Patrick Wright, now deceased, certain other parties, whom the Minister named as two Messrs.  Roche, Mr. Weymes and Mr. Wood, and the Minister.  That agreement contained a guarantee by what is called in section 1 the &ldquo;certain other parties&rdquo; who, at that time, were all the directors of Bula Limited, but now there is another one.  When I pointed out that this indemnity existed under article 11, the Minister made the point that these four men did not guarantee in their capacity as directors &mdash;they guaranted in their capacity as shareholders.  I pointed out, with the knowledge that was available to me at that time, which was the 1973 company's return, that the major shareholder then was Bula Holdings, an unlimited private company whose shareholders we did not know and, of course, Patrick Wright.  We now find that for the past 15 months at least even Bula Holdings are not shareholders, that it is now Norofin Nominees Limited, in respect of 800,000 shares, 80 per cent of the authorised share capital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe the public are entitled to a reply to this question.  Since Bula Holdings are no longer the shareholders in this company and since the information given in section 1 is misleading, considering on that very day they gave up their shareholding, how can the Minister enforce any guarantee of performance of the contract, the opening of the mine and the working of the <Col N="911" /> mine against what in effect is the Midland Bank?  What good are those limited guarantees given by the directors, whom I showed were not shareholders when Bula Holdings were still shareholders.  They are still less shareholders now when Norofin Nominees Limited are shareholders.  What good is that guarantee of performance in the agreement now?  Why were we not told about a matter that is of fundamental importance to this whole affair, that 800,000 of the shares were transferred to a subsidiary of a major British bank?</P>
    <P>It seems to me that the reason they were transferred is probably because the bank wanted further security for their lendings.  The result is that this company can now, to a great extent, in aid of their lendings to the company, more or less do what they like. If the board of the Midland Bank in England decided that they do not want to operate this whole scheme, what can the Minister effectively do about it?  I suggest that he is in a position where he can do nothing about it.  I tried to remember, after reading this this morning about Norofin Nominees Limited now being registered as owners of 80 per cent of the shares, who comprise the board of the Midland Bank.  I recalled that a great many major figures in the Tory Party in Britain comprise the greater part of the board of the Midland Bank.  If my recollection is right, I think the current chairman is Lord Armstrong, a former Permanent Secretary to the Treasury in Britain and a real pillar of society there.</P>
    <P>It was bad enough when the Minister was locked to a minority situation <i>vis-à-vis</i> four Irish businessmen with no mining experience but I am sure even he will agree that it is a great deal worse when he is now locked into a minority situation with a fine respectable British Bank, the Midland Bank.  The Minister will probably tell me that Norofin Nominees Limited, which he never told us about, during all this debate are only holding the shares as nominees for Bula Limited or somebody like that.  They are registered <Col N="912" /> and they can effect or refuse to effect a transfer as they wish.  If they run into any difficulties with the directors, all they have to do is call a general meeting and they get their way because they are the registered owners of 80 per cent of the shares of the company.  They can pass a special resolution or do anything else they like.</P>
    <P>How can the Minister say that he has a valid, practical or worth-while guarantee of performance in respect of this?  The transfer of the shares to Norofin Nominees Limited took place on 12th December, 1975.  It was only on last Thursday, 3rd March, 1977, that the public, who are entitled to knowledge of this kind, could become aware for the first time that this very significant transaction had taken place. It seems extraordinary that this debate, which began in the House on 1st February, more than five weeks ago, should have been allowed by the Minister to drag on without our being informed that the Midland Bank, in effect, through their nominees and their subsidiaries, were the registered owners of 80 per cent of the shares in the company, into which he is buying with more than £9½ million of the taxpayers' money.</P>
    <P>Within the past few weeks two further major charges appeared on the company's file.  The first one is a deed of charge dated 4th February, 1975, registered in the Companies Office on 22nd February in favour of the governor and company of the Bank of Ireland over seven folios of land in County Meath for all sums due or to become due by the company to the bank in any manner whatsoever.  The other one is a more interesting one.  It is a debenture dated 15th February, 1977, registered on 18th February, for all sums due or to become due to the bank by the Ulster Investment Bank Limited.  It seems to cover just about everything that was covered in all the previous debentures.  We are entitled to ask are the previous debentures paid off or are they subsisting?  If they are paid off, how is it that no note of satisfaction appears, as far as I can see, on the company's file in the usual way?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="913" /> The charge to the Ulster Bank seems to cover more land registry folios than were covered already.  It is also very interesting that instead, apparently, of a contract dated 17th February, 1975 between Haras el Chorro SA and Bula Limited we now, for the first time, find the disclosure here in this file of the company of a further contract dated 17th February, 1973, made between the same parties in respect of all the estate, right, title and interest of the said Haras el Chorro SA in and to any minerals on or under the lands comprised of folio 26646 County Meath and subject to the terms and conditions contained in the said contract.</P>
    <P>We now have a second contract dated apparently exactly two years earlier than the first one in relation to the minerals under these lands which are called for convenience, the Kruger lands.  How is it that we did not hear about the second contract before this? Why is it only when I went to the public file in the Companies' Office that I discovered the apparent existence of this second contract made two years earlier that we never heard of? We are entitled to answers to these questions.  I hope we will not any longer be fobbed off with the reply that these are commercial transactions or whatever we were told in that respect before.</P>
    <P>We are also entitled to inquire as to the position about the mineral ownership under the various holdings of land that exist in the townland of Nevinstown, the important one so far as this transaction is concerned.  We know that the Wright farm, as it used to be known, is in Nevinstown.  I understand that virtually all of it is in Nevinstown, the townland north of the river where all the minerals are centred.  It is not easy to glean all the information one would like from a Land Registry map, which can be confusing if you do not have all the folios as well.  From an inspection it would appear that as well as the Wright lands, which comprise about 116 to 117 acres, in Nevinstown there are ten other holdings which are registered in the Land Registry.  <i>Prima facie</i>, therefore, there are ten other holdings in that townland comprising approximately the same area as the original <Col N="914" /> Wright farm.  It seems probable that all ten other holdings are now owned by Bula limited.  It seems probable that in the majority of those ten holdings the minerals are owned by the State; in fact, it is certain in respect of several of them that the minerals are owned by the State.  I have not heard nor has the House heard of any acquisition order in relation to those minerals or that any consideration has passed from Bula Limited to the State for the opportunity that has apparently been afforded to Bula Limited to mine these minerals.</P>
    <P>These minerals in half of Nevinstown townland are the property of the Irish people and they will be mined by a private company.  What are we, the citizens of this country, getting for our 117 acres of mineral rights in Nevinstown?  Is the position not that the true consideration for this deal, this purchase of a 24 per cent minority holding in a private limited company, is not simply £9.54 million but £9.54 million plus the value of half the minerals in the townland of Nevinstown? What is the value of half the minerals in the townland of Nevinstown? I do not know.  If one goes by the valuation that the Minister has quoted here with approval regarding the minerals in the Bula half&mdash;or privately owned half&mdash;of Nevinstown, one would be entitled to feel that the State's half is pretty valuable by any standards.  Even if, as could be the case, the State's minerals are not as valuable as the private minerals in the Wright half&mdash;of course one cannot be certain of that but postulating that they are not&mdash;do they not still hold a considerable value since they actually adjoin the Wright orebody, of which we have had so many extraordinarily high valuations?  If this open pit which Bechtel propose is to be in the town of Nevinstown, as it must be, it is reasonable to assume that part at least of that open pit will be situate on non-Wright lands or on lands in which the State is the owner of the minerals.  What consideration is the State getting for giving away to a private company approximately 117 acres of State minerals?  I asked the Minister the last day if there was any royalty; he told me there was no royalty.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="915" /> On the basis of these minerals being given away is it not fair to assume that, at a very conservative estimate, the real consideration is probably at least twice the £9.54 million that is being given for this 24 per cent?  The figure may be a great deal more than twice £9.54 million.  Assuming that it is even twice the actual cash payment, we are entitled to ask if this is the Minister's idea of a good bargain.  Why were we not told about this before and why has the Minister consistently refused during the four years he has held office to make a minerals acquisition order?  If he was advised that there were problems in respect of the Wright lands, why did he not make it in respect of the registered lands?  Where there was any doubt about the State's title why could the Minister not have sold those mineral rights if he wanted to do a deal with Bula?  Why is it that we have heard nothing about any arrangement between the State and Bula Limited for the utilisation of those minerals by that company.</P>
    <P>The Minister told us that, after all the arrangements made with Bula, Haras el Chorro, SA still own the minerals in 224 acres in the adjoining townland to the west of Nevinstown, that is, the townland of Rathaldrin. Why was there not a minerals acquisition order made in respect of the minerals in 224 acres of Rathaldrin? Why was this company, which is still registered as owning those lands, allowed under one of the contracts made either in 1973 or 1975 to retain ownership, so far as one can judge, of the mineral rights in the farm immediately adjoining Nevinstown and thereby have those Irish mineral rights which could have been acquired by the State in the beneficial ownership of a company which is domiciled and registered in Panama, that well-known tax haven in Central America?</P>
    <P>One is entitled to ask a number of questions about this whole arrangement because the Minister has said that the reason he did not make an order regarding the minerals in the lands comprising folio 26646, County Meath, was because there was no evidence of <Col N="916" /> any rich deposit of minerals in those lands.  It is worth noting that within the last week an exploration company, Messina, announced the discovery of a reasonably significant but certainly not very rich orebody south of the Tara holdings, south of the Blackwater river but immediately adjoining the Tara mine.  If there are significant minerals close to the Tara operation south of the river is there not at least a possibility that there are significant minerals close to the Bula operation north of the river?</P>
    <P>The facts are that on 17th February, 1973, an agreement was entered into by Bula Limited whereby an arrangement regarding the minerals was concluded between them and Haras el Chorro SA.  This means that the payment for these minerals as between Bula Limited and Haras el Chorro SA goes outside the country and it goes to the tax haven of Panama to which I referred.  Therefore, what ever the Minister does or does not know about the existence of minerals the owners of Haras el Chorro SA made very sure that any minerals would be paid for direct to Panama and the payment must go in the circumstances direct to Panama, a tax haven.  The transfer of ownership of shares in such a tax haven could provide a facility not just for foreigners but for any Irish resident who had a liability for the payment of tax derived from an Irish mining operation.</P>
    <P>I think, therefore, we must be given the answers to four questions which I will pose as follows arising out of this matter: (1) who were the beneficial owners of Haras el Chorro SA in June, 1972, when they became registered in the folio which I quoted; (2) what was the domicile for tax purposes of these owners at that time; (3) has any change occurred in the beneficial ownership of that company since 1972; (4) has Haras el Chorro SA any agreement as to the payment of commission or management fees with any person or company elsewhere or, indeed, anywhere in the world?</P>
    <P>For the Minister's information I would state to him that commissions <Col N="917" /> and management fees payable to unknown parties is the stripping device used by offshore tax vehicles to cloak the identity of the recipients of these moneys which are got out of the country in this way.  From inquiries I have made I discovered it is impossible in the Republic of Panama to find who the beneficial owners of a company such as this registered there are and the normal procedure that is used in that country and in some others where this sort of operation is carried out is for two companies to operate parallel or in tandem and the profits that are repatriated, if that is the right word, to Panama directly or indirectly from an Irish mining or some similar operation are paid into the account of the Panamanian company concerned in Panama and are then paid out of that account into the accounts of another company, not as profits but as what is described as commissions and management fees. The beneficial owners and ultimate beneficiaries in respect of the second company to which these payments are made are essentially the same people or persons who operate in trust for the same people as those who are beneficial owners of the first company.</P>
    <P>The matter is a complicated one but nonetheless it is operated.  It disturbs one to think that, because of the nature of the transactions&mdash;and some extraordinary things have happened in relation to this company&mdash;there is the possibility that some one or more Irish residents and, I might add, Irish citizens, could in fact be involved in Haras el Chorro SA for some purpose other than the simple purpose of owning the land.  It is worth asking, for example, why after an interval of nearly four or rather five years&mdash;no, sorry, a little over four years&mdash;from the original agreement recited here between Haras el Chorro SA and Bula Limited Bula are not registered on the Haras el Chorro SA folio in the Land Registry.  What security have Bula and what security has the State and the taxpayer if Haras el Chorro SA decided to sell these lands in the morning?  They are free to do so. There does not appear to be a charge on that folio of any description in <Col N="918" /> the name of Bula or anybody else and there is nothing there to stop the company selling the lands for which it is believed Bula paid about £500,000 some years ago.  What security have they and is it, in fact, that their security is that they have perhaps some sort of say in some way in the affairs of Harras el Chorro SA and that therefore they do not have to worry about who is registered in the Land Registry as owner of the lands because it is immaterial whether it is Haras el Chorro SA that are registered or Bula?  Is that, I wonder, the explanation?</P>
    <P>Indeed, one is lead to suspect that it may well possibly be the explanation when one examines the wording used in the registration of one of the earlier mortgages&mdash;not one of the earlier ones, but the third or fourth last&mdash;registered against this company, a legal mortgage dated 30th September, 1976, between Bula Limited on the one part and Northern Bank Finance Corporation on the other part.  That particular one which was lodged on that date, 30th September, 1976, sets out two things which are charged in favour of the Northern Bank Finance Corporation.  First of all, it sets out the lands.  It refers to an agreement of 17th February, 1975, and it sets out the lands being those comprised in Folio 26646, County Meath, but excluding and excepting thereout the mines and minerals on or under the said lands.  That is, just the land itself is charged.  The mines and minerals are not.  Then it goes on in the second section of the charge to charge all that and those, the estate, right, title and interest referred to in paragraph 1 of the agreement dated 17th February, 1975, and made between Haras el Chorro SA on the one part and the mortgagor on the other part.  Deputy Colley referred to this the last day.  The mortgagor here is, of course, Bula Limited.</P>
    <P>Why are we not told about that mortgage and the amount of the mortgage? We are being asked to ratify the payment of nearly £9½ million of taxpayers' money for a small minority interest in this company.  Why are we not told about its mortgage?  To continue  <Col N="919" /> the quotation &ldquo;and the mortgagor on the other part therein described as all the estate, right, title and interest of the vendor&rdquo;&mdash;and I want to underline the words &ldquo;of the vendor&rdquo; here because I think this may well have great significance in the light of what I have been saying about offshore asset stripping operations&mdash;&ldquo;in and to any minerals on or under the land comprised of Folio 26646 aforesaid upon and subject to the terms and conditions contained in the agreement together with the mortgagor's rights and benefits acquired under the said contract&rdquo;. What is charged here is not Bula's interest, because Bula is the mortgagor and the purchaser.  What is charged is the vendor's interest.  And who is the vendor?  The vendor is Haras el Chorro SA.  And what is the tie up that enables the interest of a selling company to be charged in respect of the liabilities of the purchasing company?  I have been at the law on and off for 16 years and I have never seen the vendor of a property charging his interest.  I suggest he cannot because he has divested himself when he has sold but, obviously, in this case there is not a divesting and Haras el Chorro's interest has been mortgaged in aid of Bula Limited.  Is there any explanation for that other than that there is some overlap between Bula Limited or the people associated with it and Haras el Chorro SA, the Panamanian tax vehicle?  One is bound to ask that in the context of this whole affair of secrecy and non-compliance with the law, the non-furnishing of information that by law is required let alone required by common sense.</P>
    <P>I am entitled to renew with particular aptness at this juncture this party's request that the secret agreement of 12th December, 1975, be laid on the table of the House.  In addition, I am entitled to ask that the two agreements of 17th February, 1975, between Haras el Chorro SA and Bula Limited be laid on the table of the House and the agreement of 17th February, 1973, between the same parties.  I am also entitled to an answer to the questions I asked in relation to the ownership or control and any possible changes in the Haras el Chorro SA set-up.  These matters considerably disturb me from my <Col N="920" /> study of this and anybody else in the House who wants to look into these details can have all the documents in my possession.  I believe if they read those documents they will be equally disturbed by this very curious carry on.</P>
    <P>Is it not a strange thing that a Bill was introduced here at the end of January, 1977, referring in the first section to a secret agreement dated 12th December, 1975, naming some of the parties to that agreement but, in particular, naming the principal party which was Bula Holdings Limited and that the Minister who introduced that Bill and has conducted the debate here should have neglected to tell the House that on the date of that agreement 800,000 shares were transferred out of the name of the principal shareholder that appears in section 1?  Is that not a matter that is fundamentally relevant to this entire affair?  Is it not a matter which entitles all of us to be even more suspicious about all this than we were in the past?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Keating)</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall try to deal with the matters raised by Deputy O'Malley in the order he raised them. The first was the matter of Norofin Nominees Limited, the subsidiary of the Northern Bank Finance Corporation Limited which is a subsidiary of the Northern Bank.  The transaction referred to was one where the shares in Bula Limited which were held by Bula Holdings were transferred to Norofin Nominees Limited.  That was a private arrangement between Bula Holdings and Norofin Nominees Limited which will not affect my rights.  At the time of the completion of the contract for the share purchase by me the shareholders in Bula Limited, that is Bula Holdings and the estate of Mr. Wright, must be the owners of the entire share capital of Bula Limited.  That is a matter for the vendors to be able to give me what I purchased from them.</P>

      <P>As the House is aware, I have extremely good legal advice <Col N="921" /> and this matter is being handled by expert people but the situation, which is a perfectly straightforward one, is as I described it; it was a matter between Norofin Nominees Limited and Bula Holdings.  With regard to Haras el Chorro SA, I have indicated during the course of the debate that the principal contract between Bula Limited and that company is one for the acquisition of lands known as the Kruger Lands which Bula require as support lands for their mining operations. These lands are essential to enable the company to mine the deposits of lead and zinc which underlie the Wright lands.  It is the surface use of these support lands which is important. The lands have not been acquired because of mineral potential.  I am advised that these lands are unlikely to contain workable deposits of minerals.  However, there is a second contract which would enable the right to work minerals to be acquired by Bula Limited if the present opinion of experts is proven wrong and the workable deposits are found to exist.</P>

    <P>These two contracts are listed in certain of the charges registered by banking institutions in the file which is in the Companies Office.  They are listed because the banks have accepted these contracts as securities for making loan facilities available to Bula Limited. The entry in respect of the charge is in legal language but I believe the term &ldquo;mortgagor&rdquo; in this case is used to define Bula's relationship with the Northern Bank and not with Haras el Chorro SA.  The suggestion by Deputy O'Malley that the entry could be read as meaning that Haras el Chorro SA have mortgaged their interest in the minerals to the Northern Bank is not so.  My understanding of the entry in the Companies Office file is that the bank have accepted Bula's interest in the two contracts as a security for advancing a credit facility to Bula Limited in the same way as they have accepted Bula's interest in the Wright lands and minerals as security for borrowing. Bula has entered a commercial contract with Haras el Chorro SA and I, as an investor in Bula, am concerned with the commercial aspects of that which will be subject to the same sort of detailed scrutiny that all other matters <Col N="922" /> on closure will be.  I am informed as a matter of fact that the 1973 date to which Deputy O'Malley made reference is incorrect.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no evidence whatsoever that there are any workable minerals outside the Wright farm. There has been no making over to Bula of any State rights in any minerals whatever and, therefore, that entire speculative passage by Deputy O'Malley simply does not arise.  First, there is no evidence that there are any minerals and, secondly, there has been no making over of any State rights whatever to Bula.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will go back to the matter I reiterated on the last occasion which is that a company that is proceeding to develop a mine against an asset of between 15 million to 20 million tons of rich ore containing more than two million tons of metal has the right and duty to acquire service land and the physical environment in which it can carry on mining.  It has the right to incur charges in order to carry out that development and it is prudent that it should do so.  My task is to see that any such contracts entered into and any such charges are made available to my scrutineers and are <Col N="923" /> thoroughly checked and understood.  I can give the House an absolute guarantee that that is being done meticulously.  That is a duty I have and it is being carried out.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister care to answer the four questions I asked about Haras el Chorro SA?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I made the position about Haras el Choro SA quite clear and, perhaps, the Deputy will think through the information I gave him. I tried to take it clearly and slowly. He should digest the implications of that information on the matters he raised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to point out the implications to the Minister. He has told us that Bula have purchased substantial land&mdash;I understand about 230 acres&mdash;which belonged to Haras el Chorro SA, and which the Minister referred to as the Kruger Lands.  The company have bought these lands without the mineral rights because the owners regarded the minerals as too valuable to sell&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Otherwise why should they go to the trouble of trying to separate the minerals from the land, which is never done in the normal way?  One understands that the price Bula paid for these lands is in the region of £500,000, although they did not pay it all because they have taken mortgages from the vendors.  It is understood that they paid this money more than four years ago but they are still not registered as owners in the Land Registry.  Although it is difficult to make it out from the folio, as far as I can see there is no inhibition or charge to protect the rights of Bula. The possible explanation of what on the face of it would appear to be gross negligence on their part is that it is not gross negligence because there may be some overlap between Haras el Chorro, SA and Bula, there may be some identity of interest.  I asked the Minister four specific questions which I am entitled to repeat because he did <Col N="924" /> not even attempt to answer them.  My question referred to the beneficial interest in Haras el Chorro SA in 1972 and whether there were any changes since then.  I also wanted to know the domicile of the owners for tax purposes and if there was any agreement on the part of the company for payment of commissions and management fees with any person or company outside this jurisdiction, presumably in the Republic of Panama.</P>
      <P>I am perfectly entitled to ask these questions.  On the one hand the Minister tells us that Bula own this 230 acres, what he calls the Kruger lands, but if one goes to the Land Registry one finds out that Haras el Chorro SA own them.  Bula have paid a sum, reputed to be in the region of £500,000, for these lands.  The State is buying into Bula Limited but we seem to have no security.  If the owners of Haras el Chorro SA in Panama decided tomorrow morning that they wanted to sell this 230 acres there is nothing to stop them doing so.  On the evidence of the title that appears on the register, as far as I can see the Registrar of Titles has no option but to register any transfer that is validly executed by Haras el Chorro SA.  That is why these questions are pertinent and relevant and need to be answered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy knows that the taxation position of Haras el Chorro SA is confidential between them and the Revenue Commissioners. In regard to the timing of actions by Haras el Chorro, I will put some points on the record.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the vesting of the lands in the name of Mr. Kruger, the Land Commission received such a request in June, 1970, and consent was given in November, 1970.  The consent in respect of the transfer of the lands to the company was given in December, 1970, and I think that should be known.  Deputy O'Malley pointed out that the registration did not take place until 1972.  My information is that the contract of sale for the purchase of the lands was concluded at the end of 1970, the conveyance was completed in early January, 1971, an application for registration in the Land Registry was made in February, 1971, <Col N="925" /> and the lands were not formally registered until July, 1972.  I am saying that to indicate that the involvement of Haras el Chorro SA predated the purchase contract between them and Bula by a number of years.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question of registration, the lands are not registered in the Land Registry because the sale has not been completed as a contract of sale.  Bula will not require the use of the lands for some time; it is not possible to be specific on this but they will not be required for some time after start-off.  The question of the completion of the contract and of the sale and the matter of payment are deferred. It is not sinister or anything other than perfectly normal procedure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a number of matters that must be clarified.  Perhaps we might start by concentrating on the matter the Minister has been discussing, namely, the question of registration in the Land Registry of ownership of what he referred to previously as the Kruger Lands.  It would appear that the contract for the purchase of these lands by Bula was entered into in February, 1975.</P>
      <P>Ignoring the &ldquo;1973&rdquo; which I gather from the Minister is a misprint, we will take it as 1975.  The position then is that the contract was entered into just over two years ago.  The Minister says the sale has not been completed and that is the reason the registration has not taken place, and he finished up by saying that what has happened is perfectly normal.  I do not think it is perfectly normal.  It may be that there is an explanation for this lengthy delay, but I think the Minister will find, if he makes inquiries, that two years is not normal.  There are cases where it happens, of course, and there are reasons why it can happen, but they are not normal cases.  Consequently, I would ask the Minister, first of all, if he could tell us why the delay of over two years in completion?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the position is that from the Bula point of view they need the lands but they do not need them now.  As I understand the negotiations, it was a matter of saying <Col N="926" />&ldquo;We have a contract that must be discharged, but the payment is deferred because the need for them is deferred&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister may not appreciate&mdash;and I am not blaming him when I say this because it is a technical, legal point&mdash;the point that was made by Deputy O'Malley&mdash;that one would expect in circumstances of this kind that there would be what is called an inhibition registered on the folio, which is a warning to anybody who might otherwise be tempted to deal with the registered owners that there is an interest existing.  Could the Minister make inquiries and inform us why this fairly normal procedure was not followed in this case?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's reply does not quite meet the situation.  The Minister has painted a picture&mdash;and I do not wish to do him an injustice when I say this; I think it is a fair summary of what he said&mdash;of two companies operating at arm's length, one of them having a use some time in the future for the lands of the other entering into a contract for the purchase of these lands, but nothing being done to complete that transaction because the Minister has said there is no need for the lands at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is an understandable position, but it is not understandable that this would happen and that no effort would be made to register an inhibition on the folio.  This would be a normal precaution by Bula Ltd., into which the State is buying, and I think it is not unreasonable that we would ask why this normal precaution has not been taken.  It is not sufficient for the Minister to say that his legal advisers will look after all these matters in due course.  The question is why they have not looked after this particular point up to now. It may be that there is some other explanation, but, in the absence of another explanation, the explanation advanced by Deputy O'Malley as a possibility is not unreasonable, that <Col N="927" /> is, that there is no need for an inhibition because, in fact, the parties are not at arm's length.</P>

      <P>I made it clear that I will have all the relevant matters carefully scrutinised by experts, but my own opinion and the opinion of others from this side of the House has been, and is on the record, that <Col N="928" /> these are matters that are not relevant to be teased out in this detail, and that it is absolutely unique in the history of the House that an effort is being made to do it in this instance. It is not in the tradition of the House, and it would make dealings between the State and private companies pretty well impossible if this were to be the norm.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is repeating something he said before, and therefore I may be forgiven for very briefly repeating what I have had to say on this subject, that is, that the unprecedented nature of this debate lies in the terms of the Bill.  This is an unprecedented Bill, and that is what has produced the whole difficulty and more and more as we go into it, it becomes clear that if there had been full disclosure by the Minister we would not have had anything like the same difficulty we have had in dealing with this matter.  If I may return to the question, the Minister appears to have lost sight of the salient features of what is going on.  He tells us we are now asking for details of an agreement entered into between one private company and another private company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGrattanEsmonde" hpid="Mr. Esmonde Mr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that not what the Deputy is asking?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>In strict reality that is true, but is it not about one-quarter of the truth?  Is it not the whole truth that the Minister is asking this House to agree to the payment of over £9,500,000 to some shareholders in one of these private companies and that it now emerges, largely through the industry of Deputy O'Malley, not from any disclosure by the Minister, that one of the matters to be considered in this transaction is that there is an agreement with this company in respect of which the Minister proposes to pay over £9,500,000 for a 25 per cent share?  There is an agreement between that company and another company for the purchase of land, and there are unusual circumstances attached to that, in that over two years have elapsed and the sale has not been completed.  The Minister has given an explanation as to why that has happened, <Col N="929" /> but given that the explanation is correct, I want to suggest again that it would have been a normal precaution by Bula Ltd. to have entered in the relevant folio of the Land Registry an inhibition or a caution relating to this contract, but that has not been done.  I want to ask again why it has not been done.  Is it not true that we are also entitled to ask since the State proposes to acquire an interest in this company, in what way are the interests of that company and, consequently, the interests of the State, being protected? Why are they not being protected by the registration of an inhibition or caution on the folio?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the face of it, Bula's interests and, consequently, the State's interests, are not being protected.  We know that the people concerned with Bula Limited are good business people, that they are not the kind of people to take unnecessary risks or whose legal advisers would take unnecessary risks, but it appears that they are taking a risk here.  For the reason advanced by Deputy O'Malley, it is possible that they are not taking a risk.  There may be another explanation and if there is the onus is on the Minister to give it to us.  However, if there is no other explanation it is not adequate for the Minister to say that in due course his legal advisers will look after this matter.  We are not talking about something that will happen in due course. We are talking about the position during the past couple of years when, as Deputy O'Malley said, a sum reputed to be in the region of £500,000 was contracted to be paid for this land. There is nothing on the folio which, in law, would prevent Haras el Chorro, SA, from disposing of this land to somebody else.  If it is of great importance as, apparently is the case from what the Minister has said, why, (a) is the deed not completed and (b) if the Minister's explanation in that regard is satisfactory, why at least are precautions not taken to ensure that any potential purchaser is given notice of the existence of the contract?  I asked the Minister what date was provided in the contract in respect of closing but by way of reply he went on to talk about two private companies while being careful to ignore the investment <Col N="930" /> proposed for the taxpayers in one of these companies.</P>
    <P>It is not good enough for the Minister to adopt this attitude.  The State's interests are not being protected.  It is the business of the shareholders in Bula to look after their own interests but the matter becomes the business of this House when it is proposed to invest more than £9,500,000 of taxpayers' money.  It is for us to look after the taxpayers' interests.  This is not being done in this case when there is no indication whatever on the folio regarding Bula's interest in these lands.</P>
    <P>If the Minister says that there is no connection whatever between Haras el Chorro, SA and Bula Limited, he is saying there is no protection for the rights of Bula in regard to the transaction. There is provision in the Land Registry rules for exercising such protection. Either there is a connection between the two companies or the interests of Bula Limited are not being protected adequately.</P>

I suggest that if the Minister's advisers were to allow part of the assets to be sold before the State closed the sale, a very serious view would be taken of their competence.  I suggest, therefore, that the time of the House be not wasted on an assumption that a fraud would be perpetrated in respect of Bula Limited by the company with whom the contract had been entered into.  There is no reason to assume anything like that would happen.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Esmonde has much experience in this field.  I, too, have some experience of these matters. <Col N="931" /> It is not unusual for an inhibition or a caution not to be entered.  Therefore, there is no significance in their not being entered on the register at this time.  This is the position in the ordinary course of events in respect of many transactions.  The Deputy seems to be concerned that there may be something sinister behind this and that, because no caution or inhibition has been entered, the State's interests are not being protected.  I assure him that there is no justification for such fears.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>In the case of a normal contract concluded in a normal time there would be no registration of an inhibition or caution but, no doubt, the Attorney General will have appreciated the point of my inquiry as to the date provided for the closing of the sale.  If the date is within a reasonable time after the making of the contract, one would not expect the registration of an inhibition or caution at that time but since in this case the matter has dragged on, one would have expected something to be done about it.  Alternatively, if the date contemplated at the time of the signing of the contract was very far advanced, say, two, three, four years or more, of the date of closing, one is entitled to ask why an inhibition or caution was not registered at the time of the signing of the contract.</P>
      <P>It is not good enough for the Attorney General to give as an explanation an assurance that the State will not complete the deal if it transpires that Haras el Chorro, SA, dispose of the land or mortgage it, as they are entitled to do at present. They are the registered owners and there is nothing in the registry to prevent them from disposing wholly or partially of their interest in the land.</P>

      <P>Every detail I have spoken of is spelled out in documentation and can be backed up.  It is not enough for somebody, even for somebody who holds the office of Attorney General, to come here in aid of the Minister and say that it is not usual for a purchaser to protect himself in any way in a sale which is still not closed more than two years after the contract was signed.  Heretofore the Attorneys General did not come in here frequently in aid of the Minister, but I suppose previous Ministers were not as much in need of aid as the present Minister.  The average person here who does not know what happens in these matters would assume that because the Attorney General comes in and says that it is perfectly all right the purchasers who will expend £500,000 in buying land in this country do not care if they have no <Col N="933" /> protection when the contract, under which they will pay this money to buy these lands, is still not completed more than two years after they signed it. That is not so.</P>
      <P>If one was buying a labourer's cottage for £3,000 or £4,000 and the sale was still not closed after two years the purchaser would be protected.  Here we are buying a very large tract of land for a figure that is reputed to be in the region of or, perhaps, in excess of £500,000.  When the company concerned, which already has shown how lax it is where company law and complying with its obligations are concerned, into which the State has put a huge amount of taxpayers' money for a 24 per cent interest, does not apparently bother to take any steps to protect itself&mdash;the Minister has not contradicted this&mdash;we are told that that is reasonable, normal and usual.  It is not normal or reasonable in Limerick or anywhere in Munster and from my experience of Dublin and elsewhere it is not normal.  When the Attorney General makes such a statement, it is hoped that it is accepted and that no one will question the matter any further. The matter is very much questioned further.  It is significant, as I referred to the last day, that here again we have the Attorney General sitting right through this debate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Not at all.  I welcomed the fact the last day.  We also have the additional benefit today that not alone have we the Attorney General but we have Deputy Brendan Halligan and that is really an acquisition. The elucidation that Deputy is able to throw on all these matters is quite splendid.  We are intensely grateful to the Deputy and we hope that his engagements will allow him to stay with us until 7 o'clock.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I asked a large number of questions in my opening statement today.  A very small number of them have been partly replied to.  Some of my most explicit questions have been totally ignored. One is entitled to wonder is this for the reasons we have had in recent <Col N="934" /> weeks, that the Minister still does not know the answers, or is it, that he has taken the trouble to find out, but chooses to keep them secret as he has kept so much secret in relation to this whole sordid affair over the past number of weeks?  One is entitled to inquire as to why this secrecy is maintained at such extraordinary length, a secrecy that has extended over in relation to information which by statute must be made public and which was not made public by the Government.</P>
    <P>Since we failed to elucidate many of the matters with which I opened today, I wish to discuss the question of the valuation which has been put on this company and on which the amount payable by the taxpayers tax-free to the four or five concerned shareholders is based.  This question is related to this section.  Our opposition to this Bill has concentrated on the elements of uncertainty that should weigh with any normal, prudent investor about to embark on the expenditure of £9.54 million at least.  It now appears that the expenditure will be a good deal more than that.  I hope it is now clear for all to see that this is no time for the Minister to involve himself by means of a secret agreement in the affairs of a company whose start-up date is uncertain, whose commercial viability is unproven, whose capital requirements are unknown and whose management is inexperienced in mining matters and which has already shown itself to have little regard for the statutory rules governing the conduct of the company's affairs.  I have shown that to date the management of the company have permitted what appear to be a number of offences under the Companies Act, 1963, and the Minister has not denied this.  It appears that these breaches took place on four separate occasions.  I have tried to let some light into the effects of the secrecy involved in this tranaction.</P>
    <P>Despite the attempts at secrecy and the difficulties that that creates, I propose to deal briefly with the valuation arrived at by the arbitrators which results in this figure in subsection (1) of this section, being payable if this Bill is passed.  On Friday, 4th <Col N="935" /> February, 1977, Mr. R. Woods, one of the proposed recipients of the £9.54 million visited the offices of <i>The Irish Times</i> newspaper.  He was quite entitled to be there as he is one of the members of the board of trustees of the newspaper.  On Tuesday, 8th February, <i>The Irish Times</i> devoted an entire page to an examination of the Bula valuations, quoting extensively from documents which the Minister has seen fit to withhold from the Dáil, the Members of this House being asked to vote this Bill into law without seeing the documents which were made available to this newspaper under circumstances which I described.  One of the documents referred to is called the Bechtel Report and the Minister has very correctly referred to the reputation and expertise of that organisation.</P>

      <P>I want to quote a few paragraphs from an article in <i>The Irish Times</i> of Tuesday, 8th February, 1977, page 12, based on Bechtel, Sykes and Carsberg's valuations which were done for Bula and which varied between £63 million and £105 million.  The article I am quoting from is one of three that appear on that page and it is the one in the top left-hand corner.  The quotation is as follows:</P>
      <P>The Bechtel Report is a feasibility study on the whole Bula mine undertaking. Dated April, 1976, it contained the basic data which was the base on which all valuations submitted to the independent consultants were prepared.  While not a financial evaluation of the mine as such, it nevertheless, on a profitability analysis of the undertaking, discloses a net cash flow of £161m. after tax and capital pay-back of £22.6m.  According to Bechtel this represents a discounted project after tax return of 39.16%.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="937" /> The net present value of the mine on this assumption according to Bechtel, is £94.36m. after discounting the cash flow at 5% which it states is equivalent to a pre-tax rate of approximately 10%.</P>
    <P>The basis of this profitability analysis is&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>There is a quotation here from the Bechtel Report given in inverted commas&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;an annual increase in net smelter return, operating costs and capital additions and replacements of 9.6%.</P>
    <P>The metal prices used are those that were in effect in early 1976&mdash; £220 per tonne of lead, US $795 per tonne of zinc (European producer price) and £0.073 per gramme for silver.</P>
    <P>According to Bechtel this 9.6% increase in net smelter return....&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It goes on to quote again&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;as prepared by Bula and presented to Bechtel&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I trust the quotation is not too lengthy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the last sentence.  I want to emphasise this part because it quotes again from the Bechtel Report.</P>
      <P>According to Bechtel this 9.6% increase in net smelter return &ldquo;as prepared by Bula and presented to Bechtel&rdquo; is based on the average increase in European producer price for zinc since the inception of the producer price to January 1st, 1976.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That may be a bit technical in some respects and I would like to refer to it in simpler terms.  What has happened is that Bula instructed Bechtel to assume a 9.6 per cent per annum increase in real terms in metal prices over the lifetime of the mine.  Bechtel and the other people who prepared valuations on behalf of Bula took that assumption and worked on that basis. It is clear from what Bechtel said that this is as presented to them by Bula. It is not their judgment of the situation but it is one of the parameters within which they are bound to work because <Col N="938" /> of the instructions they have been given by their employer who is paying them.  If one disregarded that assumption of a 9.6 per cent annual increase in real terms in metal prices and in return from the ore one would come out with a very different figure indeed from the three figures which have been put up on behalf of Bula.</P>
    <P>As I understand it, even Lazard Brothers who were advising the Minister, and Mergers and the Geological Survey had to accept this projected cash flow assumption anyway, and had to accept this assumed increase of 9½ per cent per annum in real terms in the return from the mine based on mineral metal prices.  The way that Lazard, who obviously regarded this as very unrealistic, got over it was by introducing a very much higher flow discount factor and they finally came out, as we know, with a valuation of the entire undertaking of £7.5 million.  The discount factors taken by those who were advising on behalf of Bula were, of course, very different and consequently produced a very different result.  If some average discount factor had been taken but if those doing the valuation did not have to assume for purposes of valuation that it was going to be a 9½ per cent per annum increase in real terms in the return on the metals, then we would indeed have had very different results and we would not now be in the position of the taxpayer being asked to stump up £9.54 million for the 24 per cent interest in this company.  But all the valuations had to be carried on on the totally artificial assumption that there was going to be this constant annual increase in real terms, not just cash terms, in the value of the output from the mine every year during its lifetime.</P>
    <P>It is worth going back to see what the position has been in relation to the price of zinc in real terms since the beginning of this century.  The situation is that if one starts at 1900 and comes up to 1976, in real terms the price is the same in 1976 as it was in 1900.  There is published work to this effect which as far as I know is not disputed, that is the 76-year <Col N="939" /> graph of zinc prices in Europe.  There has been some increase in the years from 1964 to 1976 in real terms in the price of smeltered zinc in Europe. There are two prices in Europe for zinc.  There is what is called the European production price, the one referred to here, and there is the London metal exchange price.  The London metal exchange is a free market but it deals with only a very small quantity of zinc now in Europe by comparison with that which is dealt in under the European production price.</P>
    <P>The European production price is arrived at by a cartel which has operated in its present form since about 1964.  That cartel, like all cartels, fixes prices at levels which suit members of the cartel.  It is worth noting that for the most part the freer price of zinc on the London metal exchange is generally below that of the price fixed by the cartel, called the European production price or levy.  Apparently, the cartel has been less prominent in the past year or two than it was previously as a result of inquiries being made by the anti-trust division of the United States Justice Department into the operations of a somewhat similiar cartel in the North American zinc market and as a result of inquiries being made as to how the European cartel operates.</P>
    <P>It may well be that, as a result of these pressures which are originating in the United States, the European cartel will become less significant than it has been over the past 12 years or so.  If that happens it is fair to assume the likelihood is that the price will drop in actual terms and, if it drops in cash terms, it will drop very much in real terms.  It would appear on that basis that the assumption which is glibly made, and has to be accepted by all the valuers whether they agree with it or not, that there will be a 9½ per cent increase annually in real terms in the value of zinc is certainly not one that could be validly made.</P>
    <P>It would be my submission to this House that any valuations which have had to accept this assumption are of little value unless they discount it enormously <Col N="940" /> as, for example, two of the Minister's advisers did, that is, Lazards and Mergers.  It would be a more realistic valuation if they were able to approach it from the point of view that they did not have to assume there would be a 9½ per cent per annum increase in real terms in zinc prices, but that they could assume what they felt in their professional vision was the likely increase, if anything at all.</P>
    <P>If one is to go on the history of the past 76 years in relation to the price of zinc, while there have been peaks at the time of the Korean war, and peaks again in the late sixties and early seventies, nonetheless the price in real terms is no greater today than it was in 1900.  In fact, I think I am correct in saying the price in real terms is actually less today than it was in about 1951 or 1952 just before the ending of the Korean war.  Therefore, it seems to me to be an assumption which has been forced on the valuers which has no validity and which should not have been forced on them. They would have been able to do a more realistic job if they had been able to project what they would consider the more likely movement in real terms in metal prices rather than the assumption which was made for them of an increase of 9½ per cent annually, which is exceptionally large when one remembers it is in real terms and with which, obviously from the wording they used in their report, Bechtel did not agree but which they were lumped with anyway when they tried to do some form of valuation.</P>
    <P>I do not think any of us on this side of the House brought out this matter sufficiently when we were speaking on the various amendments to the section.  This is the first time since the section was amended that we have gone back to discuss it as such.  It is extremely relevant and extremely valid.  It renders the value of the valuations which the Minister has been talking about very suspect indeed.  I am not suggesting any of the firms are in any way suspect but they had forced on them this assumption and, whether they agreed with it or not, they had to calculate and work out the figure on that basis.  Bechtel <Col N="941" /> certainly appeared not to agree with it and made it clear that the figure they came to was arrived at in this way, based on this assumption, although they themselves quite obviously would not have made an assumption of that kind.</P>
    <P>Lest some of the earlier matters we referred to might be overlooked, before I sit down I would again invite the Minister to avail of this opportunity to explain to the House why it is that half of the townland of Nevinstown&mdash; and this is very relevant to the whole question of valuation&mdash;in which there appear to be State minerals, or minerals potentially obtainable by the State, has not had any steps taken in regard to it, even though it would appear that some part of it at least will be mined by this company.  This is one of the matters the Minister did not deal with adequately on the earlier stages.  He should be asked to do so now.  It is not enough for him to say that, although these minerals are only 50 or 100 yards from, or in some cases adjoining the Wright farm and all the minerals we know exist there, the indications are there are no minerals in the field next door to it.  It is difficult to accept that.  The experience on the other side of the river has been quite the opposite and land which is apparently some distance from the river and from the orebody south of the river has been shown to contain significant minerals.  There is no reason to believe there is not a possibility at the very least that the same position obtains north of the river and until such time as there has been a thorough exploration for these other minerals, the State should take steps to safeguard our rights in regard to them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I simply want to state that the projections, submissions and estimates made by companies other than Bechtel were not based on any such terms or assumptions as Deputy O'Malley states.  I should like to say a little about the orebody and the value of lead and zinc, the questions raised.  Deputy O'Malley is in the business of being wiser than the arbitrators on one side, on the negative side.  I do not want to pose as being or to present myself as being wiser <Col N="942" /> than the arbitrators.  It is only fair for the sake of balance that we should put another set of arguments because there is another set of arguments.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Malley talked about the evolution of the price of zinc in relation to prices in general over the past 75 or 76 years of this century, I understood him to say.  A point which has not been made previously about lead and zinc is the following.  It is the question of the relative availability of metals from the point of view of mining.  By and large, if you take things on average, a definition of inflation is that things inflate equally rapidly and one thing does not inflate faster than another.  When you look at individual commodities that turns out to be untrue.</P>
      <P>The price relativities between metals will certainly change very markedly over the next 50 years.  We have talked about the past 75 years.  I should like now to talk about the next 50 years, or even less, for a reason which will emerge in a moment.  Geologists make measurements of things with something called the continual crustal abundance in different sorts of metals.  As the rate of industrialisation increases, as the demand for metals increases, it becomes possible to make projections, on certain assumptions of course, as to what resources will run out first.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must have seen that all sorts of agencies in the world, strategic agencies of some of the great powers and other concerned groups of conservationists at the other end have made these sorts of estimates.  So have economists and businessmen and they are the proper stuff of ordinary economic projections at this time. When you make those measures, then you can draw up in regard to metals a thing which is called the dynamic resource life&mdash;it is called that, the life of the resource whether it is gold, bauxite, zinc or anything else.  It is an index; it is dynamic in the sense that you have to make assumptions based on how frequently the materials occur in the earth crust and what sort of orebodies you will get and what sort of re-cycling you will have and many other considerations.  When you do that you can make a dynamic <Col N="943" /> resource life index for all the metals. It has been done and it is available to anybody who wants to look at it and it is relevant to this orebody when Deputy O'Malley says&mdash;and I quote him&mdash;that it is fair to assume that the price of zinc will fall in actual terms and therefore very sharply in real terms.</P>
    <P>It is not so fair to assume for a reason that will appear in a moment and about which he ought to know if he is going to pontificate about valuation. The reason is that when you make that dynamic resource life index for all the metals, you find that for cobalt&mdash;it is expressed in years&mdash;that you have 685 years as the dynamic resource life of cobalt.  Coming to something of which we need a great deal more, like iron, you have over 600 years.  We need a lot of aluminium and we have 225 years of it on this index.  Of course they are assumptions but they are the same for everybody. Those are the metals you find at the top of the dynamic resource life index and therefore if you want to argue that they will become dear slower than the average increase in the world for all prices, you can make that case because there is plenty of them.  But in that index, about which we are being so knowing and pontifical, you find that the least time of all in the dynamic resource index for metals in the world, which is 40 years&mdash;and not the par 75&mdash;is for zinc.  Anybody who knows anything about the future of resources should know that and if he does not he should not be pontifical about the valuations of expert&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>There is reason to think&mdash;among others&mdash;that this will increase in price at least as rapidly as general prices&mdash;but, of course, as it is lowest in the dynamic resource life index there is every reason to think that it will increase faster than the average.  It is a resource that may become very scarce in the very near future and that is why it is so important to keep as much national control over it as possible.  It is not like iron or bauxite or cobalt of which there is plenty and on which there is no pressure; there is intense pressure on this resource.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>So, we have an invented allocation of opinion to all the people who offered valuations, which is not factual.  We have a statement that it is fair to assume that the price of zinc will fall in actual terms and therefore very sharply in real terms. We have that &ldquo;fair&rdquo; assumption which is not fair at all and which is malicious and tendentious.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>We are getting very cross.  There is no metal in the world which is more capable of being substituted for even at present than zinc. This is one of the worries one has about zinc and it is more vulnerable for that reason to changes in market trends than most others which are not capable of easy substitution by other materials.  One of the metals that can be used for much of what zinc is used for at present is aluminium and various forms of plastic can also be used to fulfil functions of zinc at present.  One has no guarantee that the demand for zinc will be at anything like the sort of level we would like to hope would exist in future, as it has existed in the past, because of the possibility in certain of its applications of relatively easy substitution for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister does not, in fact, deny my statement that zinc today in real terms is the same price as it was in 1900.  He seems, at least by default, to accept that the assumed figure which Bula gave to Bechtel of 9.5 per cent increase per annum in real terms is a valid one.  If it is valid, as the Minister <Col N="945" /> seems to argue, and 50 others did not, as the Minister now says, have to assume the same thing, why did they not?  Why was it only because Bechtel had been told by Bula to assume this that that was correct?  The Minister now says that the others were not told to assume the same thing although <i>The Irish Times</i> report says that they were and that was written by somebody who actually read the documents. Whoever wrote the article had a great advantage over me and everybody in the House except the Minister because we are mere Deputies trying to legislate in regard to this matter; we are not allowed to read these documents in case anything might turn up that might be more embarrassing for the Minister than many other things that have turned up today, and if he says so, one assumes he was right.  Having been given the advantage by somebody who is a director of both Bula Ltd. and of <i>The Irish Times</i> Trust of seeing the documents, he practically misread them; the Minister tells us that is so. If that is so, the Minister is, in effect, saying that all the other valuers were wrong because they did not assume a 9.5 per cent increase in real terms which the Minister seems to think is a valid assumption in spite of all the historical evidence.</P>
    <P>The historical evidence is the only evidence on which one can rely because anything about the future is necessarily speculative to some degree and the fact that the Minister feels that world supplies of zinc, presumably at the current rate of usage, would be exhausted if there are no further discoveries, in 40 years' time does mean a great deal if, in fact, the use of zinc lessens and its present use is substituted for by other metals or synthetic materials of one kind or another which are constantly being invented.</P>
    <P>It is significant that the Minister has again declined to deal with the question of allowing the State half of the minerals in the townland of Nevinstown apparently to be acquired without consideration.  His only excuse is that there appear to be no minerals there.  If he would like to give me a present of them I would very gladly take them, rather than give a present <Col N="946" /> of them to his friends in Bula Ltd. to whom he has already been very munificent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been no such giving to anybody.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>If there is a townland in half of which there is apparently an extraordinary rich orebody&mdash;according to the Minister&mdash;it would not be unreasonable to assume that there are at least some minerals in the other half of the same townland, particularly since there appear to be a lot of minerals on the other side of the river in whatever townland is south of the river.  The existence of those minerals appears to extend for a very long way.</P>
      <P>The other matter with which I should like the Minister to deal arising out of what we spoke about earlier, is the fact that the Midland Bank are now the registered owners through various nominees of 80 per cent of the shares in this company which the Minister is acquiring.  The Minister said he would not give away any more of the agreement but today he told us it is a provision of the agreement that when the transfer comes to be made Bula Holdings will have to be registered in respect of 80 per cent of the shares and Patrick Wright, or his representatives, would have to be registered in respect of the other 20 per cent.  When I pointed out that perhaps the Midland Bank might place some difficulty in the way of that being done and asked what would happen if they did, the Minister did not answer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems remarkable that a transfer of 800,000 shares, 80 per cent of the company's stock, took place on the date of this agreement but it was only today that public documents, some of which should have been filed a year or two ago, became available and we became aware of this very significant development.  We have had no explanation from the Minister for his concealment of this very relevant fact. If he concealed this fact we are entitled to ask how many more relevant facts were concealed, how many more facts that would cause this House to think again about the <Col N="947" /> course on which we now seem bound? Do facts matter anymore?  Is it simply a question of what the Whip says goes?  If this House pass what is patently bad law, bad economics, bad commercial and financial arrangements, that does not matter; the main thing is to get them passed.  If there is a possibility that the Constitution is infringed by a section such as this, that does not matter.  The main thing is to get it passed and ignore the questions one wishes to ignore.</P>
    <P>Obviously the Midland Bank, through their nominees, became registered as owners of the shares in order to further their own security for the money they loaned.  They may feel it is in their interests to remain registered as owner of those shares.  If they so decided they would be entitled to take that course of action to protect their lending and to strengthen their security, and there is nothing the Minister could do about it.  His agreement was with Bula Limited.  We have not been told at what time on the 12th December, 1975, these transfers were made in relation to the signing of the agreement.  Why has all this been concealed from the Dáil and the public? It is possible, for all I know, that the transfer from Bula Holdings to the Midland Bank's subsidiary took place before the other agreement was signed with the Minister on the 12th December, 1975.  Even if it took place afterwards, what is the good of an agreement with Bula Holdings when they do not own a single share, the four parties concerned do not have a single share nor do their company?  It is Norofin Nominees Limited, a subsidiary of the Northern Bank Finance Corporation Limited, a subsidiary of the Northern Bank Limited, which in turn is a subsidiary of the Midland Bank, who have 800,000 shares.  They are the people in the riding seat.  They are the people who have ultimate control because they are registered as owners of 80 per cent of this company. This is the kind of company in which the Irish taxpayer is now being asked to take a minority interest, where he will have no say and no control whatever.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="948" /> We must, inevitably, be coming near the end of this debate.  It is not enough just to ask questions, you do not get any answers.  Over the last five weeks we have shown how much was concealed. How much more was concealed that we were not able to get to the bottom of?  What we have shown is enough to cause concern to thinking people.  If they knew the other things we have not been able to unveil because of secrecy, how much deeper would that concern be?  I ask the Minister these questions once again. It is repetitious to ask them but they need to be answered.  Whether the Minister chooses to answer them or not is a matter of some significance and concern.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is rather disturbing that there is no reply from the Minister to what we have just heard from Deputy O'Malley.  It may be that we will have to come back to this again and again&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and drag out this debate unnecessarily because of the deliberate secretiveness of the Minister. If he chooses to do that he need not blame us.</P>
      <P>I want to advert to a matter of considerable importance which was raised before and to which we got a purported answer with which I, personally, am not satisfied.  To keep it in perspective I want to point out that the control over the operations of this company which the Minister can exercise is the control of a minority shareholder. In practical terms that means virtually no control.  The Minister, however, at an earlier stage in the debate said, I understand, that he had got control to ensure the carrying out of what he needed to see carried out in the development of the mine by way of personal guarantees given to him as to the completion and execution of the agreement referred to in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Further questioning of this matter elicited the fact that article 11 of the articles of association of this company in effect provides that any guarantee <Col N="949" /> given by directors would ensure that the company stood behind the directors and, in effect, took over the guarantee. The practical effect of this is that if the Minister were to try to enforce the guarantee referred to he would be trying to enforce it against himself to the extent of almost 50 per cent.  The Minister said that article did not apply because these guarantees were given by the individuals concerned as beneficial owners and not as directors.</P>
    <P>The information given by Deputy O'Malley today raises even further questions.  Without going into that, could the Minister say how he knows who were the beneficial owners of shares in Bula Holdings?  Presumably that is what he had in mind, although on the face of it that is irrelevant. The only thing that could be relevant would be the beneficial ownership of shares in Bula Limited.  Whichever he had in mind, would he mind clarifying in what way article 11 of the articles of association does not apply to the guarantee and in what way he can rely on that guarantee to ensure that the development of the mine takes place as he would wish?</P>

      <P>Deputy Colley attributes to me words, without attribution, without quotation of the source, that I did not use.  He says that truly, from his point of view, it has not been dealt with adequately.  Nothing that I could say would deal with these matters adequately from the point of view of the Deputies opposite on issues that have been raised and reraised.  If anyone wants fairly to go back over the record he will see that the matter has been settled and answered.  People can go on saying that it has not been answered and &ldquo;you have not answered my questions&rdquo; until we are all black in the face.  A perusal of the record on issue after issue will show that the answers have been given.  If the answers are not sufficient it appears to me, as I said a moment ago, that however <Col N="950" /> much I said it would not be sufficient.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am speaking from recollection and I am subject to correction on this.  The only words I recall attributing to the Minister on that occasion was when I said that he had said that the guarantees were given by the individuals concerned as beneficial owners of the shares.  I think that is the phrase the Minister used.  The important thing here, I suggest, is that the Minister will find if he looks at the record, that he has never explained how article 11 does not apply.  It is true that he purported to explain it but the explanation that he gave does not correspond with the facts.  That is why I am raising the question again. He said that article 11 did not apply because the guarantee was not given by those people as directors but as beneficial owners of the shares.  I am asking the Minister, because he has not yet explained it, is he referring to the ownership of shares in Bula Holdings or is he referring to the ownership of shares in Bula Limited?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I refer the Deputy to the record and I refer him to what I said at the beginning of the debate today, that at the time of the completion of the contract for the share purchase by me the shareholders of Bula Limited, that is Bula Holdings and the estate of Mr. Wright, must be <Col N="951" /> the owners of the entire share capital of Bula Limited.</P>

      <P>I am afraid that does not answer the question I put.  I am not saying that the Minister is doing this for evasive purposes.  Perhaps he thinks it answers the question but there is a little more in it than that.  I find, looking at the record of the debate in the House on the 22nd February last, that I did not misquote the Minister. He is reported in the Official Report at column 58, Vol. 297 for 22nd February, 1977 as saying:</P>
      <P>With regard to the point the Deputy made about article 11 in relation to indemnity on Second Stage I said that the four people who had given a guarantee of the performance of the agreement gave that guarantee in their capacity as beneficiary owners of the shares&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>I think the Minister said beneficial owners&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and that guarantee does not relate to their position as directors of the trading company.</P>
      <P>Does this statement the Minister made, which is referred to there, refer to ownership of shares in Bula Holdings or in Bula Limited?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not give the quotation again.  The Minister said that the persons who gave the guarantee gave it in their capacity as beneficial owners of the shares.  My question is does that refer to beneficial ownership of the shares in Bula Limited or in Bula Holdings?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>We will take it in relation to Bula Limited, first of all. As I understand it, and as seems to be suggested by section 1 of the Bill, none of the persons concerned holds any shares in Bula Limited and did not at the time of the giving of the guarantee hold any shares in Bula Limited.  Is that not correct?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>We are talking about an agreement which has not yet come into force.  We are talking about a contract between the company and the Minister on a certain date.  I said that at the time of completion the shareholders of Bula Limited, that is Bula Holdings and the estate of Mr. Wright, must be the owners of the entire share capital of Bula Limited.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I am not making the point quite clear to the Minister.  I am not going into the question of what he is saying, that this is to be the position when the agreement is being executed, a very unusual provision.  I am saying that assuming that happened, will the position not then be that the shareholding in Bula Limited will be in the possession of Bula Holdings and the estate of Patrick Wright and that it will not be in the possession of the individuals giving the guarantee? Does the Minister follow my point that if you leave the Wright estate aside the other shares will be held by Bula Holdings and not by the individual giving the guarantee?  Is that not correct?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DeclanCostello" hpid="Attorney General (Mr. Costello) Declan Costello">
      <NameTxt>Attorney General (Mr. Costello)</NameTxt>
      <P>As I understand the Deputy's concern it is that this particular guarantee, to which reference has been made, is of little value because of the provisions of article 11.  His argument is based on various grounds.  One of them is that the persons who gave the guarantee were shareholders, were directors, and consequently article 11 will mean that this guarantee is of little value.  He appears, alternatively, to be asking whether or not this is of any value <Col N="953" /> because they are not shareholders.  All I can say is that we discussed this already at some considerable length on this section last week.  The situation is that it would be a matter entirely for the drafting of a condition, and the signing of the condition relating to a guarantee for the Minister, to ensure that the guarantee is of some value.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Attorney General referring to the drafting which has already taken place?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DeclanCostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  Obviously it would be a matter for the draftsman to ensure that when people enter into covenants with the Minister those covenants are of some value.  It is wrong to assume that the drafting of this contract meant that the Minister was not getting a proper guarantee in relation to matters covered by the covenants.  This is a problem we have had throughout this debate.  The Opposition are raising questions in relation to the document they have not seen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not our fault.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DeclanCostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>We have been through this already for several weeks.  We understand that the Opposition have some objections to this.  The problem arises because of the fact that the Deputies opposite are asking questions in relation to the covenants entered into by these individuals.  I am saying in answer to this that the Deputies have not seen the covenants for reasons that have already been given.  It is proper for me to say that it would be elementary drafting to ensure that the covenants would not do what the Deputies opposite fear, namely, be of little value to the Minister because the persons would be able to get an indemnity from the company.  It would be wrong to assume that this has happened. We have been over this many times already.  The situation has been explained to the Deputies opposite.  It has been explained that the sort of fears they are raising are not real ones.  The documents have been properly drafted and the matter cannot be put any further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry.  I just did not find the explanation given by the Attorney General on previous occasions <Col N="954" /> very satisfactory and I still do not find it satisfactory.  What he is asking us to assume is that the draftsman has succeeded in framing something that will bind four people who on the face of it are not parties to this agreement at all, who are not shareholders in this company and who now are not directors of the company.  The draftsman on occasions is quite ingenious but he would want to be extremely ingenious to succeed in drafting something that would bind people like that.  One might as well say that he can bind four people outside who have no connection with this at all. Legally these individuals have no connection.  They may be shareholders in Bula Holdings.  We do not know. Presumably the Attorney General does not know either because it is not information to which he is officially entitled.</P>
      <P>How does one bind four people who legally have no connection with this so that they guarantee&mdash;and the guarantee can be enforced&mdash;that this agreement will be carried out?  Perhaps I am attaching more importance to this guarantee than it deserves but, if I am, then the Minister's position is even weaker than it should be.  I am assuming that the guarantee is such that if the Minister finds that the development of the mine is not going ahead, or is not going ahead at the kind of pace he would like to see, he can then enforce this guarantee to ensure that it does go ahead at a satisfactory rate.  If that is attributing more to the guarantee than should be attributed to it, the question then arises as to how the Minister can ensure that he gets any return on the money being invested.  Assuming that the way he can control that is the guarantee, then the guarantee is crucial and it is not enough for the Attorney General to ask us to accept on faith that the draftsman has succeeded in finding a formula which will bind four people who have no legal connection with this company. We are entitled to ask precisely how this is being done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It cannot seriously be argued that the commercial interests of any of the people concerned could be in any way endangered by the disclosure of <Col N="955" /> the precise terms which are relevant to this point in the guarantee.  For that reason I am asking now that those terms by which the Attorney General says and the Minister says that these individuals are bound and are not getting an indemnity under article 11 be put before the House.  It is inconceivable that the disclosure of those terms could in any way damage the commercial interests of Bula Limited or of the individuals concerned or the Minister.  The matter is of such crucial importance that I suggest it is not only a reasonable request but it is imperative that we on this side of the House ask for the disclosure of these precise terms.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DeclanCostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Briefly, I repeat what I have said.  The Minister has explained why the terms of the agreement which would include these covenants have not been made public.  The reasons have been made clear and obviously they are not accepted by the Deputies opposite.  I can only say that Deputy Colley from his experience both as Minister and in private practice must be well aware that it is perfectly normal to have individual covenants in commercial agreements relating to the purchase of shares.  There is no great mystery involved in the drafting of covenants.  There is no great legal expertise necessary to ensure that the individual covenanters are bound effectively by the terms.  I can only repeat that there has been reference made in this House to the existence of these covenants.  They exist.  They have not been made public for the reasons already given, and I can assure the House that the legal position is being adequately catered for.</P>

      <P>It has emerged in another context, in the research done by Deputy O'Malley, that there are now two agreements between Bula Limited and Haras el Chorro, SA. Since the Minister and the Attorney General have referred to an agreement, may we take it that there is one and only one agreement between the Minister and the parties mentioned in section 1 and that the one agreement <Col N="956" /> contains the covenants referred to by the Attorney General which purport to bind four individuals who on the face of it have no legal connection with Bula Limited?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes it is, but it is also my experience that, if one company is selling land to another, they have only one agreement, but it turns out that Bula Limited and Haras el Chorro, SA, have at least two agreements for the sale of land, neither of which has resulted in the registration of the purchaser as the owner in the Land Registry so we have to question what is going on here because there is such total concealment, such reliance on words which are carefully prepared in advance to convey one impression and which, when passed and analysed, convey in fact another impression. <Col N="957" /> That is why the questions have to be asked.</P>
      <P>We have had a point blank refusal by the Minister and the Attorney General to give us the details of the covenants by which they say these people are bound.  We know that the original explanation given as to how the Minister was going to force his guarantee turned out to be wrong factually.  I, for one, am not satisfied that the Government, as represented by the Minister and the Attorney General, should decide that they will not disclose even that basic detail of this agreement, fundamental to the whole spending of this kind of money in the hope of return.  They have refused to disclose that fundamental detail although nobody has attempted to suggest that the disclosure of that information could in any way damage anybody's interests.  It is, of course, consistent with the attitude which has been adopted all along in this matter, except on those occasions on which there have been inconsistencies when it suited the Minister to disclose some details of this agreement.</P>

      <P>Very selectively.  The fact he chose to disclose some details where he thought it would suit him is sufficient to discredit the whole argument he has put forward for the non-disclosure of the terms of this agreement.  But, whatever argument may be put forward for it, no such argument can justify the non-disclosure and the complete failure by the Government to take this House and the public into its confidence to ensure and make it absolutely certain and clear that the persons purporting to guarantee the performance of this agreement are in fact bound.  The other matters which have come to light from time to time in this whole affair, primarily as a result of the diligence of Deputy O'Malley, make any reasonable person approaching this matter suspicious of what we are being told and of what we are not being told, suspicious of what is being concealed and why it is being concealed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">

      <P>We have yet another <Col N="958" /> of the usual silences, which the record is unable to accommodate.  I rise to support Deputy Colley in what he has just said.  He asks that we should see the covenant relating to the guarantee by these four directors.  We are asking for that on its own.  I am not saying we are not renewing our reasonable demand that we should not be asked to legislate in a vacuum.  We are asking for that anyway because patently, as Deputy Colley has shown, it cannot affect anybody's commercial interests.  That has not been denied. It cannot and will not so affect and still we do not get it.</P>
      <P>One wonders if the guarantee is what we think it is, so useless that the Minister is ashamed to produce it, and it is useless for the reasons we have already enunciated.  Where the Minister attempted to reply to my reasons, and where he factually was wrong in what he said, although he did not realise it at the time&mdash;at least, I presume he did not&mdash;one is aware that, because of the covenants in this agreement, which are grossly unfavourable to the taxpayer, the Minister should seek to hide that fact, even in the face of five weeks' requests for it, and by continuing to hide it and conceal these facts take the risk, and a definite risk it is, that this Bill when finally passed will be declared unconstitutional.  It shows one just how unfavourable to the taxpayer some of the provisions in this agreement must be and how well the four guarantors did out of it.  They codded the Minister into paying them this vast amount of money and still enabled them to retain control.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are other covenants I understand in the agreement that the Minister may well hope will not see the light of day&mdash;covenants like the rather strange one he made that he would not go out of his way to try to ensure there would be joint promotion of this ore mine or try to bring that about in any way, and the other covenant he made that he would use his best endeavours to get the Government to apply for and guarantee a loan from the European Investment Bank of some £10 million or £12 million in respect of which a memorandum went to the Government, but not with any great <Col N="959" /> enthusiasm, some time ago.  These are the sort of areas in which the taxpayer is being taken for a further ride on top of what he already knows.</P>
    <P>I suppose it is understandable the Minister should seek to decline to tell the whole sorry truth because sorry, indeed, it is.  I shall keep some of the remaining covenants for the later stages but I believe the general interest would be served by publishing this agreement now and not carrying on this concealment of material facts any longer.  The questions and the nature of the questions now being asked in relation to this affair are increasing in number and deepening in nature.  Some people are beginning to wonder if this whole affair is in some way bound up with the event which will take place some time later this year.  The two are not unconnected in certain ways.</P>
    <P>When I spoke some 20 minutes or half an hour ago I made inquiries from the Minister on a number of points but I did not get any reply. I do not suppose it is worth repeating them but, before we leave the section, I think it is contemptible that on the very date of this agreement referred to in this section, a section which is the kernel of this debate, 800,000 shares should have been transferred to a subsidiary company of the Midland Bank in Britain and this House allowed to debate this matter here for five weeks without being told that very material fact.  We now discover, as a result of what limited amount the Minister did say about this today that, even if this Bill were passed, if the Midland Bank will not play ball and transfer back the shares to the people who had them originally, then the operation cannot go through.</P>
    <P>The Midland Bank may feel that the amounts it has lent are such, and its need for security is such, that it will have to retain these shares.  If it is so decided, and it would be within its rights in so deciding if the facts of the lendings bore that out, then there is nothing the Minister could do even if this Bill was passed.  This may be the reason why all the urgency has gone out of the Bill.  At one time it had to be through both Houses, and <Col N="960" /> signed by the President, by 9th February. But today, there is no worry. Apparently there is an interest clause in the agreement for non-payment but the Attorney General has advised the Minister that because there is a delay in the Dáil debate the interest will not become payable.  I hope the Attorney General is right because the interest could amount to a considerable sum of money.</P>
    <P>We are left in the situation that the public cannot fail to speculate about the interest of the Midland Bank in this situation and the fact that, if the shares are not transferred out of the name of the Midland Bank's subsidiary, they are the people who have the ultimate control.  It is they who sign and seal the share transfers.  It is they who call meetings and vote at them.  They are the people who are entitled to exercise the shareholders' rights because they are registered as shareholders as part of their security for the money that is due to them.  We have not had any explanation as to how a third bank has come in with a debenture.  The Ulster Bank is now in. The Bank of Ireland is in and the Northern Bank is also in in two capacities, one as a shareholder and the other as a debenture holder.</P>
    <P>The file of this company is getting a little crowded with charges and mortgages.  I presume they have sorted them out between themselves but I would hate to try and hazard a guess as to who has priority over whom because they all seem to have mortgages on the same thing.  They all have a cut out of poor Haras el Chorro SA and the various other folios associated with that.  All these questions remain unanswered.  The Minister's silence is partly due to ignorance but is also due partly to deliberate concealment. Having watched him operate for five weeks I have come to the conclusion that only half of it is due to his ignorance of what has happened in this whole affair.  The other half is due to the knowledge that what has happened should not see the light of day.</P>
    <P>This is the man who has so concerned himself and so used up his energies over the last four years trying <Col N="961" /> to buy this minority holding in a small private company with no control and no say and covenanting away some of the control he would have as Minister for Industry and Commerce.  We must bear in mind the fact that this orebody is not yet in production, that we have no arrangements made for a smelter, that we have no arrangements made for any downstream industries and that there is virtually no value going to come from this orebody to the community when it gets into production, except the jobs that will be given to the men involved in mining and extracting concentrates from it at the pithead.  The whole lot will be carted away to England or Europe where the real employment will be given and the real benefits will accrue to the detriment of our people who are supposed to commend this former socialist Minister for his astuteness in buying us into 24 per cent of a private limited company.  For the first few weeks of this debate I do not believe the Minister understood the significance of that kind of holding in a private limited company but I hope that by now it has been explained to him.</P>
    <P>This paltry reward for a large amount of money in a highly speculative venture is one that may well be regretted before this whole affair is over.  I repeat my ritual request that some of my questions be answered but I have no confidence or hope that they will.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>As a person who is involved in drawing up sales contracts and selling land and other property, I am astonished at the attitude of some of our Government representatives today in that they do not seem to appreciate the fact that in almost every deal where land is involved the whole aim is to have it registered as soon as possible in the name of the new owner.  In my ten years as an auctioneer I have never heard of a case where this type of delay has occurred.  It is an extraordinary deal from every point of view.  When one has a company stating that they are basing their valuation on figures supplied by the company that employed them to do a valuation the whole deal <Col N="962" /> becomes fraught with the deepest suspicion.  I wonder about this new marriage that is going on between the Minister and his capitalist friends in Bula.  Has that not a deeper significance than a lot of us imagine at present?  Deputy O'Malley was very charitable to the Minister when he said that he showed 50 per cent ignorance in relation to this deal.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FlorenceCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>I must bow to the ruling of the Chair.  If I had the investing of £9.54 million for anybody I would not get myself involved in this type of deal.  I am convinced that there is far more to this than meets the eye and the Minister's reluctance to answer ordinary questions breeds in me a suspicion that things are not what they seem.  I cannot understand how the Minister could enter into a contract with a company that sold all its shares on the day this contract was entered into.  Who did the Minister enter into contract with?  From whom can the taxpayer recoup any of the investment if things go wrong?  I cannot understand how the Minister agreed to this investment of the taxpayers' money in an operation that has not yet obtained planning permission. I cannot understand any sane businessman investing this amount of money in an operation without the costings of that operation being calculated.</P>
      <P>When I refer to the costings I mean whether we will have opencast or underground mining because the value of the product from those operations can vary enormously.  As a businessman if I enter into a contract with somebody I will try to ensure as far as possible that I have the maximum protection for my investment.  What protection has this Minister got for the investment of the taxpayers' money? In my opinion he has got none.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As an ordinary person from the country I become highly suspicious when I see that a company have to operate from a tax haven such as Panama in order to carry on business. <Col N="963" /> I say to a company that does that, more luck to them.  They are out to get away with as much tax as they can, but the Minister who is the guardian of the taxpayers' money on this occasion should do anything except enter into an agreement with such a foreign-based company.  I have always credited him with being a very intelligent man and I cannot understand how he put his signature to this type of disastrous contract so far as the State is concerned.</P>
    <P>In the light of what has been revealed in the past few weeks I can understand why the Minister is not willing to make this agreement public because it will show him in a very poor light.  In the normal way the man in the street is not too interested in dealings in shares and so on but he has become deeply interested in this matter. In the past two weeks I attended a seminar in Cork and I was asked questions about this agreement between the Minister and Bula.  The people are very concerned and, because of this concern, the Minister should give far more information than he has done. Because of the presence of Deputy O'Malley in this House and because of his thorough research into this entire operation, thus exposing the inadequacy of the Minister's knowledge, most of the people have become aware of the disastrous agreement the Minister has walked us into.</P>
    <P>I want the Minister to tell the House why he did not take the ordinary precautions that any businessman would take.  Is it because the money was not his own and, therefore, that he did not give a damn?  Was he <Col N="964" /> conned or was there something else not unconnected with a general election this year?  The Minister should not treat the House in such a disdainful way.  He should tell us why he took some of the actions he did take and he should try to justify them.</P>
    <P>It is all very well for the Minister to tell us he has answered our questions. It is rather like the young boy going into an examination where he is given various sums in arithmetic and he writes down under each sum &ldquo;don't know&rdquo;.  He can come out of that examination and say he answered all the questions and that is what the Minister is doing.  He is answering all the questions with &ldquo;don't know&rdquo; or &ldquo;don't care&rdquo;.  As a representative of people who do not fall for the socialist clichés the Minister was mouthing some years ago, I must ask him to explain what kind of socialism allowed him to enter into an agreement such as this one.  The people of Ireland are entitled to know and we will keep probing until we get satisfactory answers.  If we do not get satisfactory answers we can draw our own conclusions and I hesitate to tell the Minister what are those conclusions.</P>
    <P>I would ask him to treat this House as a responsible assembly and to recognise that the Members are very concerned about the way this entire affair has been handled.  I am asking the Minister to tell us what steps he will take to ensure that the £9.54 million of taxpayer's money does not go down the drain.  I want an answer to those questions.  May we take it the answer is &ldquo;don't know&rdquo; or &ldquo;don't care&rdquo;?</P>

      <P>The proposal is to authorise the Minister for Industry and Commerce to acquire shares in Bula Limited.  Right through the debate we were given to believe that he was acquiring these shares from Bula Holdings Limited and the Wright estate and that certain guarantees would be given by other parties.  It transpires now that Norofin Nominees own 80 per cent of the shares and have owned them since the date of the agreement. As I have said, Norofin Nominees are a subsidiary of the various subsidiaries of the Midland Bank and, ultimately, are owned by the Midland Bank.  I should like the Minister to explain how he proposes to acquire shares from the Midland Bank in Britain and also why we were not told that the Midland Bank were registered as owners of these shares since the date of the agreement that is recited here?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>

      <P>The Northern Bank are the registered owners of 80 per cent of the shares.  Without their co-operation and, ultimately, the co-operation of the Midland Bank, how can the closure be effected?  When I asked that question earlier the Minister said he did not know what would happen in the event of the bank not cooperating.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>It might be noted that even on the Title the Minister seeks to avoid answering questions. He has given no satisfactory explanation as to what will happen in relation to the Midland Bank should they decide in the interests of their own security not to transfer these shares to the Minister.  He tells us simply that the shares would go back to the original owners who would transfer them.  If, say, the Midland Bank because they are owed too much money &mdash;the reason for their taking the shares in the first place&mdash;do not agree to transfer them, what will the Minister do?</P>
      <P>The other question I asked and to which the Minister did not reply was why he did not disclose, until I disclosed it today, that on the very day the agreement was signed, 12th December, 1975, 800,000 of these shares, representing 80 per cent of the entire share capital was transferred to the Midland Bank?  The effective control of Bula Limited is now outside the State and is in the hands of one of the large British clearing banks.  Why was that not disclosed? It is a very relevant fact and the failure to disclose it misled the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that but, as Deputy O'Malley has pointed out, the Title provides for the Minister for Industry and Commerce to acquire shares in Bula Limited and to provide for matters connected therewith and consequential thereto.</P>
      <P>The effective control of Bula Limited, it appears now, is vested in people other than those disclosed to the House by the Minister.  If, as the Minister says, this deal can be closed only when the shares are registered in the names of the parties he mentioned, we are entitled to ask whether there is any point in passing this Bill and whether the Title represents accurately the transaction as outlined now by the Minister.  At the time of the signing of the agreement was the Minister aware that this transfer was about to take place?</P>

The Minister has said that, unless the original party, Bula Holdings, can be put back on the register, the deal cannot be completed.  That may as well be the explanation why there is no urgency in this matter. Presumably they cannot get back on the register.  The Midland Bank are a very reputable bank.  They are a <Col N="970" /> very large international financial concern, having worldwide interests.  It is nonetheless a pity that in relation to a section of minerals at Navan the Irish Government should be locked into a minority situation&mdash;not to four Irish businessmen who were quick off the mark when somebody else found the minerals, but to an enormous British financial institution.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That, in view of the existing severe inflation, Dáil Éireann deplores the further price increases announced on 2nd March, 1977, and, in particular, calls on the Government not to sanction the proposed ESB increase.</P>
      <P>On the eve of this price crisis debate we have been treated to the sanctioning of a number of significant increases, particularly in ESB charges, CIE charges and charges in relation to price increases of television licences.  I understand that monochrome television licences are to be increased from £16 to £18.50 and colour television licences from £27 to £31.  My colleague, Deputy Barrett, spokesman on Transport and Power, will deal in detail with the ESB and CIE increases.</P>
      <P>It is interesting to note that the order issued in connection with the upping of the RTE price increases was issued by the Department of Posts and Telegraphs themselves and not by the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs. That is another ploy that I am sure will be dealt with during the course of this debate.  The good news will be announced by the Minister, the bad news by the unfortunate civil servants. It is my view and the view of others that this is an abnegation of responsibility of the Minister concerned.  The Minister in this instance and indeed in the other instances should have had the guts and courage to make his announcements himself.</P>
      <P>The prices motion in the name of Deputy O'Malley was not put down lightly by the Fianna Fáil Party.  We did this in response to what we consider to be a conspiracy of silence which has been obvious from the Coalition handling of their January budget.  It cannot be seen any longer as an election budget as it was intended to be when it was introduced in January last.  It cannot be seen as an election budget in the light of subsequent events, in particular in the light of recent price increases sanctioned by the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  No doubt in the near future or in the not-too-near future the Coalition will think up some other suitable gimmick on which to fight an election.  Certainly they will not be fighting an election on the January budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We charge the Minister for Industry and Commerce with deliberately withholding the recent publication of the National Prices Commission report until the national wage agreement had been signed, sealed and delivered.  Our proposition in this respect is irrefutable. The history of the signing, sealing and delivery of the national wage agreement is there in historical date order, as indeed is the publication <Col N="973" /> of the National Prices Commission report.  The report of the National Prices Commission and the letter signed by J.J. Walsh, chairman of the commission, were sent on 6th January, 1977, to the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  One assumes that he received them the following day or days. The budget was introduced.  This is keeping the continuing negotiations of the national wage agreement in mind.</P>
    <P>The budget was introduced on 26th January, 1977, with all the brouhaha that went with it and all the hopes and expectations about what was contained in it.  The delegate conference ratified the national wage agreement on 22nd February, 1977, or thereabouts.  The announcement of the price increases came on 2nd March, 1977.  These are ascertainable facts.  We respectfully say that, in the context of this motion we are speaking on, the historical progression of events as outlined by me is irrefutable.  Having set out the irrefutability or the unanswerability of those dates, and of that progression of events, it must be considered a moot point as to whether the national wage agreement would have been ratified if all the parties to that agreement had been aware of what was within the personal knowledge of the Minister for Industry and Commerce and, taking into account the responsibility aspect of the Government, within the personal knowledge of other Ministers too.</P>
    <P>This is no disrespect to the Parliamentary Secretary who is standing in for the Minister who, like Deputy O'Malley and others, had a very long session during the course of the day. We are not making any point about that.  We believe the Minister has a duty to this House and to the parties to the national wage agreement, whom we allege he deceived, to explain the deliberate withholding of the report of the National Prices Commission until about two months after its receipt by the Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>
    <P>This was practised deception as it now clearly emerges.  It was a &ldquo;con job&rdquo; deliberately perpetrated on the parties to the national wage agreement. What is more sordid about the whole sorry state of affairs is that the practised <Col N="974" /> deception was done by a Minister who wears a Labour hat.  A socialist Labour Minister for Industry and Commerce misled deliberately, undeniably deliberately, one of the main parties to the agreement, namely, the workers of this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I must intervene to say it would not be in order to allege that any Member of the House deliberately misled.  That is tantamount to an untruth and must not be said.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I will withdraw the word &ldquo;deliberately&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;knowingly&rdquo; misled.</P>

      <P>I trust the Deputy will not seek to circumvent the ruling of the Chair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I have made the point anyway.  It is not my intention to enter into argy-bargy with you, sir, on this occasion or on any further occasion.  I have made the point that the Minister misled the parties to the agreement.  He then produced the report of the National Prices Commission which increases prices savagely in a number of areas.  They are vicious price increases.</P>
      <P>As a layman, apart from having the privilege of being a Dáil Deputy, when I heard the price increases coming over the radio on the morning of either the 2nd or 3rd of March, I was absolutely outraged.  As a citizen of this country I asked myself&mdash;if one can put political prejudices aside&mdash;what are the Government doing about prices?  That was my simple reaction.  One can only wonder about the reaction of other people, especially the people I will deal with in depth later.  As spokesman on social welfare I have an absolute obligation and duty to point out where these price increases hurt most and hit most, and where they are continuing to hurt most and hit most.  I will deal with that in some depth at a later stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A suggestion was put around by the Minister for Industry and Commerce and spokesman on his behalf that the psychology of inflation demanded that the regular price increases sanctioned by the Minister should not be published <i>seriatim</i> or in composite form <Col N="975" /> in the various newspapers and throughout the media generally.  That was put down to the fact that if these price increases were published in composite form, in detailed form, the psychological effect on people reading it might encourage more inflationary trends.  Nonsense.</P>
    <P>As I understand it, that is one of the main reasons why these price increases are not listed in an ordered fashion as they are published.  I am not in any way criticising the National Prices Commission when I say that. During the course of our journeys as TDs, housewives in Dublin city and County have complained to me and other public representatives about the fact that they consider&mdash;I do not altogether agree with them but this is what they consider&mdash;the workings of the National Prices Commission to be somewhat secretive because these price increases are not listed in detailed fashion.  When the reports of the National Prices Commission come out they are published, but they do not get as much publicity as they should.  This is the main burden of the complaints expressed to me.</P>
    <P>In the <i>Irish Independent</i> this morning I noticed fortuitously that a survey was carried out by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.  This survey was carried out in January of this year among 24 countries in the non-Communist world. It places Ireland's price increases as fourth fastest in the 12-months' period ending January, 1977, at 20.6 per cent per annum.  We are fourth highest in a league of 24.  Ahead of us were Iceland at 31.4 per cent, Portugal at 26.8 per cent and Italy at 22 per cent.  It is an unfortunate record.  The Government have to carry it because they are the responsible agency for discharging the electoral promise on which they were primarily elected.  The Government were elected primarily on the promise that they would contain prices.  As a general measure of their failure to keep that promise, we note that prices have increased by 83 per cent from February, 1973, to November, 1976. These prices are currently rising by more than 1¼ per cent per month.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="976" /> Our inflation rate throughout the period of this Government has never been less than at crisis level.  Its persistence threatens to destroy savings, erode confidence and undermine the very financial foundations of the State.  In addition, if we are to take the predicament of our school leavers, all in all we have a recipe for revolution. It is an appalling prospect, but there it is.  However, it is not my intention to engage in macro-economics or in the macro-economic aspect of our inflation.  Rather I intend to underline the callous manner in which certain specific prices have been allowed to rise to the point where even the most basic commodities are being pushed beyond the reach of the poor and disadvantaged.</P>
    <P>For instance, let us take the price increases on vital commodities.  It will be claimed by members of the Government that, in respect of certain commodities such as bread, milk and butter, they took steps to reduce prices by providing subsidies and by removing value-added tax in order to offset the consequences of currency deficiencies passed on to the consumer through the mechanism of the green £.</P>
    <P>We note what the actual price increases are.  We can only shudder when we imagine what they would have been if this limited action I have just mentioned had not been taken. Some prices as between mid-February, 1973, and the current date have risen by 60 per cent and 70 per cent.  These include briquettes at 64 per cent, rib steak at 63 per cent, milk at 60 per cent and tea at 62 per cent.  Even bread and butter, arguably the most basic commodities in spite of the measures I have mentioned, the removal of value-added tax and the financial rearrangement brought about by the green £, have risen by 85 per cent between 1973 and now.</P>
    <P>Most items have more than doubled in price.  For example, bus fares, with which my colleague, Deputy Barrett, will deal in depth, have increased by 100 per cent and are continuing to increase; baked beans are up 110 per cent; sugar and margarine, 113 per cent; cornflakes, 133 per cent.  Not finished with that, we have to deal with a price increase range of 150 per <Col N="977" /> cent or more: flakemeal up 158 per cent; cheese, the basic staple diet of old age pensioners and widows, 161 per cent&mdash;whatever about Fine Gael Party Members, Labour Party Members should be ashamed of themselves &mdash;cheese, 161 per cent; cream crackers, 165 per cent and potatoes 150 per cent. This is the Government that make food a luxury indeed.</P>
    <P>I have other commodities and other price ranges which I could quote at some length but, having regard to the time limits of the debate, I do not intend to go into them at great length. The point I want to make is that the commodities I have mentioned are all basic necessities of life and, with few exceptions, constitute the weekly basket of the less well-off sections of the community.  It is very difficult to understand the mentality of members of a Government who can prate about their anxiety for the disadvantaged while allowing the economy to get so much out of control that they can only stand by and watch these price increases literally taking the bite out of the mouths of those who are in need of our care and concern.  In the face of these facts I reject the Government's claim of concern for equity and justice as spurious and empty, as spurious and empty as all the other high-falutin' promises with which they have deluded the people for four long, weary, crisisladen years.</P>
    <P>To deal with the area with which I am charged in Opposition, price rises and income increases for welfare recipients, much has been made of the increases in benefits which this Government have provided in social welfare over the years since they came to power.  In particular a great song and dance has been made about the increases in the recent budget which will become effective on April 1st.  I do not want to underrate these increases &mdash;far from it.  They have the wholehearted support and approval of this side of the House.  I should like, however, to set out in detail references to figures of various entitlements from 1973 to October, 1976, and to April, 1977, when the increases take effect and the estimated dates at which we consider the increases given in the budget will become eroded&mdash;it is as <Col N="978" /> serious as that.  In the table, which I shall quote at length, it will be seen that between April, 1973, and April 1977, there has been an increase of over 100 per cent in childrens' allowances from £2 to £4.10p and an increase of over 90 per cent in most other benefits.  But I must examine these increases in some detail and ask whether they are percentage increases or real increases.</P>
    <P>In the last column of the table I have calculated the dates by which the expected percentage increase in the inflation rate will have eroded the increases in benefits.  For example, I estimate that even the latest increases which will become effective only in April next, have in many cases been eroded.  If I may, I would illustrate my point by reference to the non-contributory old-age pension which was £6.15p in 1973 and since the review in October 1976, is now £10.75p representing an increase of 63 per cent. However, the increase in prices which took place from 1973 to November, 1976, was 83 per cent.  Not only have all the increases in benefits been completely eroded but nearly all the additional benefits to be received next April&mdash;the extra £1 per week&mdash;have already been eaten away in price increases. Inflation has to rise by 4.4 per cent since November last to eat away the additional benefits to be received in April.  I estimate that if this has not already occurred it is a virtual certainty that it will have occurred if not before then soon after the benefits have been received.</P>
    <P>The same consideration applies to all these benefits with the single exception of children's allowances.  Social welfare benefits of one form or another go to just under one million people and of that figure there are about 240,000 in receipt of children's allowances&mdash; subject to correction.  Effectively, just under three quarters of a million people are affected by spiralling inflation and spiralling price increases uncontrolled by the Government.  It is not good enough for the Parliamentary Secretary to&mdash;as we say in legal circles &mdash;plead the Gaming Act and blame outside influences.  It has been proved beyond doubt that the 1976 budget pushed up prices by 5 per cent as a <Col N="979" /> direct result of the Government's own miscalculation.  It was not the fault of anybody else.</P>
    <P>I should like to put this table on the <Col N="980" /> record of the House.  I understand that I cannot circulate it with my conclusions and my contribution and that it will be incumbent on me to articulate it.  The following is the table:</P>

    <P>So much for the budget we heard so much about and the social welfare content of that budget.  It is my intention to repeat that series of figures which were prepared by a number of economists and actuaries of the highest repute.  Those figures have been researched down to the very last detail and I do not think there is any answer to them.  They are irrefutable.  When I say they are irrefutable I do not suggest for a moment that somebody will not attempt to answer them.  Of course there will be an attempt at an answer but it cannot be the truth in the light of the figures I have produced.  As I said, it is my intention to repeat those figures as often as possible and to give a lie to the budget which, as I pointed out, is no longer an election budget.</P>
    <P>I will now return to old age pensioners. This disadvantaged group in many ways ought to command our greatest concern and respect.  These people have already given their service to the country.  At this stage of their lives they do not belong to any powerful pressure group.  If you are not a member of such a group in present day modern politics, you are a member of the most vulnerable section of the community.  In my opinion the old age pensioners are in the most vulnerable section of the community and if we do not take care of them their plight could be helpless.  How well and how generously a country cares for its old is one of the clearest marks of the degree of civilisation to which a country has risen.</P>
    <P>In 1973 a pilot survey was conducted by the National Prices Commission to ascertain to what types of food and in what quantities the old age pensioners of urban Dublin allocated their weekly budget.  I have costed that same basket of commodities at a current date.  In February, 1973, the basket of necessities cost £2.71.  Today that same basket costs £5.47p.  This represents an overall increase of over 100 per cent.  In many ways this is a better statistic than any other for measuring how inflation is hitting the poor and the old.  It is better than the CPI which is naturally a crude overall index and better even than the individual items I mentioned at the beginning of my contribution.</P>
    <P>In the case of the old age pensioner we come to the crunch of the politics of reality.  If he has not the income some item in his basket must be left out.  Words are cheap.  This Government churned them out at the same rate and with the same contempt for meaning as they did in their manifesto four years ago.  The test of their sincerity is the sum of their actions and no test is so valid as the treatment of the disadvantaged.  On my reading of the facts the Government stand indicted.</P>
    <P>Would those apologists on behalf of <Col N="981" /> the Government, particularly in the light of the forthcoming election, please not involve themselves in political chest beating, saying what wonderful fellows they are in the context of the social welfare increases in the January budget?  That budget was seen in the recent past to be just what it is&mdash;a piece of fraudulence perpetrated on the people, on the negotiators of the national wage agreement and on the most disadvantaged sections of our community.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note the increases in a number of items which I have already mentioned in the context of the old age pensioner's weekly base.  In February, 1973, ¼ lb tea cost 10½p; in March, 1977, it cost 17p; 2 lbs sugar in February, 1973, cost 11½p; in March, 1977, it was 24½p.  In February, 1973, 1 lb butter cost 29p; in March, 1977 it was 53½p.  One pint of milk cost 5p in February, 1973; in March, 1977, it cost 8p.  A 2 lb loaf, compliments of the Government, in February, 1973 cost 13p and in March, 1977, it cost 22½p.  The staffs of life&mdash;bread, butter, tea, jam&mdash;are now being put out of the reach of the most disadvantaged sections of the community.</P>
    <P>As I have already said and it is worth repeating, this Government have made food a luxury and are continuing to do so.  They have put outside the reach of almost every person in receipt of social welfare entitlements of one sort or another, the basic human right of meat at least once or twice a week.  Do they realise there are people in the community who cannot afford meat?  Now we learn that the vitamin substitution for meat is cheese and the calories to be found in meat can also be found in cheese.  Since 1973 to a current date, on my figures the cost of cheese has increased by 161 per cent. This Government have made food a luxury and cheese and meat unpurchasable. There will be variations on this theme as we go along but the realities are there.</P>
    <P>There are those who will say &ldquo;what would Fianna Fáil do in the same circumstances?&rdquo; I said before&mdash; there is no reason why one should not point it out again&mdash;that whenever one gets a person writing an argument <Col N="982" /> favourable to the Government one will always have them writing apologies on their behalf and it ends up asking: &ldquo;What would the Opposition do?&rdquo; All the Opposition can do is produce policies on various subjects.  We have done this in relation to our economy. The Government have uplifted certain aspects of our policy on the economy and they made a complete mess of a number of aspects of it.  We will continue to produce policies despite the fact that they are being robbed by the Government without any acknowledgement by definition.  There are no patents on policies produced by the Opposition, unfortunately.</P>
    <P>The Opposition have been responsible and will continue to be responsible but we are powerless.  If the people find they cannot face up to the tragedy of the vicious spiral of price increases the answer is to change the position of the various parties in Dáil Éireann. If we are given the power to control prices&mdash;we want the power&mdash;we will do the job.  We will produce the economic plan which will stabilise prices.  We will do the job that the Government are either unable or unwilling to do.</P>
    <P>Another item is the recent budgetary increase in telephone charges.  One of the great monuments to the inertia of the Government or their willingness to produce some sort of comprehensive policy decision making or policy planning is the telephone service.  The Government are increasing charges to a more or less non-existent service.  I am not saying this is any reflection on the people who operate this service.  They are not responsible for the day-to-day running of the Department.  The people who in the final analysis are responsible for a proper telephone service are the Government.  If anybody goes outside the Dáil Chamber, picks up a telephone and on first dialling the various digits gets through to the person he or she wishes to call I will give that person a prize.  The value of the prize is another day's work, maybe the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs as first prize and the Minister for Industry and Commerce as second prize.</P>
    <P>One of the greatest monuments to the Government's inactivity and failure <Col N="983" /> on all fronts is the telephone instrument. Every time people pick up that instrument and cradle it in their hands they can see written largely across it &ldquo;Government failure&rdquo;.  The increase in telephone charges is one of the most tragic increases the Government introduced. They are robbing the people. They are putting increased charges on a service which is almost non-existent. Despite the huge capital expenditure on the telephone service in the last four years&mdash;this is what the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs and others tell us&mdash;we have one of the worst, if not the worst telephone service in Europe.  It is unfortunate that I have to say this.  The Government must accept full blame for this sorry state of affairs.  The tragic aspect of this is that the people are being asked to pay more for something they are not getting.</P>

      <P>I move the following amendment:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Dáil Éireann recognises that failure to implement price increases arising from unavoidable cost increases and the need for an adequate return on capital would increase unemployment.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>A debate of this nature can only be properly described as a debate if it is a discussion of alternatives and an argument about which alternative is better than the other.  This discussion in reality is not a debate at all.  Fianna Fáil, in the contribution of Deputy Andrews today, the contributions of their speakers elsewhere, in the output of their research department or the publication of their policies, have not yet produced a policy on prices.  They have policies on rates and the economy but they have no policy on prices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will be very interested to hear Deputy O'Malley's contribution to this debate to know what precise alternative measures he suggests the Goverment should adopt in relation to the level of price increases which have had to take place.  Everybody is against <Col N="984" /> inflation and against increases in prices.  It is almost as if one were to say: &ldquo;Is one against sin.&rdquo;  Everybody is against sin and everybody is against price increases in the same way.  It is the question of devising alternative strategies whereby to put that general statement of intent into effect that a useful debate can arise.</P>
    <P>There is no debate on this issue because Fianna Fáil have not produced a policy on price control.  The policies they have produced indicate that if their policies were implemented they would increase still further the regrettable level of inflation.  I listened to Deputy Andrews complaining eloquently about the increases which undoubtedly have occurred in food prices in the past few years.  I asked Deputy Andrews and his colleagues if they are against the devaluations in the green £ which resulted in the increases in food prices?  Are they against the fact that the farmers are now able to get&mdash;they were not able to get this formerly&mdash;a decent price for the food they produce for sale to the rest of the community?  One cannot hope to have increases in producer prices without increases in consumer prices as well.  To judge from Deputy Andrews' very emotional contribution one would think that they are against increases in producer prices which have been given to farmers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a very interesting statement from Deputy Barrett.  It indicates the degree of support for Deputy Andrews' contribution which Deputy Barrett is prepared to give.  It is clear, as our amendment states, that unemployment would result from failure to grant increases where the costs have gone up.  If one is to control prices to the extent that it is no longer possible to produce, then the firm producing the particular goods will go out of production and unemployment will result.  If a reasonable return on capital is not given by allowing increases in prices to take place, which take account of increases in costs, there will directly be unemployment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to assure the House <Col N="985" /> that all of the increases which have taken place recently have followed on detailed scrutiny by the National Prices Commission.  The National Prices Commission are an independent body containing representation of industry, the trade unions and the housewife.  They may make any recommendation they wish on a particular price increase, which must go to them before it is approved or even considered by the Minister.  All of the increases that have occurred, practically without exception, in recent years, have been recommended by the National Prices Commission. This body have resources at their disposal to ensure that their recommendation is not only an independent one but one which is well researched, which is based on concrete evidence indicating that the cost increases claimed by the manufacturer have actually occurred and that therefore the increase in price is justified.</P>
    <P>The Commission have not only a large consultancy unit of their own containing economists and accountants and other highly qualified people but they have £175,000 each year to spend on hiring independent consultants outside the NPC to do additional studies, where they feel that their own substantial consultancy unit is insufficient for the type of detailed study they wish to make before making the recommendation to the Minister.  In most cases the recommendation is accepted because of the detailed study done by the NPC indicating that these increases are necessary if employment is to be preserved in the industry concerned. There are many factors operating in our economy which have made it necessary for the NPC, taking these factors into account, to recommend to the Minister that increases in certain goods and services be brought into effect.</P>
    <P>There have been very substantial increases in raw material costs in the world at large over the last three or four years.  These started with the oil crisis but this was followed by increases in other raw materials when the primary producers decided to follow the example of the oil producers and increase their prices as well.  Perhaps it <Col N="986" /> would be useful to compare the rate of inflation which occurred in this country in the form of the CPI since March, 1973, and the rate of increase in world commodity prices.  One will find that the increase in prices to the consumer here has been considerably less than the increase in raw material costs which has occurred in the same period.  In other words, our economy has succeeded in reducing the effect on prices of the increases in the costs of raw materials which must be used to produce what is sold to the Irish consumer.  Between March, 1973, and November, 1976, consumer prices rose by approximately 84 per cent.  I have a list of 16 major raw materials, including various major metals and fabrics, and bearing in mind that in the same period prices to the consumer here have gone up by 84 per cent, I can tell the House that of those 16 raw materials only three have gone up by less than 100 per cent.  These increases have been as high as 741 per cent in the case of coffee, 391 per cent in the case of cocoa, 254 per cent in the price of tin, 217 per cent in the price of wood pulp. All these increases, with the exception of three, are higher than the rate of inflation which has occurred for the consumer here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>What has tin to do with bread?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I can tell the House that an analysis done recently by the NPC indicates that in the past seven months 60 per cent of the increase in costs justifying the increases in prices which have taken place are represented by increases in materials cost.  So we can see the room for manoeuvre that exists for the NPC in considering these increases.  It is not a very large one when one takes into account the type of raw material increases which are occurring.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This has been further aggravated by the fact that we, in common with other countries in the sterling area, have suffered a very substantial devaluation of our currency and this means that anything we buy in from outside the sterling area becomes dearer by the simple fact that our currency is <Col N="987" /> devaluing against the currency of the country from which we are buying. Our currency has devalued by 45 per cent against the German mark making anything we buy from Germany 45 per cent dearer by that alone.  Against all major currencies with the exception of the lire we have had a devaluation as high as 45 per cent in the case of the mark and as low as 20 per cent in the case of the Spanish peseta.  This had had its result in the devaluations of the green £.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, interest rates in our economy which are determined in substantial measure by world financial markets&mdash;we do not have a financial market which is independent of the world financial market&mdash;have been at an unprecedently high level during the past number of years.  If firms have to borrow money to carry over stocks or to give credit to their customers, they are incurring by that fact alone costs far in excess of those incurred in previous years when interest rates were lower.  Those increased costs have to be passed on to somebody if the firm in question is not to go out of business.</P>
    <P>Of course, there is also a matter that has been discussed at great length&mdash; the increased energy costs following the oil crisis.  All of these factors together have created a situation of unprecedented difficulty for the Government in their endeavour to keep prices down and I should like to say something about the Government's endeavours in this matter.  Let us be honest about it.  The Coalition did say that one of their chief aims was to stabilise prices but it is the aim of every party in this country to stabilise prices and one can judge the Coalition not by the problems they faced but by the specific measures which they adopted in pursuance of their aim.  If we compare these measures with those that obtained in the time of office of their predecessors, one can see that the Government have taken very great trouble to ensure that no increases except those actually necessary to maintain supplies and employment are allowed to take place.  The only way one can have complete control over <Col N="988" /> prices and complete prevention of any increase in prices is to have complete control of the economy, complete control of production and distribution and of importation all in the hands of the Government.  This is the situation that obtains in Soviet Russia.  They are, perhaps, able to control prices but only at the cost of rationing and long queues outside the shops for the limited amounts of goods available at the fixed price and there are different prices for tourists and for those who live in the country.  That is not the alternative that the people of Ireland want to see.  We want to preserve our free economy and we must recognise that in that situation there are limits to what the Government can do to stop necessary price increases.</P>
    <P>The Government can take certain major steps and the Coalition in pursuance of its policy did take major steps under two headings; first of all by the introduction of subsidies and the removal of indirect taxation from certain basic essential items so as to shift the burden of inflation away from essential items and onto luxuries or the direct taxpayer.  The second approach consists of measures to eliminate overcharging due to insufficient competition in the economy.  Against very great difficulty under both these headings the Government have adopted many substantial measures of a counter-inflationary nature.  Subsidies were introduced on bread, butter, milk and cheese by the Government.  In 1976 these subsidies cost the Exchequer £39.82 million or approximately £40 million. Had these subsidies not been introduced the price of a lb of butter would be 20 pence higher than it is today.  The pint of milk would be twopence higher and the price of the standard loaf would be 5½ pence higher than it is today.  This year these subsidies will cost the Exchequer approximately £48 million.</P>
    <P>The Government removed value-added tax from food in September, 1973.  That tax had been imposed on food by the Fianna Fáil Government. In July, 1975, the Government removed value-added tax from clothes, footwear, electricity and heating fuels, all commodities upon which value-added <Col N="989" /> tax had been imposed by the Fianna Fáil Government.</P>
    <P>The result of this combination of subsidies and the removal of indirect taxation from essential commodities plus the redistribution of the burden of taxation elsewhere has been that a sample grocery basket of essential items today costs £5.74.  That sample basket would cost £6.62 were it not for the fact that the Government introduced food subsidies and removed value-added tax.  Prior to March, 1973, there were no food subsidies and value-added tax had to be paid on food, clothes, footwear, electricity and heating fuels.</P>
    <P>Again, the Government have introduced a far wider range of controls on retail prices than obtained in the period of office of our predecessors. Despite the fact that in the last quarter of Fianna Fáil's term in office inflation was running at approximately 4 per cent higher than in any quarter in many years previously, there were only three commodities subject to maximum retail price orders.  These were&mdash;it is worth mentioning them for the record because there were so few&mdash;milk in Dublin, Ballinasloe, Mayo and Donegal, bread in all parts of the country and liquor in Dundalk.  This was the sum total of the commodities subject to a maximum price order during Fianna Fáil's last term in office.</P>
    <P>As a result of a decision by the present Minister for Industry and Commerce there are now 24 main essential commodities subject to maximum price control in all parts of the country.  This means a consumer in an isolated area who has not got an opportunity of shopping around can complain if he is overcharged and the retailer who took an unfair advantage of the fact that the consumer did not have such an opportunity can and is prosecuted for overcharging.  That could not happen in the period in office of Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <P>Prior to March, 1973, there were approximately ten prosecutions&mdash;ten&mdash; for overcharging.  Since 1973 there have been 3,367 prosecutions for overcharging of which only 2 per cent have been dismissed by the court.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="990" /> Furthermore, there has been an unprecedented increase in the number of inspectors available to the Prices Division of the Department to police the various price control measures. When Fianna Fáil left office there were only nine inspectors in the whole Department and not all of these were assigned to the Prices Division.  There are now 61 inspectors in the Department of whom 48 are assigned solely to policing the various orders in regard to maximum prices.  From this one can see that the Coalition Government have put their money where their mouths are in employing sufficient inspectors to ensure that people everywhere, but particularly in isolated areas, are not overcharged.</P>
    <P>The Coalition Government introduced the price line service whereby people who have been the victims of overcharging have now someone to whom to complain.  The price line service has dealt with 29,000 complaints since it was established.  In 2,500 cases it has obtained refunds from the retailer concerned.</P>
    <P>It is obviously very difficult&mdash;this is, I think, something the National Economic and Social Council recognise&mdash; for this country to have a rate of inflation radically different from that obtaining in the area of our major trading partner, Britain, which is the other country with which we share this sterling currency area.  The best means of comparing the relative performance of one Government against another is by comparing how inflation has grown, not in absolute but in relative terms, in Ireland and in Britain.  If we have here a rate of inflation below that of Britain then that indicates that the Government here are doing relatively well.  On the other hand, if inflation is rising faster here than in Britain that indicates that the Government here are doing relatively badly.</P>
    <P>Now, in the period May, 1969, to February, 1973, the rate of inflation here was 6.6 per cent above the rate of inflation in the United Kingdom. In the period March, 1973, to November, 1976, our rate of inflation has been 1.4 per cent below the rate of inflation in the United Kingdom.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>That latter figure does not take account of the fact that Britain, in what some might describe as an un-European approach to problems, did not allow the devaluation of the green £ to take place in its territory towards the end of that period.  The figures, though not yet released for the latest period up to February of this year, indicate that the rate of inflation here is again running below that of the United Kingdom.  That is the sort of factual information upon which one can base a realistic comparison of the relative performance on the price front&mdash;the two alternative formations offering themselves to the people.</P>
      <P>It is interesting to listen to the party opposite complaining about increases in CIE fares, in ESB charges and in the various commodities produced by different sectors of the economy.  The question that must be asked is would the Opposition be prepared to increase further the subsidy necessary to ensure the proposed CIE fare increases will not take place.  Would they be prepared to give a subsidy to the ESB to ensure the proposed increases will not take place?  The evidence from their own published economic policy indicates that they would not do so.  In their programme for an emergency they propose to spend £1,000 million additional money belonging to the Irish people on various projects, some useful and some not so useful.  In spite of the fact that they were allowing themselves this generous sum, which was to be raised by borrowing, they did not intend allocating a penny towards reducing prices, according to the breakdown of how they intend spending that money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is interesting also to contemplate Fianna Fáil's published policy on rates. They stated that in Government they would have to decide where to get the £57 million necessary to implement their promise on rates.  They went on to make various optimistic noises about buoyancy in the economy which would produce revenue but then they faced <Col N="992" /> the fact that maybe this buoyancy would not produce all of the £57 million.  They tell us that if necessary this money could easily be got by increases in indirect tax on nonessentials and luxuries.  Increases in indirect tax have a direct and immediate effect on the cost of living.  In other words, Fianna Fáil have admitted in their published policy document that they would pay for their policy on rates by increasing the cost of living.  I do not believe that is a policy the people would be prepared to accept at any time.</P>
    <P>In the long run the best means of controlling prices&mdash;in this context it is useful to follow the German example of putting the accent on promoting competition rather than on control&mdash; is by promoting active competition in our economy.  Recent measures taken in this regard are particularly important. The NBC is now concentrating most of its efforts on those sectors of our economy where monopolies or oligopolies exist, on the State sector, on the professions or on various services where people are able to exercise oligopolistic pressure.  Furthermore, at the request of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, the Restrictive Practices Commission are preparing a report on restrictive practises law. Motor insurance has been referred for examination, with a view to promoting more competition in the motor insurance market, to the Examiner of Restrictive Practices for a study so that he can come up with positive proposals in this direction.  Improved provision is being made for the display of prices so that people will be able to see for themselves what the price is in one shop and compare it more effectively with another.  Competition can be given real teeth by people being able to shop around.  Bureaucratic control is not the answer.  The answer in the long run to the problem of inflation here is to create an environment in which active competition in every sector of the economy will keep prices in check.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Last week when we had the debate on the proposed fare increases by CIE&mdash;these have been <Col N="993" /> granted by the Minister&mdash;and tonight the Parliamentary Secretary expressed the belief that the Opposition have no right to debate such increases.  In his estimation it is confounded cheek on our part to do so.  Last week he told us we were making a political football out of the increases and he almost blamed us this evening for the increases we are now debating; he almost said Fianna Fáil were the cause of the increases.  We made a wonderful discovery tonight from his contribution. He told us that the real cause of the increases was the green £. I hope one of his colleagues explains to us about the green £ being the cause of the increases.  Perhaps the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs will tell us how the green £ is responsible for the increases in telephone charges and the increases in the cost of posting. He might also tell us how the green £ has caused the increase in the television licence fee.  The Minister for Transport and Power might tell us how the green £ is responsible for the ESB or CIE increases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Irrespective of what the Parliamentary Secretary has said, the fact is that the Government today sanctioned further price increases and without any doubt we will have the other proposals mentioned sanctioned in the near future.  Since 1973 we have been saying that the lack of Government policy with regard to cost increases would create insurmountable problems. We have been proved correct in this regard.  Owing to rampant inflation, many sections of the private sector have been unable to sustain viability and the increase in the number of unemployed is a clear illustration of this. During the past four years the State, semi-State and local authority employees have continued to obtain wage increases which were triggered off by the inflationary effect of the Government policies, or the lack of policies. The taxpayer in turn had to bear the cost of all these increases.  We also had foreign borrowing to a great degree.  This was another device used by the Government to buy peace and maintain electoral support.  The cost of this foreign borrowing must now be borne by the already overburdened <Col N="994" /> taxpaying public and by the severely strained private sector.</P>
    <P>How can industry be expected to generate the surplus required for further reinvestment if it is to be competitive or if its competitiveness is not to be affected?  It must sustain higher taxes, higher working capital needs and all the increases brought about by the inflationary policies promoted by the Government.  The ESB should have been told to cut their current cost and curtail further capital expenditure.  The cost of servicing their debts has grown to an unacceptable level.  We have the ugly shadow of foreign borrowing and what it is costing the ESB, a cost that is transferred to the consumer, in the increase granted by the Minister today. With regard to proposed increases in motor insurance, I should like to state that if the Minister for Finance had not promoted the policies he has been promoting in the past four years the cost of repairs and replacements resulting from motor accidents would not have increased to the present level.  The massive increases in insurance premiums in the last few years would not have been necessary.  We all heard the Minister for Industry and Commerce on Sunday describing this period as the &ldquo;bunching period&rdquo; caused, according to him, by the seasonal nature of some applications for price increases. That was the explanation he gave. It appears to us from the result of the price applications and the fact that they are so massive that it is the Minister who is bunched.  He and his colleagues have stayed too long in power and the day of reckoning cannot be far away.</P>
    <P>We have had far too many verbal performances both inside and outside the House and on RTE.  They should stop because what is needed is action&mdash;it is time that action made itself felt.  The level of the price rise applications are the result of the Government's fiscal actions which over the past four years have been based on ill judgments, expediency and a lack of real economic planning.  Even now when it can be said that the chickens are coming home to roost we are being subjected to another example of public relations instead of government action.  The present public relations exercise involves <Col N="995" /> the red herring of forecasting inflation rates for 1977.  We maintain it is irrelevant and fatuous to suggest to a person who relies on his car or on public transport to get to work that the increased cost of his necessary travel will not escalate in 1978 to the same degree as happened from 1973 to 1977.</P>
    <P>This Government are responsible for the price rises that have been occurring practically every day for the past three years.  Since this Coalition came to office costs have been forced up because of their policies.  Increased household and living costs are not percentage statistics to the families who have seen the erosion of their spending power.  This erosion of real money values has in turn helped to force more and more out of jobs and it has prevented the necessary investment in new capacity which should be taking place. This would have absorbed the ever increasing number of school-leavers who are not permitted to get the jobs to which they are entitled and which they believe should be available to them.</P>
    <P>Coalition policies have put up prices. National wage agreements indexed to prices forced wages up and in turn this increased costs.  The spiral goes on and is further fuelled by the Government. In the past four years we have not seen any evidence of the Government's ability to develop the necessary economic plan to get us out of the mess they have created.  Consequently we are entitled to believe that as they cannot identify the problem it is most unlikely that they can correct it. Instead of crossing new thresholds of industrial expansion we are more or less having to barricade ourselves inside the existing industrial structure.</P>
    <P>Let me illustrate the nature of the problem that faces the economy today, highlighted by the percentage increases now being sought or granted already. The Government have made no attempt to deal with the energy problem. It has been with us with its escalating effects since October, 1973.  At that time the cost of oil products to the Irish consumer was about £200 million and it is now between £600 million to £700 million.  This means that cost increases in the order of £400 <Col N="996" /> million to £500 million have not received any attention from the Government whose responsibility it is to deal with it.  In fact the Government have compounded the problem because of the increased taxation levied on oil products.  This was done a few years ago in the name of conservation.</P>
    <P>I say the only conservation involved in such a policy was to buy time, three or four years of wasteful current spending whatever the cost to the competitive structure of our industry. There is no use in talking about outer zone UK applications.  That is a complete fallacy.  The cost of our petrol today is 10 per cent per gallon higher than the highest priced area in the United Kingdom.  The combination of excise duty and VAT at the levels set out by the Minister for Finance has ensured that the cost of the vehicles used to transport people or goods are 25 per cent and in some cases 50 per cent higher than in the UK.</P>
    <P>How can we be expected to be competitive? It costs more to get to work in Ireland, whether by private or public transport, than it does in the UK.  It costs more to produce the energy so necessary to manufacture goods in Irish factories and it costs more to transport those goods to the market place in Irish vehicles than is the case in the United Kingdom.  That is the result of the economic policy of the Minister for Finance in particular and of the Government generally.</P>
    <P>A few years ago we were fortunate enough to strike natural gas off the coast of this country.  During the debate on An Bord Gáis and before this debate we advocated the establishment of a gas grid in order to provide lower cost energy for industry in certain areas.  This has been done successfully in the United Kingdom.

The letter of 2nd April, 1976, stated that temporary labourers had not been recruited in the Carlow area since the previous reply had been given, and repeated the information regarding the procedure which would be followed when temporary labourers were next required in the Carlow area.
