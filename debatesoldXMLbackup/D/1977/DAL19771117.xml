      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy (Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>This section is opposed by Deputy O'Toole. As I said yesterday, the licensed banks are governed by the provisions of the Central Bank Act, 1971, and we decided to leave the position as it was but to include all other banks under the provisions of this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>It is section 23.  This was decided on after we got the assurance of the Central Bank and of the Department of Finance that, in regard to the controls we are bringing in now, there would be parallel powers brought in and the Central Bank Act, 1971, would be amended, if needed, so that the licensed banks would be under the same control as those covered in this Bill.  That, I think, covers Deputy O'Toole's point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1198" />
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>After we adjourned the debate at seven o'clock last evening I had an opportunity of checking through the Central Bank Act, 1971, and it is indeed quite evident, as we are strongly suggesting, that the very conditions we propose here to impose on a wide range of services and trades will not be imposed on consumer relationships with the associated banks.  Between now and any amendment of the Central Bank Act, 1971, it is a bit odd, to say the least, that there should be a very special exemption given to the licensed banks.  I do not know how the Department of Finance and the Central Bank can advise the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy that this special exemption should be given.  If a small credit union or a money lender were to publish a prospectus giving misleading information this Bill would apply.  On the other hand, if one of the major associated groups&mdash;the Bank of Ireland, the Allied Irish, the Northern or the Ulster Banks&mdash;were to issue a prospectus inherently deceptive there would be no way, and there is no way at present, in which they could be prosecuted.  We know from experience of a well known&mdash;notorious in some respects&mdash;bank over which the powers of the Governor of the Central Bank proved to be extremely limited. I do not know why this exemption should be given.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is worthy of note that only God knows at times what precisely the parties have agreed to in these confidential personal relationships and it is only on the rarest occasions that there is an opportunity of questioning such relationships. I should not like it to go out from this House that I, as a Labour Party spokesman, have the general view that the conduct of the four main banking institutions is not of the highest and most reputable nature.  But that applies to the bulk of manufacturers, traders and those providing services who also come under the scope of this Bill.  As regards the banks that in the past two or three years have been advertising interest rates, term loans and particular services to customers, I have wondered if the consumers had an opportunity of closely <Col N="1199" /> questioning these offers would they have ensured, as happened in Northern Ireland, that some of the phenomenal profits made by the banks would have been more equitably distributed among consumers.</P>
    <P>For example, if we take the combined pre-tax profits of the two main banking groups, Bank of Ireland and Allied Irish, and even making provision for bad debts which are relatively low, we find their profits increased from £41.5 million in 1975-76 to £55.4 million in 1976-77.  This is a matter that should be brought to public attention&mdash;their profits after tax rose by 51 per cent in a 12-month period.  We have seen some of the six-monthly profit returns from, for example, Allied Irish recently.  Their profits for the first six months of 1977 have been phenomenally increased&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Joseph Brennan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think we should have a detailed debate on the banking system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking of a situation where, if consumers had access under law to the details of services offered by the licensed commercial banks, I am fairly certain that the banks would be more circumspect and more informative in terms of how, for example, they managed to pay dividends last year, 1976-77, something like 42 per cent higher than in the previous year.  I contrast that with the situation in Northern Ireland where the pre-tax profits of the Northern Bank and the Ulster Bank were only about 8 per cent higher in 1976 than in 1975.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a great hooha about it at present and we all expect a major EEC directive on consumer credit.  Some of the interest rates charged in this area are phenomenal.  The present Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy used the word &ldquo;astronomical&rdquo; in this context in his Second Stage contribution on this Bill last March.  In many ways they have remained astronomical. In that connection it is a great pity that in section 23 of this Bill a very privileged exemption should be given by the exclusion of banks licensed under the Central Bank Act, 1971.  It is no consolation to know that in the future <Col N="1200" /> we can expect legislation which will deal with consumer information aspects of banking in the form of an amendment of the Central Bank Act.  We have the anomalous situation of directors of commercial banks on the board of the Central Bank and they are the people who will be drafting legislation &mdash;presumably it will be vetted by the Central Bank and the Department of Finance&mdash;regarding consumer information. Since the board of the Central Bank has a heavy representation of commercial bank directors they are not likely to break their hearts to bring forward legislation to bring themselves under the general control of the Consumer Information Bill.</P>
    <P>This was a decision of the previous Government and I hold no brief for it.  In Opposition, Deputy O'Malley waxed eloquent and indignant.  To use Deputy Kelly's favourite phrase, he really got up on his hind legs in a big way when he pointed out that in the general area of consumer credit we are far behind.  Our hire purchase Acts are the best part of 18 years out of date and our general regulatory provisions in regard to consumer credit are decades out of date.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Joseph Brennan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>We are not dealing with consumer credit, nor do business profits come into this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for his forbearance. The previous Government were remiss in my opinion in not having this inclusion. It would have been singularly appropriate if, the present Government, with a solid majority and knowing that no commercial bank can launch a campaign against it for at least another four years, had on this occasion ensured that the legislation did include the licensed banks.  The Parliamentary Secretary's predecessor was a most industrious and concerned Parliamentary Secretary.  The same applies to the present Minister's predecessor, Deputy Keating, and on many occasions we were assured that they were bringing forward amending legislation.  Somehow or other, the legislation having to go through the bureaucratic treadmill of being vetted by other Departments and in this case, <Col N="1201" /> perhaps, more by the Central Bank, delays inevitably occur and reasons tend to develop for them.  The result is that the parliamentary draftsmen have the legislation for months.  In fairness, they are much maligned.  It tends to end up in the Attorney General's office awaiting sanction.  In view of this I should prefer to make the necessary provision now rather than await amending legislation.</P>
      <P>If I may be allowed to repeat a point I have raised here in Dáil Questions, outside and in RTE, if the licensed banks were included in this Bill and if this legislation had been enacted, say, two years ago, we would never have had the debacle of the Irish Trust Bank because investors would know the position.  If prospectuses were circulated offering fancy rates of interest tax free, automatically one would be in a position to pick up such a prospectus, go to the Director of Consumer Information and have the matter checked.</P>
      <P>Because we did not enact this type of legislation we finished up with the Fianna Fáil Party for purely political reasons paying out £2 million of the taxpayer's money.  That is what this kind of amendment is all about in terms of preventing a repetition of that kind of situation.  Would the Parliamentary Secretary bring back both Deputy O'Toole's and my view to the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy and to the Minister for Finance, and perhaps on Report Stage we might have a fresh look at it and improve the situation dramatically in relation to the Bill?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I reiterate my conviction concerning the overall situation with regard to the inclusion of banks.  It can be fairly said that the conduct of the associated banks is above reproach and as I said last night the latest circular from the standing committee of the associated banks and the suggestions contained therein go far beyond any requirements that might be made under the provisions of this Bill.  Last night the Parliamentary Secretary mentioned that some of the banks who did not come under the Central Bank Act, 1971, would <Col N="1202" /> automatically come under the provisions of this Bill.  My confusion arises from the fact that in my innocence I thought that all banks, merchant banks and all financial institutions, came under the Central Bank Act.  The Central Bank Act which I have perused concerns itself with the renting of licences and with the solvency of a bank and the Central Bank do not involve themselves with the conduct of the day-to-day business of banking and financial institutions, be they lending banks, merchant banks or members of the associated groups. The Parliamentary Secretary's assurance that amendments to the Central Bank Act will be undertaken goes part of the way towards satisfying my opposition to section 23, but if the Central Bank Act is to be amended by the Minister for Finance on parallel lines with the provisions of this Bill with regard to banks which do not come under the Central Bank Act, why is there reluctance to have the banks come under the provisions of this Bill? I must assume that the Parliamentary Secretary and the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy have been told by the Minister for Finance to keep their hands off the banks. That is the only conclusion I can come to.  If parallel amendments are going to be made, why not do it here so that we would end up with this major service area coming under this Bill? It is logical to expect this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The directive on consumer credit was mentioned by Mr. Burke, the EEC Commissioner on Consumer Affairs. Not so long ago there were headlines in the paper concerning the treatment which will be meted out under this consumer credit directive to what the Commissioner termed &ldquo;loan sharks&rdquo;. I presume that this directive will be forthcoming in a short time.  I can envisage a situation where the Parliamentary Secretary will be coming into the House to rush some Bill through in order to harmonise our legislation with the EEC directive.  I assume that if banks were included in the provisions of this Bill it would obviate the necessity for having to do that when the time comes.  The Parliamentary Secretary may have to ensure the <Col N="1203" /> harmonisation of our laws with the EEC directive on consumer credit even before Christmas.  What did the Parliamentary Secretary mean by differentiating between banks which come under the Central Bank Act and financial institutions which do not? Can I get a guarantee that the financial institutions which do not come under the provisions of the Central Bank Act come under the provisions of this Bill?  I would like to know what type of institutions they are.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaireGeoghehanQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>All banking, savings, financial and credit institutions, excluding the licensed banks, are included in the provisions of this Bill.  We understand that the consumer credit directive will not be forthcoming for at least 12 months, and possibly more than 12 months.  Legislation within my Department on consumer credit will be very far advanced by the time the directive can come.  It is possible that we could bring in a Bill on consumer credit before the directive but that would be highly unwise. I believe that we should see what the directive contains before making any move.  Deputy Desmond raised a point in relation to the issue of prospectuses in respect of banks.  The issue of the prospectuses is governed by the Companies Act and by the stock exchange rules and not by this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 47:</P>
      <P>In page 12, before section 24, to insert the following section:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;24.&mdash;The fact that a trade description is a trade mark, or part of <Col N="1204" /> a trade mark, within the meaning of the Trade Marks Act, 1963, does not prevent it from being a false trade description when applied to any goods, except where the following conditions are satisfied, that is to say:</P>
    <P>(a)  that it could have been lawfully applied to the goods if this Act had not been passed,</P>
    <P>(b)  that on the passing of this Act the trade mark either is registered under the Trade Marks Act, 1963, or is in use to indicate a connection in the course of trade between such goods and the proprietor of the trade mark,</P>
    <P>(c)  that the trade mark as applied is used to indicate such a connection between the goods and the proprietor of the trade mark or a person registered under section 36 of the Trade Marks Act, 1963 as a registered user of the trade mark, and</P>
    <P>(d)  that the person who is the proprietor of the trade mark is the same person as or a successor in title of, the proprietor on the passing of this Act.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The effect of the proposed new section is that a false trade description will be treated as such, even though it might be a trade mark.  This would not apply to existing trade marks, whether they are registered or not, which would not have been false trade description but for the passage of this Bill.  Representations in favour of such a provision, which is included in section 34 of the UK Trade Descriptions Act, 1968, have been received by the Department from the Confederation of Irish Industry who are concerned that the <i>bona fide</i> use of a trade mark could come within the revised definition of &ldquo;trade description&rdquo; and, in certain circumstances, the use of such a trade mark could be regarded as applying a false or misleading trade description.  This amendment will provide a defence in <i>bona fide</i> cases, and the defence is limited to trade marks which are in use at the time the Bill is enacted.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1205" /> The object of the amendment is mainly to clarify the position of exist-trade marks rather than to make any change in the law.  It will ensure that existing trade marks which had been registered or in use for some time prior to the enactment of the Bill will not be inadvertently outlawed by the new provisions on merchandise marks.</P>
    <P>Under Trade Mark law there is already an obligation on the Controller of Patents not to register as a trade mark any matter the use of which, because of the likelihood of deception or confusion, would not be entitled to protection in a court of law.  Despite this, there may be on the register a trade mark which could be held to be in conflict with the law as amended by the Bill.  The amendment will, therefore, have the effect of protecting the register.  Future trade marks are not affected by this provision.</P>

      <P>During yesterday's debate I referred to the idea of consolidation. It should be the objective of the Parliamentary Secretary, in order to tidy up consumer legislation and ensure that information concerning it and the interpretation of it is available to and understood by consumers, that consolidation of Acts, such as the Merchandise Marks Acts, 1887, amended up to 1970, takes place.  That would be a worth-while exercise and in the interest of consumers.  I would like an assurance from the Parliamentary Secretary that she will see to it that this is done.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I commend the Parliamentary Secretary on having that objective.  As soon as we pass this and the other Bill the work of consolidation should proceed.  I should like to point out that a colleague of mine who was extremely good as a Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy Cluskey, when he was appointed to the Department of Social Welfare asked one of his senior officials to carry out the work of consolidation.  That was one of the <Col N="1208" /> first actions of Deputy Cluskey.  The official spent the best part of 12 months consolidating all the Social Welfare Acts and the massive piece of legislation that resulted has been lauded as a masterpiece.  Although the instruction to carry out that work was given as soon as Deputy Cluskey was appointed it was only towards the end of the period of office of the National Coalition that the Consolidation Bill was introduced.  I am aware that in the Department of Industry, Commerce and Energy all officials have many duties and that it would be difficult to extract a senior official to be given the exclusive task of consolidating all the Acts.  That should be done now because when that work is complete the matter must be referred to the Attorney General and then to the parliamentary draftsman.</P>
      <P>It is my view that this work should be carried out within the Department. I am aware that there is a feeling within Departments that such work should be given to the Consolidation Office.  I hold the officials of that office in great esteem, but the urgency, the knowledge and the ability in many cases rests within the Department. The last great exercise of that Department in relation to company law proved worth while.  I hope that in the lifetime of this Dáil we will consolidate the four or five major pieces of legislation now being put on the Statute Book.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy (Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move : &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Control of Exports (Temporary Provisions) Act, 1956, which was enacted originally for a period of three years and has since been renewed in normal course, at the end of each three-year period will expire on 31st December, 1977.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to continue the 1956 Act in force until 31st December, 1982, and to provide that the penalty prescribed in section 3 (4) of the Act in respect of the offence of making a false or misleading statement or representation to the Minister for the purpose of obtaining an export licence, shall be increased from £100 to £500.</P>
      <P>The Act empowers the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy to prohibit by order the export of industrial goods save under a licence issued by him.  Such orders have a life of 12 months only and may be annulled by resolution of either House of the Oieachtas at any time during this period.  Control is at present in force on a range of goods under the Control of Exports Order, 1977, and the Control of Exports (Southern Rhodesia) Order, 1977.</P>
      <P>As a member state of the EEC, Ireland is obliged to comply with the requirements of Community law relating to trade with third countries in ferrous and non-ferrous wastes and scraps.  The supplies of iron and steel scrap and of waste and scrap of aluminium and lead arising in this country are essential to the needs of home users; it is in our interest, therefore, to apply the Community restriction on the shipment of these scrap materials to third countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Export control on goods classified as strategic is not operated at Community level.  Each member state of the European Economic Community regulates the movement of such goods under national legislation and the proposed <Col N="1210" /> Bill enables this country to continue to do likewise.  Ireland's participation in international strategic export control arrangements derives essentially from this country's requirements of supplies of high technology materials and components needed by the more sophisticated industries established here.  It is considered essential, therefore, that the Minister should continue to control the export of goods of a strategic character in order to ensure, on the one hand, continued access to the materials and components referred to and, on the other hand, that employment may be fully maintained in the plants where they are utilised and in any similar plants which may be established here from time to time.</P>
    <P>For the following reasons, therefore, I consider it necessary for the Minister to have continuing powers to maintain the existing export controls and to enact the appropriate legislation for the purpose:</P>
    <P>(a)  to comply with our obligations under Community law as expressed in EEC Regulation No. 2603/69 to restrict, for the benefit of Irish and other Community processors, shipment of scrap metals to third countries and to ensure conditions of comparative price stability for these scraps in the home and Community markets.</P>
    <P>(b)  to ensure that strategic materials, for example, arms, ammunition, military and naval stores, certain military aircraft, computers, and so on&mdash;are not exported from or through this country to undesirable destinations abroad in accordance with requirements of the international export control to which Ireland subscribes.</P>
    <P>(c)  to enable the Government to realise a general foreign policy aim of preventing the export of strategic or potentially strategic goods to areas where they could contribute to an increase in international tension or provide support for the apartheid policies of the Government of South Africa or other similar repressive régimes.</P>
    <P>(d)  to comply with the mandatory resolution adopted by the United <Col N="1211" /> Nations Security Council requiring member states to prevent the exportation of goods to Southern Rhodesia.</P>
    <P>(e)  to have immediately a means of dealing quickly with any emergency which might denude the country of essential materials before corrective legislation could be enacted.</P>
    <P>When the 1956 Act was last renewed in 1974 its validity was extended for a period of three years and nine months terminating on 31st December, 1977.  Since the commitments mentioned will continue for the foreseeable future, it is considered that the Act should be extended for a period of five years on this occasion.  This would not alter an essential feature of the 1956 Act, that is, that the need for the powers which it confers would be reviewed by the Oireachtas from time to time.</P>
    <P>Orders made by the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy under the Act provides that goods, the export of which is so controlled, may not be exported except under the authority of a licence granted by the Minister.  Section 3 (4) of the Act states that &ldquo;Every person who, for the purpose of obtaining for himself or any other person a licence, makes any statement or representation which is to his knowledge false or misleading in any material respect shall be guilty of an offence under this section and shall be liable on summary conviction thereof to a fine not exceeding one hundred pounds&rdquo;.  It is considered that £100 is not now an adequate penalty for offences of this kind, having regard to the fall in the value of money since 1956 and because a more effective deterrent is needed to discourage misrepresentation particularly in the realm of strategic goods where money values are often substantial.  In these circumstances, a fine not exceeding £500 for the offence described at section 3 (4) of the Act is not considered an excessive penalty and section 2 of the Bill provides for such a penalty.</P>
    <P>For the reasons mentioned I commend this Bill to the favourable consideration of Dáil Éireann.</P>
    <Col N="1212" />
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Parliamentary Secretary that there is a necessity to have this legislation continued. It has been on the Statute Book now for 21 years and, in that time, I understand has been renewed at three-yearly intervals.  The necessity for having it renewed arises because section 7 (2) of the 1956 Act states:</P>
      <P>This Act shall continue in force for a period of three years and shall then expire.</P>
      <P>In those 21 years it has been found necessary to continue and retain this legislation.  As the Parliamentary Secretary said, it is logical to assume that it will be necessary also in the foreseeable future.  Indeed it is logical to assume it will be necessary because of certain circumstances.  In the light of that I wonder if it would not be possible to repeal section 7 (2) of the 1956 Act and thereby obviate the necessity of having to come into the House to renew the legislation every three years or, as is the case now, every five years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While one might argue that the discussion that ensures as a result of having to come in to renew the legislation is a good thing I do not think that opportunity would be denied the House because I understand that the Minister must come in when issuing orders anyway, when Members would be afforded an opportunity from time to time of discussing matters they feel are important.  I have the suspicion that anything one finds and cannot understand in legislation, or which is incomprehensible for some reason, will be found to be a direct cog from British law.  I can quite understand why Britain would need that kind of provision.  They are involved in the export of strategic goods and so on, and there may be a reason for continuing or discontinuing this kind of legislation at any given time there. However, here we find ourselves facing a different set of circumstances.  For example, the Bill, if when enacted on a permanent basis, was found to be unnecessary anymore, it could be repealed and that would be the end of the story.  However, that is not important, in that successive Governments <Col N="1213" /> have used this Act in the interests of the general public.</P>
    <P>This type of legislation is a good thing in that it is a reiteration of the right of this House to place the national interest before that of the individual.  The private individual is not altogether subdued in that his voice will be heard also, as the Minister must come to the House and give reasons for issuing orders or prohibiting the export of goods.  That would help a great deal because people are in the dark in so far as they do not know what materials or commodities are prevented from being exported under the terms of the Bill.  It would help to get the matter into perspective if we had a list or some idea of the items involved.  I appreciate that that list could change from time to time. I wonder whether the Parliamentary Secretary would be in a position to give us some idea of the items whose export is prohibited under the provisions of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Concerning the consequences of our accession to the EEC I wonder where we stand with regard to harmonisation of legislation.  Reading the debates, which were very short, I understand that our control on non-ferrous metal scrap ended in July, 1975, and our control of iron and steel scrap will end in December, 1977.  Does that mean that we are obliged to refrain from placing these specific commodities under the control of the Bill?</P>
    <P>I should like also to refer to an aspect of the Bill which is topical at present because, apart from disallowing exports of commodities needed at home for different reasons, the Minister has power in the Bill to prohibit exports of commodities because of their destination.  With regard to the latter point, that is, the prohibition on export because of the destination of the commodity, we are adhering to international agreements, in many cases, to those concerning economic sanctions, as is the case, for example, in regard to Southern Rhodesia.  We are party to agreements but we find that in many cases other parties to the same agreements are in breach of them.  I am not commenting on the validity or otherwise of economic sanctions as a concept. <Col N="1214" /> But we find ourselves being good boys while other countries find loopholes. While the concept enshrined in these agreements is commendable for different reasons, we all know they are not kept.</P>
    <P>I should like to mention one other aspect of the same matter.  There is the following paragraph in the Parliamentary Secretary's statement:</P>
    <P>(c)  to enable the Government to realise a general foreign policy aim of preventing the export of strategic or potentially strategic goods to areas where they could contribute to an increase in international tension or provide support for the apartheid policies of the Government of South Africa or other similar repressive regimes.</P>
    <P>On the question of South Africa which has been the subject recently of comment on the international level, I should like to know the policy of the Government in relation to trade with that country.  The Parliamentary Secretary has mentioned specifically strategic commodities but I should like to broaden that.  I should like to know the position with regard to the pattern of trade and the policy with regard to trade generally.</P>
    <P>There has been a disturbing pattern over the past few years with regard to the ratio of exports to imports.  If we consider the years 1975, 1976 and 1977 a pattern emerges which should be considered in the light of the Parliamentary Secretary's comment regarding strategic goods.  I have made inquiries with Córas Tráchtála.  They tell me their instructions are not to promote trade in South Africa; they have not got an office there.  However, on studying the pattern of trade in the last three years it is obvious that trade is going on.  I am not saying whether I condone this trade or not, but I am saying that I am disturbed at the pattern of trade.</P>
    <P>In 1974 we exported £7 million worth and our imports were £6.1 million.  In 1976 we exported £5.5 million and our imports totalled £8.5 million.  In the current year figures are available for the nine-month period to the end of September; we exported £4.5 million and imports <Col N="1215" /> amounted to £9 million.  On a 12-month basis that would indicate exports of £6 million and imports in the region of £12 million.  The ratio is 2:1 as against a 1:1 ratio some three years ago.  Purely from the imbalance point of view this is a disturbing feature and is a matter that might be considered by the Parliamentary Secretary.  I should like to hear her comments on this point.</P>
    <P>I am in total agreement with the continuation of this measure.  I should like to get the information I asked for and a comment on the Government's policy with regard to trade generally with South Africa, apart from strategic trade.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this Bill.  It is of major importance in relation to the control of exports.  I suppose many Irish people do not realise that our annual exports are in the region of £2,400 million.  This figure relates to the past 12 months, to the end of October, 1977.  It is important that there should be careful controls.  In the economic sense many people are attuned more to import controls than to export controls.  I am glad that the categories mentioned by the Parliamentary Secretary will continue to be included in this Bill.</P>
      <P>I support the assurance by the Parliamentary Secretary that certain military strategic materials such as arms, ammunition, military and naval stores, certain military aircraft, computers and so on, will not be exported from or through this country to undesirable destinations abroad.  I am pleased that we continue to subscribe to such international export controls.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary's constituency colleague, the Minister for Defence, has announced that the Government propose to have constructed here armoured personnel carriers to be used by the Army.  I have read on many occasions the proposition that this would be an ideal export.  The carrier in question appears to be a matter of great joy in particular to the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy.  He has referred to the Timoney armoured personnel carrier here <Col N="1216" /> on so many occasions that I began to wonder if he had a little toy carrier at home.</P>
    <P>There is a serious point to be made about this matter.  While I support the construction and design of such a carrier for our internal security forces, as an Irish parliamentarian I am damned if I would support the export of such carriers.  There has been a strong nuance in some of the comments made by the Minister that we should export the design to Belgium and have it constructed by other powers and that, hey presto, one of the big revenue producing products would be a few thousand Timoney armoured personnel carriers careering around undesirable places throughout the world.</P>
    <P>I do not go for that kind of export. There is enough bloodshed, suffering and misery in the world without Ireland contributing exports of that nature.  In a Press release in the past week the Minister said it was intended to have 200 such armoured personnel carriers for domestic use.  I appreciate fully that we will need such carriers for our Army, for Border patrols and for internal security, but I would be utterly opposed to such products being exported. I think that prohibition should be included in the measure we are discussing.  It is bad enough to have our own internal security problems without adding to the store of those abroad.</P>
    <P>There is a capacity in Ireland to produce such vehicles.  The Verolme dockyard has produced naval ships, although I notice the Minister for Fisheries keeps referring to them as boats. Coming from a maritime constituency I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary will inform her colleague that the Naval Service has a few ships rather than a few boats, as they are perpetually referred to by the Minister for Fisheries.  The Verolme dockyard has produced many excellent ships&mdash; I have been on two of them&mdash;and they have been well fitted out.  We have the capacity to export naval equipment but I hope we will be prepared to put our money where our mouths are.  It is great for my constituency colleague, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy <Col N="1217" /> Andrews, to career off to Nairobi or Venezuela or wherever he went recently on an international anti-apartheid conference.  At that conference he was most eloquent about how countries should not export arms to South Africa.  We must make sure we are not open to accusations of hyprocrisy in that regard.  We export goods and materials of a non-military nature to South Africa and we continue to trade to the extent of £6 million or £7 million a year.  I wonder if Deputy Andrews is prepared to publish&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>My apologies, the Minister of State-designate.  Are the Government prepared to publish a list of Irish firms which provide employment&mdash;at least 2,000 or 3,000 people have been employed manufacturing goods for export to South Africa down through the years and there are probably or 500 or 600 employed now&mdash; and to ensure that those exports are stopped?</P>
      <P>If Ireland is opposed to the racialist policies of South Africa and Southern Rhodesia, we will have to forego that investment.  There are some firms here whose shareholdings are predominantly South African.  Whether these firms should continue is very much open to question.  In the coming decade there will be an increase in international tensions as the liberation of southern Africa proceeds.  I do not think Ireland should find herself at the end of that liberation being accused by the incoming governments of having been very selective in some of her international statements.  Therefore I urge that the matter be kept under review.</P>
      <P>I support the extent to which the Bill continues to prohibit exports to South Africa and Southern Rhodesia and in that regard our United Nations commitment is being met.  In an era when there is so much hypocrisy in relation to trade with those two countries we should keep a very close watch on the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hold the view that this legislation is necessary.  I am glad it is not done <Col N="1218" /> just by order but rather that a revised Bill is being brought before the House. I also support the view that the penalty of £100 is derisory and that the increase to £500 is necessary.  We should have no difficulty in passing all Stages of this Bill this morning.</P>

      <P>I should like to thank Deputy B. Desmond and Deputy O'Toole for welcoming this Bill and to refer to a few points made by them.  Deputy O'Toole suggested that perhaps we should repeal section 7 (2) of the Act and make the Act permanent. The powers in this Act were derived from emergency legislation during the war.  When the Act was originally introduced it was felt that the powers of the Minister should be subject to review from time to time. Because those powers were very far-reaching, it was felt that a certain amount of control or some restriction on the Minister's power was necessary. The Act was originally enacted during the term of the second Coalition Government. The Deputy spoke about 31st December, 1977, when scrap controls will end.  After that date our scrap controls will conform with the Community scrap controls.</P>

      <P>Yes.  The Deputy spoke about South Africa at length.  There are no restrictions on Irish exports to South Africa except in relation to strategic goods and ferrous and non-ferrous scraps which we control.  As regards South Africa, we would conform with any United Nations regulations.  The United Nations resolution of 3rd November, 1977, refers to exports of arms and military supplies to South Africa and is mandatory on this country.  Our strategic controls are not based on treaty obligations; they stem from mandatory resolutions of the Security Council with which we comply.</P>
      <P>Deputy B. Desmond spoke at length about the Timoney personnel carrier. It is nice to know he is pleased that the Minister for Defence has decided that this will be used by the Army.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1219" /> The export of these to undesirable destinations will not be permitted but we would not restrict the export of these vehicles to Belgium.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The essential point I was making is that the transshipment of these arms and carriers to other countries is a notorious practice by arms dealers.  Once they are exported from Ireland they can end up in the most undesirable situations.  I do not want to prolong the matter but the Parliamentary Secretary must be aware that this could happen.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Toole asked if I could give him a list of exports which are controlled.  The list is four pages long &mdash;this order was made on 1st July, 1977&mdash;and perhaps I might give a few examples&mdash;waste and scrap metal of iron and steel, aluminium waste and scrap, waste and copper and copper alloys, lead waste and scrap, aircraft and parts thereof, arms, ammunition, military and naval stores and equipment, chemical elements and compounds, electrical goods and apparatus and parts thereof.

    <P>&ldquo;(4)  The local returning officer shall appoint a place within or convenient to the constituency as the place at which he will open the ballot boxes and arrange the ballot papers in parcels as hereinafter provided and shall at that place so appointed provide suitable accommodation and all furniture and equipment necessary for opening the ballot boxes and arranging of the ballot papers in parcels as aforesaid.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): I spoke at length in support of this amendment before the debate was adjourned last day.  I consider I made a strong case in favour of amending the Schedule to change the system of counting as provided in the Bill to the method contained in the Presidential Elections Act, 1937. I notice Deputy Kavanagh has just entered the House.  On the last occasion he was proceeding to elaborate on the reasons for the amendment being accepted and for the Presidential system of the counting of votes being adopted.  Deputy Kavanagh spoke on this for a very short time. He was anxious to get in before the debate was adjourned because he anticipated the possibility of his not being here when the debate was resumed. However, now that he is here I propose to give way to him.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy. I did not know when speaking here last when the debate would be resumed. I was at the European Parliament up to last night.  I was making a point on the last occasion in support of Deputy Fitzpatrick's argument for holding the first count of the Assembly elections at the traditional counting stations in the various local constituencies. I argued then that there is a strong possibility of the Assembly elections being postponed until late next year or perhaps, into 1979.  However, the date will depend to a large extent on the timing of the elections in places like France, Britain and one or <Col N="1221" /> two other countries.  The point is that 1979 is the year in which the local elections are due to be held.  Consequently, one can see the possibility of putting off the Assembly elections until then and holding both elections together.  I am sure that by now the Minister is thinking of holding the local elections at the time they are due to be held although he could extend that date by a year or two.</P>
      <P>It can be said in favour of holding both elections on the one day that in the event of apathy in respect of the European Assembly elections, the local elections would ensure a big turnout.  The usual poll for these elections is around 70 per cent.  In addition, the holding of both elections on the same day would result in a major saving to the nation.  Deputy Fitzpatrick was told that the cost of the Assembly elections will be in the region of £300,000.  To have both elections on the same day thereby utilising the same presiding officers, poll clerks, gardaí and so on, would result in a considerable saving.</P>
      <P>A problem could arise, though, in many centres in urban areas where there are two counts on the one day in respect of local elections&mdash;an urban ballot and a county council ballot.  To hold the Assembly elections on the same day as these would mean having three ballot papers for every voter and this could cause much confusion.  The real confusion would occur in the event of ballot papers being mixed up and finding their way into the wrong boxes.  If, for example, Assembly ballot papers were to find their way into local election boxes, they would have to be transferred back to the count centre.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is the other possibility too, that is, the holding of a referendum in conjunction with the Assembly elections. Perhaps it would be stretching the imagination too far to think in terms of having local elections, Assembly elections and a referendum on the one day.  One hopes that will never occur but it is possibility and while we here must consider what is possible, it is more to the point to consider what is likely and the more likely outcome is that we will have <Col N="1222" /> local elections and Assembly elections on the one day, one count being conducted on the basis of a Presidential count.  To provide by way of legislation that the Assembly votes would have to be counted at a central area would cause a great deal of confusion. Perhaps, too, it would have a bearing on the result in the event of ballot papers being lost in the transfer from one centre to another.  In a small urban council election the result could be affected by two or three votes and there could be a loss of a few votes in the event of the ballot papers being put into the wrong boxes.  Likewise, the Assembly election results could be affected by the respective ballot papers finding their way into local election ballot boxes.</P>
    <P>There is a strong case to be made for Deputy Fitzpatrick's amendment and for holding more than one election on the date to be decided.  I trust the Minister will see the wisdom of the amendment.  It should not lead to any contention here because all of us are anxious that elections be carried out as quickly, as efficiently and as accurately as possible.  This amendment is designed to ensure both speed and accuracy.  I would like to hear what the Minister has to say.  Deputy Fitzpatrick also might have something to say on what I have said.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): I have covered everything I wanted to say in regard to the objections which I see to the conducting of the count in one place in each constituency.  I think I covered the ground fully and when I hear what the Minister has to say, unless he intimates that he proposes to accept my amendment, I will have something further to say.  I agree entirely with the additional case made by Deputy Kavanagh.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the past it has been customary to hold more than one election on the same day.  We have had a Presidential election and local elections held together. We have had a Presidential election and a referendum held together. In those cases it has invariably happened that ballot papers have been <Col N="1223" /> put into the wrong box.  Indeed, it happens when local elections are held and there is an election for a county council and an urban council.  Ballot papers for the county council are put into the urban box and urban ballot papers are put into the county council box.  That entails only exchanging the papers between the town hall and the courthouse, and in the area with which I am most familiar that is a matter of only 100 yards or so.  However, if you have to forward papers, say, from Letterkenny to Galway, Castlebar or Cavan, it is going to take days and it will be unworkable. The very strong point which Deputy Kavanagh made is that this could delay and confuse the count for days.  The amendment put down by me and supported by Deputy Kavanagh is compelling and I trust the Minister will intimate that he is prepared to accept it.</P>

      <P>Having listened to Deputies Fitzpatrick and Kavanagh, it seems to me that Deputy Fitzpatrick may be missing one very important point.  He said that on the night of the poll the ballot boxes could be conveyed to a local counting centre in each county and county borough and that next morning the local returning officers could commence counting the votes.  Unfortunately, it is not as simple as that.  Under the European instrument, in this case, the election to the Assembly will be held on a date to be fixed by the individual member states within the period commencing Thursday morning and ending on the following Sunday and the counting of the votes cannot begin in any member state until the poll has been completed in all member states.  Most of the continental countries will vote on a Sunday; this has been the pattern there for elections.  Therefore the counting cannot commence anywhere throughout the EEC or in any member state until the polling booths close in the last country on the Sunday night.  Taking the realistic view, the counting here probably will not start until Monday morning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1224" /> A decision has not yet been taken as to which day we will vote, whether it will be Thursday, Friday, Saturday or Sunday.  During the debate on this Bill Deputy Kavanagh suggested that we should vote on Sunday.  This suggestion will also be carefully considered when we come to decide on the day. Having regard to our tradition of voting on weekdays rather than at the weekend, Saturday or Sunday, it seems very likely that Thursday rather than Sunday will be the day that will be selected.  This means that the ballot boxes must be retained unopened and under guard from Thursday night to Monday morning either at one centre in each Assembly constituency if the proposals in the Bill are accepted, or at two, seven, eight and in one constituency 11 centres respectively within the constituencies, if Deputy Fitzpatrick's amendment is accepted.  The Deputy must accept that we should utilise the days between Thursday and Sunday night until Monday morning at least to get the boxes together in one centre in each assembly constituency. The question is really one of time and the continuity of proceedings.  In effect counting cannot begin either at the local counting centres until Monday morning.</P>
    <P>Under the proposal in the Bill counting would begin at a central counting place on Monday morning and proceed continuously until the count would be completed.  Under the proposed amendment the boxes would be held in several different places in each Assembly constituency, and in the Leinster constituency there would be 11 different places.  The first count would be carried out at each of these centres on the Monday morning and the proceedings would then be adjourned while the ballot papers were packed and transported to the constituency counting centre where the proceedings would recommence some time on Tuesday at the earliest.  I will leave it to the House to judge which of these arrangements is more likely to recommend itself to candidates and their agents, the news media and the public generally.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick raised a very important point when he said that there <Col N="1225" /> was grave danger that the proposals in the Bill would prove unworkable, that the arrangements would break down, that there would be litigation and that the entire election would be upset as a result.  I am glad to be able to set the Deputy's mind at rest here. When these proposals were being prepared my predecessor set up a working group of experienced returning officers to advise on the practical arrangements for the elections.  This group advised that while there were administrative advantages in having the first count carried out locally, as the amendment says, they were satisfied that either arrangement would work.  The House can make a free choice between the two proposals secure in that knowledge.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick spoke at length on the problem of transport and security.  I have no wish to make light of these problems.  They are the same whether or not there are to be local counting places or one centre.  Each ballot paper must travel directly or indirectly on one or more journeys from the polling station at which the vote was cast to the control counting place for the constituency, and security must be provided right along the way.  A vehicle carrying half a dozen ballot boxes is just as likely to be involved in an accident as a vehicle carrying 100 boxes.  So far as the security aspect is concerned it must be easier to provide security for a few days at a single place than in seven, eight or 11 different places in the constituencies.</P>
    <P>Comparison was also made with Presidential elections.  In reality the two situations are quite different.  At a Presidential election the whole State is one constituency and if there were no local counts every ballot box for every polling station would have to come in to the national counting centre.  The problem would therefore be four times as big as it would be with the Assembly elections because we are talking about four constituencies. In a Presidential election counting can commence the morning after the poll and there is no question of waiting two or three days until the polling stations close in some places <Col N="1226" /> like Italy, France or West Germany. At a Presidential election we can proceed at a pace that suits ourselves; the result of the election is of national interest only.  At the Assembly elections it may be taken that there will be considerable European pressure to get the counts and the results out as quickly as possible.  In this connection we must bear in mind that the counting under the single transferable vote system is more complicated than under the systems employed by any other partners and that the counting in our elections will necessarily be slower than in the case of any of our partners. We would be well advised, therefore, to adopt an arrangement which holds out the best promise of a result as early as possible.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick also spoke about the difficulties associated with carrying out a central count.  We are all familiar with elections and I am quite sure none of us is under any illusion about the magnitude of the task involved here.  I am quite confident of the capacity of the returning officers to meet this challenge.  This is a suitable opportunity to place on record my appreciation of the efficiency and dedication of our returning officers and their staff.  Over the years they have very ably met the demands on them and I am sure we can commit the conduct of the new Assembly elections to them.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick in his argument also leaned very heavily on what he referred to as the obligation on returning officers to rule personally on doubtful votes.  Is he interpreting the provisions of the Bill a bit too literally in this case?  It is true that the Bill requires the returning officer to decide on the validity of ballot papers but the Bill also requires him to arrange the ballot papers in parcels, to count the ballot papers, to calculate the quota, to transfer surpluses and so on.  We all know that all this is done by the staff under the returning officer's supervision, not personally by him.  In relation to rulings on the validity of those ballot papers presumably what will happen in practice is that the returning officer for the constituency will lay down the criteria for assessing the <Col N="1227" /> validity of ballot papers and the actual ruling will be carried out by his senior assistant or legal assessors under his general supervision.</P>
    <P>I would like to draw attention to section 14 (4) (c) of the Bill.  This obliges the local returning officer to render such assistance to the returning officer for the said constituency as that returning officer may require.  There is no reason why the constituency returning officer, if he so wishes, could not ask his colleagues from neighbouring Dáil constituencies to attend the count and assist him in ruling on the validity of these ballot papers.  The Deputy spoke of teams of counting staff being brought in from other counties to help in the counting of the votes.  I do not know to what extent this may be necessary but if this kind of arrangement is decided on in a particular constituency there seems on the face of it to be no reason why such a team should not operate as a team and be responsible for a particular block of votes, under the supervision of their own local returning officer.</P>
    <P>With regard to the general desirability of having the entire count for a constituency conducted in one place rather than in several places, there is one question I would like to pose.  At the conclusion of the local count the counted ballot papers will be packed in boxes and sent to the constituency returning officer.  Let us suppose that one box is alleged to contain 5,000 ballot papers and suppose on a recheck at the central counting place the constituency returning officer says he can only find 4,500 ballot papers.  The question then arises on whom can the courts or anyone else fix responsibility? Is it on the local man, the central man, on both or on none at all? I have gone to some lengths to answer the points raised.  I believe it is important to do so because this is an agreed measure.  I would like to think that we can all feel committed to each individual provision contained in the Bill.</P>
    <P>With regard to the point made by Deputy Kavanagh about the confusion that would arise because of having two elections taking place on the same <Col N="1228" /> day, I doubt if any confusion could arise here.  We have on many occasions had more than one election on the same day.  Even when the local elections take place in urban areas, the urban election and the county council election take place at the same time and, so far as I am aware and my Department officials are aware, we have had no complaint on this score. No difficulties have been created and there has been no mix up of ballot papers.  There are always two different coloured ballot papers and the presiding officer and his polling clerk are there to ensure that the right colour goes into the right box in case there is confusion.</P>
    <P>In past elections we have had referenda and presidential elections taking place on the same day and we did not have any difficulty.  I doubt if any commissioner from any town in Ireland will find his way to Europe through this confusion because I do not think it will arise.  There has been no difficulty when we have had more than one election taking place on the same day.  We do not know for sure at this stage when we will have the European election.  It is quite possible the election could take place before we have any of our own elections. No consideration has been given to changing the local elections.</P>
    <P>I would like to assure the House that I am not digging in my heels in regard to this particular amendment just for the sake of being difficult.  The reason I will not accept the amendment is that I consider the proposal in the Bill to be the better one.  I trust the Deputy will agree and possibly withdraw his amendment.  On balance the proposal in the Bill is the better one.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): I am disappointed that the Minister has not seen the force of the arguments that have been put forward in favour of the amendment.  I regret that I am not prepared to withdraw the amendment.  In regard to the major point made by the Minister that the count cannot start until the election has concluded in all the member states and that this would <Col N="1229" /> involve holding the ballot papers at the local centre for one or more days the Minister spoke about the possibility of holding the election on Sunday.  I do not believe we have yet reached the point when we can hold an election on a Sunday.  It is essential that people should not be discouraged from exercising the franchise in any election.</P>
      <P>If we were to decide to hold the election on Sunday I believe a sizeable percentage of the people would either feel obliged to stay away from the poll or would be strongly discouraged from doing so on religious belief. I refer to the religious minority in the country who hold very strong views on the observance of the Sabbath Day. It is true that their feelings in regard to the strict observance of the Sabbath Day are as strong now as the feelings of the religious majority were towards the observance of abstinence on a Friday when that was a rule in the majority church here.  Therefore, I would be strongly against any proposal to hold the election on a Sunday unless there was clear evidence that it was acceptable to all the people and that no sizeable body of opinion was against it on religious grounds.</P>
      <P>Elections could be held on Thursday, Friday or Saturday.  I concede Saturday could be quite a good day for holding them because many people have the day off and it could quite well be that Saturday would be a suitable day.  I have not given very deep thought to that yet.  I would not agree that the fact that the election was held on Thursday, Friday or Saturday and the count could not begin until Monday defeats the force of my argument.  I have pointed out&mdash; it is on the record and I do not have to go into detail again&mdash;that if the count takes place at a central counting place in each constituency, thousands of ballot boxes will have to be assembled at a local centre because the local returning officer will have to check that all the boxes have been brought in and that he discharges his obligation under the Bill in forwarding them to the central counting place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, I repeat, hundreds of boxes will have to be assembled <Col N="1230" /> locally.  A very considerable amount of work is involved in that.  These hundreds of boxes will then have to be transported long distances&mdash;up to 400 I am sure from some counties.  A number of lorries will have to be engaged to transport them.  A separate Army and Garda escort will have to be provided for each local constituency. There is a danger, as I said before, of a breakdown during transport and there is a real danger of their being attacked and the papers being destroyed.  An enormous amount of labour is involved in this.  Then there is the difficulty of securing a suitable counting centre large enough to accommodate all the ballot boxes which will be conveyed from the 11 centres, apparently, in Leinster, and the question of assembling sufficient staff at this one centre to count all these papers.  There is also the danger of having great difficulty in reconciling the ballot paper accounts with the actual number of ballot papers contained in each ballot box.</P>
    <P>The Minister does not see any difficulty arising out of the possibility and the likelihood, I would say, of having two elections held on the one day.  As evidence of that, he says there was never any difficulty about this in the past.  Of course there was not, because the count was held locally.  If they were a referendum and a presidential election, the count was held in the same building.  If they were a presidential election and a local election the count was held in the same building.  If they were two local elections like an urban council election and a county council election the count was either held in the same building or in the same town.  In those circumstances, one would not expect any difficulty arising out of ballot papers being put into the wrong ballot boxes.</P>
    <P>The Minister seems to be advised that ballot papers were not put into the wrong ballot boxes.  Practical politicians who have been present at counts over 20 or more years know as a matter of fact that when there are two elections ballot papers are invariably put into the wrong ballot boxes.  Either two of them are put into the one box or the ballot paper is <Col N="1231" /> put into the wrong box.  There is no fuss or real trouble because the papers are just transferred from one counting centre in the town to another, or from one room to another in the same building. Here we will have real difficulty because we will have to transfer them not from one building to another in the same town, or from one room to another in the same building, but from as far as 100 miles or more. That is where we will have the real difficulty.</P>
    <P>The Minister also said the entire State was the constituency in a presidential election.  Of course that is true, but the counts are held in every Dáil constituency, and the difficulties I see here do not arise.  I gathered from the Minister when he rose to speak that, when this matter was considered in the Custom House, the Minister had the benefit of practical advice from practical people.  I gathered from what he said that he consulted, or his predecessor or his officials consulted, experienced returning officers on this topic. They said either the system proposed in the Bill or my system was capable of working.  I do not deny they are capable of working.  As the Minister conceded that these experienced returning officers or other experienced people he consulted, advised in favour of the presidential system of counting, it is difficult to see why he has overruled that advice and, I believe, going against the opinion not alone of this side of the House but against a great body of opinion on the Government's own side of the House.</P>
    <P>When the Minister says he is prepared to leave it to the House I wonder does he mean he is prepared to leave it to a free vote or to the House under the Whipping system. If he does the latter the result is a foregone conclusion and the Minister will force the system in the Bill, which is not acceptable to this side of the House and apparently not acceptable to the experts he consulted.  If the Minister is prepared to leave it to a genuine free vote I will be interested to see the outcome of that.</P>
    <P>This is not a controversial matter.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1232" /> It is an effort by the House to get the best workable system possible.  I do not believe the Minister dealt fully with the points raised by me in regard to counting staff, for example.  He seemed to say that if additional staff were necessary it would have to be got.  Of course additional staff will be necessary.  Nobody suggests for a moment that the staff which could count the votes for County Sligo, for instance, would be capable of counting the votes for the eight counties comprised in the Connacht-Ulster constituency. It is absolutely certain additional staff will be necessary and the counting staff will have to be augmented fourfold or fivefold.  Where will accommodation be found for that staff? I said the last day, and I repeat it now, that there is a tradition and a procedure which has worked well over the years.  It is not necessarily a uniform system but, if staff are brought in from all over the provinces, there are bound to be different approaches and there is bound to be difficulty and contention.</P>
    <P>I do not accept what the Minister said about spoiled votes.  There are duties which can be delegated by returning officers, such as mathematical calculations and so on, but I put it to the Minister and to the House that the adjudication on spoiled votes is something that is not delegated.  It is conducted personally by the returning officer in the presence of the candidates and their agents.  Before the count starts there is agreement on general criteria.  But there can be borderline cases which have to be adjudicated on by returning officers before the count begins.  For instance, it may be agreed that a single &ldquo;x&rdquo; standing alone will be regarded as No. 1.  That does not give any trouble.  But a question can arise as to whether a No. 1 is really that or whether it is some sort of stroke and there are two Nos. 1 on the paper. All these have to be scrutinised by the returning officer.  Not for one moment do I accept that as a matter of practice this is delegated by the returning officer or, indeed, that it would be possible to delegate it.</P>
    <P>The Minister also seems to suggest that the count would take longer here <Col N="1233" /> because of proportional representation than it would in other countries.  There are mechanical methods of counting in the United States and other places. We do not have that system here.  I understand, however, that in some of the member states the same system of propotional representation as we are advocating here will be operated.  I speak of the other part of this island. It is unlikely that the election will be held in Britain on a Sunday.  I could not see the election being held in Northern Ireland on Sunday.  I do not know whether they will have a central system of counting or a local system, but all the arguments here so far support my amendment.</P>
    <P>We have the strongest possible arguments. We have the presidential system. We have had several presidential elections since 1937 and that is the system I am asking the Minister to adopt.  It is hard to understand why he will not accept it.  There was an agreed presidential candidate in 1937 but there have been several elections since and one went to a recount.  They were all held under the system I am proposing. The system has been tested.  It has worked well and there has never been any trouble.</P>
    <P>Now, if politicians are authorities on anything, they are authorities on elections and counts because that is the way they find their way into this House and it is something in which they take a deep interest.  As far as I can gather, opinion in this House is practically unanimous that the presidential system is the right system and the system proposed is absurd.  The Minister said that the expert opinion he consulted&mdash;county registrars and returning officers&mdash;advised him that he should adopt the presidential system. That is my information.  The Minister is now turning that down and opting for this new type of count which has not been tested.  He is taking a step in the dark.  That is not what politicians want.  It is not what the advisers he consulted want.  I strongly urge the Minister to have another look at this, think about it, consult the members of his own party and the returning officers and I am satisfied that, if he does that, <Col N="1234" /> he will come down in favour of my amendment.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that each ballot paper under one system or another will ultimately find its way to the central counting centre.  I agree, but it is a totally different operation to transfer up to ten, at a maximum, ballot boxes from County Cavan to County Galway or from County Galway to County Cavan than it is to transfer over 400 boxes involving a totally different volume of transport and more escorts.  The Minister has not dealt with that to my satisfaction nor has he dealt with the amount of transport required or the difficulty in providing on the same night a fleet of Army transport lorries for every province and county in the State.  That is what is involved.  There must be an Army escort and if there are hundreds of boxes it will have to be a heavy Garda and Army escort.  That will have to be provided at the same time in every county.</P>
    <P>Neither has the Minister dealt with the fact that the boxes will have to be hauled back from the central counting centre to the local ones.  Of course, they will not need an escort then and there will be no rush about it and it is not as strong a point as the other but it means more work.  Apparently, the Minister has not given any thought to how the extra staff will be recruited, the extra cost of transporting them from far outside the immediate area where the central count will take place, keeping them overnight and paying expenses.  I think it will double if not treble the cost of the count. Also, I am not satisfied that the Minister has dealt with Deputy Kavanagh's point about the possibility&mdash;and it is far more than that: it is a certainty&mdash; of ballot papers finding their way into wrong boxes if there are two elections on the same day.  Anybody who says that does not happen is not familiar with the conduct of elections.  I suppose the quickest way of coping with this would be to have Army motor cyclists plying between the central counting centre and the local ones or the ones concerned with the other election.  It means unnecessary delay and unnecessary problems.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1235" /> Those are some things the Minister has not dealt with.  I believe that for some reason he is being advised at central level to adopt this system which is not practicable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>Last week I suggested that the Minister should consider a Sunday ballot as a possibility because of its popularity in other Community states.  I take Deputy Fitzpatrick's point that some people would have strong objection to balloting on the Sabbath, particularly among the minority, but one does not know how strong these objections are until we find out from them.  There are ways of doing that.  I think the possibility is worth considering not only for this election but for all elections.  People should be convenienced.  We have found in elections that quite a lot of people who have to travel to their work in cities, say in my constituency from Wicklow to Dublin, do not get back until night and miss the voting.  They are unable to vote because they leave before the booths open and get back after the booths close.  Strangely, many of our voters will not go to vote in their working clothes, particularly in rural areas.  Many of them go home, put on a good suit and then go to vote. Some who go home do not bother to go out again to vote.  On Sundays when people go to Mass or Service, polling stations are usually close by, in schools or colleges, practically next door, and it could be quite convenient to do two jobs on the Sunday.  Even though tradition has it that we do not vote on Sundays, the idea is worth considering.</P>

      <P>The Minister's argument in refusing the amendment was that he is confined to rules&mdash;laid down by the Council, I assume, because it is certainly not laid down in the Treaty <Col N="1236" /> of Rome how the election should be run.  One of the big problems about the EEC is their desire for harmonisation. They want to harmonise the size of eggs and sausages and so on and apparently also how we run elections. I see nothing wrong in our saying once in a while, in the case of something as important as an election, &ldquo;We will run it to suit our own traditions.&rdquo;  I do not see any strong objection to that. But I am certain that it would not be acceptable to our people to hold a ballot on a Thursday and tell them that we would not start the count until the following Monday.  They would not get even a first count result by the following Tuesday.  Nowadays if a person puts a bob on a horse he wants to know the result an hour after the race is run.  When something as important as an election takes place he will want the result as soon as is practicable, allowing counters and polling stations staff a chance to get a night's rest, so that some of them can take their places at the counting tables the next morning. We have accepted that system and I do not believe anybody wants to change it because someone in Brussels decides that we should not start a count for three or four days.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I found the Minister's reply to my problem and my strong objection to this rule and his defence of his objection to Deputy Fitzpatrick's amendment evasive and I can describe it in no other terms.  He did not have an adequate answer.  He did not say that there was no possibility of a second election or a referendum or a local election taking place on the same day as the Assembly election.  He is being practical in that: he knows this election could take place at the same time as the local elections; he knows that there are some things in the Constitution that are likely to be considered in the next year or so and that a referendum could take place at that time.  A presidential election does not seem likely; neither does a general election seem likely before the Assembly election, but there is the possibility of two elections taking place on one day.  And merely because of the saving that could be made by having two on one day the likelihood becomes a strong possibility.  There is <Col N="1237" /> also the political wisdom of getting as many people as possible out to vote on issues that are attractive to them, that is local issues, interests and candidates. These are very attractive to people and bring them out in large numbers.</P>
    <P>While the Minister did not say that there was no possibility, he said that the tradition has been that the presiding officers and so on were all so efficient that they never let a vote go astray and that a voting paper for the local elections could not possibly get into an Assembly elections box and that we would have different coloured ballot papers.  I have stood at local elections.  I presently represent Wicklow, at urban council level, at county council level and in the Dáil.  It is quite conceivable that my name would be on the Assembly elections ballot paper as well.  To have the same name on three ballot papers would cause confusion regardless of what the Minister says.  In some areas the duties are taken very seriously, but where lighting is inadequate and so on mistakes can be made.  Some people screw up their votes into a nice tight little ball and they would certainly take offence if the presiding officer asked them to smooth out the votes so that he could take note of which box they were going into.  Some of them would think he was interfering with their rights to a secret ballot.  The Minister should seriously consider this point.  I do not see why the Minister cannot have both options in the Bill and so cover himself should we hold two elections on the same day.  The Minister should consider the objections raised by both Deputy Fitzpatrick and myself.</P>
    <P>All of us here belong to the three main parties that will be contesting the Assembly elections.  Our organisations&mdash;consisting mostly of amateurs even though they work like professionals&mdash;are not paid, they work in their own time.  One small recomnense they like to get is to know the result in their areas, and as many as possible would like to be present at the count to see how their areas polled.  This information is useful for political parties.  They need to know how the trend is going.  It is very <Col N="1238" /> important that each constituency know the trend.  They need to know if there has been a shift in popularity from one party to another.  After the result of the last general election we would all like to see how the Government are doing.  An election on this issue will certainly indicate how the Government are being considered by the people in the overall situation.  Those of us who will have the duty of turning out our support in Dáil constituencies will want to know how the constituency is behaving.  This information can be obtained by having the count in one central place.</P>
    <P>Does the Minister now say that he wishes to have in the rest of Leinster constituency 11 separate counting areas where the different county ballot boxes will be counted, where the boxes will be taken into different rooms and counted and then brought together?  If that is the case surely Deputy Fitzpatrick's proposal is met far more simply by having the count done within the county or county borough and then transferring in one vehicle the checked and counted ballot papers. The Minister has not convinced us of the value of proceeding in the way he chooses in this Bill.  The Minister should open up the possibility of being able to change his mind should our arguments in the future seem to him to be correct.  There is likelihood of an election being run with the Assembly elections.  Due to the polling patterns we have here and to our wish to know the trends in the various constituencies, it is reasonable to press Deputy Fitzpatrick's amendment as strongly as possible, or, as I have suggested, the Minister should try to contain both possibilities in this Schedule.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy wondered why we could not do our own thing with regard to when we count the votes and so on.  Under article 9, subsection (2), of the Act agreed by the Council of Ministers in September, 1976, by agreement it was laid down that the counting of votes may not begin until after the close of polling in the member states whose electors are the last to vote within the period referred to at paragraph 1.  We do not have any <Col N="1239" /> choice in this.  With regard to the confusion about ballot papers if two elections are held, a point seems to have escaped Deputies in the argument. If the elections are held on a Thursday the count for the local elections will definitely take place the following day, because council candidates will not hang around waiting.  In most instances the local elections counts will be completed and the winners declared in the shortest possible time.  If a local election ballot paper got into an EEC election box that would not be discovered until the following Monday, so that will not affect the position if the winner has been declared.  Over the years two elections or maybe a referendum have taken place together on many occasions.  If this had ever created a problem or continued to create a problem surely we would not have continued holding these elections at the same time.  I am not saying that it would be an isolated incident but there have been few complaints in this regard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): The reason there were no complaints is that they were usually in the same building and were able to solve any problems that arose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps that is the reason but it had never been brought to the attention of my Department that it was creating a problem.  Different coloured ballot papers will be used and there will be a presiding officer and a polling clerk supervising the polling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The ballot boxes will have to be transported to the central counting centre under Deputy Fitzpatrick's amendment or under the Bill, and a security problem will arise during transportation.  There are 11 centres in Leinster which would need to be secured from Thursday night until Monday when the counting starts. Security would also be needed the following day when the boxes are being transported to the central counting centre.  Surely it would be more realistic to have a proper security system <Col N="1240" /> at the central counting centre than at each polling centre.</P>
    <P>The arguments and disagreements of the working party have been referred to.  The returning officers assured the former Minister that either system was workable.  Some of them were in favour of the provisions contained in the amendment and some of them were in favour of our system.  When the Bill came before Deputy Fitzpatrick and his colleagues they agreed with its contents.  I do not know where all this disagreement is coming from because the Bill is an agreed one.  It was agreed by the previous Government and by my predecessor.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick referred to Northern Ireland and wondered what would happen there.  The only answer to that is to refer to the referendum on the Border.  On that occasion all the ballot boxes were transported to a centre in Belfast so it is probable that the same system will be used again. At every general election the ballot boxes are transported from each constituency to Bolton Street where the count takes place.  The system has worked well in Dublin and everybody is satisfied with it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): The Minister has made considerable capital of the fact that the Bill was introduced by the former Minister for Local Government and presumably it was cleared by the Government before it was circulated.  That is true in regard to the general details of the Bill.  The Second Schedule to the Bill was the work of the independent commission established by the present Government.  It is the duty of this House to scrutinise legislation on Committee Stage and to try to improve it.  As Opposition spokesman on the <Col N="1241" /> Environment it is my duty to scrutinise the Bill.</P>
      <P>I am perturbed by the Minister's belief that the holding of two elections on the same day would not lead to confusion. Anybody who has any experience of elections knows that this invariably happens.  I agree that it is not the sort of thing that would be reported to the Custom House, that it would be dealt with locally by the two returning officers, one operating in the town hall and the other operating in the courthouse. They would simply exchange the ballot papers and that would be that.  The Minister made a rather alarming point which would seem to make it impossible to hold the two elections on the same day.  He said if both elections were held on Thursday, the local election count would be completed on Friday when the result would be declared, and the Assembly count would not begin until Monday.  I should like to see the reaction of local authorities when it would become apparent that the wrong people had been elected or that the wrong people had been eliminated by one vote.  There would be civil strife and an uproar that would take the military to put down.  There is nothing more important for any man who stands for election than to be elected.  If a candidate who was eliminated on Friday discovered on Monday that there were a couple of votes available that would have elected him he would react very strongly, as would his party.  That is unthinkable and it shows how far removed some people are from the reality of the situation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): There are strong arguments in favour of having a local count rather than a central count.  If the two elections are held on the same day it is imperative that the two counts commence at the same time.  I would be in favour of holding the elections on the last Saturday within the specified time between the Thursday and the Monday and commence the count locally for both elections, or three elections if they are held, on the Monday.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): They would react favourably to it rather than run the risk of discovering after they had been defeated that they had enough votes to elect them.  The Minister fails to get my point in regard to transport and has said that the ballot boxes will have to be transported one way or another. I agree with the latter but they will have to be transported in six or ten boxes rather than in hundreds of boxes.  That is a different operation. The Minister said his suggestion has worked in Dublin but that is not a valid argument against my amendment. Votes in Dublin do not have to be transported any more than a few miles and they are stored in different rooms in one building.  There is no comparison between transferring ballot boxes from Rathmines to Bolton Street <Col N="1243" /> and transferring ballot boxes from Letterkenny to Castlebar or Letterkenny to Cavan.</P>
      <P>The Minister said we would be slower in the count than other member states because we would be the only state using proportional representation. As far as I know the entire vote in the UK will be in accordance with our system of PR.  Certainly, the count in Northern Ireland will be in accordance with our system of PR and, consequently, will take as long as ours.  I did not put down this amendment to score political points.  I tabled it because I believe the system suggested by the Minister is unworkable.  I say that from a practical commonsense point of view.  I agree with the point made by Deputy Kavanagh, that our system of democracy works because of voluntary organisations and because a lot of people are involved in the various political parties.  If this form of democracy is to continue it is necessary that our people be involved at local level.  Deputy Kavanagh also made a valid point when he stated that the key men in any organisation want to be at the count and see local boxes opened. Practical politicians know that it is not feasible to transport political organisations from, for instance, 11 centres to one centre.  In my view this is another attempt to centralise things, to take democracy away from the grassroots and to gather everything and transport it to Dublin, other cities or big towns, forgetting about those who did all the work leading up to the election.  The Minister's suggestion would be bad for democracy and would lead to less interest in the election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister concedes that he has been advised that either system will work.  That is the Minister's argument against my amendment at its best.  He admits that he has been advised in favour of my amendment but added that he was told that either system would work.  If that is so why does the Minister not retain the system that the people want, retain the system that has been in operation here since 1937, a system that is in the interest of local <Col N="1244" /> democracy.  The old system avoids votes which are meant for Cavan Urban Council being found 100 miles away from that centre when they are badly needed by a candidate at the count in the town hall in Cavan.  The Minister should give us the system everybody wants.  I urge him to have a rethink about this and apply his own common sense to the matter.  If he does that I am satisfied that he will be in favour of my amendment.  I am not prepared to withdraw my amendment entirely but I do not want to put the issue to a vote.  I want to reserve the right to raise this matter again. This discussion affects practical politicians and is one between practical and experienced politicians.  The Minister should apply his political experience and common sense to this issue. Out of his own mouth he had been advised by experts that his system will work, or that my system will work.  I put it to him that my system is the most practical, the less expensive and will meet the wishes of every grassroot politician down to the personation agent; they do not want their boxes to be brought in from little polling centres, packed up on a lorry and driven 100 miles, never to be heard about again except what they might learn from television, the radio or the newspapers.  They want to be involved in the count and the only way they can be so involved is if it is retained at local level.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to give my reaction to two statements the Minister made when he replied earlier.  Two fundamental and basic beliefs that sustain me in politics and which the Minister does not seem to consider as important to democracy as I think they are, are that when a Bill comes into the House it is up to every Member to endeavour to put his views forward and improve the Bill wherever possible, irrespective of what agreement is reached at whatever level outside it. Until we arrived at this point in this Bill one could say agreement was fairly general, except in some smaller details. We have now reached the stage where we have an important point to make. Had there not been the general election <Col N="1245" /> in June, with the previous Government remaining on and, were we still over there, I would still make the same objections to whichever Minister would be presenting this Bill.</P>
      <P>The other basic fact the Minister did not consider when he made his remarks is that convenience as far as counting is concerned should come before the accuracy of the result. Whether it be a local, general or Presidential election we all want to see the correct result being brought out.  A voter goes to a ballot box, places his ballot paper in the box in the polling station, which is the limit of the jurisdiction of the presiding officer.  He is then entitled to ensure that that vote is counted amongst the others in that election.  Every effort must be made to ensure that that vote is counted and that an accurate result is brought forward.  All sides would be appalled if a local election count were to take place and, three or four days afterwards, an Assembly election's count was to commence, with ballot papers proper to the local election becoming available which would obviously distort the result previously found in the local election.  The result previously found in the local election would have been distorted because the ballot papers were not counted at the appropriate time or were disregarded by the presiding officer as not being available to him when he declared the result at the earlier count.</P>
      <P>Since there is this very strong possibility I, too, would insist that the Minister either accept the amendment as put down or that, on Report Stage, he would alter this section giving himself the widest possibility of holding the count wherever the most accurate results can be obtained.  That is really what we want.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What Deputy Fitzpatrick is asking is very reasonable and is in line with tradition here.  If the Minister holds strongly to his argument and is not going to give way to Deputy Fitzpatrick's amendment, at least he should accept that there is the possibility of one or more elections taking place in conjunction with this election. Therefore he should maintain in the Bill the opportunity of affording himself <Col N="1246" /> the widest possible scope when it comes to the counting of votes.  He can do so very simply on Report Stage by indicating that the count can take place either at the local counting stations up to a certain stage of the count and will then be transferred elsewhere, or that the count can take place at a central point.  He should not set his face totally against the amendment.  We have said all we can and we cannot advance any more arguments, at least from this side.  But I would not like the Minister to say that any Bill, because it had the agreement of the previous Government around the Cabinet table, would necessarily meet with the total agreement of every backbencher in the House and would get the go-through on the nod. There must be debate on any Bill introduced in this House.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I will make two points : firstly, the danger of the mixup of having the two elections on the same day and the fear expressed here that if an urban council or local election vote finds its way into the EEC ballot box&mdash;because of these being taken to a central point for counting, as set out in the Bill&mdash;such would create a serious problem and that a candidate might find himself elected or eliminated, or the wrong man elected and the wrong man eliminated and so on.  Even were we to accept Deputy Fitzpatrick's amendment this danger would still exist.  Assuming that we would be polling on, say Thursday, and this happened the European count could not start until the following Monday.  There is no way I know of in which one could persuade the local election candidates to wait until the Monday to start the count if polling day was the previous Thursday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I ask the Minister one question about that.  Suppose the presiding officer for the <Col N="1247" /> local election was approached by the agent of a particular party who said: &ldquo;I have evidence that a number of votes have found their way into the Assembly box; I want this count halted until those boxes are checked.&rdquo; Does the presiding officer not have to suspend the count until those papers are brought back?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, if such should occur.  In my opinion the possibility of holding the two elections together is very slight because, in all probability, the European elections will be over a year before the local elections are due to be held.  Therefore, we are worrying about something that will probably never happen here.</P>
      <P>A very important feature of what is contained in the Bill is the fact that we are doing it in the most efficient and, let us say, quickest possible way. Deputy Kavanagh possibly will be a candidate and, for all I know, Deputy Fitzpatrick.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>If we were to have the local counting centres they would still have to wait until the Monday to start their count.  The boxes would still have to be transported&mdash;perhaps fewer in number&mdash;to a central point.  It would definitely be, say, Tuesday evening before they would arrive, some of them perhaps from distant parts; it would be into Tuesday anyway.  By using the time between, say, Thursday and Sunday night, or Monday morning, to have the ballot boxes at a central counting station, you would have a quicker result and spare a lot of worry and suspense on people like Deputy Kavanagh, who I assume will be going as a candidate for the election, and many more. This is the way the candidates would want it themselves&mdash;the count to take place and winners declared elected in the quickest possible time.  It would be more convenient in every way and, in my opinion, the proper way to do it. We have been through all the arguments for and against and I am still convinced that our decision for doing <Col N="1248" /> it in the manner contained in the Bill is the correct one.</P>

      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): There is a point on page 12 of the Bill that I raised before. Rule 2 states:</P>
      <P>The returning officer shall, not later than the twenty-eighth day .... before the polling day, give public notice in the prescribed form of the Assembly election ....</P>
      <P>I suppose this is one of the ways we will find out when the election will be held.  In a section of the Bill it is stated that the Minister shall fix the polling day by order.  I should imagine that he will have to fix it more than 28 days from the date of the order, otherwise the returning officer could not give 28 days' notice. The point I made on the last occasion was that this is a very roundabout way of fixing the date of the election and I should like the Minister's views on it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): I should like to raise a point on page 14 of the Bill.  Only seven days are allowed for nominations and that sounds a very short time.  However, I suppose it would be generally known that the election was on the way and people would plan accordingly.  Rule 7 states:</P>
      <P>The earliest time for receiving nominations shall be 10 a.m. on the day ....  next following the latest date for the publication of the Notice of Elections and the latest time for receiving nominations shall be 12 noon on the seventh day ....</P>
      <P>It seems the period is approximately seven days for making nominations. Unless people were prepared, it appears that seven days is too short.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>

      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): Naturally I accept without reservation the Minister's word about Dáil elections but it surprises me to hear that in a snap election there is only five days to get in nominations. We know that involves calling a convention and they are not always called by telegram.  When the Dáil is dissolved notice is not given for a few days.  I suppose it could work out to be seven or ten days from the date the Dáil is dissolved.</P>

      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): The time is still a little short, but I am sure it is all right.</P>
      <P>I should like to raise a point on page 16 of the Bill.  In general elections a candidate is entitled to appoint a sub-agent and a personation agent.  I know that in a referendum there is no provision for sub-agents and I do not think there is any provision for them in this Bill.  I suggest there should be provision for appointing sub-agents as in the case of a general election.  It could happen that there would not be a personation agent in every polling booth and in such case it would be essential for the candidate to have a sub-agent who would be entitled to go to the polling booth, to be there at the opening and when the boxes were sealed.  Even if a candidate has a personation agent it is desirable that he should also have a sub-agent.  I could never understand why the distinction was drawn between local government elections, Dáil elections, referenda and Presidential elections.  In the case of local government or Dáil elections there is provision for personation agents and sub-agents but in referenda and Presidential elections there is no provision for sub-agents.  There is no provision in this Bill for sub-agents and I suggest we should make such provision.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>We will have a look at this matter with a view to doing something about it on Report Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): I shall have to refer to Rule 20 (1) in its entirety because that <Col N="1251" /> is the rule that provides for what happens when a candidate dies.  It states:</P>
      <P>Where, not less than seventy-two hours before the latest time for the withdrawal of candidature under <i>Rule 12</i> of this Schedule, the returning officer becomes satisfied that a candidate standing nominated has died, the returning officer shall immediately give public notice to that effect and the candidature of the candidate shall be deemed to have been withdrawn.</P>
      <P>The period specified means that it is some time before the latest date for making nominations and in that event the candidature is deemed to have been withdrawn.  That is simple enough and I have no objection to it.  However, paragraph (2) states:</P>
      <P>Where, at any time during the period beginning seventy-two hours before the latest time for the withdrawal of candidature under <i>Rule 12</i> of this Schedule and ending on the commencement of the poll, the returning officer becomes satisfied that a candidate standing nominated for election has died, the following provisions shall have effect in relation to the Assembly election&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  the returning officer shall notify the Minister and the chief returning officer of the death of the candidate and at the same time, if notice of the poll has been given, he shall countermand the poll.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is to happen even if the candidate was a next door neighbour of the returning officer and he happened to die at 8.30 a.m. on the morning of the polling day.  If the returning officer became aware of this he would have to call off the election.  Has that been the procedure in general elections to date or is it something new?  It is a grave duty to impose on a returning officer the obligation to countermand a poll and call off the election if he hears of the death of a candidate half an hour before the poll begins.  That would be bad enough in an ordinary general election where the constituencies are <Col N="1252" /> comparatively small but in Leinster he would have to call off the election throughout the entire constituency.  If I understand this correctly, the notice appears to be too short.  I would like to hear the Minister on this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>If a candidate dies the arrangement is identical to that which applies at local elections.  If we are to make any changes in this, I suggest that the change be considered generally.</P>

That is what I tried to do in regard to this Schedule and it appears that this provision is unreasonable and unworkable. Even if a candidate died in the middle of the night before the election, I cannot see how the returning officer for Leinster would be able to advise his hundreds of presiding officers that the election was off.  Would the Minister have a look at this?</P>

      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): The provision in rule 20 (3) came as a complete surprise to me.  Is it new?  It reads:</P>
      <P>Where, at any time after the commencement of the poll in a constituency and before the close of such poll, the returning officer becomes satisfied that a candidate has died&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1253" /> (a)  all votes cast at the Assembly election in the constituency shall be disregarded and the ballot papers destroyed,</P>
    <P>(b)  the returning officer shall notify the Minister and the chief returning officer of the death of the candidate,</P>
    <P>(c)  the provisions of subparagraphs (b) to (f) of paragraph (2) of this Rule shall apply.</P>
    <P>That means that it will start all over again.  That comes as a complete surprise to me.  I thought that whatever the provision about a candidate dying before the poll began, if he died after the poll began the election carried on.</P>
    <P>I have a recollection&mdash;not a very clear one I want to emphasise&mdash;of something like this happening and an aeroplane being hired to notify the electorate that the candidate had died and that they should disregard him. If this has been the law for a long time, this comes as a great surprise to me.</P>

      <P>the ballot papers shall be numbered consecutively on the back and the back of the counterfoil attached to each ballot paper shall bear the same number.  The numbers of the ballot papers shall be printed in the smallest characters compatible with legibility and shall be printed on or about the centre of the ballot paper,</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): That is not the point. In the old days there was a number on the counterfoil and a number on the ballot paper.  Then the presiding officer or his clerk took the number of the voter from the register and put that on the counterfoil.  Consequently, in theory, if one knew the number on the ballot paper and had enough time and facilities to get the counterfoil, he would find the voter's number.  But somebody challenged that situation in the High Court on the basis that it did not preserve the secrecy of the ballot. So far as I know an order was made to the effect that it was no longer <Col N="1255" /> legal to put the voter's registered number on the counterfoil of the ballot paper.  If that is so I should like to think that not only is it a million to one chance but that it is impossible to ascertain how someone voted unless the returning officer, and he is bound by the secrecy of the ballot, were to memorise the number on the ballot paper counterfoil and search perhaps for years until he found the other paper.  I am wondering whether it is necessary to put numbers on ballot papers at all and if it is necessary, whether the numbers should be big or small.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>

I would go further and say that there should be a number on the counterfoil but none on the ballot paper because the only purpose in having a number on the ballot paper is to be able to relate it to the number on the counterfoil for some reason or other.  I can understand it being necessary for the returning officer to know how many ballot papers he issued and, consequently, they should be numbered but why not have the number appear on the counterfoil only?<Col N="1256" /></P>

      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): With regard to page 21 I am availing of this opportunity to raise all the points that have occurred to me in regard to elections.  Rule (3) provides for postal voting.  Not so very long ago I had experience of Seanad ballot envelopes that were of a very poor quality.  It was very difficult to seal these envelopes properly and to ensure that they would not prevent the appearance of having been interfered with.  The quality was so poor that in one instance is was considered necessary to telephone the Seanad Returning Officer to ask for directions.  The difficulty was overcome by putting on one side of the envelope a certificate similar to and in addition to the one that normally goes on the back of the envelope.  I am sure that the returning officer used the envelopes with which he was supplied but steps should be taken to secure superior-type envelopes for this purpose, envelopes that will do the job properly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to page 22, the situation in regard to polling cards leads to a great deal of confusion for many people who think that if they have not received a card they cannot vote.  In city areas in particular with the greater movement of people and so on these cards are sent often to the wrong addresses.  I suppose one of the best ways of checking whether one is on the register is to consult with the agents for the candidates.  The problem in relation to polling cards is that they very often fall into the wrong hands.  Cards have been collected and used by people who had <Col N="1257" /> no right to use them.  I see no need for a continuation of this system.  The cards only add to the confusion that is caused in households by the amount of material that arrives at election time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy.  In my personal experience I can say that polling cards certainly create problems.  People do not always realise that although they may not be in possession of a polling card they have the right to vote so long as their names appear on the register.  The system of polling cards was introduced some years ago on foot of representations made at the time but it is creating unnecessary problems and needs to be reviewed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): I should like to call a spade a spade and say that polling cards facilitate impersonation wholesale, especially in the cities where people are more anonymous than is the case in the country.

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): I understand that interested people collect armfuls of these cards in flats throughout the city of Dublin and that they do not collect them for use as souvenirs.  Polling cards create confusion in so far as people who do not receive them think they are not entitled to vote.  Rule (3) of paragraph 28 provides that a polling card shall be despatched by post and shall be transmitted free of charge by the earliest practicable post.  It is provided that if a person fails to receive a polling card he has no complaint and the election is not invalidated.  However, the more serious aspect of the polling card system is that it facilitates impersonation. Therefore, I am glad to hear the Minister saying that these matters will be reviewed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): I am obliged to the Minister. I want to avail of this opportunity to make a few general remarks about the provision at the end of page 25. Up to comparatively recently&mdash;I do not know what &ldquo;comparatively recently&rdquo; might be, perhaps ten or 15 years&mdash;if a person could not vote himself he had to vote as an illiterate person.  Everybody was excluded from the polling booth except those entitled <Col N="1259" /> to be there under the rules and the presiding officer voted for the illiterate or incapacitated voter, the person who could not vote for himself.  Some years ago, probably 15 or thereabouts, the rules were changed and provision was made under which a person who was not illiterate but who was incapacitated, because he was blind or suffering from arthritis or something like that and could not mark a ballot paper, could vote through what was called a companion.  I assume that by a &ldquo;companion&rdquo; was meant some relative of his own, somebody who was a genuine companion.  This has been grossly abused, especially in institutions where politicians of all sides take the institution by storm and some of them who are not relatives at all bring the voters out and act as companions and vote for them.</P>
      <P>There is a provision here in the rule that lays down that the voter may be put on oath or affirmation that he or she is incapacitated and cannot vote.  I saw voting through a companion for people who were so far gone that they could not make that affirmation or take that oath because they could not talk. The presiding officer asked them not once but up to ten times &ldquo;Whom do you want to vote for you?&rdquo;, and eventually the presiding officer got some sort of a hand wave from the invalid in the wheelchair indicating that invalid wanted the person who was pushing the wheelchair to vote for him.  That is going too far.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If somebody is incapacitated and being brought from his own house to the polling booth by a relative there is no abuse.  The abuse takes place when inmates or patients in an institution are voting.  I want to go on record as saying that the way these people are treated is a public disgrace, and it does not matter whether they are so treated by the Minister's party, by my party or by Deputy Kavanagh's party.  They are not being treated as human beings.  I know too of a person being &ldquo;retrieved&rdquo; from a companion on the basis that the voter admitted that he, the voter, was illiterate and the presiding officer <Col N="1260" /> then held that he could vote through a companion, but the vote was different from what it would have been voted if the companion had gone about his business properly.</P>
    <P>This matter needs to be tightened up very much in regard to institutions where the practices permitted are not in keeping with the dignity of the patients there.  We hear a lot of talk now about human dignity, but certainly what these people are subjected to&mdash;if they know they are subjected to it, and some of them do not&mdash;is not in keeping with human dignity.  The machinery in the Act is good enough to ensure that a lot of these companions can be excluded, but that leads to scenes in the polling booths and to rows between the various parties, and this is an unseemly exhibition.  I ask the Minister and the officers of his Department to have a look at this now when we are far away from elections and to see that the rules in institutions where old people are living as patients or inmates will be changed and that strict instructions will be given to those in charge of the institutions to see that abuses are not permitted.</P>
    <P>Some time ago polling stations were established in mental hospitals for a short time.  The result of that was so outrageous that the practice was stopped.  The Government of the day amended the regulations, and mental patients are now put on their home register.  There is a lot to be said for putting inmates or patients of institutions on their home register.  If they are able to go a mile or two miles to the local polling booth they are able to go home if they want to.  Of course there are unfortunates who have no home to go to, but if a person's home address is known I strongly recommend that that person should be put on the register of his or her home address.  If that person's relations want to bring him or her out to vote that should be allowed.  Such a person should act as that person's genuine and proper companion.  I feel strongly about this and I have as much experience of it as anybody else.  I put it on the record of the House that this is something which needs to be looked into.  The only way this can <Col N="1261" /> be accurately dealt with is to see that as many of those people as possible are taken off the registers of the institutions where they are and put on the registers of the addresses from where they came into the institutions. That will leave them in touch with their own people.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to refer to some points made by Deputy Fitzpatrick with regard to assisting an elector or using a companion.  I agree that we need to have a look in a general fashion at all the legislation dealing with elections.  As the law stands it means that a person or a companion can assist only two electors.  An agent of a candidate is not entitled to assist but I suppose all those things are not observed in accordance with the letter of the law.  We certainly should have a look at it and see if we can improve the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): I was rather surprised to hear that the presiding officer's clerk, the poll clerk, is excluded.  He is bound by secrecy and the garda is also bound by secrecy.  My experience of elections goes back to 1937.  I probably have taken part at elections one way or another since then and certainly the poll clerk is never excluded and neither is the garda excluded when an illiterate voter is voting.  That is the practice.  It is understandable because the poll clerk is there to assist the presiding officer.  He has a function. He reads out the elector's name and marks off the elector's name on the register.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another thing which is not generally understood and is not contained in the instructions which go out to presiding officers.  It is clear from this Schedule that anything a candidate can do through an agent he can do himself or do with the agent.  In other words, if a candidate has somebody to detect personation on his behalf that candidate can be there at the same time.  The candidate can be there, rightly or wrongly, when an illiterate voter is voting.  It is stated here in black and white that he can do anything <Col N="1263" /> which he can do through an agent.  That is not generally understood. It is not contained in the book of instructions which goes out to presiding officers presumably from the Custom House.  That matter should be clarified.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>The poll clerk has always been excluded under the law. Maybe it was not recognised that that was the law.  A garda should never have been permitted to remain inside. He has no jurisdiction in that respect at all other than to maintain law in the precincts of polling booths.  The garda should never have been permitted to stay inside.  Some presiding officers may have presumed that a garda had some right to be there but the garda was never entitled to be there.  There might be a case where the polling clerk was concerned, from what the Deputy said, but he was always excluded under the law.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>The illiterate voter voting towards the end of the day can cause quite a lot of confusion if he arrives at 8.40 p.m. and the poll closes at 9 p.m.  The presiding officer now can refuse to let him vote if he arrives within the last four hours.  That is excessive.  One hour would be reasonable but four hours is excessive.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): On page 45, Rule 91 deals with penalties and paragraph (2) provides:</P>
      <P>Where a person is guilty of an offence under Rule 78, 85 or 88 of this Schedule, such person shall be liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding £100 or, at the discretion of the court, to imprisonment for a period not exceeding three months or to both such fine and such imprisonment.</P>
      <P>That seems to be a smaller fine than the fine provided in Rule 91 (1) which reads:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1265" /> Where a person is guilty of an offence under this Act, other than an offence mentioned in paragraph (2) of this Rule, such person shall be liable,</P>
    <P>(a)  on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding £500 or, at the discretion of the court, to imprisonment for a period not exceeding six months or to both such fine and such imprisonment, or</P>
    <P>(b)  on conviction on indictment to a fine not exceeding £1,000 or, at the discretion of the court, to imprisonment for a period not exceeding two years or to both such fine and such imprisonment.</P>
    <P>Rule 85 provides for voting through a companion.  A breach of that Rule by virtue of Rule 91 is regarded as a lesser offence.  An offence by a companion acting in bad faith, or by a companion in whom the unfortunate illiterate or incapacitated voter places his trust, should be treated as a very serious offence and should be taken out of Rule 91 (2) and put into Rule 91 (1) where he would be treated as a person who had committed a serious offence. It seems to be regarding the offence by a companion voter as a small offence or a light offence.  I do not think that should be so.</P>
    <P>I admit the omission of the name and address of the printer and publisher from the documents, which is the offence under Rule 78, might, in normal circumstances, be regarded as a minor offence, and also the offence under Rule 88 which is the offence of handling a ballot paper which could be accidental or otherwise.  I suggest to the Minister that he should bring in an amendment on Report Stage to take an offence under Rule 85 out of Rule 91 (2) and put it into Rule 91 (1) where it would be treated as what it is, a mean, comtemptible, shabby offence.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that kind of offence would be mean.  For instance, a companion could be charged with assisting more than two people, with assisting a third person.  That offence could not really be regarded as a very serious one or not as serious, we will say, as marking the paper wrongly, in <Col N="1266" /> my opinion.  There can still be minor offences even by the companion.  I suppose we could consider putting it in the higher bracket as well.  We will have a look at it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Education if he has seen a report of a survey which showed that handicapped children attending ordinary day schools had a higher rate of achievement than those at special schools; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume that the Deputy's question refers to a paper read at a recent conference of the Psychological Society of Ireland about a survey carried out in Scotland of the reading and arithmetic attainments of some 100 physically handicapped children in that country.</P>
      <P>It is the established policy of my Department that as many physically handicapped children as possible should receive their education in ordinary day schools.  This policy has been greatly facilitated by the introduction of free school transport and by the home teaching scheme under which a number of physically handicapped children attending ordinary schools receive supplemental tuition to enable them to maintain the normal rate of progress.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It must be recognised, however, that many physically handicapped children find it impossible to attend ordinary schools because of the severity of their disability and their need for constant medical and para-medical treatment. The education of these children in many cases requires specialised skills and fairly sophisticated equipment. For such children educational facilities must continue to be provided in hospitals and in special schools which are associated with clinics.  Approximately 600 children are being catered for in this way&mdash;one-third of them in hospitals and the remainder in five special clinic/schools which cater for children on a day basis.  In these schools medical, para-medical and teaching staff work together as a team to prepare the child for an independent life.  If it is considered that a child's progress will be helped by transfer to an ordinary school every <Col N="1271" /> effort is made to arrange such transfer. One cannot but be appreciative of the standard of education provided in these schools and with the rate of achievement of the pupils, having regard to the limitations which their disabilities impose on them.</P>

      <P>It is not my intention to depart from the generally accepted procedures for the provision of such schools.  In the case of newly-developing areas the Department maintains close liaison with the local planning authority with regard to the provision of schools.  It has been decided in principle, for example, to sanction the provision of a multi-denominational school in Dalkey.  I think the Deputy refers to that.  There is no doubt that the Dalkey school project was organised as a result of what the Deputy described as an effective public relations campaign.  This does not mean, however, that a public relations campaign is essential to the establishment of such a school.  So far as the Department is concerned consideration will be given to any case for a national school where it is established that there is a demand and need for such a school.</P>

The employer in each case is the director of the school but the salary of a social worker is met out of the school budget which is financed by the Department.  The social worker's functions are in relation to the boys in residence in each school.  The Department of Justice will shortly be seconding a welfare officer full time to each of the three special schools for young offenders, the two just mentioned and also St. Joseph's in Clonmel.</P>

      <P>The Minister's supplementary answer spelt out that social workers were involved in the schools. Presumably the people who pay them are the people who call the tune.  Perhaps the Minister will have the whole thing clarified.  If social workers are working in schools in an educational context as a back-up service to an educational institution, their terms of reference should surely be decided by the educational masters of the schools and not by some outside body.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Education why a grant towards the cost of audio-visual teaching equipment for Scoil Fhiachna, Glengarriff, County Cork was not sanctioned for the year 1977.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Because it appeared that the provision for audio-visual equipment in the relevant sub-head of the Vote would not be sufficient to meet all applications for grants, it was not possible to approve requests for grants received after the 24th June, 1977.  It would now appear that some schools are not availing of approvals given for the purchase of equipment and it has, therefore, been found possible to approve the purchase of equipment by schools which applied between 24th and 30th June, 1977. The Deputy will be delighted to know that Scoil Fhiachna, Glengarriff, is one of these schools.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Education whether the Government exercise any function in relation to the method of selection or the criteria for appointment of the Maynooth College president whose salary and expenses are paid from public funds; and in what way the Government ensure accountability for expenditure in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the first part of the question is in the negative. I do not exercise any function.  The secular education grant to Maynooth College is provided for in the Vote for Higher Education by way of a grant-in-aid to An tÚdarás um Ard-Oideachas. Under paragraph 20 of the Schedule of the Higher Education Authority Act, 1971, the accounts of receipts and expenditure of An t-Údarás um Ard-Oideachas are audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General and the audited accounts together with the Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General are laid before each House of the Oireachtas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister happy with the position as outlined in his reply which states in effect that a major educational position paid from public funds need not necessarily relate in any way to academic criteria or to what might be called the popular will of staff and students in a college or an institution?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure what the Deputy is referring to.  All I know is that there is a grant-in-aid listed in the Book of Estimates, with informative footnotes saying &ldquo;for secular education&rdquo; in the case of Maynooth College and of Trinity College, Dublin.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said that the answer to the first part of the question is in the negative.  That refers to the Minister and the Government expressing an interest in the method of selection and the criteria for appointment. I assume the Minister in his <Col N="1284" /> answer said that he does not have a function with regard to the method of appointment.</P>

    <P>Appointments of staff are governed by section 17 of the National College of Art and Design Act.</P>
    <P>The grades of staff are related to the requirements of the college as determined from time to time.  The number of grades at present is as follows: teaching staff, 5; administrative staff, 3.</P>
    <P>It would not be in accordance with normal procedure to identify the staff or the institution by reference to categories of non-national and national.</P>
    <P>Grants to the College of Art and Design are made available by way of a Grant-in-Aid to the Higher Education Authority in accordance with the provisions of Article 12 of the Higher Education Act, 1971.</P>
    <P>I am informed that no full-time courses have been discontinued in the present academic year and that no suspension of any one such course is being contemplated.  Certain adjustments have been made in the arrangements for extra-mural part-time courses.

I did not know there was another overexpenditure. I will investigate the matter for the Deputy.  With reference to the method of appointment, I have outlined the responsibility for it in my answer.

    </Speaker>
    <P>Every vacancy for a wholetime position as an officer of the Board <Col N="1290" /> shall be advertised in the public press except in cases where the prior approval of the Minister for Education to the waiving of this requirement has been received.  This approval will be given only in special circumstances.</P>
    <P>Each applicant for wholetime appointment will be supplied with copies of Terms of Appointment and Conditions of Service, approved in accordance with the provisions of the Act.</P>
    <P>The Terms of Appointment shall set out the age limits and the qualifications and experience required, and also the requirements relating to provisions of birth certificates, medical reports and character references.</P>
    <P>Each appointment of a wholetime officer shall be subject to the submission by the appointee at his own expense of (a) satisfactory evidence of age, i.e. a certified extract from the public register of births, (b) a satisfactory medical report, from a doctor nominated by the board and on a form similar to the attached, (c) satisfactory testimonials of character from two responsible persons, other than relatives, personally known to him, (d) satisfactory evidence of the qualifications and experience required.</P>
    <P>Selection: The board will establish a selection committee, under section 21 of the Act, of at least three named members, not including student and academic staff members.  All applications for wholetime posts will be acknowledged and will be considered by this committee, assisted by such advisers as the committee may desire.  The committee assisted by advisers as it deems necessary, will conduct interviews and conduct or have conducted such tests as it considers desirable, and shall select the candidate it considers most suitable from among those who satisfy the terms of appointment.</P>
    <P>All appointments of wholetime officers shall be subject to the signing of approved conditions of service.</P>

      <P>In accordance with an agreement between school associations and my Department an application for the re-assessment of an examination result of a school candidate is accepted where the school authority certifies that the result is substantially at variance with what the school expected from the candidate.</P>
      <P>A fee of £5 per candidate per subject is charged in all cases.  This is returned, if, on re-assessment, the candidate's work is deemed to merit the award of a higher grade.</P>
      <P>The marking of the candidate's work is re-assessed by an examiner designated for the purpose.</P>
      <P>A total of 4,354 examination papers in single subjects were re-assessed in 1977.  The number of cases in which a higher grade was awarded as a result of re-assessment was about 4 per cent.</P>
      <P>I should like to thank the Deputy for putting down that question and I hope my reply gets publicity so that people will know what the procedure is.</P>

      <P>I reject <i>in toto</i> the suggestion in the first part of the supplementary.  We have been hearing for years now how important it was to take into account the assessment of the teacher, the person on the floor, so to speak, the person who has had close contact with the individual pupil.  It is when he considers the verdict of the public examination and is of the considered opinion, as a professional, that it is not what the pupil was known to him to be worth that the application goes to the Department for re-assessment.</P>
      <P>The second point the Deputy made is a good one.  As of now I am of the opinion that the person who assessed and marked in the first instance is not involved in the second marking.  But I will check that for the Deputy and let him know.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Education the number of remedial teachers in primary, secondary and vocational schools in 1972-73 and 1976-77; and the intentions of the Government in the future provision, including training, of such teachers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>At primary level, remedial education, in the first instance, is a matter for the child's class teacher.  In certain cases, however, where the problem of backwardness is particularly acute, a special additional teacher may be appointed to help with remedial work.  The number of such teachers in national schools in 1972-73 and 1976-77 was 160 and 335.  Five in-service courses are held each year for national teachers engaged on remedial work <Col N="1300" /> and this programme of training will be continued.</P>
      <P>My immediate priority is to reduce class sizes in national schools, with particular reference to the problems of disadvantaged areas.  Extra posts for remedial work elsewhere will be considered in the light of this overall priority.</P>
      <P>Remedial teachers are not a specific category in post-primary schools. Where a need is established for the provision of remedial education for students in those schools, such education is provided by teachers who, in addition to possessing the normal qualifications required of teachers in the schools, are deemed to be competent to undertake remedial education, usually as a result of attendance at special in-service courses organised by my Department.</P>
      <P>The following table shows the numbers of teachers who attended and satisfactorily completed such courses in the periods indicated, and the categories of post-primary schools in which they were serving:</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): Rule 92 provides that where a person is charged with personation on the allegation of a personation agent and that agent does not turn up to prove the offence, or if the offence is not substantiated by him, the Criminal Court hearing the charge has power to award the person charged damages up to £200.</P>
      <P>I am looking for information here. There was a similar provision in the Road Traffic Act, 1965.  Where a person was involved in a road traffic accident causing damage to a third party and where that person was charged with driving without insurance on the occasion in question and was convicted of driving without insurance, the Road Traffic Act empowered the Criminal Court hearing the charge of driving without insurance to award damages.  I believe that section was the subject of proceedings in the High Court, that its constitutionality was tested.  The High Court may have held that it was unconstitutional and that it was not enforceable.  I am not sure about that and perhaps the Minister would tell the House the position.  It is a highly technical matter and he may not be able to do so now; in that event perhaps he will look up the matter between now and Report Stage and tell us the position.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure of the position in that matter but I will seek the information.  With regard to the compensation provision in Rule 92, this is as it has been in previous legislation. The only change is that the <Col N="1314" /> amount has been raised from £20 to £200.  The figure was not reviewed for many years up to now.</P>

      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): With regard to page 46 of the Bill, the Director of Public Prosecutions is introduced into Rule 96.  I presume the Act that established the office of Director of Public Prosecutions entrusted him with this function?</P>

    <P>I note that provision is not made for giving a copy of the petition to the <Col N="1315" /> local returning officer.  It is very likely that a local returning officer would be heavily involved in the petition and a copy should be given to him.</P>

      <P Just="Center">SECOND SCHEDULE.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Second Schedule be the Second Schedule to the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): This is the Schedule that outlines and creates the four constituencies from which the 15 Members will be elected.  It is pleasant that this Schedule comes before the House as an agreed measure, as an arrangement of the constituencies which is acceptable to the Opposition as well as to the Government.  That is the case because the constituencies, as outlined in the Second Schedule, have been arranged by an independent commission consisting of Mr. Justice Brian Walsh of the Supreme Court, Mr. Tobin, the Clerk of the Seanad, and Mr. Maher, Secretary of the Department of the Environment.  These learned gentlemen have already been complimented on doing a very good job expeditiously.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There were a number of options open to the commission in regard to the manner in which they should arrange the constituencies.  It is true to say that a different commission might have arranged a different set of constituencies which might have been <Col N="1316" /> equally acceptable, efficient and fair. The constituencies as outlined in the Second Schedule are reasonable and fair and no reasonable person could raise an objection to them.</P>
    <P>The Bill is unique in constituency revision Bills or constituency creation Bills because the constituencies are agreed, and that is because they were arranged by a commission.  Since the foundation of the State these constituencies have been revised from time to time in accordance with the Constitution by the Minister for Local Government of the day.  They were never accepted by the Opposition, whether the Opposition was Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael or Labour.  There was always an angry prolonged controversial debate. This Bill is unique because that controversy and wrangling did not take place on this occasion.</P>
    <P>As I said before, most probably Fianna Fáil were the right party to introduce this method of revising constituencies because they had the privilege of devising and arranging constituencies over the years, with one solitary exception.  Now that new ground has been broken and this good precedent has been established, on behalf of my party I hope that will be taken as an established precedent and that on all future occasions when constituencies have to be revised they will be revised by an independent commission. When the report from that commission is presented to the Government, I hope it will be published and accepted by the Government of the day.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to join with Deputy Fitzpatrick in welcoming this Second Schedule which sets out the constituencies and has the full agreement of all parties.  The Labour Party made a submission to the independent commission.  I am glad to say that we found the results of their work more or less in line with our thinking in that submission. The inclusion of the recommendations of the commission without any alteration is a credit to the Government and we acknowledge this fact.  I hope this will be the forerunner of a new boundary commission which will be set up for the purpose of setting the new boundaries for Dáil elections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1317" /> It was a simpler job to deal with very large constituencies because the variations from one constituency to another would not create the personal and immediate problems of representation as happens when one changes boundaries for small constituencies in relation to Dáil elections.  In those circumstances there are outgoing Deputies who are well aware of the situation. In this case nobody has represented these constituencies before and therefore they are acceptable to all parties.</P>
    <P>My party are happy with the work done by the commission and wish to compliment them.  Once again I believe the east has been under-represented to the extent that the population has changed a great deal since the last census.  The Minister, I am sure, will be quick to point out that it is not his fault there has not been a census in the interim.  I want to remind him of the actual situation that Leinster and the county and city of Dublin have a much higher population than the figures used by the members of the commission.  I hope that when the Minister gets another opportunity up to date figures will be used in any new bounary changes for this type of election or in the local or general elections.</P>

    <Title>Social Welfare (Alteration of Rates of Contributions) Regulations, 1977: Motion.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Haughey) Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Haughey)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Haughey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That the Social Welfare (Alteration of Rates of Contributions) Regulations, 1977, proposed to be made by the Minister for Social Welfare and laid in draft, sanctioned by the Minister for Finance, before Dáil Éirann on the 7th day of November 1977, under subsection (9) of section 6 of the Social Welfare Act, 1952, be approved.</P>
      <P>The purpose of these regulations is to reduce by £1 a week the employee's element of the flat-rate social insurance contribution in the case of workers on weekly earnings under £50 as promised in the Government's election manifesto.  The £1 reduction will benefit all insured employees apart from permanent and pensionable employees in the public sector who are insured for limited benefits, mainly widows' and orphans' pensions and deserted wife's benefit, all of whose social insurance contributions are less than £1.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The £50 limit will be applied to earnings chargeable to income tax on which the existing 3 per cent pay-related <Col N="1319" /> social insurance contribution is based, in other words, gross earnings less superannuation contributions.</P>
    <P>The regulations provide that the £1 a week reduction will take effect from Monday, 2nd January, 1978, which is the beginning of the contribution year for men.  It is proposed to provide a new series of social insurance stamps at the reduced rates for the various classes of contributors involved and to place these on sale alongside the present rates which will continue to be payable in respect of persons earning £50 a week or more.</P>
    <P>An average of over 300,000 insured persons a week will benefit from the reduction which will be of particular value to young people commencing employment and to many women workers.  The measure is expected to cost some £13 million in a full year.</P>
    <P>The regulations which it is proposed to make under section 6 (9) of the Social Welfare Act, 1952, may not be made until a resolution approving them in draft form has been passed by each House of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>I recommend the draft regulations for the approval of Dáil Éireann.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister says, this is the implementation of one of the offers made by his party during the general election campaign.  However, I am disappointed that the Minister has not taken the opportunity, when amending the social welfare regulations, of abolishing social welfare contributions in respect of persons under 21 years of age.  This would have the effect of providing an incentive to employers to engage young people and it would go a long way towards improving the unemployment situation.  It might even have been considered that persons up to 25 years of age should have been excluded.  Unfortunately, the question of tackling unemployment has not been given any consideration in these amendments of the regulations and the reduction by £1 per week in the social welfare contribution in respect of persons earning less than £50 per week will not make any contribution towards improving the employment situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1320" /> We might note, too, that this reduction in the cost of the stamp will benefit the employee while there is no corresponding benefit to the employer.  In other words, there is no incentive to employers to create further employment. From that point of view I am disappointed that the Minister seized the opportunity that was presented to him on certain occassions.</P>
    <P>In addition, he might have used this opportunity of introducing a reduced social welfare contribution in respect of persons who are not working full time, five days a week.  Anyone who works more than two days a week is obliged to pay the full social welfare contribution while his employer, too, is obliged to pay his full share. Obviously, it would be much more attractive to employers who might not have a full five-day week job to offer to have the social welfare contribution reduced.  This would encourage such employers to take on workers for three or four days' or even for two days' work.  A change in this area would be of much interest to employees also because for anyone working perhaps only two-and-a-half days per week the full social welfare contribution is a heavy burden in terms of gross pay.  The application of some imagination in this regard could have led to the creation of additional employment.</P>
    <P>It surprises me that the Minister is able to give a figure of more than 300,000 insured persons as benefiting by virtue of this scheme.  I must admit that when I examined the order I had difficulty in trying to establish the number of people earning less than £50 per week.  My understanding was that the pay-related benefits are always based on the previous year's wages or salaries, for the simple reason that at any given time during the financial year the Government are not aware of how many people are earning less than £50 per week in that year and that the only accurate statistical information is in relation to the previous financial year after the adjustments have been made by the Revenue Commissioners on the completion of returns.  I would be inclined to question whether there are more than 300,000 people who are earning less than £50 per week.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1321" /> The other aspect of the matter is that the £50 per week refers to gross earnings with the sole exclusion of superannuation contributions.  The payment to local authority manual employees is usually taken as the yardstick for the general labourers rate.  I understand that council workmen earn about £1,800 per year or between £42 and £43 per week in flat pay.  From time to time many of these workers earn overtime pay or receive bonuses so that even in that category there will be many workmen employed by local authorities who will not benefit by virtue of this change in the regulations because their earnings would gross more than £50 per week.  Consequently, again I question the Minister's figure of 300,000 persons.</P>
    <P>Neither is it clear who will decide from week to week whether a person is earning less than £50.  A person operating on the PAYE system has his deductions amended by his employer as his earnings vary from week to week.  I wonder if a situation could arise where, for instance, a person might be paid £49.99p for 51 weeks of the year and who would have his employer stamp the social welfare card at the reduced rate and then in the fifty-second week the employee might be paid a bonus or some money based on a productivity deal of the order of, maybe, £1,000 so that it would be only apparently in respect of that last week that the employee would be obliged to pay the higher rate. The Minister may say that after some time and when the income tax returns are made adjustments would be made for that sort of situation, but I cannot foresee how it will be possible, as the scheme operates from week to week, to determine who, in any given week, has a gross income of less than £50.</P>
    <P>I am surprised, too, to note that the change in the regulations is being introduced as and from January.  Up to now any such change was always introduced either in March or in the autumn of the year concerned.  I wonder if the Minister is in a position to give an undertaking to the House that there will be no increase in Social Welfare contributions announced in the budget which also will be due in January, an <Col N="1322" /> increase that might have the effect of negating the reduction we are talking of here.  The question we must ask is, how illusory is this scheme and how much more illusory will it be if there are upward changes in the January budget in respect of social welfare contributions? Is the Minister in a position to guarantee to the people who he alleges will benefit from this change that the benefit will continue to the same degree after the budget of 1978?</P>
    <P>The other question that ought to be answered relates to the suggestion from the Minister that within a certain time a scheme will be introduced for the purpose of abolishing the social welfare stamps as we know them and, instead, of having the social welfare contributions paid through the income tax system.  I wonder if the Minister is in a position to give an undertaking that when that scheme is introduced the benefit for the people earning less than £50 per week will continue to apply.</P>
    <P>We heard yesterday that the Congress of Trade Unions have indicated that they are prepared to consider the idea of a new national wage agreement. This figure of £50 per week is very low in the context of present-day wages and I do not accept that there are 300,000 people earning less than this gross £50 per week in November, 1977.  No matter how many there are they should be given today an undertaking that if their income is brought above £50 per week by virtue of a national wage agreement, or any freely negotiated wage increase in the event of there not being a wage agreement, they could continue to be eligible for the reduced rate of payment.  Obviously any wage agreement will have the effect merely of keeping them in line with their fellow-workers.  The intention of this is to benefit lower paid people who, even after the effect of a wage agreement, will still be in the lowest category and they ought to benefit from this reduced payment.</P>
    <P>From that point of view I am a little disappointed that the areas I have outlined were not dealt with in the Minister's short statement.  I am more than disappointed that the opportunity was <Col N="1323" /> not taken to use a little imagination in a real attempt to stimulate employment when the regulations were being amended, by the abolition of social welfare contributions for young people under a certain age in the twenties. That would have created real employment opportunities.  In addition, the idea which I suggested to the House of introducing a reduced social welfare contribution in respect of both employer and employee for people who do not work a full 40-hour week again would have the effect of creating employment and giving a real stimulus to employers to take on extra people.  In any discussion that comes before this House at present we should be most concerned about the creation of new jobs and the provision of employment for young people and first-time employees. No attempt has been made to improve the lot of those people and from that point of view the amendment to the regulations is disappointing.</P>

      <P>There is no doubt that the proposal contained in the Minister's resolution is a novel approach, but I have personal doubts and my party also have doubts about the extent to which the Fianna Fáil Party in devising this promise gave any great thought to the expenditure of money of this nature.  There can have been only an estimate of the most vague kind, and I challenge the Minister to give a breakdown of the £13 million in a full year&mdash;presumably 1978.  It would be illuminating to get that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister and I have always worked together.  It would be interesting to get a breakdown of the 300,000 insured persons who allegedly will benefit from this reduction.  The first point I make in relation to the £50 is that presumably it was discussed in the Fianna Fáil Party around the beginning of 1977, and then, it became obvious that in <Col N="1324" /> about April or May, the figure of £50 was arrived at and it has rested there since May-June, 1977.  A look at the figures for earnings last December after the implementation of the 1976 interim national pay agreement, shows that the average earnings of an industrial worker in transportable goods industries&mdash;that is, over 111,000 workers &mdash;was £71.35 a week.  We tend in Ireland to regard our pay levels as being pretty low.  In fact they are not low.  The average fireman in Dublin has a basic pay substantially in excess of that of the fireman in London.  The fireman in London on his basic pay of about £47 per week would qualify for the Minister's scheme if that is merely his take-home pay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>That is if he went back to work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, indeed. There is no fireman in Dublin who would come under the £50 limit.  He would be at least £10 or £12 over that limit.  Virtually no male adult industrial worker in manufacturing industry will benefit from the £1 per week.</P>
      <P>Employers were complaining bitterly about the alleged penal imposition of social welfare contributions and the Fianna Fáil Party reacted and in the end said: &ldquo;We will take £1 a week off the employee's element of the flat rate of social insurance contribution.&rdquo; I predict that I will put down a Dáil question about this at the end of 1978, and I have a feeling that the number and scope of workers coming under this, the cost of its administration and the total cost is going to be substantially less than what the Minister is suggesting, unless, of course, in the meantime there is a major change in the £50 earning limit.  Therefore, I am making a point that there is hardly an employee who takes home less than £50 per week in gross pay.  We are talking of £55 and £60 per week and there are deductions from that.  The average bricklayer apprentice of 20 years of age would benefit but not anybody on the male side in many of the key sections of the economy such as the construction industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One group of workers who will certainly benefit from this measure <Col N="1325" /> are the adult female industrial workers. The best part of 40,000 women who are working in the manufacturing industry will benefit because last December their average earnings were only £36.29 per week.  One has to add on to that the first phase of the 1977 national wage agreement, the 2½ per cent plus £1 a week, with a minimum increase of £2 and a maximum increase of £4.13p.  Even if one adds all that on to the average earnings of many adult female industrial workers this will only bring their earnings up to £40 a week.  Those people will benefit. I would like to get a breakdown of the 300,000 people who are expected to benefit from this.</P>
    <P>I do not know if my remarks will have any influence on the national pay agreement.  We are all thankful that the unions have decided to enter into negotiations on a national pay agreement.  I am not so sure that this measure will have any influence on the negotiations.  Measures of this nature are regarded as election promises and people say: &ldquo;Thank you for your election promise.  Now let us get down and talk about what the increase in wages will be for 1978.&rdquo; When the former Minister for Finance, Deputy Ryan, came into the House and asked for approval for tax concessions and increased social welfare benefits, very little cognisance was taken of this in the negotiations which followed on a national pay agreement.  I would, if I had £13 million to spend on social welfare, feel there are better ways of handling an expenditure like this so that those in greatest need benefit.</P>
    <P>There is a large number of lower paid workers, many of whom are exploited. There seems to be a popular myth that every worker in the country is in a trade union.  We know that around 65 per cent are in organised trade unions but there are thousands of young workers earning far less than £50 a week.  There are thousands of women in the personal service industries, in restaurants, hotels, the forecourts of garages, the hairdressing trade and many other places, who are not organised and are earning far less than £50 a week.  I would hate to see any employer turning around and saying: <Col N="1326" />&ldquo;You are now getting £1 a week off your social welfare stamp and that is all you will get.&rdquo;  Many of those employers never heard of a national pay agreement.</P>
    <P>A man was offered a job recently on the basis that he would get £35 a week when the employer was getting £20 a week employment premium. The employee came to me and said that was all he was offered, that he was told to take it or leave it.  The employer was getting the benefit of the £20 a week employment premium and he was simply going to pay out another £15 bringing that man's wages to £35 a week.</P>
    <P>I hope this social welfare regulation is not exploited by people who will turn around and say, particularly to those who are not in trade union employment: &ldquo;You are getting £1 a week reduction, that is your wage increase for 1977-78.&rdquo;  I hope those employees will not be exploited in that manner.  We will take note of this measure, see how it works and see to what extent it meshes in with the overall reform of the social welfare contribution system which the Minister has promised, the pay-related system. At the end of 12 months we will have further questions down when the scheme is in operation.  It will be illuminating to see to what extent the promise contained in the manifesto had reality, to what extent it helped the lower paid in the community.  I believe most of us, pending that 12 months trial, would be wise to stay in a state of some suspended approval of the measure.</P>

      <P>When Deputy Boland was speaking he chided the Government on carrying out their election promises.  That may be a rare happening for other Governments but it is the policy of this Government to carry out each promise.  The Minister is to be congratulated on another step towards bringing social justice into the wage structure.  While some people <Col N="1327" /> may say that £1 off is not very much simple mathematics will show that it is £52 a year.  As far as I know the insurance period is 48 weeks in the year so there is a gain there.  Perhaps the Minister at some time in the future might try a sliding rate because the change will take place very rapidly in the wage structure.</P>
      <P>I look forward to this measure which will bring great benefit to many of the lower paid workers earning £50 a week.  It is quite true, as Deputy Desmond said, that some people are not even getting the benefit of national pay agreements.  I feel that it is a fault in our educational system that parents are inclined to focus their children's attention on taking up white-collar jobs.  Some of those white-collar employers are notorious for paying bad wages.  An industrial worker will almost certainly be in a trade union, of which we have 93.  There are many unorganised workers so the State must step in with a measure like this to give them a better income.</P>
      <P>Deputy Boland said that this did not bring any solace to an employer. It brings solace to an employee and also in an indirect way to the employer.  Any satisfied worker is an asset to any employer.  £1 a week, especially with the inflation rate falling, will be much more valuable than it was two years ago.  We will have more satisfied people working.  In the case of workers who are denied the benefits of national pay agreements by unscrupulous employers we find the State stepping in with a subvention to the lower paid workers.</P>
      <P>Deputy Boland and Deputy Desmond mentioned that there are not many workers earning less than £50 a week.  I believe there are thousands of agricultural workers who do not earn £50 a week.  I do not know what their rate is but I am quite sure it is not over £50 a week.  The people we want to help, the agricultural workers, will benefit from this and therefore, it is a worthwhile motion.  I take it the Opposition will not oppose it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We would all like to see a much bigger sum being given.  Since the <Col N="1328" /> Minister took office a few months ago as Minister for Health and Social Welfare, he has adopted a humane approach and, apart from its humanity, there is a very constructive approach to each measure bringing benefit to those most in need of it. Very few people need to benefit as badly as the workers benefiting under this motion, all 300,000 of them.</P>
    <P>Deputies may argue that is not a realistic total but, taking into account the agricultural workers and the lower paid commercial workers, it is easy to reach that total.  This extra money will bring a measure of happiness and wellbeing to families.  In a family the benefit may not be confined to just one worker.  Most workers in rural factories will benefit and a household with a father and two or three daughters working will gain substantially from this motion.</P>
    <P>The motion shows the Minister's dedication to making our social welfare code better.  We realise there is a lot more to be done, and we also realise our limitations.  We must keep on bringing in motions like this to ensure that we have the best possible society at the earliest possible time, always appreciating just how far we can go.  This motion and other measures introduced by the Government since the election are a credit to the Government.  We are carrying out our election promises.  The rates have gone.  The car tax has gone.  Now £1 is going off the social welfare insurance stamp.</P>

      <P>A sum of £1 in £50 would be an increase of 2 per cent for the recipient, and so on through the scale.  This is based on gross earnings, less superannuation contribution. In his wisdom the Minister has decided on this basic figure as the qualifying figure.  I can find no fault in this small scheme, as it is.  It is the precursor of greater things to come.</P>
      <P>The Opposition would be very foolish to oppose this motion.  The policy of this party has always been to achieve a system of social justice.

Indeed, it is a tribute to the sincerity of the Minister and the Government that they are slowly and surely getting through the items offered to the electorate which the electorate so resoundingly accepted in June.</P>
      <P>I accept the Minister's figure of 300,000 persons who will benefit.  That is a large percentage of our working force to benefit.  If we are to look at the amount that people earning less than £50 a week would have to spend on luxuries after meeting commitments, such as house purchase, rent, food, and so on, £1 represents a fair proportion of what they have left to spend.  If they have £5 less to spend it represents 20 per cent and £10 less represents 10 per cent so that for these people on less than £2,500 a year it is something worth while in the pay packet at the end of the week.  I congratulate the Minister on introducing this measure at this time.  There could have been a temptation to wait until the budget and for a further six months after that.</P>

      <P>First of all, I should like to congratulate the Minister on his appointment since this is the first time I have spoken on a motion introduced by him.  He states that 300,000 insured persons will benefit per week.  I would like him to reassure people who are a little doubtful as to when the proposed new scheme will come into operation&mdash;that is, the scheme designed to replace the social welfare stamp eventually.  It will probably be the same as the pay-related contribution scheme at the moment with a certain percentage taken per week from the wage packet.  That would be a very <Col N="1332" /> positive step.  I am in business myself and, as an accountant, I have found that employers experience great difficulty in operating the present system of stamping cards, deducting PAYE, pay-related benefit and so on.  The new scheme will be a step in the right direction. Some workers are perturbed in case this £1 reduction will be lost when the new scheme of percentage reductions comes in.  I should like to hear the Minister's views on that.</P>
      <P>I have received representations from the sub-postmasters union regarding their plight.  I am informed there are about 2,000 postmasters in the Twenty-six Counties and 1,000 earn less than £30 gross per week and 25 per cent earn less than £25 per week.  As they are paid on the basis of units, or something like that, the social welfare stamp represents a considerable number of units and as a result of a survey made by the union it has been found there would be a loss of 26 per cent&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I bow to your ruling, but I would like the Minister to allay these fears because a number of sub-post offices may possibly close down if the social welfare stamp ceases to exist.  Reducing the employee's contribution by £1 a week is a very worth-while reduction.  The Minister should look at the whole question of the social welfare stamp because it is becoming a disincentive to employing more people.  The stamp is a little over £7 and the employer has to pay in the ratio of about 2:1.  If we are to get more people back to work&mdash;that is the aim of this Government&mdash;the Minister should try to reduce still further the cost of the stamp to the employer.</P>

      <P>I must confess it is a bit puzzling to find the Opposition and particularly the Labour Party representive here refusing to afford an enthusiastic and wholehearted welcome to this measure.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Not alone am I satisfied but I will go a little further.  The 300,000 is a round figure.  There will actually be 303,800 persons who will benefit.  I will give the House the calculation in my own good time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mention has been made of the national pay agreement and I think it is the unanimous wish of both sides that a national pay agreement satisfactory to both sides will be forthcoming. Deputies must admit that this proposal of mine represents a positive and significant contribution to a favourable atmosphere in which such a pay agreement can emerge.  It is certainly helping to set a favourable scene in which these discussions can <Col N="1335" /> take place.  I shall put it no further than that at the moment.  The participants in the discussions can be certain, particularly on the trade union side, that this positive advantage will accrue to lower paid workers on 2nd January whether or which.</P>
    <P>Having said that, I should like just to deal with the question of the 300,000.  This is a firm calculation worked out by the statisticians, analysts and economists in the public service available to the Government in the public service by the best, sophisticated methods available.  I shall give the House the benefit of their calculations.  In the income tax year 1977-78 there will be approximately 700,000 persons paying pay-related social insurance contributions.  The distribution of that number can be calculated reasonably accurately as 43.4 per cent of those who have earnings under £2,500 a year, £50 a week. That gives me a figure of 303,800. The average contribution by those persons contributing to the social insurance fund who pay at least one contribution a year is £42.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Reference has been made, naturally, during the discussion to the longer term and to what is proposed in regard to the social insurance fund.  I have already announced that we intend to change over as soon as possible to a pay-related system which will also involve the abolition of the cards and the stamps.  It was the Government's wish to introduce that system as early as possible and my colleague, the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy in particular, was pressing very hard that the changeover be made as early as possible, because it is a sensible reform both on economic grounds and from the point of view of doing justice to the lower paid workers.  It means the less you earn the less you pay by way of insurance contribution; it would be pay-related.  Unfortunately, the experts in the public service from the different Departments concerned who were examining this matter reluctantly, in spite of very considerable pressure from me, have had to tell me that the earliest date on which this can be introduced is 1st April, 1979.  It must come in at the beginning of an income tax year for a number of complicated technical reasons and the preparations and necessary changes cannot be made by 1st April, 1978.  Accordingly, we are faced with the unavoidable delay of waiting until 1st April, 1979 to introduce the new system.  I know there will be a widespread welcome in the trade union movement for it and also in industry because&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>And from the sub-postmasters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;it will be a fairer system in that it will be pay-related. The insured person will pay a contribution directly related to his earnings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There will have to be a cut-off point, an upper limit beyond which the contribution will not continue to increase. The percentage rate of the pay-related contribution and the cut-off point have still to be settled: and until we get the full report from the interdepartmental <Col N="1339" /> working group studying the matter at present decisions on these points will not be taken.  So, any percentages which may be referred to can be totally disregarded at this stage.  Those are not fixed and will not be settled until the full report of the working group is made available to the Government and until all the implications are clearly understood.  The one thing that is fixed and definite is that the new system will be pay-related.  This will be to the benefit of the lower paid workers.</P>
    <P>Deputy McCreevy asked me how this related to the new changeover.  In so far as it is a positive move towards the reduction in the contribution of the lower paid worker it can be seen as a forerunner of the changeover.  It will eventually be subsumed into the new system but for the moment it represents a positive contribution to the lower paid worker on the industrial front.  Another advantage which we hope to secure from the changeover is that there will be only one deduction.  The new system will be administered by the Revenue Commissioners by means of their computers and only one deduction we hope will be made which will cover all the different social welfare contributions. The aim is to try to ensure that the whole system will be simplified.</P>
    <P>Deputies will readily realise the economies that that will give rise to in the administration of not just the social welfare side but throughout the whole wage paying system in the private sector.  Sub-postmasters and sub-postmistresses, I understand, are naturally apprehensive about a loss of earnings which this changeover will entail for them, and they hope to submit a case to the Government about this matter.  It will be at least 12 months before any positive action can be taken, so the sub-postmistresses and sub-postmasters will have plenty of time to submit their case and to have it considered by the Government. The Minister for Posts and Telegraphs will be primarily concerned and it is to him that the submissions should be made.  I am sure <Col N="1340" /> nobody would expect us to continue an old fashioned inefficient system which has many disadvantages if we can go over to much more modern efficient and much fairer system along the lines envisaged.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister say that the sub-postmasters will not suffer any loss of earnings?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I can only say at this stage that any submissions they make will be favourably and sympathetically considered.  As an important and valued section of the community who have given dedicated service down through the years, they are entitled to have their submissions sympathetically and favourably considered by the Government.  There will not be anything precipitate in this area.  If our target of 1st April, 1978, had been adhered to there would have been a lot more pressure on them. They know that the changeover cannot take place before the 1st April, 1979, and there is plenty of time for them to make their submissions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From the point of view of the sub-postmasters and sub-postmistresses there is one advantage in the changeover. The insurance stamps have constituted a danger to a number of offices.  They were a constant worry as they represented a fairly valuable removable commodity, and indeed there was a fair amount of robbery and pilfering of these stamps.  I know that many sub-postmasters and sub-postmistresses were apprehensive about their personal safety and the safety of their offices.  With the changeover that burden will be removed.  I readily recognise that this is not necessarily the most important aspect of the matter from their point of view.  However, I am recommending this proposal to the House.  I am surprised that any hint of reluctance to accept it should have been expressed from the Opposition benches because this is simply a straightforward measure giving positive real benefit to 300,000 of the lower paid workers in the community. It will become operative on the 2nd January and I hope that workers and their trade union representatives will recognise it as a positive <Col N="1341" /> gesture, a contribution from the Government towards creating a climate in which the very crucial and important pay negotiations can take place.</P>

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 121 and 122 together.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Western Health Board that at 30th September, 1977, there were 105 persons from County Galway, 89 from County Mayo and 42 from County Roscommon on the waiting list for hip operations.  The average waiting period for cases regarded as non-urgent is between two and three years but urgent cases are treated in a much shorter period, as circumstances require.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The number of people referred for hip replacement operations in recent years has greatly increased, due to <Col N="1305" /> the success of this type of surgery.  Hip operations for patients in the Western and North-Western Health Board areas are carried out at Merlin Park Regional Hospital.</P>
    <P>As regards orthopaedic services generally, a second orthopaedic theatre was provided at Merlin Park Hospital last year.  Four orthopaedic surgeons are employed at the hospital.</P>
    <P>Because of the need for extended orthopaedic services the building of a new 60-bed orthopaedic unit at Sligo General Hospital was approved some months ago.  Tenders for this project were invited a few weeks ago and work on the building is expected to commence within the next few months. The provision of this new 60-bed orthopaedic unit at Sligo will relieve some of the pressure on the unit at Merlin Park Hospital.</P>
    <P>Pending the building of this new unit the North Western Health Board intend to commence orthopaedic surgery at Manorhamilton County Hospital. Two orthopaedic surgeons are at present being recruited by the Health Board.</P>
