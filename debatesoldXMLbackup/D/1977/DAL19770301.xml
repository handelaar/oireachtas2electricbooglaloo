      <P>The question of possible closure was not raised by the Department but by the people speaking for the homes and it would be more appropriate if that question were addressed to the people who made the <Col N="426" /> statement.

    <Speaker pid="PearseWyse" hpid="Mr. Wyse Mr. Wyse">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wyse</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Education if, in view of the urgent need for additional moneys to finance youth and sporting organisations, he will consider giving substantial increases in the 1977 grants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Applications from youth organisations for grants-in-aid in 1977 are being examined in my Department at present and in that connection all relevant factors are being taken into consideration.</P>
      <P>I expect to be in a position to announce this year's grants within the next week.  The allocation of grants to the sports organisations was announced last week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PearseWyse" hpid="Mr. Wyse Mr. Wyse">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wyse</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Parliamentary Secretary aware that the grants made to sporting organisations this year are of no consequence in view of the impact inflation is having on their finances? Now that he is about to announce the grants for youth clubs and new development would the Parliamentary Secretary give serious consideration to awarding or making available substantial increases where youth development matters are concerned?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept that the grants in this area are of no account. The grants being made available in 1977 are an increase of 166 per cent over those made available in 1973. They are a 30 per cent increase, including the money being made available <Col N="427" /> for the tartan tracks, on those made available last year.  That is a very substantial and important factor in sports development in this country. The situation in relation to grants to youth organisations is under consideration and an announcement will be made on this matter in the very near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PearseWyse" hpid="Mr. Wyse Mr. Wyse">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wyse</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Parliamentary Secretary aware that the term used by sporting clubs throughout the country at the moment regarding the grants is &ldquo;hand-outs&rdquo;?  That to my mind is an indication that the grants are of no importance.  How does the Parliamentary Secretary determine the amount of grants to the various sporting bodies?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I have never heard the term &ldquo;hand-out&rdquo; used in the pejorative sense, certainly not in the sense that the Deputy has used.  I believe that what he has said is entirely wrong. This represents only part of the total work, which is designed to assist sporting organisations with coaching development and the organisation of competitions and various activities of that nature.  The Department receive regularly data from the grant-aided organisations and this detailed information is investigated.  It is only at the time of this concrete investigation that the money is obtained and allocations are made on an annual basis.  It is not a hand-out in the pejorative sense used by the Deputy.  These grants make a very essential contribution to the development of sport.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TimothyOConnor" hpid="Mr. O'Connor Mr. O'Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Education if he is aware that secondary <Col N="428" /> school children from the Lougher and Camp areas in south Kerry are harshly treated by CIE which tries to bring them to Tralee on the normal bus from Dingle and that if the bus is full leaving Annascaul the students are left to find their way to school and at most times have to return home; and if he will have the matter rectified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The areas in question are in the Dingle post-primary school catchment area.  So far as the schools transport scheme is concerned these children are entitled to free transport to Dingle or to free transport to Tralee from the catchment boundary at Camp Cross provided that spare accommodation is available on the bus serving the Tralee catchment area.  Any other provision is a matter solely for CIE in the context of its normal scheduled service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyOConnor" hpid="Mr. O'Connor Mr. O'Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>With this service it is quite a common occurrence on one day or sometimes two days a week that the children have no transport.  If it is CIE's business on behalf of the Department to bring those children to school surely the Department must see that they get the service.  This is serious for the children who are receiving secondary education.  They are not getting the full service at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>Children from Lougher and Camp are brought to Tralee.  They were provided with this service formerly and, if a bus was full, CIE sent out another bus.  On one occasion the bus arrived at 11 o'clock. Will the Parliamenary Secretary see that CIE do their job?</P>

      <P>There may be a misunderstanding between the Deputy and the Department on this matter.  Our information is that these areas are in <Col N="429" /> the Dingle catchment area.  As I understand it, CIE have an obligation to provide an adequate service.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I am open to correction if I am wrong in what I have said, but I understand the catchment boundary is in Tralee.  I am asking the Parliamentary Secretary to ensure adequate transport is provided for the children from these areas.</P>

    <Speaker pid="StephenCoughlan" hpid="Mr. Coughlan Mr. Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice the number of parking tickets issued by members of the Garda Síochána in Limerick city on Sunday, 13th February, 1977, from 8 a.m. to 1 p.m.; and the reason for the large scale of activity on that particular date.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Cooney) Patrick M. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Cooney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána that no &ldquo;fine-on-the-spot&rdquo; notices were issued by the Garda in Limerick city on Sunday, 13th February.  I understand, however, that on Sunday, 5th December, 1976, serious traffic obstruction was caused by illegal parking in the city and that 30 &ldquo;fine-on-the-spot&rdquo; notices were issued between 8 a.m. and 1 p.m. on that day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="StephenCoughlan" hpid="Mr. Coughlan Mr. Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>There may be a printing error in the question.  Will the Minister assure me and the House that the Commissioner on his visit to Limerick did not instruct the Garda to become active in issuing more parking tickets?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy that there is nothing whatever in that statement, or in that version concerning the Commissioner's visit.  I have been informed that serious traffic obstruction was caused by illegal parking in the city on that Sunday morning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="StephenCoughlan" hpid="Mr. Coughlan Mr. Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely there could not have been a traffic jam on a Sunday morning while people were at 8 o'clock Mass in the centre of the <Col N="430" /> city.  That has never been the case in Limerick.  I understand that when the Commissioner visited Limerick he specifically instructed the Garda that they were not issuing enough parking dockets.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>May I again deny that these summonses were issued as the result of any alleged instructions by the Commissioner?  I have no information on what was discussed by the Commissioner on his visit to Limerick.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Deputy was not paying attention but I have already said that &ldquo;fine-on-the-spot&rdquo; notices were issued because serious traffic obstruction was caused by illegal parking on that Sunday.  While Limerick Corporation implement the traffic warden schemes, the Garda still have power under the Road Traffic Acts to operate parking controls independently. If someone disputes a &ldquo;fine-on-the-spot&rdquo; he can contest the matter in court and perhaps Deputy Coughlan may come forward as a witness.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if he is aware that persons in rural areas wishing to avail themselves of the provisions of section 14 of the Family Home Protection Act, 1976, by transferring their family home to the joint names of husband and wife are being penalised by the Revenue Commissioners by the imposition of stamp duty on that portion of the transaction that relates to land; and if he will, if necessary, amend the legislation so that such transactions will be free of stamp duty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>May I first of all mention that the issue raised in the question is not confined to cases where the family home is associated with a farm.  It also arises in, for example, cases where the family home is part of a business premises.  The matter is complicated by the fact that, as I understand, some transfers of ownership of business premises, from one spouse to both spouses jointly, may in practice be made for business reasons unrelated to the objectives of the 1976 Act and in circumstances where there would be little argument for tax relief. I understand that this can be the case even though the premises may include the family home.  However, I accept that there is a point to be examined and I am bringing the matter to the notice of the Minister for Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister accept that as the Act operates at present it discriminates against the farming community?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not, because there are a large number of cases throughout the country where the family home and a business premises are incorporated and are, in fact, under the one roof.  I agree with the Deputy that there is a point to be examined but it is a matter for the Minister for Finance and I am asking him to do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 9 and 10 together.</P>
      <P>The number of break-ins reported to the Garda at Dundrum station during each of the years 1973 to 1976 was 97, 127, 129 and 238, respectively.  It is not the practice to give the number of detectives on duty at a particular station.  In any case it would be misleading to consider detective strength in relation to crime since many crimes are dealt with by uniformed members of the force.  At present, the total strength of Dundrum Garda station is 48.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiBrugha" hpid="Ruairí Brugha Ruairí Brugha">
      <NameTxt>Ruairí Brugha</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that during recent weeks the number of break-ins have been as high as ten to 15 per week and, with the present strength of the Garda, there is little hope that they will be investigated until several days after they occur?  There is no protection against burglaries as there is not sufficient personnel to get around until three or four days later to the scene of the crime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no information as to the incidence of break-ins as quoted by the Deputy for 1977 and I cannot comment on the validity or otherwise of the figures he mentioned. As regards Garda strength at Dundrum station, the Deputy may be interested to know that between 1973 and the end of February, 1977, the strength increased from 34 to 48, <Col N="433" /> something in excess of 40 per cent. As the Deputy is aware, an extra 500 gardaí are being recruited and I would hope that the bulk of them will be deployed in the Dublin area.</P>

      <P>If the figure is 30,000 then it does exceed the population of Waterford city but, again, I have no information as regards the number of gardaí in Waterford city.  However, the strength in Dundrum area has been increased to 48 which is an increase of 41 per cent in the last three years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ruairí Brugha</NameTxt>
      <P>Whatever the extent of the increase I can assure the Minister that it is not adequate for the number of break-ins that are taking place, certainly if judged by the first couple of weeks of this year.  Is the Minister aware that it is reaching the stage in this area that while in the normal course of events women used be afraid to go out at night in some parts of Dublin, here some women are afraid to stay at home because of the danger of break-ins?</P>

      <P>I am not so aware and frankly I would be disturbed to hear that to be the position.

    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1965" hpid="Mr. J. O'Leary Mr. J. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare whether he is aware of the hardship imposed by his Department on recipients of unemployment assistance who were self-employed prior to application, by not paying them at the full rate; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Corish) Brendan Corish">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Corish)</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the Unemployment Assistance Acts payment of unemployment assistance at the full rate is made only where the applicant is assessed as having no means.  Where there are means the rate of payment is reduced accordingly.  This arises from the nature of the assistance scheme under which payment is subject to an individual means assessment which applies to all applicants irrespective of the nature of their previous employment, if any.  I am not aware that it causes any particular hardship in the case of persons who were previously self-employed. Their means are assessed by a social welfare officer in accordance with the statutory provisions of the Acts referred to and the officer <Col N="438" /> is obliged to take into account the income which the person may reasonably expect to receive during the coming year.  All the relevant circumstances, including the level of earnings in the previous year where appropriate, are taken into account.  Allowances are made for expenses and by averaging the income over a period of a year, allowance is made for good and bad periods.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1965" hpid="Mr. J. O'Leary Mr. J. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that it is virtually impossible for persons who were self-employed and are now unemployed to get unemployment assistance at the maximum rate? It appears that in many instances the income during the past year is being taken into account and not the prospects for the year ahead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>The means are assessed by the social welfare officer and he does not necessarily have to depend on information in regard to earnings in the past year.  He is also obliged to take into account the earnings that would accrue to an applicant for unemployment assistance in the coming year.  If he considers that the income for the coming year is at a certain level it can then be determined whether the applicant can be paid unemployment assistance.  It is not entirely on his last year's earnings that the assessment is made.  His prospective earnings for the coming year also have to be taken into consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1965" hpid="Mr. J. O'Leary Mr. J. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that there is a difference in the calculations in the rate of unemployment assistance payable to self-employed as against employees who may be re-employed within the next month or two?  In other words, is the Minister aware that an employee is treated differently from a person who is self-employed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy says, this is so.  This system of assessment of means for the self-employed has obtained since 1933.  I will not say if that is a good argument for changing it but I have a certain amount of sympathy for the people the Deputy <Col N="439" /> has in mind.  I still believe this is a fair system.  As I said, possible means for the coming year must be taken into account before an assessment is made.</P>

Inquiries into this aspect of the case have been protracted but it is now hoped that they can be completed at an early date and a decision given in the matter.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the problem referred to by the Deputy.  The Limerick Board of Conservators are doing everything possible with the resources at their disposal to protect the salmon fisheries within its district.  I am having the position regarding the provision of an adequate fishery protection service examined in the context of the proposals at present under consideration for the restructuring of our inland fisheries administration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that a number of prosecutions by the fisheries board had to be dropped because they could not identify the trawlers in the estuary?  They need a protection vessel.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am so aware.  The position is that the Limerick Board of Conservators are doing their best. There is a suggestion that suitable seagoing patrol vessels for offshore protection of the salmon stocks should be acquired.  A figure of between £10,000 to £15,000 has been quoted as being required for this purpose.  It should, however, be possible for the protection staff of the various boards to inspect the salmon at the point of landing rather than at sea.  Admittedly, if fishing for salmon is taking place in the Shannon Estuary, it is possible that the catch is being landed outside the Limerick district.  We are having this matter investigated and we hope to improve the position as soon as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>and <b>Mr. Carter</b> asked the Minister for Local Government if he is aware of the pollution of Lough Ennell, County Westmeath; and if he will make a statement on the steps he proposes taking to rectify the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have an opportunity of commenting on the question of pollution in Lough Ennell and the steps being taken to deal with the problem.  In a general survey of local authority sewerage systems carried out in 1971 it became evident that sewage from Mullingar was a source of pollution of the lake. Shortly after I became Minister I sanctioned, in May, 1973, the provision by Westmeath County Council of a new treatment works for the town sewage.  I am glad to say that the works, which came into operation in February, 1975, and which cost <Col N="443" /> £200,000, are working satisfactorily and have eliminated this source of pollution in so far as the discharge of organic matter is concerned.  I might mention that the scheme was designed to facilitate the subsequent installation of additional treatment for the removal of phosphate as required.</P>
      <P>With regard to the question of eutrophication and whether or not additional treatment should be provided for the removal of phosphate, the county council were advised in October, 1973 by An Foras Forbartha that it would be unwise on the basis of limited data and incomplete assessment of all the factors involved to provide such additional treatment without first assessing the effect of the new treatment works.  The county council accordingly commissioned An Foras to continue their detailed studies of lake conditions.  I should mention that An Foras in their Preliminary Survey of Irish Lakes, which was published in May, 1975, indicated that the lake was excessively enriched.</P>
      <P>I am advised that the problem of eutrophication is a very complex one and that there are very real problems in deciding whether provision of additional treatment for removal of phosphate would have any beneficial results on the lake waters in any particular case.  The county council have, therefore, very good reason to await the outcome of the further detailed studies by An Foras before coming to a conclusion in the matter.  It is hoped that these studies, the results of which are expected to be available very shortly, will give sufficient facts, including information on the amount of phosphate coming into the lake both from the sewerage works and from other sources and the extent to which the new treatment works is already removing phosphate, to enable the county council to make an informed decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Should Westmeath County Council decide on the basis of An Foras studies and having regard also to the high running costs of tertiary treatment, that additional treatment for removal of phosphate should be provided at the Mullingar sewerage works I would be <Col N="444" /> prepared to approve of such a proposal subject to the usual clearance of technical aspects.</P>

      <P>I am aware of such a report but I am also aware that An Foras Forbartha have been given a job which they are doing and for which they were set up.  It would be foolish to proceed with any further improvements until An Foras Forbartha get the information which they are eliciting and until it is made available to Westmeath County Council. The county council will then make a decision on the matter.

      <P>Newspaper publicity was given to the fact that they did not propose to do any further work, that they had suspended work on the lake. I would not be prepared to comment on this matter too deeply because, while they have done this, it is true that only in the last few years has anything been done to try to help.  It is rather strange that they should now decide to pull out when an effort is being made to clear the matter.  They have asked on a number of occasions that we should put tertiary treatment <Col N="445" /> in there.  We are not prepared to agree to this until Westmeath County Council&mdash;we must be satisfied that they will do the job which it is suggested they should do&mdash;ask us to do so.  That is fair enough.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government if he will consider preparing for the guidance of sanitary authorities a comprehensive management policy for the disposal of waste, having regard to the increase in the quantity of waste and the wide range of hazardous materials it now contains; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a matter for each sanitary authority to decide on the provision to be made for waste collection and disposal in their area.  I have already given considerable advice on these matters.  I have asked the local authorities to review their waste operations and to see that they are operated adequately and efficiently from both the economic and environmental viewpoints.  I have also asked that there should be a survey of hazardous wastes in each area; that measures should be taken to help the recycling of metal scrap and waste oils and that planning should be undertaken for waste disposal operations in the years 1977 to 1979.  In addition, my Department, in co-operation with An Foras Forbartha, organised a conference last <Col N="447" /> November to help local authority personnel in their approach to these and other waste problems, including the requirements of a number of EEC directives relating to waste.  Further advice is being given locally by inspectors from my Department.</P>
      <P>As I have previously indicated, a general examination of the provisions relating to local authority waste operations has been undertaken in my Department with a view to remedying any statutory or other deficiencies that may be identified.</P>
      <P>In the meantime I have asked An Foras Forbartha to conduct a study as to whether or how local authorities might contribute further, on an economic basis to the recovery of useful materials from waste.  I might mention also that my Department are represented on a new committee on waste management which has been set up by the EEC Commission to advise on development of policy in this area including possibilities for waste reduction and re-use as well as disposal. My Department, and other Departments concerned, will have the benefit of that work as it proceeds.</P>

      <P>Is there a follow-up procedure in the Minister's Department to ensure that the local authorities are doing something in this important field?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>There is.  Circular ENV 2/74 was issued on the 9th of January, 1974; circular ENV 6/75 was issued on the 14th of March, 1975, and circular ENV 7/75 was issued on 7th April, 1975.  At the present time officials from my Department are visiting local authorities to ensure that there is a proper system of waste disposal. I agree with Deputy O'Leary that there appears to the layman to be a better way of waste disposal than what we are operating at the present time.  It does not appear reasonable to me&mdash;I am speaking as a layman&mdash; that metals which are now so costly should be dumped in with general waste.  I am informed that as of now, except it is hand-picked before it is put into the waste disposal vehicle, <Col N="448" /> there is no way in which it could be segregated at a reasonable cost afterwards. The result is that there is a lot of waste material which is potentially very useful and expensive being lost to industry in the country, because so far no reasonable method has been evolved.  I have again and again asked local authorities to do what they can about trying to reduce both the volume and the type of waste.  One of the biggest volume-creating things is paper.  It is amazing all the people who will fill up their bins with newspapers and then wonder why they have not got room for the ordinary household refuse.  I hope that An Foras Forbartha and particularly the EEC Committee who are investigating it will come up with a solution.  As of now we are doing the best that is possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>Agricultural co-operation in this country, which has been promoted and developed over a very long period, is now well established and, apart from the dairying industry with which it has been predominately associated, covers such diverse activities as meat processing, livestock marketing, artificial insemination, pig production, horticultural production and the sale of agricultural requisites. Today co-operatives control a very substantial proportion of agricultural business, both processing and marketing, and are extending their interests with the encouragement of my Department and the assistance of the Irish Agricultural Organisation Society, which is in receipt of an annual grant from the State.  Co-operative enterprises qualify for aids from the Industrial Development Authority and FEOGA for the improvement and development of agricultural processing and marketing.  Grants totalling £5.3 million were allocated to co-operatives from these sources in 1975.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no evidence as to the extent to which the communal grazing of land, including Land Commission lettings, may be contributing to the spread of brucellosis and disease generally.  The Land Commission and the district veterinary offices of my Department are however very concerned to ensure that no spread of disease is likely to occur as a result of any lettings made to farmers.  With a view to minimising the disease risk there is an arrangement in operation in some counties whereby only herdowners who can produce to the Land Commission a certificate from the district veterinary offices that their herds are clear of brucellosis will be allowed to rent land from the Land Commission.  I intend to ask the Land Commission to consider introducing this arrangement into the remaining counties comprising the brucellosis free and clearance areas.  The Department would also like to restrict communal grazing of land, including Land Commission lettings, to the grazing of bullocks as an added precaution against the spread of brucellosis but before this can be introduced the legal position must be examined.  Arrangements for this examination are being put in hands.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>The recommendation of the court accepted that the authorities concerned could plead inability to pay and it was on that basis that the payment was not made.  The claim fell into the category of special pay increases over and above standard increases and, as the Deputy is aware, that is a very complex area.  There are many views on the equity or otherwise of such claims.  The matter has now been satisfactorily settled, the recommendation accepted and payment will be made to those concerned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>This arises on both sections.  It relates to the question of indemnifying directors of Bula under article 11.  I raised the matter again, admittedly not as fully as I had done on section 2 before discussion on that section was postponed.  Section 4 refers to shares being transferred by the Minister into the name of a nominee, and when we inquired the reason we were told it might be necessary for the directors appointed by the Minister under the secret agreement of 12th December, 1975, to hold a share. The discussion then went on to consider the position of those and other directors in the company in relation to article 11 of the articles of association which gives directors indemnity for any difficulty they might be in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the time, the Minister said they did not give the guarantee in their capacity as directors but as shareholders. I should have adverted on the last day, but unfortunately due to the complications of the matter I did not, to the fact that the four directors who gave the guarantee are not shareholders. They are directors only.  The only two registered shareholders of Bula are those of Frolic Investments, now known as Bula Holdings, an unlimited private company who are registered in respect of 80 per cent, and Patrick Wright, since deceased, who was registered in respect of 20 per cent.  Therefore, the Minister's contention on the last day that Roche senior and Roche junior and Messrs.  Wymes and Wood gave the guarantee under the secret agreement in their capacity of shareholders is not right.  It was in their capacity as directors, because <Col N="472" /> they are not in fact shareholders.  Bula Holdings, formerly Frolic Investments, are the only shareholders other than the late Mr. Wright.</P>
    <P>I referred the House to the company's office file and what I have been saying is what is set out in that file at the latest state in which it is available for inspection by the public.  I should like the Minister to deal with that point.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I am a little confused in regard to procedure.  I thought that point came up and was discussed on section 2 and that it was dealt with under that section and, in my wish to avoid unnecessary repetition, I do not think we should have this matter discussed twice round.  It would not be a reasonable way to proceed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I would point out to the Minister, as has already been pointed out by Deputy O'Malley, that this matter was, in fact, discussed on section 4 and not unreasonably, having regard to the provisions of section 4 which envisage the transfer of shares by the Minister to a nominee.  The only obvious reason why this procedure might be necessary at all would be if the holding of a share or shares were a necessary qualification to be a director and if the Minister wished to appoint certain people as his nominee directors and if in order to do so, to qualify them, they would have to hold a share or shares, then the provisions of section 4 would apply.  This clearly raises the issue as to the position of directors in this company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley has pointed out that under article 11 of the articles of association of the company a director of the company who gives a guarantee is indemnified by the company against liability on foot of that guarantee.  As a result it would appear that if the Minister sought to enforce a guarantee which he has, apparently, under this secret agreement&mdash;in other words, if he were dissatisfied with the actions of the company or the inaction of the company in developing the mine&mdash;he would have power under this agreement, on foot of a guarantee apparently contained in it, to enforce that guarantee against the parties to <Col N="473" /> the agreement personally.  Deputy O'Malley was pointing out that under article 11 this would mean, in effect, that the Minister was trying to enforce a guarantee in respect of which he was 49 per cent responsible and this was on the face of it a ludicrous position. The Minister replied to that by saying that the people concerned had not given their guarantee as directors which would entitle them to this indemnity but rather as shareholders. Deputy O'Malley pointed out that this argument is not correct because these people are not shareholders but they are directors.  It would appear, therefore, in the absence of any other explanation from the Minister that the position is as originally set out by Deputy O'Malley, that is, that such guarantee as the Minister has received in practice cannot be enforced or would be enforced by the Minister against himself, at least to the extent of 49 per cent of whatever liability arises on the guarantee.  That is a ludicrous position.  It is such that there is an onus on the Minister now to explain to the House why the position is not as we have outlined it, if in fact it is not, or alternatively if the position is as we have outlined it, to acknowledge that it is so and let us consider what can be done about it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not trying to be procedurally obstructive but I must insist that this was in fact a section 2 discussion and I will be happy to come to it when we get to section 2, but I do not wish to have this discussion perpetuated needlessly by discussing things under a number of sections.  It was raised on section 2 and presumably it was in order on section 2 and I submit that that is where it should be taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>It arises equally relevantly on this section and on section 2 and there is no question of its prolonging the discussion because if the discussion is not held on this section then it will be held when we go back to section 2.  But if the Minister wishes to withhold the information until such time as we get back to section 2 that is his affair and I will not make an issue of it.  I would have thought that it would be better if we <Col N="474" /> clarified the situation in regard to these matters at an early time because I am afraid that the Minister made a number of statements the last day which were wrong, on the face of it. These matters should be clarified. First of all he said he did not know anything about it but he went on afterwards to seek to make some statements which apparently do not stand up in the circumstances.  However, I will not raise any objection.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">SECTION 5.</P>

      <P>Having regard to the amendment accepted earlier by the Minister which refers to not less than 49 per cent of the issued share capital, I think it is amendment No. 3, could the Minister say whether in his view section 5 authorises the acquisition by him or by the State of more than 49 per cent of the shares or whether it is his view that the wording of the section in conjunction with the wording of the agreement confines the State share to 49 per cent?</P>

      <P>How does the Minister reconcile that reading of the Bill with the provision in the secret agreement of the 12th December, 1975, whereby if control of the 41 per cent interest that will exist after the Minister's purchase and after the gift to him of that 41 per cent changes significantly out of its present hands, the Minister is then entitled to acquire a further 2 per cent in order that he will retain or obtain for the first time control of the company?  If the Minister's understanding of the effect of this Bill is to allow him to acquire not more than 49 per cent, does that mean that, if this situation arises, he does under the secret agreement become entitled to buy another 2 per cent out of the 41 per cent and does that mean we would then need further legislation to enable him to do that or is it his intention not to take up that potential option of the further 2 per cent?</P>

      <P>I do not think it is correct for the Minister to say that the contents as outlined by me of some of the provisions, and we have only come to some of them so far, are assumed or hypothetical.  We had a pretty long discussion earlier on the fact that the <Col N="476" /> shares in the company are not <i>pari passu</i> in the sense that they do not have equal voting rights.  The Minister's block of 24 plus 25 is actually in a weaker position than the Bula holdings block of 41 and the Bula holdings block of 41 can still out-vote the Minister plus the Wright share of 10 per cent in certain circumstances.  I think we have established that, even if we have only established it by default, and nobody has so far said it is wrong. The Minister agreed at some stage in the debate that the shares did not carry equal voting rights.  In those circumstances, is the Minister aware of the difficulty he is creating for himself or for any successor of his who might have an opportunity of buying a majority control of this company but who will be excluded or prevented from doing so by the interpretation the Minister has given the Bill, namely, that it prevents the acquisition of more than 49 per cent of the shares?</P>

      <P>The Deputy is failing to take into account the provisions of section 2.  Section 2 provides: &ldquo;The Minister may acquire shares of the Company in accordance with the Agreement....&rdquo; Whatever can be done in accordance with the agreement will be authorised by law and the only possible limitation that would be placed on what the Minister can do seems to me to be that the Bill sets out an aggregate figure and, if the aggregate is exceeded, then authority from the Dáil to spend more would be required, if that is what is required by the agreement, but I certainly think the terms of the agreement can be carried out by this Bill when it is enacted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>He refers to the agreement and says the Minister can do certain things in accordance with the agreement and he conveniently overlooks the fact that we are still, even at <Col N="477" /> this stage of the debate, essentially debating the provisions of this agreement and we have never seen it, which causes the debate to be prolonged unnecessarily and, indeed, to be carried on in a quite extraordinary atmosphere in that the Attorney General can stand up here and say the Minister can do a, b and c provided the agreement authorises him to do a, b and c.  A few minutes ago the Minister told us he could not acquire more than 49 per cent and, by implication at least, the Attorney General now seems to be saying the Minister could acquire more than 49 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are being put in an impossible position.  There appear to be two points of view.  We are referred back by the Attorney General to the phrase in section 2 &ldquo;in accordance with the Agreement&rdquo; and that, of course, is our objection to this whole procedure. It is no good the Attorney General referring us to the agreement if he will not show it to us.  How can we know what the Minister can or cannot do if we do not see the agreement?  Never before, as we have shown repeatedly, has a Bill which refers six times to an agreement not had that agreement published in conjunction with it.  It is not enough for the Attorney General to say the Minister can do whatever the agreement allows him to do if he will not publish the agreement.  I pointed out one of the provisions in the agreement with which the Minister on his own say this afternoon could not comply.  He says he cannot buy buy more than 49 per cent.  There is provision that in certain circumstances he can acquire 51 per cent.  I think the circumstances are unlikely but nonetheless they could arise.  The Minister has told us what he cannot do and the Attorney General says the Minister can do whatever the agreement allows him to do.  It is all very frustrating, to say the least of it, and without precedent to try to legislate in these circumstances. How can this House legislate properly when we are told by the Attorney General that the Minister can do whatever the agreement allows him to do and we do not know officially what is in the agreement? I have given one provision in <Col N="478" /> the agreement which would contravene the Minister's statement to the extent that it would prevent him acquiring the 51 per cent he could in certain circumstances acquire under the agreement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like a little clarification.  I do not know whether the Attorney General was here when I referred to the terms of this section&mdash; in fact, I read out the section&mdash;and I adverted to the amendments which had already been made and asked the Minister did he, as the Bill now stood, understand it to mean that the State was restricted to an amount not exceeding 49 per cent as its share and the Minister said that was his understanding of the position.  There was a restriction to 49 per cent in the amount of shares which could be acquired by the State.  That is quite clear.  What is not clear, arising out of what the Attorney General said, is whether the Attorney General agrees with that interpretation or whether he is saying that, in certain circumstances, if the agreement so provides, more than 49 per cent can be acquired.  Could we get some clarification of this?  Which is the official view of the meaning of this section and of the rest of the Bill?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DeclanCostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>The question is based on a paraphrase of what the Minister said and I think the record will make clear what, in fact, the Minister said. I was dealing with the query raised by Deputy Colley initially as to whether it is necessary to come back to the Dáil at any time.  I pointed out that, whatever the agreement permitted to be done, whatever contractual arrangement was entered into by the Minister was going to be sanctioned by this Bill under which he is given power to do certain things.  One would want to be living in a very restricted world not to know that the Opposition have taken objection to the fact that the agreement had not been made public. I am well aware of this.  The point I was making was that in relation to coming back to the Dáil whatever is in the agreement can be carried out by the Minister.  The Opposition object to the <Col N="479" /> fact that they do not know.  All I am saying in relation to coming back to the Dáil is that if there are powers in the agreement which the Minister wants to carry out he can do so as a result of this legislation.  The only circumstances at the moment in which I would see any necessity for further intervention by the Dáil would be if the aggregate sum referred to in section 2 is exceeded.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid the position has not been clarified by the Attorney General's remarks.  I put a very specific question to the Minister.  I referred to the terms of the Bill as amended and to the fact that this section contains a specific reference to the agreement.  The section refers to &ldquo;... the acquisition under this Act and pursuant to the agreement of shares...&rdquo;.  In response to my question the Minister quite unequivocally said that the position as he understood it was that it would not be open to the State to acquire more than 49 per cent of the shares of this company under the Bill as drafted.  Of course this includes the agreement.</P>
      <P>The Attorney General appeared to be saying something different.  He said if the agreement provides for the acquisition of more than 49 per cent then the Bill as drafted allows for that.  I am inclined to agree with the Attorney General's view of the situation but I specifically put this question to the Minister.  The Minister answered it quite specifically but it was a different answer from that given by the Attorney General.  I suggest that if we cannot see the agreement at least we are entitled to get a specific reply to a specific question.</P>
      <P>In the light of the discussion that has taken place, I should like once again to put that specific question. It is: Having regard to the terms of the Bill as amended so far, and those terms include the references to the agreement, and having regard to those provisions, is the State restricted to 49 per cent of the shares of this company in so far as it may acquire shares?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>The amplification given by the Attorney General is <Col N="480" /> entirely in accord with my understanding of the situation.  I could add we are restricted simply because of the money provision.  The sum provided for in the Bill is a restriction.  The Attorney General and myself are not in disagreement about that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume the Minister appreciates I raised this question specifically on this section which refers to the advancement of money out of the Central Fund for the acquisition of the shares.  It is not accidental that I raised the question on this section. The Minister now appears to be saying that because of the restriction on the money being made available there is a restriction to 49 per cent of the shares. If I understand the Minister correctly that is the argument he is making.</P>
      <P>I understand that argument in so far as it goes but I suggest it does not square with what the Attorney General has said.  Under the terms of this Bill either the State's share is restricted to not more than 49 per cent of the shares or it is not.  That is straightforward.  The State is so restricted or it is not.  Is the Minister saying the State is restricted to 49 per cent or that it is not restricted?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">

      <P>Obviously there is no point in pursuing this matter.  The Minister was asked a specific question by Deputy Colley and he gave an answer.  In fact, my recollection is that he repeated it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Colley wanted it made very clear and he put it to the Minister again.  The Minister actually repeated what he said.  He said: &ldquo;My understanding of the effect of this Bill is that it does not allow the State to acquire more than 49 per cent of the shares in this company&rdquo;. That is what the record will show.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Attorney General then came along and Deputy Colley raised further matters arising out of that point.  The Attorney General then intervened to reply to Deputy Colley and he gave what was essentially a different answer to what the Minister had given.  Then the Minister and the Attorney General found themselves in the position that they had given different answers to the same question.  Deputy Colley and I pressed them to reconcile their answers.  The Minister's method of reconciling them was to say there was no conflict; he said he was now saying the same as the Attorney General.  He may now be saying <Col N="482" /> the same thing as the Attorney General but he did not start off by doing this.</P>
    <P>This is a demonstration of how incredible this debate has become.  On the last day when we discussed this Bill we had to do something I had never heard of in the House before and I have not met anybody else who had heard of it either.  The key section, the kernel of this Bill, had to be put back to another day so that the Minister and his advisers might get some information about various fundamental matters that were raised.</P>
    <P>Today we have a very unusual situation in this House where, in order to help him, the Minister has brought along the Attorney General to answer some of the questions.  I have never seen or heard of an Attorney General coming to this House to answer questions for a Minister and it is unusual to say the least.  I am not objecting to it.  It is commendable that the Attorney General would participate in debates in this House even though it has not been his practice to do so during the past four years.  It is commendable that he is doing so now but it is also significant that he had to do so on this debate.</P>
    <P>The best thing to do with the point at issue is simply to pass from it.  Perhaps we will put down an amendment on Report Stage that will enable this matter to be clarified once and for all.  It will enable the Minister and the Attorney General to have a conference outside the House at which they could reconcile their views on when the House could be given some information that would enable it to judge whether or not this provision should be passed.</P>
    <P>I should like to draw the attention of the House to the words &ldquo;and pursuant to the Agreement&rdquo;.  Having accepted the deletion of the words &ldquo;and subject to the Agreement&rdquo; in subsection 3, to be consistent the Minister should agree to delete the words &ldquo;and pursuant to the Agreement?&rdquo; in this section.  The presence of these words raises the question of the absence of the agreement and the secret nature of it.  The House might be willing in its wisdom or otherwise to vote moneys from time to time for the acquisition of shares but the House <Col N="483" /> might be quite unwilling, if it saw the agreement, to allow moneys to be advanced out of the Central Fund for the purchase of shares.  It seems logical that if the words &ldquo;and subject to the Agreement&rdquo; are deleted the words &ldquo;and pursuant to the Agreement&rdquo; might be deleted from this section.  I have not put down an amendment to this effect because I was not sure that the Minister was going to accept my earlier amendment which he did. Having done so, it would seem logical to do it now by agreement, or I could put down a further amendment on Report Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DeclanCostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>The two sections are different.  Section 4 (3) deals with what the Minister for Finance can do as a result of this subsection.  It was not considered necessary to leave in the words &ldquo;and subject to the Agreement&rdquo; because without those words the section would permit the Minister to do what is necessary.  Section 5 deals with a separate matter.  In order to give the required legal power to the Minister these words are necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Presumably the Attorney General appreciates that the words &ldquo;and pursuant to the Agreement&rdquo; would not appear to be necessary unless the agreement provides for the acquisition in certain circumstances of more than 49 per cent of the shares to which we have been referring.  If one assumes that the agreement does not provide for that, why should these words be necessary?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I will give the Minister one reason why it should be questioned, that is, that we are here dealing with an agreement the contents of which we do not know.  This is just another example of what Deputy O'Malley said a few moments ago.  If the agreement were before us, whether we approved of it or not, almost certainly this debate would be quicker than it is at the moment.  This provision says: &ldquo;all dividends and other moneys received by the Minister for Finance&rdquo;.  An obvious question that arises is whether &ldquo;other moneys&rdquo;, that is, money other than dividends, are envisaged under the agreement? That is not an unreasonable question, but the Minister, if he reverts to the kind of thing he has said on some occasions, it likely to say: &ldquo;I am not going to disclose what is in the agreement&rdquo;. Of course, as I have said <Col N="486" /> many times, he should have disclosed what is in the agreement, but I do not intend to go back over that.  What I am saying is that in the circumstances where this phrase is used &ldquo;and other moneys&rdquo;, we are at least entitled to ask the Minister whether that is to have whatever its normal meaning is or whether it is to have a meaning which has to be interpreted in the light of the terms of the agreement we have not seen.  Is there anything in the agreement which could be covered by this phrase &ldquo;other moneys&rdquo;?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

      <P>It is a little more than a comment.  Either that is correct or it is not.  If it is correct, then the Minister is entitled to say this phrase &ldquo;other moneys&rdquo; simply has the normal, traditional meaning.  However, if the agreement provides for the payment of any sums other than dividends, then clearly this phrase &ldquo;other moneys&rdquo; can and almost certainly does refer to whatever provision is in the agreement for payments other than dividends.  Consequently, we are entitled to ask the Minister to make it quite clear whether this phrase &ldquo;other moneys&rdquo; does or can refer to any payments envisaged under the agreement other than dividends.</P>

      <P>And no other?  The Minister did not say that before.  If the Minister says &ldquo;and no other&rdquo; he is, in effect, saying that there is no provision in the agreement for any payment except a dividend on foot of these shares.  This is what I asked him the first time, but it took quite some time to get him to say that.  However, since there have been a few statements by the Minister which he has subsequently retracted or controverted, I do not want any misunderstanding on this or the Minister to say that it is simply a comment by me.  I want to spell it out as clearly as I can so that if there is any misunderstanding about it the Minister will have the opportunity now to correct that misunderstanding.</P>
      <P>The position appears to be as follows: The Minister says that the phrase &ldquo;other moneys&rdquo; has it normal, traditional meaning and no other.  If that is so, it follows that the agreement envisages the payment of dividends only and not payment in any other way.  If that position is being correctly represented by me, then the phrase &ldquo;other moneys&rdquo; does not present any difficulties.  If it is not being correctly represented in what I have said, I suggest that now is the time for the Minister to correct the position, because if there is any other provision in the agreement, then the Minister would be misleading the House if he allowed the impression to go forth that there was no other provision in the agreement when in fact there was and that the words &ldquo;other moneys&rdquo; did not refer to anything in the agreement if, in fact, they could so refer.</P>

      <P>Section 6 refers to shares held &ldquo;by a nominee under section 4 of this Act&rdquo;.  The Minister has said we are dealing only with dividends here and that this phrase &ldquo;other moneys&rdquo; is just a pattern followed by the parliamentary draftsman. If there are one or two nominees of the Minister under section 6 and the directors get an annual fee because <Col N="488" /> of the ownership of shares of the company by the Minister, does this mean they must hand over this money for the benefit of the Exchequer?  That is the way it reads to me.  I shall be delighted if that is the case but I want the Minister to confirm it.</P>

      <P>This section refers to the expenses incurred by the Minister in the administration of this Act.  I take those expenses to be in addition to the £9,540,000 of taxpayers' money re-referred to in section 2 and which is to be paid tax free and direct to the four fortunate beneficiaries of the Minister's generosity.  Can we have some idea of what sort of expenses are envisaged in section 7?  Already we have extracted one figure from the Minister, <Col N="489" /> that was, the sum of £58,500 to two firms&mdash;Lazard Brothers and Company Limited and Mergers Limited&mdash;for advice on the question of the valuation of 24 per cent of this company.  We know that that money has been expended.</P>
      <P>The Minister received advice also from the Geological Survey Office.  I do not know whether that advice had to be paid for.  Presumably it had to be paid for.  These then are three headings under which expenses have been incurred but can the Minister tell us the various other headings which are intended to be covered by this section and also what are the approximate amounts of money involved?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>The sort of expenses that arise from the administration of the Bill, once enacted, are things like employment of consultants, if that is necessary, the matter of travel and there could be circumstances in which there was a matter of staff but all of that would have to be brought forward and dealt with by the normal mechanism by which moneys are voted by the Oireachtas.  This section is simply enabling those expenses to be paid from moneys provided by the Oireachtas but the section is not providing the money.</P>

Is this money that is being paid to Lazards and Mergers, to the Geological Survey Office, to solicitors and counsel who have been retained, apart from the advice that he is getting from the Chief State Solicitor's office and the normal legal channels, to be paid under section 7 or is it being paid under some subhead in the departmental Estimates.

      <P>We have a situation whereby under section 7 the Minister is making provision for the payment of expenses incurred in the administration of this legislation and where he is saying that the money will be paid out of the moneys provided by the Oireachtas.  We know that there have been sizeable expenses already in relation to this whole matter.  Since the Minister has said that all of the expenditure involved up to now has been found without reference to the Bill, is there a need at all for this section?  Deputy O'Malley was endeavouring to ascertain the sort of payments the Minister envisages in respect of the administration of the Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I indicated the sorts of categories of payments that could be envisaged as being required but the point I made was that no expenditures have been incurred or could have been incurred under this section since the Bill is not yet an Act and that, therefore, discussion of other expenditures in respect of the past and to which Deputies have made reference do not seem to arise under section 7.  It was on that matter that I asked the guidance of of the Chair.</P>

I am assuming that the Minister intends appointing two directors to Bula.  I am assuming that section 7 will enable the Minister to make provision for the payment of these two directors, or are we to assume that Bula themselves will pay the two directors?

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>That is putting me into a very hypothetical situation.  One can only talk about general circumstances in which consultants are retained by Departments and then ask if such a hypothetical situation might arise.  Consultants are employed where the expertise does not exist within the Department or within another available Department or State agency and it can be envisaged that such circumstances might arise.  But I would be entering into an extremely speculative area to be more precise than that.  The Deputy's experience in public life might provide speculative answers to the question, but I do not wish to be speculative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the significance of what the Minister has said does not strike him as it strikes me. When the Minister talks about the use of consultants it is in the context of expenses incurred by the Minister in the administration of this Act.  One could envisage the use of consultants by the company in respect of further developments and so on, but that on the face of it would be something that would be paid for by the company and <Col N="493" /> not by the Minister as an expense in the administration of the Act.  In what circumstances would the Minister envisage the use of consultants for which the Minister would have to pay as an expense incurred in the administration of this Act?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no specific set of circumstances in mind.  This is a technical provision in the usual form.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that and I also appreciate the fact that the Minister may not have some specific thing in mind.  Quite clearly some of the Minister's advisers have something specific in mind when they advise the Minister that the cost of a consultant or consultants could be a possible expense under this section.  Would the Minister inquire from his advisers what they had in mind when they advised him to refer to the possible expense of a consultant as an expense under this section?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed that this is an enabling provision in the usual drafting layout and that there is no specific intention at this moment to retain consultants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is being evasive.  We are aware that the section is in the usual form.  We can assume that there is no specific intention at this time to engage consultants. That is not an unreasonable assumption.  Equally, it is not an unreasonable assumption that if the cost of a consultant is envisaged as a possible expense under this section somebody had something in mind when they said that.  Could the Minister elaborate a little on the other heading mentioned, staff and travel?  How could they arise as expense in the administration of this Act?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy says that it is not an unreasonable assumption that somebody had something in mind.  I wonder if we are being entirely serious.  I have assured the House that this is a technical provision in the usual form.  This detailed speculation about what might be envisaged by members of my staff is a very extraordinary sort of speculation which is <Col N="494" /> not germane to the purpose of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Clearly it has not occurred to the Minister that that is a very peculiar form of reply, to refer to consultants, staff and travel.  On the face of it that answer is so peculiar that it immediately raises the question as to what the Minister had in mind, or if he had nothing in mind, what his advisers have in mind.  As the consultants seem to be a problem we will leave that aside for the moment.  Does the Minister think it peculiar of us to ask in what circumstances does he envisage possible expenditure under this section under the heading of staff or travel?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>It is peculiar.  It is simply taking up time and spinning a thing out.  This is an enabling section so that if circumstances arose in which it would be desirable to have people travel, or desirable to have someone employed who was not a normal member of the establishment of the Department paid for in the normal way, then it would be possible to do so.  That is the extent of the intention. It is not worth the rigmarole which it is now receiving.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is missing the whole point.  The Minister has a Bill coming up shortly which deals with the setting up of an overall authority in regard to science and technology.  I have not looked at that Bill, but there is almost certainly such a section in it.  In that case the Minister is setting up a form of State authority for which clearly expenses will be incurred in relation to its administration.  This is a Bill for the acquisition of shares in a private company.  How can one incur expense in the administration of this Act when the purpose of the Act is to acquire shares in a private company?  I do not say there is no reasonable answer to that, but at the moment I cannot imagine what it is.  I am asking the Minister to give us a reasonable answer.  In answer to this the Minister gave us an example of three headings, consultants, staff and travel.  We asked the Minister to indicate how under any one of those headings <Col N="495" /> expenses might be incurred in the administration of this Act, which is quite different from the normal one which the Minister has referred to. It is not an answer for the Minister to refer to the normal provision, because this is a normal provision in a different kind of Act.  I hope the Minister has got the point I am trying to make.  It seems to me that, once one thinks about it, it is self-evident. Maybe the Minister had not thought about it up to now.  I hope it is clear why there is a considerable difference in this case and why the questions are not strange or peculiar in the circumstances of this Bill and what it is seeking to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>The section refers to the expenses incurred by the Minister in the administration of this Act.  I have always understood, and I believe I have always functioned on the basis, that when I am required to administer any Act that I should be entitled, if I deem it necessary in circumstances that I cannot now envisage in regard to this or any other Act, to these sort of powers.  That seems not alone normal but necessary if a Minister is to discharge his functions properly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>If one accepts that proposition it is one thing, but when the Minister was asked what kind of expenses would be involved he did not give the answer he has just given. The answer he gave was consultant staff and travel.  Is he now wanting to withdraw that answer or did it mean anything when he said it?  If it did not, why did he say it?  If it did will he tell us what he meant?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I gave those things as examples of the sort of expenditure. They are not exhaustive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Taking any one of them would the Minister explain how it could arise as an expense of the Minister in relation to this Act?  I will explain what I mean.  On the face of it when this Bill is enacted the Minister will acquire the shares referred to. He will appoint, let us say, two directors. <Col N="496" /> The two directors will, as the Minister indicated earlier, if they are paid directors' fees, be paid by the company.  The cost will not be an expense under this section.  If they incur travel expenses as directors these presumably will be paid by the company also and will therefore not be an expense under this section.  The question therefore arises: in what way will the Minister be incurring expense in the administration of this Act?  I am inclined to accept the proposition put forward by the Minister with a general insurance clause which the Minister should have.  He cannot spell out too precisely all the expense that might arise and there should be exceptions which would absolve him if this should arise.  This is not an unreasonable proposition.  Surely the Minister can appreciate that that is not the case he made.  He mentioned three specific headings.</P>

Would these not be expenses of the company and not the Minister, or am I completely misunderstanding the position arising under this Bill?</P>

      <P>The Minister has told us what his financial and geological advisers told him and how much he paid them, that is £58,500. He did not include the Geological Survey and we do not know what they got.  I presume they were paid.  I am repeating the same query under what seems to be the most appropriate section, because this section would retrospectively enable the payments to be made.  I am inquiring what the position is about the legal consultants.  I understand the Minister did not confine his legal advice simply to the full-time officials of the public service. Since we have been given information in regard to financial and geological consultants we should have this in relation to the legal equivalents as well.</P>

The £9.54 million cannot be paid officially, or lawfully at any rate, until the Act is passed.  With the greatest respect to the Chair, the Chair's reasoning in relation to the question of expenses under section 7 would have also included any discussion of the £9.54 million.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister feels the question I am putting to him is more complicated than it really is. Let me give him a very simple example. Deputy O'Malley referred to one expense we know of, the fee paid to Lazards.  May we take it no payment will be made under section 7 in respect of that expense?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>May we take it no payment whatever will be made under section 7 in respect of any expense whatever the liability for which was incurred before the enactment of the Bill?  In other words, all expenses incurred prior to the enactment of the Bill will be paid for in a way other than under section 7.</P>

      <P>Surely if that is so the Minister, quite inadvertently I am sure, was misleading the Leas-Cheann Comhairle in the submission he made in regard to this section.  The whole point of his submission was that no expense could be incurred and paid for under this section until after the enactment of the Bill.  Therefore, he contended Deputy O'Malley was out of order in referring to any expense incurred prior to the enactment of the Bill.  That was my understanding of what was said.  On that basis I was merely trying to clarify the position.</P>
      <P>The Minister appears now to be saying expenses could be incurred prior to the enactment of the Bill which would be paid under this section. If that is so, I suggest all expenses which have been incurred in connection with this matter prior to the enactment of the Bill are open to discussion on this section because they may become payable under this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a general enabling section.  The funds have to be voted.  In the interests of trying <Col N="500" /> to be precise.  I was indicating that there could be circumstances in which a service would commence at a certain stage, and continue through the moment in which the Bill became law, and the question of payment for those sort of services under the enabling umbrella of this section, using voted moneys, could not be ruled out.  I cannot understand the Deputy's difficulty. He knows such overlap services will arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>If we take expenses incurred quite clearly prior to the enactment of the Bill which have already been paid for&mdash;assuming some have already been paid; I do not know &mdash;they will have been paid for on foot of the authority in some subhead of the Estimate for the Minister's Department. I see no reason why expenses incurred of the kind the Minister is talking about would continue from before the enactment of the Bill until afterwards which could not also be disposed of in the same way.</P>
      <P>In other words, this section does not appear to me to be necessary to discharge such expenses.  Indeed, on the face of it I agree with the contention the Minister was making that it relates only to expenses incurred in the administration of this Act and therefore, on the face of it, can only relate to expenses incurred after the Bill is enacted.  I was trying to clarify that and get it on the record, and the Minister took me aback by what he said which indicated that he envisaged the possibility of making a payment under this section in respect of expenses incurred prior to the enactment of the Bill.  If it is possible to make a payment of that kind under this section, it seems to me all expenses incurred in connection with this matter might well come for payment under this section and should be open to discussion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I did not think they were and I was merely trying to clarify them.  I intended to follow up with another small point.  The Minister has opened up the whole position now in a way I did not envisage and which I do not think the Leas-Cheann Comhairle envisaged when the Minister made his submission to him.  Would it be possible <Col N="501" /> for the Minister to clarify the position?  I have no desire to open this matter up but, on the other hand, I have no desire to let the section go without a discussion on the expenses involved if, in fact, this section will be deemed to authorise payments in respect of expenses incurred prior to the enactment of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy says &ldquo;deemed to authorise payments&rdquo;. This is an enabling section, I repeat, of a standard form.  It provides that they may be paid out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas.  It is the voting of the moneys by the Oireachtas that is the authorisation.  Surely the authorisation for all moneys paid in such circumstances is the vote of the Oireachtas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The position was made distinctly unclear by something the Minister said some time ago.  We have now established that some expenses which were incurred in connection with this transaction have already been paid. Clearly they have not been paid on foot of this section but on foot of a subhead in the Minister's Estimate which was approved by this House. There is no reason why other expenses incurred in the future, or incurred already and not yet paid, cannot be dealt with similarly.  Therefore the question arises as to how can any liability for expenses already incurred or incurred prior to the enactment of this Bill fall to be paid or authorised for payment under this section?  Why is this section not relating solely to expenses incurred after the enactment of the Bill and expenses which relate to the cost of administration?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>This is my understanding but I stated that there would be certain services that would have started prior to the enactment and would continue after it and that there would be a question of apportionment of payments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the first time the Minister mentioned the word &ldquo;apportionment&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not the first time I mentioned the idea.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I fear the Minister does not pay as much attention to what he says himself as we do.  What he said was that there could be a situation in which fees incurred were on a continuing basis dating from before the enactment of the Bill to after the enactment <Col N="504" /> of it.  If he did not say, he certainly implied that such fees, covering the whole period, would fall to be paid under section 7.  Did he not mean that because that is the impression I got from what he said and that is the reason for the whole difficulty?  If the Minister did not mean that, would he say so?  Did he mean to convey that such fees would be apportioned, that there would be a separate payment for those incurred prior to the enactment of the Bill and another one under section 7 subsequent to the enactment of the Bill?  If that is what he meant, it is not what he said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I would refer the Deputy to the record in due course.  I was trying to be specific in saying that there were services which had been initiated prior to the enactment of the Bill but which would continue after the enactment of it and the payment of those in the latter context would be, as I understand section 7, subject to, or not subject to&mdash;because this is simply an enabling Bill&mdash;the vote of the Oireachtas but would arise after the Bill has become law and therefore in the context of section 7.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister mean that there would be, in respect of that continuing fee, in effect two separate payments, one in respect of that incurred prior to the enactment of the Bill and a second in respect of the one incurred afterwards, the second one being a payment made on foot of section 7?  Is that what the Minister means?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Fees are paid from subheads.  I think I was not referring to a payment; I was referring to a service.  In fact, I was trying to clarify matters for the Deputy when I made it clear that there would be some services that would be continuing beyond the moment when the Bill became law.  It was my whole intention to be clear about that fact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that the Minister was trying to make that point clear.  What he did not make clear, and I fear has not yet made clear, is whether in such a case the services incurred prior to the enactment of the <Col N="505" /> Bill will be dealt with separately from those incurred after the enactment of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>The fees are paid from subheads voted by the Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that.  Those already incurred by the Minister before the enactment of the Bill&mdash;some of them have been paid, as we have established and some have yet to be paid&mdash;will be paid under subheads. You do not need section 7 for that purpose.  The difficulty has arisen because the Minister drew into the argument, quite unnecessarily in my view, expenses incurred prior to the enactment of the Bill under section 7.  It was the Minister who brought in that. He has still not made it quite clear that in fact there is a separation between the two, even if it is the one firm rendering the one service and that in fact there has to be an apportionment. He hinted at that but he did not say it.</P>
      <P>I am not making a mountain of a molehill in case the Minister is tempted to think that I am because if the Minister proposes to make any payment under section 7 in respect of an expense incurred prior to the enactment of the Bill there is a new situation in regard to our discussion of section 7.  All of this has arisen because of what the Minister said. Would he now indicate specifically in the case of a service of the kind he has envisaged, which commences prior to the enactment of the Bill and continues after the date of its enactment, when payment falls to be made for that service, is it envisaged that that payment would be apportioned, that one portion would relate to services up to the date of enactment and another portion to be paid on foot of a subhead authorised under section 7 would relate to the services after the enactment date?  Is that what is envisaged?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>The fees, as I said, are in fact paid under the subhead. I believe that the mechanism that I described and that the Deputy has now described again is the mechanism that would have to be used.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>If that is so, then no expense incurred prior to the enactment of the Bill comes under section 7. That is what, apparently, the Minister was trying to establish: in fact what he conveyed was something quite different.  He has now switched it around and he is talking about apportionment and I think he is getting me to make the case for him rather than making it himself, the case he should have made the first time.</P>

      <P>That is the question I am putting to the Minister.  Would he at least allow me to put the question to him?  Was he bringing in something hypothetical?  Is that what he is now saying, that it was hypothetical?  He did not say that at the time.</P>

      <P>I am not surprised that the Minister is not saying one or the other because he is saying one and the other on almost every question that comes up.  It is totally unsatisfactory that a Minister should come into the House, and not know his job, not be properly briefed, not be able to explain things, putting forward a case and then withdrawing it, and changing his feet. This is a totally unsatisfactory performance. He is wasting the time of the House and of the Opposition.</P>

      <P>In view of the fact that the Minister cannot envisage in what way expenses can arise under section 7, and that he has already found in existing legislation ways and means of spending quite a sizeable amount of money on research, the business of staff, travelling expenses and the various other things he mentioned tonight, surely he could accept this Bill without providing for the possibility of incurring further expense <Col N="508" /> administering it?  In view of the abstractness, as the Minister put it, of being able to visualise further expenses in this regard, could he withdraw section 7, because it does not seem to be necessary?</P>

      <P>We cannot agree. The Minister has failed to answer various questions and has changed his answers several times.  This is not the normal provision where a State company or its equivalent&mdash;the example given by Deputy Colley was the National Board for Science and Technology&mdash;is concerned.  This is a private company in which the Minister is buying with the taxpayers' money a minority interest.  These expenses are matters for the company. Any expenses incurred from now on should be paid by the company and not out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas.  We have had no reassurance on this matter from the Minister and in those circumstances we cannot agree to the section because it is not usual in that context.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to deal with two matters that came up the last day because during the earlier debate on this section Deputy O'Malley remarked that at the time he obtained copies of the documents of the company's file in the Company's Registration Office the latest annual returns of Bula Limited did not appear to be available.  I promised to look into that.</P>
      <P>I am informed that the 1974 and 1975 returns were submitted some weeks ago and they are now on the file, but it is possible that one or both of them were being subjected to the registration process at the time of the Deputy's inquiry.  As I said, they have since been filed and I understand that the 1976 return is on file also.  I think the item from these returns which Deputy O'Malley particularly wished to be informed about was the figure of the indebtedness of the company, which appears at part 4 of the annual return.  The figure entered in the 1976 return for this indebtedness was £3,091,409.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other matter, which to a great extent has been dealt with but which I will just return to, is the matter of Haras el Chorro, SA.  That matter again was raised by Deputy O'Malley. The reason he did so was that contracts entered into by Bula Limited with Haras el Chorro, SA were listed in a charge registered in the Companies Office as part of the security <Col N="511" /> for the credit facilities by banking institutions.  This matter, I think, has been incorrectly taken up by the press as being a situation where Haras el Chorro, SA hold a mortgage on Bula lands or minerals.  This is not so.  Haras el Chorro, SA are and have been since 1970 the registered owners of lands known as the Kruger lands. These lands were essential and support lands for the Bula mining projects and contracts for the acquisition of these lands were entered into by Bula Limited.  It is the surplus use of the land which is important to Bula for the purpose of constructing tailing dams and other facilities ancillary to the mine development.  Those are the specific matters Deputy O'Malley raised&mdash;the matter of the returns and also the matter of Haras El Chorro, SA.  The latter was misunderstood and I believe it is now recognised that it was a misunderstanding.  That has been substantially cleared up but I wanted to add the official record to the explanations already given.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Before I comment on those two&mdash;and I will have quite a lot to say on what the Minister has said, or not said, as the case may be&mdash; I should like to mention a third matter. The Minister made a statement on the last occasion that the four guarantors, whom he named as Messrs. Roche, senior and junior, Mr. Wymes and Mr. Wood, were not guaranteeing in their capacity as directors although they are directors but that they were guaranteeing in their capacity as shareholders although they are not in fact shareholders, as I demonstrated since. Would the Minister deal with that situation, because the question as I originally posed it remains perfectly valid, that as directors they are entitled, under article 11, to an indemnity.  That means that the Minister is suing himself so far as 49 per cent of his action might be concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I can amplify a little what is in the record.  I said that the guarantee was given by the four individuals as the beneficial owners of the shares; the individuals control Bula Holdings.  The guarantee was drafted to <Col N="512" /> take account of the way in which the shares in Bula Limited are held.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The only connection of these four individuals with Bula Limited is that they are four directors. They are not shareholders in Bula Limited.  The shareholding of Bula Limited, as I demonstrated from the Companies Office file on the last occasion, is 80 per cent Frolic Investments, now with its name changed to Bula Holdings, and 20 per cent Patrick Wright, since deceased.  None of the four men concerned is the owner of a single share in Bula Limited.  Who owns what shares in Bula Holdings I do not know and nobody knows because it is a private unlimited company. These companies are common enough nowadays for taxation purposes. They have no great advantages or value other than for taxation purposes.</P>
      <P>One of the provisions of the Companies Act, 1963, is that it is not necessary to disclose the names of the shareholders.  Therefore, while we might well guess, and make a very informed guess, perhaps, that these four men are the principal shareholders at least of Bula Holdings, we do not know because there is no information in the file in the Companies Office to that effect. My original proposition stands, that these four guarantors are guaranteeing in their capacity as directors and it can be the only capacity in which they are guaranteeing because they are not shareholders and they cannot therefore guarantee as shareholders.  If they guarantee as directors, as indubitably they do, then they have an indemnity under article 11.  I regard as seriously wrong that they should have an indemnity under article 11.  I regard as seriously wrong that they should have an indemnity under article 11 because the value of their guarantee is diluted straight away by 49 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In practice that guarantee may be diluted to a greater extent.  The Minister might well be advised that it would be futile or unwise for him to seek to enforce a guarantee when he will have to indemnify as to 49 per cent of what he succeeds in enforcing. In practice the dilution of the value of those guarantees given in the secret <Col N="513" /> agreement of 12th December, 1975, may be virtually nothing.  The dilution is so great that the value is virtually nothing.  I do not wish to say that the Minister misled the House the last day, because I have no doubt he did not consciously try to do that, but the effect of what he said in practice was to mislead the House.  Now that we have established the precise facts they bear out precisely what I said on Tuesday, 22nd February, as reported in Volume 297 (1) of the Official Report.</P>
    <P>The Minister said now that the 1974 and 1975 annual returns were sent in &ldquo;some weeks ago and are now on file&rdquo;.  On 22nd February the Minister said these returns were made and filed in the Companies Office on 24th January, 1977.  I had a search carried out on that file by long established, most competent and experienced law searchers in Dublin.  They carried out a search for me on Tuesday, 15th February, 1977, and sent me an invoice with the search dated that date. On that date the file was available to them but the annual returns for 1974, 1975 and 1976 were not on the file.  I communicated with the firm concerned by telephone last Tuesday and told them I understood that in the last few days, as a result of what the Minister said here, a number of annual returns which had not previously been on the file were now on it. I asked them to get me copies of those. They said they would.  When I had not heard from them I telephoned them at lunchtime today and they told me that the file was not available in the Companies Office.  They said they had been there a couple of times but the file was not available.  I asked them the reason it was not available and they said they understood that a number of forms had recently been sent in and the file had been withdrawn, presumably, to have the forms put on it. I asked them when they thought the file might be available.  They hoped it would be available by Friday and if so they would then copy the additional documents for me.</P>
    <P>The position is that, notwithstanding the statement of the Minister on the last day that these annual returns were placed on the file on 24th January, 1977, they clearly were not <Col N="514" /> on it when that file was copied for me on Tuesday, 15th February. The file was not available since Thursday last or today.  To say the least of it this is an unsatisfactory position.  It is not a position that pertains to the average company. There is secrecy, mystery and doubt about the fulfilment by this company of its legal obligations under the Companies Act, 1963.  If the Minister's statement of the last day that these documents were filed on 24th January, 1977, was correct&mdash;that statement was not correct&mdash;that would disclose on the face of it a breach of the Companies Act, 1963.  It was a serious matter for the Minister to make that statement.  The position now is that a servant of his, the Registrar of Companies, having had drawn to his attention in Dáil Éireann by the statement of his own Minister the failure of a particular company to file its annual returns in time, presumably will now have to take the appropriate steps open to him under section 125 (4) of the Companies Act, 1963.</P>
    <P>On the question of the annual returns, I raised on the last occasion, but the Minister conveniently overlooked it, the position that the 1972 and 1973 annual returns had not been filed until 12th November, 1974.  On the face of it that disclosed what seems to me to be a further offence under section 125 of the Companies Act by the company in which the Minister is seeking to buy a small minority share with more than £9½ million of the taxpayers' money.</P>
    <P>On that occasion I also drew attention to and asked the Minister to deal with, which he failed to do, the situation that on 16th July, 1974, a resolution was passed at an extraordinary general meeting of the company increasing the authorised capital from £100 to £1 million.  That resolution was not filed until more than 18 months after the date of its passing, although there is an obligation in section 143 of the Companies Act to file it within 15 days.  Subsection (5) of that Act states that a criminal offence is committed by failure to file within 15 days.  It states:</P>
    <P>If the company fails to comply with subsection (1) the company and <Col N="515" /> every officer of the company who is in default shall be liable to a fine not exceeding £50.</P>
    <P>This matter has not been dealt with by the Minister, though he has given us to believe over a long period that the company in which he will get a 24 per cent interest with more than £9½ million of the taxpayers' money are a company admirable in every way.  In view of the statements he has made today about the filing of these documents, which presumably was done after information from some source or other, I ask the Minister how he reconciles this with the non-availability of the documents and the non-availability of the file in the last two or three weeks.</P>
    <P>I have often made searches of Companies Offices in regard to ordinary companies, and have never found this sort of cloak and dagger mystery.  You go in, you get the file, you put it back and that is it.  But it is almost as hard to get the file on Bula Limited as to get the secret agreement of 12th November, 1975.  When it was got less than a fortnight ago by a reputable firm of law researchers in this city the documents to which the Minister referred and which he said on the last occasion were filed on 24th January, and which he said today were filed some weeks ago and are now on file, were not on file.  That was the position again this morning.</P>
    <P>We are now told that in the 1976 return, which we were not told about at all last week and which must have been got together in a great hurry because of what I disclosed to the House last week, discloses indebtedness on foot of mortgages and charges of £3.91 million.  That is a very substantial amount of money.  If that company file with that information had been available to the various advisers and to the arbitrators we might have ended up with a very different result.  It is a serious matter that if the Minister's statement that these documents have been filed in the last few weeks is correct it would <i>prima facie</i> appear to be a breach of the law.</P>
    <P>I am aware from practice that small <Col N="516" /> companies in a small way of business, without the assistance of the considerable high grade professional advice available to this company, often default, that they forget to put in an annual return sometimes and that they have to be reminded by the registrar, but it does not happen to companies of which the secretary is a solicitor, in which the capital is £1 million and in which the liabilities, as declared in the annual return exceed £3 million and where, presumably, the assets are fairly considerable.  It does not happen normally with such companies, and one is entitled to ask why it has happened in this company and why it is so difficult for a citizen to exercise his right in the Companies Office, given to him under the Companies Act, to inspect the file.</P>
    <P>The other matter I raised and that the Minister knew nothing about last week&mdash;he did not appear to have heard of the company at all&mdash;was the involvement of Haras el Chorro, SA, which in French would mean Societié Anonymie, but I think this is Spanish. I could not follow what the Minister told us about that company&mdash;as far as I can remember he did not tell us anything.  I think he told us they had sold the surface land to Bula Limited, but apparently not the minerals.  I am no linguist but I assume the name of that company to be Spanish.  The reason for that assumption is that I understand the company are registered in Panama, which is an unusual place for a company to be registered who own land, or owned land, whichever the position is, in Ireland.  Financially speaking, Panama is one of those mysterious little countries used for the most part not by the citizens of Panama but by the rich citizens of many other nations for the purpose of carrying on what are known as offshore operations.  The whole point of using a Panamanian registered company is bound up with what we should delicately call taxation affairs.</P>
    <P>I have not come across a Panamanian country owning land or minerals in Ireland but possibly there is some other Panamanian country which does.  The interests of Haras el Chorro, SA, are widespread; they <Col N="517" /> are not confined to land in Meath in Ireland.  My attention was drawn to the edition of Tattersall's catalogue of 29th September, 1976.  A yearling was offered as lot 460, a chesnut filly by Ridan out of Narrow Escape described in the catalogue as being the property of our old friends Haras el Chorro, SA.  It is a company with widespread interests throughout the world.  I want the Minister to tell me its exact connection with Bula.</P>
    <P>According to the returns in the Companies Office there is an agreement of 17th February, 1975 between Bula and Haras el Chorro, SA.  I want to know&mdash;and I feel I am entitled to know&mdash;the nature and effect of that agreement.  I understood the Minister to say that the surface land appeared to have been sold to Bula and that there was some other arrangement about the minerals but in order to try to clarify that I looked up in the Land Registry folio 26646 County Meath, which is the folio mentioned in relation to Haras el Chorro, SA, to find out had they sold the land to Bula and the position relating to the minerals.  It appears that Haras el Chorro, SA are registered on that folio still and there is a reference there to the mineral rights.  The registration extends to the mines and minerals other than minerals of gold, silver and petroleum within the meaning of Part II of the Petroleum and Other Minerals Development Act.  The entry in relation to minerals was registered on the folio on 1st April, 1976.  It would seem, if my reading of this is correct, that the folio is owned by this Panamanian company and that all the minerals other than gold, silver and petroleum are owned by it also.</P>
    <P>There is a curious entry in No. 2 relating to the charge of the Northern Bank by a mortgage dated 30th September, 1976.  It refers to the lands comprised in the folio but excludes the mines and minerals on or under the said lands.  It also refers to the estate, right, title and interest referred to in the agreement dated 17th February, 1975, between Haras el Chorro, SA, and the company therein described as the estate, right and title of the vendors to any minerals.  It <Col N="518" /> seems to me that Haras el Chorro, SA on the basis of this have mortgaged their interest in the minerals to the Northern Bank Finance Corporation. I cannot understand otherwise how the reference to the right, title and interest of the vendors in and to any minerals under the lands can be explained.</P>
    <P>These are matters about which the Minister has had a full week to find the answers.  One would have expected a great deal more information than the very skimpy information which we were, in fact, given.  We are not at all clear as to the position in relation to this company which is registered, so far as I know, in Panama.  One assumes that it is not owned by Irish citizens; perhaps Irish citizens have some interest in it.  Perhaps it is an offshore asset stripping operation.  I do not know.  One cannot form any definite conclusions about it on the basis of the very inadequate information given by the Minister but I think one should continue to ask that sufficient information be given so that we can ascertain the exact position in relation to the company.  The Minister has an obligation to give further and better information than he has done and to explain fully what the dealings were with this company, why they were carried out and why this company is still referred to in this charge on the land of the Northern Bank Finance Corporation.  Also, we are entitled to ask in the circumstances for a copy of the agreement of 17th February, 1975, between Bula and Haras el Chorro, SA.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DeclanCostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to intervene briefly on one point raised by Deputy O'Malley.  He made reference to the guarantee.  The Deputy has not got the agreement for reasons which have been made clear and which he does not accept; both sides understand exactly the position of the other without accepting it.  The Deputy's suggestion that the guarantee is of very little value is based on the assumption that the contract which he has not seen would have been drafted in a very slipshod way.  All I can say to the Deputy and to the House is that it would be a very serious error if an <Col N="519" /> agreement was drafted which contained a guarantee which turned out to be of very little value to the Minister and I think it would be wrong for the House to assume that such a basic error was made.</P>
      <P>I do not wish to intervene in matters which the Minister has dealt with but I want to raise a general matter which has reference to a point Deputy O'Malley made, that is, the position when the State is buying into a private company, as will be done if and when this Bill becomes law.  When the State buys into a private company, that company will have entered into all manner of transactions and I think it would be extremely wrong that the company in which the State is taking a stake should be required to publicise its commercial transactions.  I think it would mean that it would be extremely difficult for the State to carry out an operation such as has been carried out under the present legislation.  Members may differ as to whether or not this is desirable.  Members may differ as to whether or not it is a good idea for the State to buy into private companies in the mineral area or otherwise, but assuming it is a good idea and assuming it is a good idea for the State to take a shareholding, particularly in mineral development, immense difficulties would be raised in future in the operation of such a policy if at any time suggestions were made that such a company was subject to, shall I say, the threat that its private dealings would be made public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems to me, therefore, to be unreasonable that the Opposition should require the Minister to ask the company whose shares he is purchasing to produce its private agreements.  What the Minister has done is to indicate to the House the nature of the particular transaction.  The nature of that particular transaction is, of course, now known and it is wrong to suggest that the actual agreement itself should be produced.  Generally speaking, Members should know&mdash;certainly Deputy O'Malley should know&mdash;that when a sale is being closed all the transactions in relation to the particular company are examined.  Whilst it is true that a <Col N="520" /> private company has a statutory obligation to file its accounts, the purchaser of shares, while concerned about the viability of the company, is not primarily concerned with whether or not the company carries out its statutory obligation.  What he is concerned about is whether he is getting a good bargain.  These are matters taken into account when the sale is being closed and certainly anything in reference to the accounts of the company are matters which are examined very carefully when the sale is being closed. Deputy O'Malley may, if he wants to, comment on a company which has delayed filing its accounts.  I suppose he is entitled to make his comments, but I do not think that affects the decision of the House in relation to this particular section.</P>

      <P>There are two matters to which I wish to refer.  The first is the filing of the accounts.  I note what my colleague, the Attorney General, has just said, but I must say I certainly do not condone the failure of any company to submit its returns on time. That being so, I believe the position is, as the Deputy well knows, that a high proportion of private companies are not as prompt in submitting their accounts as they should be.  This failure is due to a number of causes.  Deputy Colley made reference to these last week&mdash;illness, pressure of work and so on.  I am quite sure none of the Members opposite would suggest there is anything exceptional or remotely sinister about delay in having returns submitted.  I do not condone delays and the Registrar of Companies quite rightly takes a serious view of such delays.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Malley dealt with some dates and some words of mine.  May I now be quite clear about this?  What I said was that the returns were lodged on January 24th.  I understand that normally returns are processed and filed within ten days but, due to shortage of staff and for a number of apparently valid reasons, there is now a longer delay between the lodge ment and the filing.  If Deputies consult the Official Report they will see that the word I used was &ldquo;lodged&rdquo;.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to deal now with Haras el Chorro, SA, if the Deputy wants more of it.  He knows that since 1970 Haras el Chorro are the registered owners of the lands known as the Kruger lands and that there has been a stud farm and other sorts of farming carried on there.  The point is these lands were essential as support lands.  First, we have to have an idea of where tailings can be and secondly, there was the question of the diversion of the river. Both were relevant and it was essential that these support lands for the Bula mining project should be acquired. These lands were there beside the Wright farm and they were necessary <Col N="522" /> for the development of the mine. These lands were secured by Bula under a contract arrangement.  That is the essence of it.</P>
    <P>I hope that is clarification because this was a contract for the acquisition of the lands which were essential for the mine.  It does not relate to the working of the mine in its underground sense; it simply relates to a servicing area for it.  I know that Bula could not have had a choice with regard to the adjoining people.  They could not have had a choice with regard to the registered owners of the land, the so-called Kruger lands.  That was as it happened.  They were correct and they were prudent in seeing that the land was secure.  That is the story and there is no mystery or drama there.  Had the registered owner of what are known as the Kruger lands been an Irish farmer&mdash;this might just as well have occurred; it was a matter of chance that it was Haras el Chorro, SA and not a local farmer with a more normal name that would give rise to less surprise&mdash;there would not have been any comment at all.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>My understanding about the minerals is that it is not a geological interesting area.  The people disposing of the land argued as follows: if by any chance there turned out to be a mineral interest&mdash;this is not anticipated&mdash;there was some other arrangement which could be made with regard to reimbursement about minerals.  The particular interest is not a mineral interest; it is an interest in relation to the surface availability of the surface land.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>It is Mr. Kruger's interest that is involved.  I am not clear as to the status of the minerals.  I know that the need, the interest and the reason for the exclusion here is that <Col N="523" /> the requirement is a requirement of service land and, therefore, of the surface of it.  This would be seen as a perfectly normal transaction if it were a local farmer who was involved; the comments of the newspapers originated because of the name of the company. That was something that existed long before decisions were taken by this Government or by the Opposition when they were in office with regard to the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The folio concerned would appear to indicate from what I understand that this company became registered not in 1970 but on 1st June, 1972, that is approximately 18 months after the discovery of the existence of the orebody beside it or beneath it. The Minister has said that a contract exists for the purchase of the surface of these lands but not of the minerals under them.  From the folio concerned it does not appear that the purchase has been completed because so far as one can see this Panamanian company is already the owner of the land.  Under the Registration of Title Act, 1964, any form of trust of this nature is not enforceable as against the registered owner.  The Registrar of Titles is entitled to deal with the registered owner who appears to be this Panamanian company.</P>
      <P>If I were purchasing into this company it seems to me I would have to insist that they would become registered as owners and they are in a very weak position at the moment without that.  I am not clear about the area of land involved.  I understand it is sizeable and I presume the price is sizeable also.  It is a pity that the whole thing is so vague and so highly unusual.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is not right in saying that if this were an ordinary Irish farmer with an ordinary Irish name it would not appear unusual.  What attracted my attention to the very extraordinary nature of the transaction &mdash;and the more I hear of it the more extraordinary it seems to become&mdash; is the provision that the lands in this folio are charged to the Northern Bank Finance Corporation but the mines and <Col N="524" /> minerals on and under the lands are excluded and exempted.</P>
    <P>It is extraordinary for a mining company, or what hopes to be a mining company, buying land immediately beside what it hoped will be its mine not to buy the minerals if they are there.  The Minister is not aware whether they are State minerals.  Has he made any attempt to make an acquistion order in relation to these minerals?  Without going into the history of the mineral title, on the face of it I would say that the likely ownership of these minerals is different from the ownership of what was originally the Wright minerals.  It appears from these documents that Mr. Wright's land was not registered land.  It was not registered in the Land Registry and, therefore, it did not go through the Land Commission.  Therefore, the opportunity of the Land Act, 1903, and subsequent Acts vesting the minerals in the State did not arise.</P>
    <P>In the Haras el Chorro land, the property is registered in the Land Registry.  One assumes that some time before 1972 when this Panamanian company came to Ireland the property had been vested in the Land Commission and was revested by them in whoever was the tenant under the Land Acts.  If that were done the normal provision would be to retain the minerals for the State.  There has been a great deal of discussion here about the fact that Mr. Wright's minerals were privately owned.  The Minister failed to make a second acquisition order to acquire them and he did not make an acquisition order for anyone else's minerals in that area.  Apparently he did not make one for Haras el Chorro's minerals. For some extraordinary reason they have been allowed to retain their minerals even though they are next door to a mine in which the Irish taxpayer is buying a 24 per cent interest and receiving a further 25 per cent.  That seems to be another extraordinary fact of this saga.  We have in Panamanian ownership the minerals of an extensive farm that are under the lands owned under contract by the company in which the Irish taxpayer is to get 49 per cent at a high cost. <Col N="525" /> Why did the Minister not make a mineral acquisition order in relation to these minerals?  If they are in Panamanian ownership, why should they be left in it?  One assumes from what the Minister has said that they must be privately owned.  He explained that there was a division between the sale of the surface land and the minerals.  The Panamanian owners want to maintain an interest in the minerals in case they become valuable. They have a much better chance of becoming valuable next door to the Navan orebody than if they were elsewhere.</P>
    <P>In these circumstances, would the Minister not make an acquisition order under the 1940 Act in relation to this holding and other holdings on that side of the river?  The Bula part of the orebody extends beyond what was originally the Wright farm to other lands which they have bought. Because these are registered land folios one assumes that some of them must be State minerals and that the others might be easier to acquire than the Wright minerals.  What is the State's position in relation to those non-Wright minerals, including the Panamanian minerals, if the mining operation continues?  The State owns some of those other minerals.  Why are we not getting royalties?  Why are we not getting paid for them?  I should like the Minister to answer those questions?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>The existence of workable minerals in relation to Haras el Chorro has not been established. There is an assumption about minerals which one would need to know more about before considering any procedure.  If they are State minerals, they are State minerals, and that is the end of it.</P>

      <P>I doubt that an astute body like the Northern Bank Finance Corporation would take mortgages <Col N="526" /> and charges on minerals from someone if they did not have title to give.  Banks employ lawyers who spend their time investigating titles to property which is offered as security for loans and on which the banks want to register charges.  They do not lend money or register charges unless they are satisfied that the mortgagor has the title to do it.  If the mortgagor did not have the title, the bank would not acquire any valid security.  In this Bill the company are referred to as mortgagors. No mortgage seems to be registered on the folio and there is no change of ownership in respect of the surplus lands.</P>

I must confess that the information given to us by the Minister in regard to it is not helpful.  Would the Minister not agree with me that, if there are minerals which could be acquired by the State in the immediate vicinity of this land, the State should exercise its rights and should not allow a private company to use them?

      <P>How is it relevant to the purchase of shares in a company whether the Minister has State minerals next door or whether he is right or wrong in acquiring them?  I do not see how these provisions are relevant to <Col N="527" /> section 2.  The point I am making is that I would express the hope, which would be shared by many Deputies, that the activities which are being undertaken by the Minister in this area will be continued in the future; that in the future the State will take a more active role in the development of our minerals and will give effect to that role by different means, one of which would be the purchase of shares in private companies.  If that role is to be played, it is important that the State does not see to it by what it does in this instance or in other instances that private companies will fail to deal with the State.</P>
      <P>What we are dealing with here is a situation where a private company has entered into a contract with a neighbour for the purchase of land. That is what this is about.  The Minister has explained to the Dáil what is the nature of the contract arising from the information sought by the Deputy last week.  That having been given, it is then a matter for the Minister's advisers to see that the shares being bought have not in any way been affected by any transaction undertaken either before or since the contract was entered into.  The debate in this House has arisen to a great extent because Deputies are objecting to the fact that they cannot see the agreement.  However, that matter having been debated at great length and the Minister having explained the position, the situation now is that we are dealing with a section which is making provision for the purchase of shares in a company which, of course, has entered into many transactions. It would be extremely unreasonable for this Dáil to be asked to ask the company whose shares the Minister is buying to produce details of all these transactions.</P>
      <P>The Minister has gone, I think, as far as is reasonably necessary to indicate what the nature of this transaction is.  Whether the Minister takes further action in relation to his rights under the 1940 Act in this neighbouring farm or another farm is surely a matter that has nothing to do with this Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter is not quite as simple as the Attorney General seems to think or, which may be more accurate, as he would like to present it.  We are told that there was a simple contract between Bula Limited and Haras el Chorro, SA for the sale of the adjoining surface land needed for the development of the mine, but there is no explanation why that agreement is still an agreement rather than a completed transaction which is registered and gives that ownership to Bula Limited.  It is easy to lose sight in all of this of the fact that the purpose of this Bill is to pay nearly £10 million of the taxpayer's money to four individuals for a share in Bula Limited.</P>
      <P>It would appear from some entries in the file in the Companies Office that this is not a simple contract for the sale of the surface land; in fact, it is a reference to what appears to be Bula Limited as a mortgagor.  If there is some transaction between Bula Limited and Haras el Chorro, SA which involves not just a contract for the purchase by Bula Limited of the surface land owned by Haras el Chorro, SA but a more complicated agreement which involves some form of borrowing by Bula Limited from Haras el Chorro, SA &mdash;and that would appear to be the explanation of the reference to a mortgagor in this agreement&mdash;then of course this can have a bearing on the value of the shares being purchased.</P>
      <P>I think we are entitled to ask, is the transaction such that it should, on the one hand, increase the value of what is being acquired by the Minister or, on the other hand, decrease that value?  It is not at all clear what the position is, and I think it is not unreasonable that we should ask for some details as to what is involved here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister was making the point that it has not been established at all that there are any worthwhile minerals involved under the Kruger lands.  That may be so, but I would suggest that there is at least as good a chance of the discovery of worthwhile minerals under the lands as there is of the <Col N="529" /> discovery of oil wells in the waters off the western coast of this country, a factor which recently the Minister was indicating presented a very good opportunity for this country.  It may be, and we all hope it is; nevertheless, I would suggest that on the basis of existing information, if you are trying to sell your chances on an oil well in the waters off the western coast, on the one hand, or, on the other hand, the chances of minerals being found in this land adjoining the Navan orebody, I think you would find an easier market for the minerals hopefully adjoining the known Navan orebody.</P>
    <P>Therefore the question of what is involved in this transaction in so far as it relates to Bula and in so far as it affects either the potential assets of Bula Limited or the liabilities of Bula Limited, these are matters that ought to be disclosed to the House.  Of course, an inquiry of this nature does involve the disclosure of the business of private companies&mdash;two private companies in this case.  A lot of the information which was being sought was information which statutorily should have been disclosed anyway under the Companies Act, but was not, but in so far as the inquiries seeking information go beyond what is required to be statutorily disclosed, I am afraid that is one of the hazards that face a private individual or a private company that deals with the State, and in particular a private company that deals with the State and proposes to sell a minority of its shareholding for very substantial money to the State. It may be unfortunate but I suggest it is quite unrealistic to put a proposition to the House that any Government can come in here and propose to spend money, as is proposed to be spent here, close to £10 million, on a minority investment in a private company, and expect at the same time that there will be no inquiry on the part of the Members of this House or of the other House into the affairs of that private company.  Of course there must be.</P>
    <P>If the Minister were investing his own personal money in this, then the proposition being put forward would be a reasonable one, a matter entirely for him, but it is not his personal money; it is the taxpayer's money. <Col N="530" /> It may be unfortunate and it may lead to difficulties; in some cases it may lead to a certain amount of inefficiency. However, when you are dealing with the taxpayer's money, then you must face the fact that there is a degree of accountability required which is not required if you are dealing with your own money.  You may not like it but it is a fact, and anybody involved in such a transaction knows that is so. It is not something directed against the private individual or the private companies concerned.  It is a natural corollary that follows from dealing with the State, particularly in regard to large amounts of money.</P>
    <P>Consequently, the inquiries being made as to the precise nature of the relationship between Bula Limited and Haras el Chorro, SA, are in accordance with the principle I have been trying to enunciate.  I do not think we should either seek or be given any information in regard to Haras el Chorro which is not relevant to their relationship with Bula, but we ought to be given all the information that is relevant to their relationship with Bula, information, as I said earlier, in relation to the potential increase in the value of the assets of Bula or, alternatively, to the actual or potential increase in the liabilities of Bula.</P>
    <P>Broadly speaking what the Minister has said is that there is a contract for the sale of the surface land owned by Haras el Chorro.  On the face of it the information on the file of Bula and referred to by Deputy O'Malley does not bear out what the Minister has said.  Therefore I would ask him to clarify the nature of the agreement between the two companies: how does a reference to Bula Limited as a mortgagor arise in the file in the Companies Office in relation to their transactions with Haras el Chorro? What is the nature of that mortgage or debenture, if it is a debenture, which leads to this situation?</P>
    <P>The reference in the Companies Office file is to particulars of a charge created by Bula and which is described here as legal mortgage.  It is dated 30th September, 1976, and is between Bula Limited as the one part <Col N="531" /> and the Northern Finance Corporation as the other part.  It is securing all sums due or to become due by Bula Limited, both principal and interest, to the Northern Finance Corporation on any account whatsoever.  But then the property is described as all that comprised in the agreement dated 17th February, 1975, made between Haras el Chorro, SA, and the mortgagor of the other part.  That mortgage covers the lands comprised in Folio 26646 County Meath: but excluding and excepting thereout the mines and minerals on and under the said lands. It goes on to describe particulars of the property charged as all the estate, right, title and interest referred to in paragraph 1 of the agreement dated 17th February, 1975, and made between Haras el Chorro and the mortgagor.</P>
    <P>One can interpret this in a number of ways.  I do not wish to waste the time of the House speculating on it if the Minister will tell us what is involved in the relationship between Bula and Haras el Chorro.  The Minister will appreciate this is just an indirect version because it refers apparently to a mortgage or charge by Bula in favour of the Northern Finance Corporation Limited of lands they have acquired or are in the process of acquiring from Haras el Chorro.  If the Minister would clarify the nature of the agreement between the two companies it would help to clear up some of the questions that arise and not all of which we have put yet.  The Minister's explanation of the situation has been that what is involved is a simple agreement for the acquisition by Bula Limited of surface land.  That would not appear to be a sufficient explanation to give any rational meaning to the increase under the heading quoted in the file of Bula Limited in the Companies Office.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DeclanCostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise briefly to make this point.  I sought to suggest to the Deputy that the points he was making were not relevant to the Bill but he says they are relevant.  The Deputy seems to be asking the House to do the impossible&mdash;to decide on the value of the shares of which the House is <Col N="532" /> authorising purchase.  The shares have been valued by an independent arbitrator and the basis on which the Minister has come to the House is that he is purchasing something which has been the subject of independent arbitration.  When fixing shares the arbitrator takes into account the underlying assets of the company.  One of these is the contract to which reference has been made.  To suggest that it is the nature of the contract that is relevant is not to answer the point I made, which was that it seems to me that the Minister had indicated the nature of the contract.  This is a contract which was taken into account when the valuation of the shares was being fixed.  The Dáil is being asked in this section to authorise payment for these shares.  It would appear that the other matters to which the Deputy refers are not relevant.  Mainly what he is asking the House to do is to value the shares.</P>

Perhaps the Minister could reconcile his description of this arrangement with the Panamanian company as being a simple straightforward acquisition deal which would create no notice if the company happened to be Irish&mdash;with the statement of the managing director of Bula which was issued either during or immediately after the debate here on Tuesday last and in which he said that the agreement represents the deferred payment mortgage arrangement and that payment was to continue for a period for whatever they were buying.  Mr. Wymes did not go on to specify how much the payment should be or to say what exactly was the nature of the transaction.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann condemns the exorbitant increases in CIE fares which were recently announced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In debating this motion we wish to put on the record what we see <Col N="533" /> as the reasons for the proposed fare increases which are now before the Prices Commission.  The CIE deficit of approximately £32 million will not be reduced during 1977 as a result of the proposed increases.  This deficit is a reflection of the mismanagement of the economy during the past four years by the Government.  If the Government permit the proposed increases they will be contributing to a classic case of the chicken and the egg approach.  By adopting these proposals the Government will show that they do not know which comes first, the chicken or the egg. The weakness of the economy, and the consequent increase in passenger and freight service charges, and other increasing costs, which are fuelled by the Government's policy, are the principal reasons for the mounting CIE deficit.  The inability of the management to cope with these problems which are not within the control of CIE is no surprise.  The breakdown of the unified approach which should be taken by those within CIE in attempting to cope with these problems is a further reason for the mounting deficit in recent years.</P>
    <P>The recreation of confidence and dignity is required within CIE.  The creation of a comprehensive system of passenger and freight transport is one of the essential elements in the economic development of any country. That is an undeniable fact.  We must recognise that CIE is an essential national resource.  It is as essential to the economic state of the country as water supplies, hospital facilities and so on.  We should ensure that those engaged in CIE recognise its importance and its value to the country.  The problems of CIE are symptomatic of Coalition economic mismanagement, and the massive deficit is the result and not the cause of current CIE problems.</P>
    <P>Traditionally there was always a great pride associated with the people who worked on railways and buses in this country.  Now that pride and confidence have diminished to such an extent that the sense of identity with this proud tradition has been destroyed. Not unexpectedly the workers react to the situation and their reactions produce <Col N="534" /> more problems for CIE.  CIE do not need higher fares and reductions in services.  That will only result in the creation of a huge torso which will have an increasing appetite which can only be satisfied from an ever-diminishing number of limbs.  If one keeps cutting branches from a tree indiscriminately, the trunk in time will wither and die.  If one keeps cutting back in the cause of viability, as is now happening, and if nothing is done to appease this huge appetite, CIE will go bankrupt.  The first requirement for CIE is Government action in the revitalising of our national economy. That is the long-term answer.  There is a need for leadership and management now so that the pride in CIE which was there in the past can be recreated. There is a need for a change of approach so that the workers on the ground can be given the information to bring about the necessary understanding so that a wholehearted effort can be made by all for the national good.  This despondency which now prevails, or appears to exist in the whole organisation should be dealt with by the Government and the Board of CIE.  The breakdown of relationships causes the service to break down, resulting in a breakdown in the train and bus service.</P>
    <P>When the annual report of CIE makes its belated appearance&mdash;it is always very much behind time&mdash;we never see any evidence of the essentials required for any transport system. These essentials are urgency, reliability and value.  It is not good enough to be told that this line and that line should be closed because they are losing money or that we should have one-man buses.  This will only hold the deficit at its present level providing fares and other rates are increased exorbitantly.  Failure can only result from such an approach.  As fewer people use the increasingly costly services of CIE there will be more closures so that there will be a reduction in the opportunities for earning revenue, higher charges will become necessary, the services will become more costly and so on in an everdiminishing circle of activity.  I can see a situation where the only services operated by CIE will be between <Col N="535" /> Connolly Station, Heuston Station and Pearse Station and they will be in very little use because of the extreme costs and the inability of people to meet the charges.</P>
    <P>What is required from the Government above all is an effort to get the economy moving throughout the country.  This has been needed for the last four years.  Government action to alleviate the effect of the increase in operating costs over the past four years is required.  We see the folly of the lack of an energy policy on the cost of the oil products used by all sections and sectors of CIE.  The taxation policies of the Government, undoubtedly have added to the real cost of oil products&mdash;the increase in tax on petrol and also the levy of the tax on types of oil products that traditionally bore no tax.  This has all happened in the last three years and the levy of tax on the other oil products which traditionally bore no tax started within the last 12 or 18 months.  We should also remember that the consumer cost of oil or oil products in the last three years has risen from £200 million at the time of the oil crisis to over £600 million.</P>
    <P>The effect that these cost increases had on the price index has shown in inflation in wages and salaries which in turn had to be financed by increased Government spending or increased unemployment in the private sector of the economy, which in its turn had to be financed by increased insurance and social security payments by employer and employee alike.  In the case of CIE this payment alone probably totals about £10 million per annum which is a sizeable chunk of the £32 million deficit we hear about.  This payment has been subsidised in the last 12 months by the taxpayer and by the House here.  Now we can see why we argue that on commercial and national economic grounds there is no case at this time for increased fares or rates by CIE.  The result of such a policy can only be negative.  It can lead only to reduced usage and consequently to reduced services.  This is a case where the patient's temperature cannot be reduced by treating the symptom&mdash;<Col N="536" /> for example, the cost of £30 million in this case to sustain national loss.</P>
    <P>The Government should be giving a lead to help reduce the cost of providing this national service by creating an atmosphere in which the economy can move out of the chronic depression in which it is and has been for the past four years.  The liability of maintaining the properties and other fixed assets of CIE should be examined with a view to creating income-earning assets with these properties.  The positioning of railway stations and other facilities in practically every major town in Ireland offers an opportunity for development second to none, whether developed commercially, industrially or for warehouses or other potentially beneficial use.  CIE has the biggest and best potential property asset in this country at present and it should not be permitted to be a liability.  All that is required is initiative and knowhow to turn such a property or such a land bank into a real income-producing asset.  Everyone will realise how strategically placed are these properties in most of the provincial towns.  They are generally situated in very central areas and are suitable for some form of development.  I am not suggesting that these locations should be sold off but they should be comprehensively developed to maximise their benefit for CIE. This cannot be described as a unique proposal.  If we consider Euston Station and Liverpool Street Station in London, to name but two, they have been developed without affecting the usefulness of British Railways.  Consider also the way that many of the London underground stations in recent years have been dealt with similarly.  This has taken place while they were still being used as stations.  They are vastly improved and the manner in which they have been developed has brought more revenue to London Transport.</P>
    <P>The Government can make such things happen here.  In the Dublin area in particular the State must be the largest user of commercial space. It has been obliged to lease or purchase office space in different parts <Col N="537" /> of the city in recent years, sometimes at very great cost.  CIE were already owners of very expensive properties in this city which could have been utilised for this purpose and leased in turn by Government Departments. This would have brought badly needed revenue to CIE which would have helped to offset the increase in the amount of the subsidy they have been seeking.</P>
    <P>There is a State or semi-State body or a local authority in all the major towns and most of the provincial towns in the country.  Anyone who lives in or knows these will agree that there are more and more Government offices having to find space and accommodation in these towns.  It may be the Department of Agriculture, the Land Commission or a semi-State body like the Agricultural Credit Corporation.  In my town they have had to purchase in one instance from the local Convent of Mercy while at the same time a vast area of CIE property in the town was not being fully utilised as a result of the cut-back in railway services.</P>
    <P>As we travel through rural Ireland we notice that such space is lying idle with weeds growing over it and in many cases in a derelict state.  This is something that should be tackled, and of course this will require imagination and intitiative, elements which have been badly lacking to date.  It is possible to do it and there is a ready market waiting in most of these areas which is under Government control, whether by State or semi-State bodies, departmental offices or local authorities. All of these we have seen expand and spread into other provincial towns. Even the local authorities have had to expand their office space and find more sites.  At the same time properties owned by CIE were becoming more and more unused and tended to lie idle and in many cases derelict.</P>
    <P>While the so-called future viability of the Dublin bus service seems to be related to whether or not one-man buses can be agreed upon with the trade unions, the increases proposed will reduce fare paying passenger numbers because it will be outside their capability to pay the increased fares in <Col N="538" /> many instances, the massive increases which were announced as having gone to the Prices Commission recently.  In particular, this will happen in the outer suburbs because the proposed increases will make the cost of bus travel higher than the cost would be if people were to share private cars and commute in and out to the city to work or otherwise.  The tendency will be to utilise this form of transport because of the exorbitant cost of CIE fares on the buses in this city.</P>
    <P>We say the Government must now call a halt to these proposed increases. A comprehensive energy and transport plan should be formulated and should have been formulated after the oil crisis three years ago.  We need a wide-ranging examination based on national and local needs.  This is vitally important and urgently needed. As we all know, circumstances have altered radically since the energy crisis in 1973 and the need for such an examination has been evident to us and to many other people.  I suppose it was too much to expect that something so necessary and positive would be initiated by the Government.  From their performance since the oil crisis I suppose it is quite possible that something like that will be announced any day now because of the possibility of a general election in the not too distant future.</P>
    <P>People will know from experience that any such hurried announcement by the Government after four years in office is just another means of grabbing the headlines in an effort to woo the voters.  This examination should have been carried out over the past three years.  This has not happened and the people will readily appreciate that fact. For far too long the public have suffered under a policy based on tax, more tax and more tax again in order to reduce consumption.  It has not reduced consumption but has caused massive inflation.  This has definitely been the policy on energy and oil products.</P>
    <P>We had the infamous 15p extra tax on petrol about two years ago which was introduced out of the blue on top of the increases imposed by the multi-national oil companies and the OPEC countries.  They were bad enough and <Col N="539" /> drastic enough without further introduction of massive taxation by the Government on all those products. This taxation failed to reduce consumption. I do not know whose idea or whose policy it was, or who believed that if you increased prices you would reduce consumption.  Instead more and more inflation was created.</P>
    <P>Increasing CIE fares at this time will be inflationary and, in the short term, will discourage the use of CIE services, particularly in city areas where the increases are likely to be most severe because more people in cities tend to use CIE services than in rural Ireland where they have not been as readily available.  We put down this motion in an effort to highlight what it is threatened will happen.  We cannot prevent it from happening but, at least, we can draw the attention of this House and the people to what was publicised in the newspapers and the type of proposals now before the Prices Commission.  We see no justification for these drastic increases.  We cannot discourage the Prices Commission but we can try to discourage the Government from imposing these drastic increases and having them duly granted by the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  The public cannot bear any further increases.  They will lead to a reduction in the use of CIE services which, in turn, will reduce CIE revenue.  We do not see what this can possibly achieve for CIE.</P>
    <P>Last week we had a debate about a railway line the Board decided to close down.  If this policy is continued, we will probably be debating closures every week or every two weeks.  Now is the time for a proper re-examination and assessment of the functions of a public transport system not only in rural Ireland but also in our cities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick, Cavan) Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Cavan</i>): I move the following amendment:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;notes that CIE's application for an increase in fares has been accepted by the National Prices Commission and recognises that taxpayers <Col N="540" /> in general will subsidise CIE to the extent of £30 million this year&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barrett has given a number of reasons for moving this motion condemning the exorbitant increases in rail and bus charges.  Having listened to him, I have come to the conclusion that putting down this motion and debating it in this House are an exercise by the Opposition is a luxury to which it is entitled to indulge, that is, the luxury of calling for more public expenditure in the form of subsidies, calling for the continuation of two man buses, as Deputy Barrett appeared to do, calling for a continuation of lines which are uneconomical and which can be replaced by other forms of transport, calling on the Government to engage in all this type of expenditure while at the same time refusing to support the Government proposals necessary to raise the funds to finance them.  That is one of the luxuries in which the Opposition are entitled to indulge.  It is probably the only luxury an Opposition have and they are welcome to it.</P>
    <P>In his opening remarks Deputy Barrett referred to what might be regarded as the golden days of transport when people were proud to work in transport companies.  I am sure many people are still proud to work in a national transport system. If Deputy Barrett is to find the really golden days of the railways, he will have to go back a long time.  At the beginning of this century or the end of the last century railway shares were looked on as a gilt-edged security.  There were wise men at that time who invested their money in ordinary railway shares and took the precaution of buying preference shares in Guinness.  Railway shares were looked upon as a gilt edged security, but all that changed.  At that time there were few motor cars; in most counties you could count them on your fingers and toes.  As things developed all that changed and when we came into the thirties railway stock which cost £100 was not quoted on the Stock Exchange.  The railways were out of business.  People who <Col N="541" /> invested their money in railway stocks and shares which had appeared to be gilt edged were bankrupt; they had put hard earned money into them and left their dependants with nothing.</P>
    <P>That situation changed and developed until we reached the forties. At that time it seemed as if railways were about to fold up and as if there would be no public transport in the country.  It is true and only fair to say that at that time the Dublin United Tramways were doing all right and were paying their way.  The railway companies all over the country, the Great Northern and the Great Southern&mdash;and there were two systems coming into the town of Cavan at that time&mdash;looked like folding up. Private transport for long distance journeys was still quite scarce or practically non-existent.</P>
    <P>I think there was a general election fought on the issue: I think the Transport Bill, 1944, was defeated in this House by the vote of an Independent Deputy from my own constituency.  A general election was fought on the Transport Bill and the Fianna Fáil Government came back to office.  They acquired for public purposes the railways and the Dublin United Tramways.  They set about economising and clipping and performing surgical exercises on the railways in order to make them pay. The methods they adopted were drastic.  They closed down 700 miles of railway line and they dug up the lines and sold them.  In this city they closed down the railway line from Harcourt Street to Bray on which in my student days I travelled daily between Harcourt Street and Dundrum. Every time I look at where that line was closed down I think in common with the great majority of the people in this city I believe, what an asinine performance that was.  But that is over and done with.  Even the very station house is sold and cannot be restored.</P>
    <P>That was the contribution of the last Government to modernising and making viable the railways.  I do not need to mention the railway from Tramore to Waterford or from Clonmel to Thurles: we had that <Col N="542" /> discussed here last week.  They were all closed down permanently in an effort by the Fianna Fáil Administration in their wisdom to make railway lines viable and make them pay.  It all goes to show how difficult the running of railways has been over the years.  I am speaking of a time between the beginning of this century and the late forties when privately owned motor transport suitable for long distance use was very scarce. Now railways and buses have to compete in the situation where practically every household has a motor car and some of them have two.  That makes it all the more difficult for public transport to operate and be viable.</P>
    <P>I said elsewhere that I regard public transport as being a mixture of commercial enterprise and social activity.  I believe that if it were to be treated entirely as a commercial enterprise many people dependent on transport in the country would be without it.  If it were to be run as a social welfare effort entirely it would cost the earth.  Therefore, I think you must have a fair mix of getting a reasonable return for the services provided and putting in a State contribution by way of injection to the social element.</P>
    <P>I regret as much as anybody that it is necessary to consider increasing bus fares and short distance rail fares.  The Government also regret it very much and are doing something about it and the best evidence of that is that the Government provided in the estimate of 1976 a sum of £28 million by way of State subsidy towards the running of the public transport system in order to keep down fares and cushion the people against increases.  In this year's Estimate we have provided a further sum of £30 million by way of the national transport system in order to subsidise fares and keep down costs to the general public.  In addition, the Government are paying over to CIE, to enable them to run the free school transport service&mdash;which they are running at a profit&mdash;£11 million.  They have paid CIE £6 million in order to finance the free transport facilities for the aged and the other categories of people statutorily entitled to them. <Col N="543" /> Therefore, the Government&mdash;I am wrong in saying the Government because it is the taxpayers of the country who are paying it&mdash;are paying to CIE a sum of £47 million, £30 million of which is paid directly by way of subsidy and £17 million paid for services rendered to the State.</P>
    <P>If the advice of the Opposition were accepted and if there is to be no increase in fares&mdash;and that is what I think Deputy Barrett requested&mdash;the taxpayer would have to contribute a further £13, £14 or £15 million this year towards running the national transport system.  Is that what the Opposition want?  Are they prepared to support me if I were to bring in a Supplementary Estimate, to ask the people, the income tax payers, the pint drinkers, the tobacco smokers and everybody who pays tax, to contribute a further £13 million or £14 million to CIE?  If they are, I can understand their argument but I do not understand a great deal of waffle about not increasing fares and the way this, that and the other thing should be run.</P>
    <P>There is, of course, another alternative&mdash;a massive cutback leading to mass unemployment.  I gather that is not what the Opposition want if we are to have regard to their motion last week and the speech made by Deputy O'Kennedy when he said &ldquo;of course, these railways could, and should be kept open and the way to do that is to provide the required finance&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Let us get down to realities.  Not so very long ago Fianna Fáil described themselves as the party of reality.  I have not heard that expression for a few years but it is not so long ago since they used that description.  There are only three ways to help CIE this year to make up the running cost over and above the £30 million being subscribed by the taxpayers in the form of income tax and through indirect taxation.  Another £14 million is required to make up for losses and for the national wage agreement.  I repeat there are only three ways that can be done.</P>
    <P>I want to come back now to subsidies because they can only be raised <Col N="544" /> by taxation.  Are Fianna Fáil prepared to support further taxation this year? Will some of the speakers who follow Deputy Barrett be specific about this and say &ldquo;Yes do not increase the fares; impose further taxation and we will support you&rdquo;?  If they do that they will be doing an about-turn on their attitude to the budget a few weeks ago.</P>
    <P>When the Minister for Finance introduced measures to reduce taxation by £50 million what was the reaction from the Opposition?  &ldquo;Not near enough; reduce taxation by £100 million.&rdquo;  These are the people who are talking about more subsidies.  Not alone were they not prepared to support the tax raised in the last budget to provide a subsidy for CIE to the tune of £30 million, but they wanted to reduce taxation by a further £50 million.  So much for subsidies and the likelihood of the Fianna Fáil Party supporting the necessary measures to provide them.</P>
    <P>Again I invite the speakers who will follow Deputy Barrett to say if they approve of a cutback in services to eliminate these proposed increases. Deputy Barrett was talking about a vicious circle.  We will have a vicious circle if we propose that because I am advised that in order to raise the necessary money to eliminate these increases, you would have to sack 2,700 people straightaway.  Is that what the Opposition want?  Are they prepared to support that?  If that is their alternative to CIE's proposal to increase these fares, they should say so.  Even if they did that, and if they consented and approved of sacking 2,700 CIE employees it would not end there because services would have to be cut back, the income those services are bringing in would disappear and CIE would have to sack a further 1,300 people to make up for that loss in revenue.  Therefore, there would be 4,000 people sacked.  If that is the alternative Fianna Fáil want they should say it.  It does not appeal to me nor to the Government.</P>
    <P>The only other alternative is the proposal to increase fares in a reasonable way.  A proposal has come before the National Prices Commission with <Col N="545" /> regard to fares and it is under consideration by the Government at the moment.  If Fianna Fáil this evening or tomorrow evening say which alternative they support it would, in my opinion, be of some help to the Government in their deliberations.  I do not imagine they will do that.  I imagine they will continue to indulge in the luxury of blowing hot and cold of saying &ldquo;Spend more money but do not raise taxation&rdquo;.  That is their luxury at the moment; that is their entitlement.</P>
    <P>A very small percentage of the people who use public transport pay the full fare.  That is as it should be. In Dublin, as Deputies opposite know, there are concessionary fares.  A 20p fare from Tallaght to the city centre costs 40p per day or £2 for a five-day week.  If a five-day concessionary ticket is bought that costs £1.60.  The purchaser might decide to buy an unlimited fare for a month.  This will cost him £9 and he can travel nonstop on buses and by rail.</P>
    <P>In his opening remarks Deputy Barrett seemed to suggest that is was the handling of the economy by this Government that had CIE so much in debt.  I reject that.  It could be argued that the money available and in circulation, and the number of people who have increased incomes and are spending it on purchasing their own transport is hitting the national transport system.  If we are to compare the performance of CIE with comparable cross-channel transport undertakings we find that CIE are doing reasonably well and are doing better than some cities across the water.  In the United Kingdom the rail subsidy increased from £75 million in 1970 to £340 million in 1975.  The bus subsidy increased from £10 million in 1972 to £135 million.  Our subsidies increased from about £6 million in 1971-72 to £13 million at the present time.  The bus fares in Glasgow increased between 1972 and 1977 by 125 per cent for certain fares, 143 per cent for others and 156 per cent for others. There may be certain circumstances prevailing in Belfast and I will not rely on it as an example.  In Liverpool the bus fares increased by 133 <Col N="546" /> per cent, 180 per cent and 200 per cent.  In Manchester they have increase by as much as 200 per cent. CIE fares have been increased, without the proposed increases, by 100 per cent and in respect of one class of fare by 86 per cent.  That is the performance of CIE compared with their counterparts in British cities.  It is obvious that the transport system is in trouble the world over.  It is in trouble in Britain and in Germany, as the Deputies opposite very well know.</P>
    <P>The next question I ask the House to consider is what are CIE doing to improve the situation?  I am not happy and the Government are not happy with the existing or the proposed fares. I believe the present management of CIE are doing a reasonably good job. They have engaged in productivity schemes and deals with the trade unions during the past few years. Their productivity deals have worked out well and have resulted in the work-force being substantially reduced without one enforced redundancy.  As the Deputies opposite know, delicate negotiations are going on at the moment between the management and the unions in regard to one-man buses.  I am afraid I must interpret Deputy Barrett's contribution as trying to bedevil those negotiations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> He asked in a sneering sort of way: &ldquo;What is the use of this?  If you cut down a bit of a line and put one man on a bus will that get you anywhere?&rdquo; He was playing the game, which the Opposition are entitled to play but which is not in the national interest, of trying to bedevil negotiations like that, which are being worked out in order to get worthwhile productivity deals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a limited debate.  I regard the national transport system as one that has an element of commercial enterprise in it and which has a social welfare input as well.  I believe it is the duty of the Government and of CIE to maintain a reasonable, efficient and economical service.  I believe that in going to the extent of £30 million in <Col N="547" /> taxpayers' money the Government are going as far as any Government can reasonably go in asking every person in the country, the poor as well as the not so poor, to contribute this sum in subsidy.  That is as far as they go. Notwithstanding the cutbacks that have taken place and the productivity agreements that have been negotiated, £14 million is necessary.</P>
    <P>I again ask the Opposition to say if they are prepared to provide that sum by subsidies and raise the necessary money to provide those subsidies by taxation.  If that does not appeal to them are they prepared to enforce the necessary cutbacks, wholesale sackings and consequential redundancies which will make up this £14 million?  If they are not, are they prepared to agree to the reasonable increase in fares which CIE have sought?</P>
    <P>Those are the alternatives open to the Government.  Those are the alternatives which the Government will consider.  They will not be put off a mature consideration of those alternatives by the failure of Fianna Fáil to be realistic or honest in this debate. They will not be put off a fair and a mature consideration of those alternatives even if Fianna Fáil come in here and play election politics with the situation in which CIE find themselves. The Government, having considered the present situation of CIE and the alternatives open to them, will come to a mature decision and make it known.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>I had hoped, in order to make my contribution helpful, to follow my usual custom of endeavouring in some way to enlighten the Government as to how they might improve a very bad situation.  If I say my good intentions and my traditional attitude in that regard have been disturbed by the appalling performance of the Minister, whose responsibility it is to help CIE out of their problems, I am sure it will not be taken as an understatement. It speaks for the delicacy of the case the Minister endeavoured to make when one sees that in 1977 he tried to attribute all the present transport ills <Col N="548" /> in the country to a mistake which was made, which he described with his customary authority as an asinine performance of some former CIE executive 25 to 30 years ago.  It speaks for the lack of forward-looking approach which we should have and which is necessary if we are to save CIE from all the trouble the Minister attaches to them.</P>
      <P>I listened to the contribution made by our spokesman, Deputy Barrett. The report will show that the Minister proceeded to distort what was a useful and helpful contribution by Deputy Barrett.  He set up cockshots of his own so that he could knock them down. He sat down then, happy in the thought that he is purer than pure in relation to his portfolio, that he is protecting it from the politicians who apparently should not be in the House and that if it is left to him and kept away from any contributions which Fianna Fáil speakers can make all will be well with CIE.</P>
      <P>I should now like to deal with the Minister's suggestion about what will arise if the terms of Deputy Barrett's motion are accepted.  The Minister has responsibility in this area and he is expected to have a horizon which comprehends all the advantages, disadvantages, difficulties and attractions which are open.  He has told us that in his vision there is no hope for CIE, there is no protection for the commuter in the implementation of this proposed 25 per cent increase unless we accept one or all of the following three propositions: (1) that there must be an increased subsidy of £14 million which, as far as he is concerned, is not on; (2) that we agree to the unemployment of 2,700 people or (3) that we have a cut-back in services.  The Minister maintains that Deputy Barrett wants those things to happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From what the Minister has said in reply to Deputy Barrett's motion it is obvious that he came in with preconceived ideas and did not listen to what Deputy Barrett said.  Deputy Barrett did not mention any of those three matters but rather expressed his fear that because of the application of the 25 per cent increase CIE would <Col N="549" /> be losing a volume of trade and traffic which would necessitate that which the Minister fears.  What Deputy Barrett presented is a situation which is acceptable to any businessman engaged in providing a service.  It is accepted that if there is a diminishing demand for a product any proposal to increase the cost of that product automatically means a slackening off rather than an improvement in the demand for it.  Does the Minister accept that proposition or does he accept that, as he stated, only very few people pay the full fare?  That is the Minister's philosophy of transport here, that the unfortunate working class man in my constituency under the proposed increase will have for himself and two school going children an additional 80p per week taken from his pay packet.  According to the Minister this is the type of person who should carry the burden and the Minister is happy to advocate that there should be no departure from that position.  That man contributes as much to the subsidy as anybody else.</P>
    <P>The three points made by the Minister are sacred to him.  He has told us that there cannot be any further increase in the subsidy, there cannot be any unemployment and there cannot be any cut-back in service.  He does not accept Deputy Barrett's point that if fares were reduced more activity would be generated and there would be a better intake and more revenue for CIE.  Deputy Barrett's motion reads as follows:</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann condemns the exorbitant increases in CIE fares which were recently announced.</P>
    <P>The Minister's amendment states:</P>
    <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;notes that CIE's application for an increase in fares has been accepted by the National Prices Commission and recognises that taxpayers in general will subsidise CIE to the extent of £30m. this year.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We gather from the Minister that because there can be no departure from the terms of his amendment, <Col N="550" /> which to him are principles but to us are nothing, the increases must take place.  When these increases were announced early in February the Fianna Fáil members of Dublin Corporation convened a meeting under the chairmanship of Deputy Seán Moore.  Arising out of that meeting we notified the National Prices Commission of our concern about this matter and requested that they hear us on it.  The National Prices Commission, in the course of a letter dated 21st February, notified us that they were prepared to meet us.  The last sentence of that letter stated that before setting a date for the meeting they wanted the group's suggestions submitted in writing.  Are we wasting our time doing that?  Has the Minister had consultations with the National Prices Commission? Apparently, he has given his blessing to the increase.  He does not see any way out of the 25 per cent increase. Has he indicated to them his acceptance of the case presented?  Are the National Prices Commission indulging in a time-wasting exercise with the Fianna Fáil members of Dublin Corporation who represent the biggest group on that body?</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will indicate to Government speakers what the position is before they reply to this contribution. The Minister turned a deaf ear to the case presented by Deputy Barrett and said his suggestions were not on.  To suggest that a greater volume of traffic can be generated by not applying such an increase, according to the Minister, is a fallacy.  In the scheme of his economic thinking, that is not on.</P>
    <P>The Minister indulged in prattle about Fianna Fáil wanting to disemploy 2,700 CIE workers.  We had from him the same type of prattle about Fianna Fáil wanting to save on the one hand and to spend more money on the other.  We also have had from him the equally puerile prattle about Fianna Fáil wanting a cutback in services.  People who know Fianna Fáil's record will realise that the Minister's accusations are concoctions, unfounded and deliberately used to defend what the Minister knows to be a delicate situation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="551" /> If CIE are to survive they will not do so by taking from the head of a typical family in my constituency, a man working in the central city area and sending two senior cycle students to college, 10 per cent of his weekly take home pay.  This man's net earnings, after tax amount to £40 a week and the proposed 25 per cent increase in CIE fares will mean another £1 a week out of his pocket, making a total of £4 per week.  That situation never arose under Fianna Fáil.  Never was a worker, skilled or unskilled, required to pay a tenth of his wages or salary to travel to work and to send two of his children to school.</P>
    <P>The Minister is insensitive to any suggestion from this side of the House. He did not want to hear the positive statement made by Deputy Barrett. When Deputy Barrett said we are living in difficult economic times and that we have been for the past four years, the Minister seemed to suggest that was a figment of Deputy Barrett's imagination.  Apparently he does not appreciate that what Deputy Barrett said is no more than a repetition of what has been said <i>ad infinitum</i> by the Taoiseach, by the Minister for Finance and by the Minister now in the House.  According to him, this is something Deputy Barrett thought up on the eve of an election.  The election will come, buíochas mór le Dia, and the electorate will speak.  None of us knows how they will speak but some of us have an idea of what will happen.</P>
    <P>The Minister suggested that Deputy Barrett tried to sabotage the one-man bus proposal.  That was the innuendo in the Minister's statement.  The record will show where the truth lies.  Perhaps what went on behind the scenes between the Minister and the NPC&mdash; obviously something did&mdash;is not what I suspect, but having listened to the Minister tonight I will be suggesting to the leader of our group in Dublin Corporation that I have a little more to do than to waste my time making suggestions to the NPC on this matter.  The Minister said tonight that these increases must be imposed and I can only assume that some of his officials <Col N="552" /> said to the NPC: &ldquo;Tell the Fianna Fáil people to come in, listen to them, but they are only wasting their time.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I speak with a certain parochial or metropolitan outlook because of my concern for the commuters of Dublin. Because of the unfair increases in fares. CIE are losing business and unless the situation is arrested the time is fast approaching when the only form of transport which will be attractive to the people of Dublin will be one completely subsidised from the Central Fund.  At the moment, only a very small percentage of the people who use CIE transport pay full fare and what I am seeking is a system that would be equitable, not one that breaks the backs of the people on whom we are all depending.</P>
    <P>There are aspects of the situation in Dublin that for the life of me I cannot understand.  Any economies that can be devised will contribute to the position which we all want, one in which the service will be cheaper.  There must be a departure from the traditional approach of CIE.  Over the last few months I have talked to people about CIE and I have heard certain epithets which I could not use in this House.  This is how the commuter feels. He simply wants to be transported from point A to point B, point B invariably being his place of employment, involving perhaps a journey of three or four miles.  The commuter is not terribly pushed as to the luxury or comfort of his journey.  Anything would be better than standing for half an hour on the windswept Navan Road waiting for a bus to come, a bus which when it comes is invariably full.  He would be happy to have a lift in a van or a car. I can be accused of saying that anything at all is good enough for the Dublin commuter but when we cannot have the ideal situation to which we would all aspire we will have to satisfy the immediate need of the commuter, even if that means using a vechile of lesser quality, of poorer upholstery. We will have to supply the service which I have seen operating in other capital cities, where possibly the the commuter will be required to stand. I do not know the position regarding insurance in other countries and how <Col N="553" /> it compares with the situation here.  I have heard a conductor say that they are not allowed to have more than three people standing.  This is a situation which needs to be examined in relation to the accidents, if any, that have occurred as a result of that.  We should look for a form of transport which will alleviate the suffering of the commuter and will help in reducing for him the agonising minutes and half hours standing on the roadside.</P>

      <P>We should examine the rank folly in the routing of the 12 bus which has a terminus in Cabra and also has a terminus on the far side of the city in Rialto.  Because of the appalling traffic situation it is absolutely impossible for these buses to maintain any schedule and we must have perimeter bases.  Having regard to the hardship which the commuter has endured over the last couple of years, he would be quite happy to be brought to within a few hundred yards of the centre of the city.  I regret that I have to talk in these terms and suggest these emergency-type proposals but as they say in Irish &ldquo;Nuair a cruann ar an gcailleach caithfidh sí rith&rdquo;.  Practically anything would be better than that which we have at the moment.  CIE are now indicating that their present services can be maintained only by the imposition of an additional 25 per cent while under the terms of the national wage agreement the workers get only 10 or 12½ per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is time to say to trade unions that their understandable concern for the continuing employment of personnel can be best served by generating more activity so that we can employ <Col N="554" /> more people.  They have evidence now of a fading and failing CIE.  If they are to protect employment and if people are to be catered for in an appropriate and desirable fashion there must be a reassessment of the whole position and of the approach of the Minister and the three options which he suggests.  If that is the best there is on offer then, go bhfóire Dia ar CIE agus go bhfóire Dia ar mhuintir Átha Cliath agus na daoine eile atá ag brath ar CIE chun iad a thabhairt ar scoil, ar obair, ar ospidéal nó áiteanna eile&mdash;iad sin nach bhfuil gluaisteáin acu, iad sin nach bhfuil rothair acu, iad sin atá leis na blianta ag iarraidh dul ó áit go háit agus iad ag brath ar CIE.</P>

      <P>I am saddened here this evening.  I came along and spent an hour and a half hoping that we might hear some words of wisdom from the Opposition about how we might solve the problem.  We are all concerned about increases.  We listened to Deputy Barrett for half an hour and then to Deputy Tunney for another half an hour telling us all about why Deputy Barrett said nothing.  He spoke about generating some sort of traffic; obviously he is not aware of what is happening in CIE.  It is easy to knock semi-State bodies.  This is the thing to do these days and the Opposition are now in the mood for knocking CIE.  It does not surprise me, though it was their own brainchild.  I think they got it under way.  Now that they are in Opposition and increases have to be made, they are doing the Pontius Pilate.</P>

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, it is proposed to take Questions Nos. 39 and 40 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="457" /> I am aware of the decision of the Supreme Court referred to by the Deputy which was in relation to an appeal from a decision of the High Court.  The Supreme Court directed that a decision of an appeals officer in this case should be declared invalid and that there should be a fresh oral hearing before a different appeals officer with a different medical assessor.  A copy of the judgement in question was received in my Department on 24th February, 1977, and is being examined.</P>
    <P>The information requested by the Deputy in relation to the claim in question is as follows: (i) the application for benefit was made on 13th December, 1968; (ii) the weekly rates of death benefit under the Occupational Injuries Acts payable to a widow since 13th October, 1968 (the date of death of the widow's husband) was £4.75 from 13th October, 1968; £5.25 from 2nd January, 1970; £6 from 2nd October, 1970; £7 from 1st October, 1971; £7.60 from 6th October, 1972; £8.60 from 6th July, 1973; £10.15 from 5th July, 1974; £12.30 from 4th April, 1975; £12.95 from 3rd October, 1975; £14.25 from 2nd April, 1976 and £14.95 from 1st October, 1976.</P>
    <P>The widow in question was, however, paid Widow's (Contributory) Pension from the date of her husband's death to 4th July, 1974, from which date she was awarded an Old Age Contributory Pension which she still receives; (iii) (a) a deciding officer gave his decision on the claim on 14th January, 1969; (b) oral hearings were held by appeals officers on 9th July, 1969 and 12th January, 1972; (iv) Prior to the Supreme Court hearing to which the Deputy has referred, the case was before the High Court on 24th June, 1970, and judgement delivered on 16th December, 1970, when the court directed that the claim be heard again by an appeals officer.  The case was again before the High Court on 1st December, 1972, and judgement was delivered on 28th May, 1973, when the court dismissed an application to have the appeals officer's decision set aside; (v) and (vi) Respondent's total legal costs amounted to <Col N="458" /> £809 and £284.41 has been paid in respect of plaintiff's legal costs; no estimate of remaining costs in respect of plaintiff is available.</P>

    <P>NOTE 2: The proceeds of increased tax on cycles and private cars imposed by the Finance Act, 1966, and the Finance (No. 2) Act, 1970; the proceeds of variations in road tax rates imposed by the Finance Act, 1973, and the proceeds of increased tax on private cars imposed by the Finance Act, 1976, are retained by the Exchequer and do not reach the Road Fund.  The amounts given in the table are inclusive of Exchequer retentions.  In the year 1976 the Exchequer retained £18,872,802. The Road Fund was, however, supplemented by voted money to the extent of £5,356,000 in 1976.</P>
    <P>NOTE 3: The amounts given in the table do not include small sums in respect of licence fees in respect of appliances and structures for servicing vehicles which are collected by licensing authorities but are lodged direct to the Central Motor Tax Account for eventual inclusion in Road Fund receipts.

      <P>There are at present 61 secondary schools in which the number of teachers in receipt of incremental salary from my Department is in excess of the number permitted by the quota regulations.  The number of teachers involved is 87.  Because of increasing enrolments many of these teachers will be absorbed within the quotas of their schools in the 1977-78 school year.  In any other case I will be prepared to examine the situation as sympathetically as possible with due regard to the particular circumstances of the school.  At present there are 131 schools in which the teaching staff is less than that which could be employed within the quota regulations. Secondary schools are private institutions and it would not be in accordance with normal practice to furnish the names of the individual schools in which the number of teachers is either in excess of or less than that authorised in accordance with the quota provisions.</P>

      <P>The following are the options in relation to the provision of a post-primary school in Leixlip: (a) a community school with a board of management comprising two elected parents, two representatives of the vocational education committee and two representatives of the religious authorities involved.  The board would be responsible directly to the Department and both the religious and the vocational education committee would be expected to make a financial contribution, or (b) a school under the control of the County Kildare Vocational <Col N="467" /> Education Committee with a board of management set up under section 21 of the Vocational Education Act, 1930.</P>
      <P>The main considerations which affect a decision are the wishes of the vast majority of the community and the method of financing a school.</P>
      <P>No decision has yet been taken on the date from which the post-primary school in Leixlip will be required but this matter is being kept under consideration. A decision in the matter will be taken shortly.</P>
