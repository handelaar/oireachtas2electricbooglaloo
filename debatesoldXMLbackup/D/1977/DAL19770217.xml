      <P>When speaking here the other day I was trying to identify the type of budget I considered this to be.  It is certainly not for the social welfare recipients, it is not a businessman's budget or a worker's budget. It will be particularly galling to union men when they realise the treatment they have received from the Government who are part comprised of the so-called Labour Party.  The Government as a whole have sat on the unions and on the individual working man, yet the Government boast of their labour achievements.  There are no labour achievements.  As regards the heavier end of the payee scale and the help it gives to industry, that is <Col N="1698" /> only window dressing and will involve us in far more expense.</P>
      <P>Least help has been given in this budget to the farming community.  This is an anti-farmer budget.  There is no pretension in it of helping farmers.  If anything it impedes the farming community from developing.  There has been a great deal of useful and useless talk on the question of the taxation of farmers.  When industry became an urgent factor in our development some 20 years ago the then Government encouraged industry to come into the country by asking foreign companies to set up business here on a tax holiday. This policy was followed by successive Governments because they saw the need for developing industry and the tax holiday is an incentive to set up industries.  The tax holiday has since been extended because of the vast amount of employment in and the development of industry.  That was a wise decision, a sensible and realistic way of introducing business into the country.  For some unknown reason this Government will not view agriculture as a developing industry.</P>
      <P>They are totally blind to the fact that the taking of an industrial outlook at agriculture has developed it enormously in the past 20 years.  Agriculture is an important industry in the economic development of this nation. Agriculture had a great distance to travel just to approach the level of agricultural development in other countries.  In some aspects we may be the most backward country in Europe, but on the other hand we have some of the best farmers in Europe.  Nonetheless we have an agricultural industry which must not alone catch up in the areas of development, but it must also keep abreast in the sections in which it is proficient and it must develop far ahead of that in the European context so as to be on a level with Europe within the next ten or 15 years.  If we put this case to the Government about an industry they would immediately give it all sorts of tax advantages because they would see the need for re-investment and they would voice the tax advantages to those who re-invest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But the Government for reasons best known to themselves will not regard <Col N="1699" /> agriculture as an industry and they certainly will not encourage anybody to re-invest in agriculture, our most important industry.  Indeed the tendency now is to get out of agriculture and certainly not to develop its potential to the fullest, and there is great development potential in agriculture. What sort of suicidal complex have we when we will allow a country of whose exports over 50 per cent are agricultural to be downgraded? That is the word to use at this stage because agriculture is an industry that has a vast opening for development and with even a little encouragement and incentive it could be developed to the point where close on 75 per cent of our total exports would be agricultural.  From another point of view we could simply develop it to that level and develop our other industries at the same time, but develop it we must above all other industries. Agriculture cannot stand still. It must develop, it must have investment and research and there must be growth in the numbers employed in it. It must have growth in cattle numbers and in the acreage put to useful arable purposes.  It must develop a dairy herd because, whether we like it or not, we cannot have a beef herd without a dairy herd.  It must develop the level and quality of our beef and particularly the level and quality of our breeding herd.</P>
    <P>In any context that must be regarded as industrial development and it must be given the incentive of industrial development, but our Government's refusal to do this is a suicidal policy. It is suicidal from the point of view of Government because the major arm of Government, the Fine Gael Party, always had a large measure of support among the farming community, particularly among the medium and large farmers.  I can testify how accurate that assumption is; certainly there were rural areas where they did pretty well.  Looking at it from the lowest level of politics it is distressing to see the mentality in a party which will allow that party to attack the vast majority of their own supporters, but it is easy to understand this when <Col N="1700" /> there is a tie-up between the Fine Gael and Labour Parties in this Government.</P>
    <P>They attack not only their own supporters.  When the farming community are attacked the entire country is attacked.  The Government say to farmers &ldquo;We will not recognise the development factor in agriculture.  We ignore the need to look to you as a business people.&rdquo;  This is a very sad state of affairs.  They go on to say &ldquo;We will not alone tax you but on top of that we will not give you any development funds.  We will give you an airy-fairy type of sentiment and let you develop that if you can&rdquo;.  But the necessary finance for agricultural development the farmers can forget about because it is not to be provided by this Government, an approach which I find difficult to understand.  I cannot understand either how they can profess that they have the interest of the country at heart when they take half of the industrial output of this country&mdash;and I include agriculture in that&mdash;and say &ldquo;Let us downgrade it&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Where therefore are we going to replace this national output?  It is a truism, but a fact nevertheless, that our farmers do not object to carrying their fair share of the taxes.  In years past they carried their share in many ways.  They carried their share patriotically.  The rural sector of our country was never known for any type of &ldquo;under-the-bed&rdquo; attitude during our worst years.  Where they did not take part in the national struggle in the early part of this century they provided shelter for those who did, and that was almost as dangerous as taking part.  In later years they were the worst sufferers in the economic war but again they carried their burden with the rest of the country and did not ask for more or less than the rest of the country got.  During the war years they more than helped this country by taking on the sowing of crops and the development of foodstuffs very often in lines they were not used to; nevertheless they learned. Then came the 1950s and the 1960s which saw the development of large farming organisations and one of the touchstones of those organisations <Col N="1701" /> was a patriotic drive to develop agriculture as an industry.  I was not saying that they deserve special praise or thanks for doing all this.  It is the duty of any Irishman to help his country in peace or war, but they deserve as much as their neighbour who lives in a city or town.  They have given a great deal of money, time and effort to the development of agriculture as an industry, and there-by the development of the nation's economy.  They deserve encouragement and they are not getting it from the Government.</P>
    <P>The taxation of farmers has been based largely on the notional method. No credit is being allowed for development and re-investment.  Re-investment in any industry and above all in agriculture, is essential for development.  I want to review the changes in the notional system as outlined by the Minister in his budget statement.  The £40 valuation has been increased to £65.  In a sense that is reasonable enough because it must be kept in line with the decreasing value of money. No one can doubt that, under this Government, money has decreased in value.  In the past we took £100 as a static figure but now the value of money is changing from day to day.</P>
    <P>The figure has been increased in one budget by over 50 per cent.  This is a very large figure, indeed.  Allied to the increase from £40 to £65 valuation is the drop in the valuation level from £100 to £75.  The Minister said this was done in order to bring into the tax net some farmers who were not in it previously.  That is not an honest suggestion because it does not do that.  It imposes a double burden on them.  It increases the burden on the man with the higher valuation, and it compounds the burden on the man with the lower valuation.  It may be difficult to feel sympathy for a man who owns a few more acres than his neighbour, but we should have sympathy for the man with a smaller acreage and a lower valuation who is being salted in this budget.  He has been brought into a much more troublesome net because he has to pay double the rate of what farmers paid last year even though they may have more land.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1702" /> The Minister may say this is an equitable system of taxing farmers, but I do not agree.  It is an exercise in hypocrisy by a Government who have become famous for hypocrisy, and it has been carried out by a man who is the chief spokesman on hypocrisy. What was done by the farming community in the 1960s will be a pale shadow of what the farming organisation will do in the months ahead because of this penal taxation and they realise fully how they have been attacked in this budget.</P>
    <P>I hope the Ceann Comhairle will forgive me for dealing at such length with the agricultural sector but I do so for two reasons.  One is that I am responsible for a large number of farmers in my constituency.  Secondly, they have been neglected and attacked in the budget.  There is no way in which this Government can claim the loyalty of the farmers either to themselves or their parties.  They have been attacked in other ways as well but, then, so was everybody else.</P>
    <P>Social welfare costs, which have risen dramatically, have been tied to the whim of the trade unions.  This brings me to an interesting attitude on the part of the Government.  They now tell us that being elected to the Dáil is not enough.  Under the Constitution we are elected through free and open elections which are open to all members of the community but according to the Government that is no longer enough.  You must join a trade union, because the trade unions have the final say so far as the Government are concerned.  This budget hinges on the whim of the trade unions. If they agree to it the Federated Union of Employers have to be consulted, and if they agree to it there is still another factor, the Government as an employer at the negotiation table.  This budget depends on those three factors getting together.  Therefore the taxation concessions in the budget are dependent on the whim of the trade union movement and the decision of the Employer-Labour Conference on the wages settlement.</P>
    <P>The vote of a trade unionist at local level may not be very significant.  It is passed on to national level and eventually <Col N="1703" /> to the delegate at the negotiating table and by the time that happens the local decision may be very much diluted. The people have lost the right of going directly to their public representatives because their votes are no longer final in the House of the Oireachtas.  The Minister for Finance may introduce a budget setting out income and expenditure for the year provided the unions, the employers and the Government as an employer eventually agree.  This is an entirely new concept in Government which might be interesting if it were not so very dangerous.  It opens the Oireachtas to the idea of a third house. I wonder do the people want a third house.  Do they want three factors in Government, the Dáil, the Seanad and the Employer-Labour Conference?  It is high time this question was brought before the people by way of a change in the Constitution.  Perhaps it is time for a referendum.</P>
    <P>I am not trying to introduce farce into the debate but I think the budget has come to that.  A third element has been brought into the Government.  We may have an opportunity of airing our views in the Dáil on this subject but we must first await the approval of the third factor.  The introduction of this third factor in my opinion is not permitted by the Constitution and the matter was never decided by referendum or otherwise.  If the people want it, so be it; but until they have expressed their view in favour of it, it should not be introduced. The Government if they are worthy of the name should be able to make their own decision as to what is best for the country and should not be dependent on the whim of an outside factor or a third house.</P>
    <P>Therefore, this is a ridiculous question. It can have no good effect on the position of the Government and in my view it will earn a proper retribution from the electorate when they get the opportunity which I hope will be in the very near future.</P>

      <P>No, I am talking very seriously about a serious matter.  I am <Col N="1704" /> trying to develop the argument that the taxation relief in this budget is dependent on decisions taken outside the House and the Government.  In my opinion that is a very serious business.  I have no doubt Deputy Collins will have an opportunity to speak later.</P>

      <P>Whether in Government or in Opposition we have a duty to represent here the interests of our people and because they probably have the least resources our responsibility falls more on the side of the poorer sections.  They deserve our attention before all else.  That does not mean that we victimise anybody who happens to have a few pounds more for which he worked hard in an effort to improve himself and his financial position.  We must never victimise enterprise without which the economic future is blank.  It has been the Government's habit over the past couple of years to victimise enterprise. Finally, in an election year such as this they begin to see their folly but see it only in the purely selfish terms that they are unlikely to be re-elected. Be that as it may, the poorer sections got a very raw deal.  The postage stamp was increased in price dramatically, more than 10 per cent.  One must be careful in using the telephone because it is now only for those who can afford it and fewer people can readily afford this luxury.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Within the limited time at my disposal I have dwelt on a few aspects of the budget.  There are many others which no doubt will be taken up by my colleagues.  Every Government speaker in this debate so far has spoken about the increases granted to social welfare recipients and the Government have boasted about them. If we examine these increases and look at the rate of inflation over the last 12 months, which the Government were unable to halt, we will see that they are very small.  If we look at inflation which has been running at the rate of 22 per cent per year over the last three or four years, and at the recent dramatic and steep increase in the price of coal, we will realise just <Col N="1705" /> how miserable the increases given to social welfare recipients were.</P>
    <P>Let them compare the amount they get now in real terms with the amount they got during the last term of the Fianna Fáil Administration and they will realise that they were better off under Fianna Fáil than they are now under this Coalition Government part of which&mdash;the Labour Party&mdash;have as their policy the protection of the poorer sections of the community. When one examines their record with that of Fianna Fáil Governments one will realise which Government protected the poorer people.  Even taking the latest increases into consideration these people were better off 12 months ago than they are now because this Government were unable to control prices.  This budget has been termed an election budget.  This Government are a dismal failure because they have been unable to produce an economic plan for the future.  They are going from one crisis to another hoping something will happen to bring them out of the financial doldrums in which this country finds itself.</P>
    <P>In the early days the Coalition blew their trumpets and said they had some of the best educated men in the country as part of their Government. How can they say that their mismanagement over the last four years has been a demonstration of intelligence?  It has not.  At worst, it was a demonstration of hypocrisy and stupidity.  It is a demonstration of how one can misuse the national attributes and abuse the people through incompetence in the handling of their affairs. It is a demonstration of failure because who else turned their backs on so many of the people and still said &ldquo;We serve you&rdquo;?  It is a demonstration of ineptness from beginning to end.  This is not a budget, it is a panic-striken fumbling with the finances of the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamBurke" hpid="Mr. L. Burke Mr. L. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a small country and is directed by the flow and ebb of the tide.  Despite worldwide economic depression, this Government have done an excellent job of running the country over the past four years.  Facts, however unpalatable, must be faced.  We have passed <Col N="1706" /> through the worst economic depression the western world has witnessed for over 50 years.  It is necessary that I stress this fact at the outset for various reasons.  First, Ireland has to contend with a position not of her own making. As a small export dependent economy we are badly hit by the worldwide recession in economic activity.  Because of our size and vulnerability we have suffered in many ways more than any other country.  Secondly, while the Government's economic policy has consistently been to try to safeguard employment and living standards at the expense of considerable budget deficits, there are limits to such a policy.  Thirdly, now that the long awaited economic recovery has come there can be no assurance that it will restore fully the patterns of growth to which we were accustomed in the sixties.  These limitations on the Government's freedom of action mean that the highest priority had to be given to tackling the one economic problem that is to some extent within our control, namely, inflation.</P>
      <P>The declared objectives of the Minister for Finance are to maintain and improve economic growth, to encourage greater enterprise, increased productivity, higher employment, to make the agricultural sector pay a fairer share of taxation, to reduce our dependence on borrowing and to maintain the real value of social welfare benefits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The following are some examples of the effects of improvement in social welfare.  When this Government took office on 14th March, 1973, a contributory old age pensioner had to be 70 years of age with an adult dependant to get the paltry sum of £10.35 per week.  From April next a contributory old age pensioner with an adult dependant will get £24.40 per week and from October next £25.60 per week with the qualifying age reduced to 66 years, also from October next.  At present a married man with three children drawing unemployment benefit is getting £26.80 per week; from April next he will receive £30.60 per week and from October next £32.15 per week and in addition he may be entitled to pay-related benefits.  From April next a <Col N="1707" /> widow or deserted wife with three children in receipt of a contributory pension will get £25.35 and in receipt of a non-contributory pension she will get £23.45 increasing to £26.60 and £24.65 respectively in October.</P>
    <P>An old age non-contributory pensioner can now earn up to £6 per week and will be entitled to full non-contributory pension from April next of £11.75 per week and from October next of £12.35 per week.  Under the previous Government if that pensioner earned as much as one penny he would not be entitled to any non-contributory pension.  A married couple over 67 years of age will get £23.50 increasing in October to £24.70.  From April next an old age pensioner living alone will get an extra £1 per week which is essential for people in that category. Invalidity pensioners, subject to the usual conditions, will be entitled to free travel, free television licence and free electricity from April next.</P>
    <P>A widow or single woman to qualify for unemployment assistance must have 52 contributions paid over the four preceding years.  I am glad to say that the Minister has now reduced the number of contributions to 26.  All in all, this Government have done more for social welfare recipients than any other Government since the foundation of the State.</P>
    <P>I now come to the subject of rates. As part of the 14-point programme the present Government have removed the housing subsidies and health charges from the rates to the tune of approximately £90 million.  Were it not for these concessions the ratepayers of Cork city, which I represent, would this year be paying £15.45 in the £ compared to £9.40 in the £ which they are now paying.  The Government will now pay 25 per cent of all domestic rates.  Rates due for the first half of the year must be paid in full but the rates due for the second half will be reduced by 50 per cent.  The Minister must be congratulated for giving this rates relief which the people wholeheartedly endorse.</P>
    <P>The <i>Newsletter</i> of the Confederation of Irish Industries in summing up the budget states:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1708" /> The overall budgetary policy is welcomed by the Confederation. The public capital programme will undoubtedly raise employment and together with the income tax reductions will help to maintain the buoyancy of domestic demand.  The budget, too, has provided more money for industry not only through its increased grant allocations but by the overall reduction in corporation profits tax&mdash;which was a necessary prerequisite to investment.  It is hoped that those industries which have been hardest hit in the past three years may find conditions improved and help them get back to profitable enterprise, and that those who are able will increase the level of investment and output so that the economy may be able to come closer to the necessary growth rates required for economic and social development.</P>
    <P>I believe that the budget meets these objectives.  The Minister's package of tax cuts, rates relief and investment in job creation exceeds what was promised in advance.  The trade unions have reacted cautiously and have complained that the new tax concessions still do not do enough for those on lower incomes, but the Government have not only met their obligations but have also moved to increase employment.  They have raised the food subsidy, which is now costing about £48 million.  They have spread the tax net of farmer taxation and dealt fairly with recipients of social welfare benefits.  All these things should in my opinion create a favourable climate for acceptance of the draft national pay agreement.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance has called this an incentive budget whilst the Opposition called it an election budget. I honestly believe that the Minister's description is the fair one because the incentives are there to give a much needed stimulus to the economy.  If other favourable conditions follow, such as wage restraint, industrial peace, lower interest rates and flourishing world trade, then this budget will mark a most important stage of our way back to real economic wealth.  I am glad to see that the bank rate has fallen this morning by ¾ per cent.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1709" /> I should like to thank the Minister for Finance for his handling of the nation's purse strings over the past four years.  I believe he has steered the economy through several crises, surviving abuses and other interference from the Opposition and from the press.  He has brought the Department of Finance to a high level of performance and maintained its integrity and freedom.  I congratulate the Minister on his good work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Meaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Much has been written and said during the past few weeks about the budget and it is right that some of the back bench Deputies should also have their say.  At this stage we are able to assess the reaction to the budget and most people have come to the conclusion that there are no real benefits to be gained.  They see all around them rising inflation, high unemployment and a trade deficit which was worse than ever in the month of January.  Previously they had listened to the Minister for Finance telling them that the recession is over and that he does not want to hear any more about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My good friend, Deputy Liam Burke, said that we are now on our way back, but we are on our way back from a situation where things went very wrong.  This Government have made many mistakes.  Since 1973 this country has been mortgaged to the hilt. The national debt has almost trebled. At that time Deputy L'Estrange was tired from shouting about our national debt which then stood at approximately £1,387 million; today it is in the region of £3,000 million.  From every £3 raised in taxation, £1 must be used to pay for our national borrowing. This cannot continue.  The economy was mismanaged and grave mistakes were made.  The Government themselves admitted that they had not got the money when they said in October last year that they could not give increases to certain social welfare recipients.  All of a sudden we turned the new year, good spirit in our hearts after Christmas, and we are told that the recession is now over.  It is far from over.  There is an article in this morning's <i>Irish Times</i> written by Paul <Col N="1710" /> Tansey, the economic correspondent. He stated:</P>
    <P>Ireland recorded its worst-ever visible trade deficit in January. Figures released last night by the Central Statistics Office show that the value of goods imported during January exceeded the value of exports by over £90 million.  If this trend were to continue throughout 1977, then the trade gap, the excess of imports over exports, would be in excess of £1 billion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. R. Ryan) Richie Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. R. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy I am sure will appreciate that the nature of the imports is important. A good deal of our imports is machinery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJVMeaney" hpid="Mr. Meaney Mr. Meaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Meaney</NameTxt>
      <P>He further stated in this article:</P>
      <P>This could lead to serious balance of payments problems later in the year.</P>
      <P>We had a trade deficit in January of almost £90 million, which is almost £3 million per day, £1 per person including man, woman and child.  What is the Minister doing about this?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the major items imported is a turbine for Bord na Móna.  We either import a turbine or we do not increase our energy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJVMeaney" hpid="Mr. Meaney Mr. Meaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Meaney</NameTxt>
      <P>There are other things involved.  We had to import those in the past and we had not the grave deficit we have now.  I admit that import figures can vary from month to month.  If this trend continues for the year where will we land ourselves? This economics correspondent goes over the various facts and says that, perhaps, some of it is due to the recovery, which is what the Minister is talking about, more of it is due to the decline of sterling during 1976 and still more of it is due to the continued high rate of inflation which we have not controlled.  The economic correspondent later made the statement:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally, the continued high rate of inflation in Ireland has probably led to Irish manufacturers losing sales both in the domestic and export markets, as Irish goods become <Col N="1711" /> more expensive relative to the cost of goods produced elsewhere.</P>
    <P>That is a fair summing up.  There are no signs that the recession is over. Unemployment is still increasing.  We have a recorded figure of over 118,000 but there are many more not recorded.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil have for a long time been pressing for some easing of the income tax burden payable by the ordinary working people.  It is a very heavy burden at the moment.  A person working in a food processing plant remarked to me that there were two people paid for one job.  I asked him how was that and he replied that he was paid and out of his money another man was paid social welfare benefit of some description.  His remark referred to the high rate of income tax he had to pay every week.  He said he had a good income but that income tax took a fair proportion out of it.</P>
    <P>People all over the country had been pressing for an easing of the income tax burden paid by ordinary working people.  Every party had been pleading for an easement of this burden.  Anybody who thinks he is a socialist, a Member of this House and a follower of the Government and who looks at the chart presented with the budget will surely shake his head and say that he has qualms of conscience about voting for it.  If we look at the category of people who get the various benefits we see that the Government have brought in a new category, that is, people on certain levels of income who are better off single than if they were married.  These people gain more by being single than being married with two children.  Down the country we would say about that that the Government believe in living in sin rather than encouraging people to get married.</P>
    <P>I doubt if there are many people in the £20,000 bracket.  Does the Minister think it is right that they should save £2,088 if they are single, £2,048 if they believe in marriage and only a saving of £1,967 if they have two children?  There is no allowance in this budget for people at any level who have families.  We have always believed in the family.  The Irish family believe <Col N="1712" /> in a man and wife living properly together, rearing a family and the State giving whatever help it can to house them.  Not alone are the housing grants gone from those people but they can hardly qualify at all for them.</P>
    <P>When we come to the new structure of income tax those people are almost completely wiped out.  A single man in the £2,000 income bracket will have tax savings of £50.  If he is married he will get £57.40.  Is it any wonder the women organisations throughout the country think they are being discriminated against?  There is only an allowance of £7.40 for that poor woman.  If the person in the £2,000 income bracket has two children the tax savings are only £48.60.  Can the Minister or the Government stand over a man earning £40 a week who has two children now getting tax saving of £48.60, whereas if he is single he will get £50 and a married man without children £57.40?  There is no incentive for anybody to rear a family when it comes to this budget.  The Minister should have a rethink on this.  We have always boasted of being a good family country.  This Government are breaking down the harmonious relationship of marriage by their tax savings in the budget.  I know that Deputy Collins will agree with me.</P>

There is no tax allowance for those children.  Families all over the country will suffer as a result of this. The only man left is the Minister for Defence.  He is the only pious man the Government have now and I cannot see how he agrees with this.  The Minister should bring about a change before this budget is passed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Meaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister was thinking of getting rid of that but pressure all over the country caused him to change.  A tax saving of £2,000 <Col N="1713" /> is a large sum of money to give to a person in the £20,000 bracket.</P>
      <P>We should compare that figure with an income of £2,500 and then consider what that man is getting from society now and what he got some years ago.  Even if that man has four children he gets no help from the State.  He does not qualify for a state grant if he wishes to construct his own house nor does he qualify for a supplementary grant.  He does not qualify for an SDA loan because his income is in excess of £2,350.  How is he to live?  He is badly hit.  That shocking low income limit should be increased considerably.  In January, 1976, the Minister for Local Government made an order specifying that anybody with an income of more than £2,350 would not qualify for a supplementary housing grant.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Finance who is involved in the negotiations on a new national pay agreement has told us that the tax savings for a single man this year will be £62.80 per annum while for a married man the tax saving will be £62.40.  For a married man with two children the tax saving will be £57.60.  Is it any wonder that the latter type of person is fed up with the present regime and is clamouring for a change?  We have heard a lot of talk about tax savings and wage agreements but those in power never consider the person who must use a car to get to work.  Many people must travel 40 miles round journey to and from work but they do not receive any allowance.  It is not possible for everybody to live adjacent to his employment.  Only a few small cars will do 40 miles to the gallon today and, again, they suit the single person. The result is that a lot of people pay more than £1 per day to get to work. Such people are at a terrible disadvantage. The tax concessions or the new pay agreement will not be of much use to them.  We all want national pay agreements but we must look at the realities of the situation.  It is not surprising to hear married men with four children saying that they would be better off drawing unemployment assistance or benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of children's allowances <Col N="1714" /> I should like to remind the House that it is not too long since somebody, when thinking aloud, suggested that children's allowances be got rid of.  That would be a shame.  It is right that children's allowances be paid to the mother of the children because in most cases it is better spent by the mother.  To substitute that allowance either by way of income tax savings or in a national pay agreement would be ridiculous.  The money is often used by the less well off to help pay the monthly grocery bill or to buy clothes for the children. The Government should get rid of the notion of doing away with children's allowances.  Long may it be the right of the mother to have such allowances. Hands off the children's allowances.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael have claimed great credit for this budget and Deputy Liam Burke boasted about what he described as improved social services. In this connection I should like to quote from a letter published in the <i>Cork Examiner</i> on Tuesday, 15th February.  The lady who wrote it is a colleague, in politics, of Deputy Liam Burke but yet she has her priorities right.  She is chairwoman of the National Association of Widows in Ireland and did her best to be nominated as a Fine Gael candidate in a Cork constituency.  I admire her for being interested in politics but I also admire her for adopting an independent stand in relation to social welfare increases.  That lady lobbied us when we were in Government and I should like to quote what she had to say on behalf of the widows of the country:</P>
    <P>Any increase which is a percentage increase hits those on lower income&mdash;it widens the gap in cash terms between them and the better-off.  Widows, for instance, who, a year ago, were drawing at 67, £1.00 a week less than old age pensioners, are now drawing £1.30 a week less.  All widows are drawing less than AOPs but the injustice is particularly noticeable when they are old age pension age themselves.  The new rates are OAP, £13.90; widows, £12.60 if they are receiving maximum contributory <Col N="1715" /> pensioners.  Many widows draw far less.</P>
    <P>The budget was just a facade, a pretence of helping the less well-off.</P>
    <P>It is signed: Maureen Black (Mrs), National Chairwoman of the National Association of Widows in Ireland. That lady has shown that there is discrimination against widows.  We have heard a lot of talk about the increases given in social welfare compared with 1973.  We all knew that once we entered the EEC the age limit for an old age pension would be reduced within five years to 65.  One year has been lost in that battle because the age limit has been reduced to 66 only.  What happened to the £35 million bonanza resulting from our entry to the EEC?</P>
    <P>Increases to social welfare recipients are not keeping pace with inflation. I should like to tell the Minister that at a meeting in Cork recently the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for agriculture proposed that steps be taken to get the Government to pay a coal allowance to old age pensioners.  That is a castigation of what the Government are doing for these people.  We have also been told that the waiver of rates scheme is to be extended this year.  I should like the Minister to clear up a problem about the free fuel and waiver of rates scheme.  Can we in rural councils expect to be recouped from the Central Fund?  These schemes were of immense benefit to rural local authorities.  Dublin, Cork and other local authorities can get their money back.  Does the same apply to us?</P>
    <P>Rates are still going up although the health charges are being financed by the Central Fund.  Up to three or four years ago people got value for the rates they paid on their properties and there was little talk about ability to pay.  Fianna Fáil brought out a programme to get rid of rates completely on private dwellings and of course this copy-cat Government moved towards that, but only half way.  Can the Minister tell me if the quarter remission of rates will be bolstered in the next two years to cater for inflation? <Col N="1716" /> This year the Minister has not mentioned any concessions to local authorities in respect of amenity grants, and therefore we must take it that the rates will have to pay for them.  These grants enabled local authorities to help voluntary organisations to provide such things as playgrounds for the very young, community halls and pleasure grounds for the old.</P>
    <P>On the matter of health charges, we had good services when the rates were paying their share.  Now health services are non-existent in some areas at a time when the charges are met by the Central Fund.  We have no transport to hospitals and clinics for the old, the feeble and the very young. They now have to hire taxis and have to pay £12, £14 or £20 and then try to recoup that money from the health boards.  Most of our hospitals are understaffed at a time when there are fine strapping young nurses unemployed throughout the country. Hospital matrons are not permitted temporarily to replace nurses who are absent for one reason or another. Hospitals are not allowed to appoint temporary caretakers.  Our health services generally have deteriorated in the past four years and anybody living in a rural area will back me up in what I am saying.</P>
    <P>As well as that, our roads have been allowed to deteriorate terribly.  Some of our main roads are reasonably well kept, but minor roads, on which most of our ordinary rural people have to travel, are in a shocking state.  We are being told there is no money in State funds to finance road maintenance. Our minor roads are impassable because of potholes.  Indeed, a wag who saw a flock of wild duck flying over one of them on a rainy day said the duck did not know which side of the road to land on because both sides were covered in water.</P>
    <P>This year's budget is particularly noteworthy for lack of mention of the Old IRA.  They seem to be a forgotten group.  There are very few of them left.  They went out to fight so that we could have a Parliament of the kind we have today.  They are now the forgotten members of our society.  No <Col N="1717" /> Irish Government should be afraid to honour in a tangible form the men with 1916-1921 service medals.  No Government should be afraid to give each one of them at least £5 a week irrespective of his income.  People on the opposite side tell us we should not mention them at a time when we are sending ambassadors abroad to independence day celebrations in newly-independent nations.  The Government should not be afraid to honour the men who survived the GPO campaign and other such campaigns. That is the nation's right and the Government should never be afraid to organise some simple ceremoney at the GPO each year to honour these men and not to be leaving it to voluntary organisations and others.</P>

      <P>I am fighting for the men who fought to give us a free Ireland.  They have got very little in financial terms from the Oireachtas which they helped to create.  In most other budgets there was special reference to them, and I could quote from the records of both Houses.  What we have this year are references to Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution to take people's minds away from the real problems.  It is another election year gimmick.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister made no reference to any provision for school transport. Someone who was thinking aloud a few months back said there should be changes in the school transport system because, he alleged, there were abuses. I can quote the Fine Gael viewpoint from the <i>Corkman</i> of Friday, November 26th last.  At a Fine Gael meeting, reference was made to the school transport system and it was stated that &ldquo;The scheme as at present administered was blatant robbery&rdquo;.  That is how the scheme was described, &ldquo;blatant robbery&rdquo;.  &ldquo;Taxpayers would not object to free transport to national schools but in so far as transporting secondary and vocational school students free of charge it was simply ridiculous.&rdquo;  That represents the Fine Gael philosophy in my part of the <Col N="1718" /> country.  &ldquo;Many of these students spend the weekends at dances and it is only right that, if transport is provided for schools, they should be made pay their way under a new scheme.&rdquo; Senator P. Burton, a good friend of mine, said that the scheme was introduced without any attempt at planning or costing by Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <P>Obviously this Government are going to do away with the present transport system to our secondary, vocational, community and comprehensive schools.  If children in the 14 to 18 group are able to go to dances at the weekend, free transport will be completely out.  The Minister made no reference to that in his budget statement. He did mention children's allowances. It is obvious to me that school transport will get the hammer.  What about the children of the small farmer, of the agricultural workers and the council workers?  Some of these live 15 and 16 miles from schools.  If they have the brains are they not entitled to climb to the top of the academic ladder?  It will be a crying shame if school transport is done away with. It was the late Donogh O'Malley who brought this scheme in.  He did not go to the Arabs for the money.  The system was financed out of our own resources. Neither did the Fianna Fáil Government go into debt up to the neck or put on more taxes in budget after budget to provide for it.  I am stating the plain facts.  It is down here in black and white what the present Government will do about school transport.</P>
    <P>I am a farmer and I know the outcry against the Minister by the farming community.  He has provided very little under the disadvantaged area scheme.  This scheme is supposed to help farmers in the lower valuation areas mostly along the western sea-boards and in parts of the south. Actually you can find these farmers in any area.  You can find them in Kildare.  No proposal has been made to Brussels by this Government to bring these farmers into the scheme because the Government are unwilling to provide the necessary finances.  We get 35 per cent of the money from Brussels and we have to fund the remainder ourselves.  Every year names <Col N="1719" /> have been submitted for additions to the disadvantaged area scheme.  Should we talk of disadvantaged areas or disadvantaged farmers?  Small farmers, wherever they are, are disadvantaged. Brussels have never refused an extension yet but no request has been made to Brussels for many extensions submitted.  It was not Brussels that refused to do anything.  It was our own Government.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture has been accused in the last few days of not paying up the various grants.  The heading in today's <i>Independent</i> reads: &ldquo; `Cattle cash.  No election gravy train,' says the Minister&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>Good enough.  The Minister mentioned that farmers who supplied liquid milk were getting an increase of 7p per gallon.  In a farming supplement to <i>The Cork Examiner</i>&mdash;and I compliment them on it&mdash; there is a report by a correspondent who visited the liquid milk producers and asked them what they thought about this.  The report is in <i>The Cork Examiner</i> of February 17th.  It is stated that liquid milk producers are angry because of the long delay in granting them the necessary increases to maintain parity and they accuse the Minister for Finance of blocking on budget day because they were entitled to 3p a gallon since 1st October last: &ldquo;The anger of the liquid milk producers has been fuelled by the prolonged delay in granting the increases to maintain parity with their counterparts supplying milk to creameries. They have accused the Minister for Finance of blocking when he told the nation on budget day that he was granting an increase of 7p per gallon to them when they were entitled to 3p per gallon since October 1st last and two green £ adjustments should really have meant an increase of 7.86p per gallon.&rdquo;  That is what Dick Cullinance wrote.</P>
      <P>I do not think these men who supply milk to our cities and towns make any money over the winter, but they have to work 12 months the year round and they are out on Christmas morning and every Sunday morning. They have to keep up the supply of milk.  It makes no difference what happens their herds, whether they suffer the scourge of brucellosis or they are hit by bovine tuberculosis and have to sell out their herds, they must replace them immediately with other cows to keep up the supply of milk.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister was quite unfair when he said on budget day he was granting an extra 7p a gallon for milk.  The farmers should have got 7.86p per gallon a long time ago.  Their costs are <Col N="1721" /> increasing and all they want to do is to keep in line with everyone else. One man who had a herd of 55 Friesians lost £400 during the four-month period when he should have been getting the extra 3p.  It is not necessary for me to make any further comment.</P>
    <P>With regard to taxation on farmers, everyone accepts the principle that those who are in a position to do so should pay tax.  What we are arguing about is the way it is proposed to collect the money.  It is obvious that we should not impose taxes that will inhibit development and neither should we severely tax savings.  The present allowance of £70 which is not liable to tax is a very small amount. Anything in excess of that amount incurs heavy taxation and there is no encouragement to save.  Some years ago the present Government even tried to do away with the £70 allowance but they reconsidered the matter and the allowance was restored.  The amount should be in the region of £400 to £500.  Most people who save do so in order to pay for extra expenditure that may be incurred in their business.  We should help them to save rather than hinder them.</P>
    <P>One of the major complaints of farmers is that they cannot plan ahead. They do not know who will be taxed next year or what kind of multiplier the Minister will use.  In farming it is necessary to plan for months ahead. For instance, farmers must purchase fertilisers in the autumn rather than waiting until the spring of the following year.  In the budget the £100 PLV limit has been reduced to £75 and the question being asked is whether it will be reduced to £50 next year.  The Government have an obligation to tell their intentions in this regard.  It is generally accepted that the limit will be reduced to £50 or £60 next year and consequently many more farmers will be brought into the tax net.  Another question being asked is whether the multiplier will be increased to 100 or 110 next year.  The Minister for Finance has an obvious duty to tell the farming community what he plans to do in this area.</P>
    <P>The major complaint of farmers is that the income tax assessed for 1977-78 <Col N="1722" /> will become due for payment on 1st September, 1977.  That may or may not be all right if a person is operating on the notional system, but if he is not it will not be feasible to make the necessary calculations.  The dairy man will have a problem because his cattle will still be milking.  The remainder of the year could be a disastrous one or a very successful one for him.  It will also affect farmers who deal in grain because the crop will not be cut by then.  In addition the beet harvest will not be completed until the early days of January and consequently the final accounts will not be available until 1978.  How can such a farmer pay taxes in 1977?  Will it be the case that the money he will receive in 1978 will be carried into the accounts for the next nine months, thus mixing the business of two years?  The Minister was ridiculous when he said he could tax anyone in a year when the accounts would not be completed for another three months.</P>
    <P>It is thought that the Minister will change all of this as soon as the national wage agreement is signed.  It is said that when the Finance Bill comes before the House the Minister will tell us he will not charge the tax until the following February.  I do not know if there is any truth in that but the Minister should tell us what he intends to do.  People involved in the dry cattle trade will not sell their cattle until December and there is no way in the world they can make out their costings.  They can accept the notional system but that means they will have to pay for every £ valuation multiplied by 65.  In addition the Minister has abolished many of the items of costing that were allowed last year.</P>
    <P>The farming organisations have made certain proposals to the Minister and he would be well advised to listen to them.  They have stated they want to pay income tax, that they want to play their part with everyone else in funding the nation's finances.  However they have also pointed out that the system proposed will affect development. Agriculture is the backbone of the country and farmers should be helped.  It is my belief that there will never be more than 25 per cent of the farmers who will be able to pay income <Col N="1723" /> tax.  In the south the vast majority of the farmers have small farms and this applies also to the west.</P>
    <P>From the returns under the farm modernisation scheme it is obvious that only 2 per cent or 3 per cent of the farmers in some areas are developing or commercial and that most of them are classified as transitional farmers. Under the present regulations that means they cannot make a living out of their land.  When we talk of taxation of farmers we are referring to 25 per cent at the most who in due time will pay some tax or other. Those people probably own land which is very valuable but it is another thing to be able to get a decent living from the land.  It is rather like a situation where a person inherits a house with a valuation of £40 but whose income is only about £40 per week.  In such a situation that person would find it very difficult to pay the rates on the property. The Minister should reconsider this matter.  Deputy Noonan has dealt with this matter very competently and I do not wish to repeat his arguments. Nobody wants to pay tax on 1st September, 1977.</P>
    <P>People are concerned that the £75 will be lowered to £65 next year and that the multiplier can be increased from £65.  Last year the State hit the co-operative movement.  All co-operative societies should be given special concessions to help them to survive. The Minister should reconsider the farm taxation system.  It is ridiculous that it is payable on 1st September.</P>
    <P>Small farmers with a valuation of over £20 will not receive any social welfare assistance.  Farmers between £10 and £20 PLV are not to get any increase this year.  That is an injustice because some may have reasonable incomes but the majority have not.  The majority of farmers who have valuations under £10 own only six or seven cows or bullocks, and that is all they have to live on.  They are still trying to eke out a living and are in need of assistance.  If these people were included in the disadvantaged areas scheme, a worthwhile disadvantaged areas scheme, they might prosper.  It is only a matter of time before the <Col N="1724" /> Government remove their small supplementary allowances.  People in the rural areas have not got the benefit of public lighting and sewerage and many of them have no telephones. They live in isolation by modern standards but many of them are happy. Whatever money they have they spend in their own villages.</P>

      <P>The Government cannot take away the dole without giving the people something to live on.  Now that the school buses are being taken off the roads the people in rural areas will have the extra worry of trying to get their children to school.  Society should not shun those who were by accident of birth born on small farms in rural areas.  Society should devise a plan to provide them with the benefits enjoyed by other citizens.  Everybody shouts about removing the farmers' dole.  They point to the few who have taken advantage of it without considering the many who need it.</P>
      <P>When the budget was announced there was a great blare of trumpets. We were told that the recession was over, but it is far from over.  The national wage agreement is under ballot at present.  Any agreement that includes an inability-to-pay clause which can be enforced is not a true agreement.  The people will see the hypocrisy of this election-year budget. Many people, including the unemployed and the school leavers, have not gained anything from this budget. Last year we were told that there were schemes for school leavers but many of them are still unemployed.  When Fianna Fáil left office four years ago school leavers had a future.  The Government are trying to provide money for such schemes in an election year at the expense of previous years.</P>

      <P>The budget has been welcomed by most people.  It has not been welcomed by the Opposition, but that is to be expected.  They are entitled to criticise the Government. In four years the Government have introduced socially sound and industrially acceptable budgets.  The <Col N="1725" /> Opposition are upset by their failure to tackle many problems during their term of office.  I am afraid they are going to be upset for a long time because they are devoid of policies, talent and incentives.  It is generally accepted that they have condemned themselves to staying in Opposition.</P>
      <P>The last speaker talked about rates relief and the fact that the Government were abolishing a quarter of the rates on householders in the current year. He pointed out that under his party there would be no rates on domestic dwellings.  People will see through that statement because Fianna Fáil introduced that policy two weeks before the last election.  Prior to that they published a White Paper and said that rates were an essential part of the taxation system.  They have not acted responsibly.  They are split.  I do not know who the leader is, whether it is the supposed leader, Deputy Jack Lynch or Deputy Haughey, Deputy Colley or Deputy O'Malley.  One is confused with the statements that are issuing.  I do not even know who are the spokesmen in the various fields, because time and again a spokesman speaks for a spokesman.  I suppose in time they will sort out their problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The philosophy behind this budget is a welcome one.  For the past few years everyone has seen the effect of the world recession, the damage which has been caused to our industrial structure by the massive increases in oil prices.  There has been an unacceptable rise in the level of unemployment and inflation.  This has been caused partly by the oil crisis and partly by monetary instability in the western world and especially in western Europe.  This country suffers more, perhaps, than other because it has such an open economy and depends to a great extent on imports and exports.  We have the worst of both worlds.  We suffer while our imports rise in price and we also suffer when demand for our exports slackens.  Unfortunately, in the past three years the price of imports has risen at a rate which has damaged our investment potential at home and our export markets have suffered from a reduction in demand.  The results have been a recession in Irish industry and a <Col N="1726" /> serious increase in the level of unemployment in the State.</P>
    <P>It is against that background we must view the last few budgets.  I welcome this budget particularly because it tackles the two basic problems facing our society.  One is the need to give confidence to industry in order to encourage greater investment, and create an air of confidence in industry among producers on the home market and the second is the need to expand the export potential of our industries.</P>
    <P>The Minister is to be congratulated on the whole package he has presented in this year's budget.  He has also successfully protected the incomes of those people who are old and infirm and who depend on the State for a living.  I have heard the Opposition speakers moan and groan about our social welfare policy.  I think it is more in jealousy than anything else.  I do not intend to quote statistics in regard to the benefits, allowances and so on that have been given in the last few years because statistics can be twisted and presented wrongly.  However, I speak for many people as a public representative and I believe that those people who are in receipt of sickness, unemployment and other benefits are satisfied that they are substantially better off now than they were four or five years ago under the last Government.  It is thanks to the social conscience of this Government that that is the position.</P>
    <P>One of the other advantages of this budget is that it protects family living standards.  It is a householder's budget and the policies which have been adopted and which I will discuss in a few minutes go to the heart of the problem.  The tax allowances, the rates relief, the increase in children's allowances, are all very progressive and sound and will in no small way help householders not only to maintain their present living standards but to improve them.  Taking these householders' reliefs in conjunction with the hoped-for national wages agreement, there will be a substantial improvement in people's living standards over the next 12 months.</P>
    <P>I was rather amazed at Deputy Noonan's criticism of the National <Col N="1727" /> Employer-Labour Conference, the national wages agreement, and the attitude of this Government in that respect.  The Deputy's attitude was most irresponsible, and one wonders if that is the official Fianna Fáil policy in relation to the development of an incomes policy.  The Government's attitude, which I support fully, has been one of consultation, one of developing an incomes policy with the people involved, with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, with employers, with all those interested in the economy and its expansion.  That policy is in stark contrast to the jackboot-type policies which, apparently, from what Deputy Noonan says, the Opposition support.  However, I do not want to make a contribution which seems to be carping at the Opposition because I do not think they are of any significance. I would prefer to confine myself to the budget.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of the budget is the development of an equitable tax system.  Again, in relation to personal reliefs and the introduction of the new tax bands and the question of taxing farmers' incomes, the policy being adopted here is sound and equitable and deserves the support of the House. It is a policy that is understood by the majority of the people.</P>
    <P>I should like to turn now to four other aspects of the budget on which I have concentrated and which, in my opinion, will have the effect of tackling some of the problems in our society.  The measures taken to reduce household costs and, consequently, to protect family incomes and living standards, are generous.  This year the Exchequer will carry the cost of half the second moiety of household rates. This concession will result in a substantial saving for householders.  It will benefit not only people who own their own homes but also those who are tenants of local authority dwellings. It has been said often, both here and elsewhere, that our rating system is inequitable and requires revising. Perhaps in time rates on private dwellings can be abolished.  Such a development would be very sound but we must remember that revenue lost <Col N="1728" /> in this way would have to be found by other means.  Fianna Fáil talk about abolishing rates.  They have merely some sort of magic wand remedy for replacing the revenue that would be thereby lost.  In this budget the Minister has taken a first step at revising the whole area of rates.  This follows on our policy of transferring to the central fund, the health subsidy aspects of the rates.  Unfortunately, the effects of inflation countered our policies in this respect but the reduction in the rates payable this year will help to redress the situation.</P>
    <P>To be welcomed, also, is the extension of the rates waiver scheme.  This will cost the Government about £2 million in the coming year but it is a move that is desirable socially.  Many cases have been brought to my attention which concern old people or others, who through no fault of their own, found themselves in changed circumstances and who were finding it very difficult, if not impossible, to pay their rates.  Sometimes the loss of a spouse can result in someone being put into this situation.  In other cases the people concerned had been comfortably off but because of inflation had exhausted their savings and were too proud to seek help. Sometimes a social welfare officer has difficulty in convincing such people that they are entitled to a waiver of rates.  In these circumstances I welcome the extended scheme.</P>
    <P>The extension in respect of food subsidies will cost about £9,500,000 but this device should prove anti-inflationary. It is aimed at countering the effects of the CAP on food prices within the Community.  It is a measure that will help to keep the consumer index at a reasonable level. The British have been using such a measure for many years in an effort to counter the effects of inflation.  In time we may find that the British system in this respect is attractive in terms of countering inflation.</P>
    <P>All these measures combined with the new tax bands should prove very effective.  There is a substantial saving for income tax payers and this saving, together with the benefits that will accrue from the national wage agreement, <Col N="1729" /> will increase substantially the incomes of workers, including those who are self-employed.  This measure, too, will help to counter the effects of inflation in so far as family income is concerned.</P>
    <P>The Opposition have criticised the increases in personal taxation but our policy in this respect during the past four years has been successful.  This year's measures have a constructive part to play in the acceptance of a national wage agreement.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of the budget that has been welcomed widely relates to corporation tax reliefs.  Worth-while changes in this area are the reductions in the main corporation tax rates from 50 per cent to 45 per cent and from 40 per cent to 35 per cent.  This measure was needed in order to restore confidence among both large and small businesses.  The introduction of a reduced corporation tax rate of 25 per cent deserves to be commended.  It should prove an added incentive to firms to embark on investment programmes and to increase their level of employment.  We are experiencing a recovery from the recession.  This is due mainly to the taking-up of a substantial amount of the slack in industry and the situation should be improved further as a result of the introduction of the 25 per cent corporation tax rate.  I trust that this innovation will find favour with manufacturing industry. It is something that we can discuss in detail when the Finance Bill is before the House.</P>
    <P>Allied to these changes in taxation are the increases in the tax thresholds for small businesses.  The present thresholds of £5,000 has been increased to £10,000&mdash;that is for the purposes of the 40 per cent rate&mdash;while the £10,000 threshold has been increased to £15,000 in respect of the 50 per cent rate. These are marginal changes but they will help the expansion of small businesses in the current year.  Allied to the reductions in these tax bands, the capital allowances are also being extended to expenditure incurred up to the 31st March, 1979.  That is a guarantee for the next two years.  It is a package deal which is very attractive&mdash;100 per cent initial allowance <Col N="1730" /> on new plant and machinery, free depreciation for new plant and machinery, 50 per cent initial allowance for expenditure on industrial grievance and so on.  These are necessary for the expansion of industrial activity.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister might consider looking further ahead and evoking an industrial policy stating that certain allowances will be available for the next ten years.  There may be some difficulty in relation to EEC competition policy but, as one of the countries accepted within the EEC as needing further industrial development, we would probably get a good hearing in Brussels for the evolvement of a proper and exciting industrial policy over the next ten years.  The fact that stock relief is being continued is welcomed but I understand from a number of industrialists that the question of recovery by the Revenue Commissioners of stock relief granted is not as clear as they would like it.  Certain conditions must be met in relation to the writing off of stock reliefs, and, perhaps, when the Finance Bill is introduced the Minister will be more specific in explaining to industrialists when stock relief is not to be recovered and under what conditions stock relief granted will be recovered by the Revenue Commissioners. Greater clarity would be welcomed by industrialists.</P>
    <P>The industrial policy as announced in the budget is backed up by an employment creating expenditure package which involves a massive amount of capital being devoted to areas of Government involvement, for instance, the IDA is getting £5 million extra.  Telephones, education and the whole broad spectrum of Government activity are being included in an expansion programme which is allied to the development of industry.  Stamp duty relief on office buildings is a short term relief, but greater emphasis should be given to decentralisation of industry and greater incentives should be given for industrial expansion outside of Dublin.  Dublin is growing at an unprecedented rate.  The growth of Dublin is affecting the development of the infrastructure, and rather than committing the metropolis to massive expenditure to provide the infrastructure, <Col N="1731" /> the infrastructure could be provided more cheaply by developing industrial centres outside Dublin.  It is important to develop centres outside of Dublin from a national point of view.  It is not good for the country that Dublin should be overbalanced from the point of view of population or industry.</P>
    <P>The expansion of Government policy in relation to the taxation of farm incomes has caused most criticism. The lowering of the threshold from £100 to £75 as and from the 6th April will bring 6,500 more farmers into the tax net.  Allied to this, the notional system is being made somewhat harsher.  It is generally accepted that the farming sector of Irish society has prospered over the past few years and that is in stark contrast to the prosperity of business people and workers.  The farming organisations have accepted that the farming sector should pay a fair share of the tax burden.  The Opposition party have also stated that they would tax farmers.  Deputy Gibbons, the spokesman for Fianna Fáil, says that income tax should be extended to include all farmers.</P>
    <P>There is no real political controversy in so far as it is generally agreed that farmers should pay a fair share of the tax.  The farmers are up in arms at meetings throughout the country.  Their criticism is not valid.  They have done well under this Government.  Average agricultural land values have increased from £300 per acre in 1972 to £1,000 for the same acre in 1976.  This is a fair increase which is far in excess of the rate of inflation.  That is a special reserve which all farmers have and which many industrialists, commercial people and workers have not got. Good luck to them; farmers are the backbone of the country.  They are a solid hardworking group of people who deserve whatever prosperity comes their way.  When campaigning for Ireland's entry into the EEC, I remember that one of the basic reasons for our entry was that the farming community would prosper in the EEC.  That has come about and they have prospered under the EEC more than any other sector of Irish <Col N="1732" /> society.  They will continue to prosper and they have succeeded in prospering right through a serious recession.  They have had solid increases in income when people were being made redundant in industry, when industries were closing, when people were finding it very difficult to survive.  They are a responsible body of people and I think they will accept the principle of paying income tax.</P>
    <P>After all, why does one pay income tax?  I do not think income tax paid by anyone is going to be put under the bed or locked up in a bank.  The reason we pay income tax is to provide educational services, hospital services and social welfare services.  That should be kept in mind because one feels that there is a mental block about paying income tax which is not quite fair to the Government.  I have discussed this question of taxation of farmers' incomes and a number of well-to-do farmers who were initially caught, so to speak, in the last year's income tax policy stated quite specifically that the threshold of £100 was unfair and that the only legitimate approach to taxing farmers' incomes was on an income basis so that those who had a good income from farming were taxed and those who did not have a good income were not taxed.  That is generally the attitude among farmers.  I feel that the Minister is trying to move them in that direction by increasing the multiplier. I think he is trying to get away from the principle of the multiplier and to bring farming into the tax system by assessing them on their income rather than having an artificial multiplier system.</P>
    <P>In time the most equitable system for taxing farmers' profits will be on the basis of income tax based on the actual income as returned by farmers. This is exactly what happens with a person in a small business or working for industry or owning his own industry. He pays on the actual income and that is the fairest method of all. No one likes paying income tax and everyone will take whatever legitimate ways are open to him to avoid paying it.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of the budget policy which has caused controversy is the <Col N="1733" /> abolition of the £50 threshold in relation to a farmer paying income tax who, or whose spouse, has another income outside agriculture.  It is stated specifically that from 6th April, 1977, holders of farmland who, or whose spouses, are also engaged in another trade or profession will be liable to income tax on farming profits.  This needs some clarification.  I understand that it does not affect a small farmer who works in a creamery or who does a bit of contracting during harvest time or some ploughing or other work for some other farmer.  I take it to mean that a farmer whose wife works as a teacher, for instance, will be subject to income tax on farm profits.  I also take it to mean that the farmer who has, say, a shop will be taxed, but I am not quite sure about this and it is certainly an area which has caused some comment and criticism.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not include any person who is an employee but it does include any person who is described in the law a sole trader, a person who is self-employed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but it seems to be a grey area in which there is need for clarification.  For instance, if a small farmer does some contracting is he liable for taxation on farm profits?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We will be spelling it out in the Finance Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>That is fine because it needs clarification.  I take it that the general approach of this income tax policy would not be to damage the small farmers who have to supplement their incomes outside farm profits. This would be an unwise policy which would be against the whole philosophy of the objectives of the budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another matter which has caused some concern is the fact that income tax will become due for payment on 1st September.  I would point out that they will be paying income tax for two years in the year.  When you are introducing a new sector of the community to paying income tax this should be done with great understanding. Perhaps the Minister would look <Col N="1734" /> at this aspect of his policy and ensure that no hardship is caused on the one hand, and that the system which he introduces is seen by those concerned to be an equitable one which does not bear harshly on any other sector.  I am not aware that any other sector under this schedule would have to pay income tax for 1977 in 1977.  However, this is a matter in which I know the Minister will be generous in the light of the need for farmers to expand.  For a farmer to expand at this time usually means an expansion in a capital-intensive way; capital-intensive means spending a lot of money.  This budget should not be a disincentive to expansion, especially in the farming community.  They should be given every encouragement to expand. Taking into consideration that such expansion is costly, to ask farmers to pay as from 1st September, 1977, on 1977 profits is a bit harsh and may be a disincentive to the full expansion of agriculture.</P>
    <P>In relation to the multiplier certain allowances which were formerly given have now been excluded.  I am not a great admirer of a multiplier system. I know the farming organisations favour it.  Many farmers favour it because they did not practice the compilation of accounts down through the years and this is new to them.  It is correctly used in an interim period in order to give farmers time to compile accounts.</P>
    <P>I have come across a number of farmers who want to compile accounts but who do not seem to be getting the right advice.  They seem to be going to the wrong people.  They are going to half-backed people who are unqualified in this field and doing their own cause a substantial amount of damage.  The only competent body of people who should be approached by farmers who are serious about compiling accounts and getting the best advice about what allowances they are entitled to, and the best advice as to what policy to pursue, are professional accountants.  If I were asked by any farmer who he should go to to get his accounts done, I would say without hesitation that a proper firm of qualified accountants are the people to go to. <Col N="1735" /> Any other firm or any other type of person will only arrest the development of farm accounts.  They are a number of such people on the go.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture should be quite categorical about this and the Minister for Finance also.  Everybody knows that the income tax inspector prefers to deal with professionals of his own standing in relation to income tax matters.  I say that without any qualms of conscience.  I have seen accounts which were drawn up and which caused farmers to suffer.</P>
    <P>In relation to developments in the EEC, last year the increase in the monetary compensatory amounts did great damage to the development of the beef industry and the livestock export industry in Ireland.  The MCAs went to such a level as to price our agriculture out of the European markets. I know this because I am involved in the meat industry and I saw it at first hand.  One of our great problems since our entry into Europe has been the development of the MCAs plus the fact that we are still in a transitional period in relation to the pricing of our agricultural products.  We still have to get over customs duty going into Europe.</P>
    <P>These MCAs should be abolished. There is no justification for them.  We have an underdeveloped country.  We have a vast potential in relation to our agricultural produce.  Of all the hindering factors facing Irish industry based on agricultural products, the most serious and the one which is causing the most trouble, whether it be from the point of view of livestock exports or beef exports, is the existence of the MCAs.  To a large extent in the past 12 months they have countered the benefits of the price increases we gained by joining the EEC.</P>
    <P>The sooner we stand up and say: &ldquo;Abolish the MCAs; do away with them&rdquo;, the better.  If they had not been there during the past 12 months we would have had a fantastic year for agricultural exports.  They are harmful, dangerous, regressive and most damaging to agriculture.</P>
    <P>The lack of a common sheep policy <Col N="1736" /> has done serious damage to the development of our sheep flock which is continuing to fall.  The French have been most intransigent in relation to the introduction of this policy.  We have been fighting for it down through the years and we have not made any progress.  There is no sign even of an interim sheep meat policy.  When our transitional period ends I wonder what the position will be.  I hope we will take the French to the European Court of Justice on this matter.  They have been most unhelpful.  I would go as far as to say to them &ldquo;If you will not take our lambs we will not take your produce.  You export to our country many consumer durables such as motor cars, consumer products and engineering products.  Either you take our sheep, or we will not take your products&rdquo;.  I would have a bilateral war with them.  I would be as hard as that because they have the only real market for our sheep meat.  We must stand on our own two feet and say &ldquo;We want a sheep policy or else&rdquo;.  If we do not do that we will be doing ourselves an injustice in relation to our sheep industry.</P>
    <P>Currently there is a controversy about the role which CBF should play in relation to exports.  It goes from one end of the spectrum to the other. Should CBF have powers to buy and sell, or should CBF get a levy from the meat trade?  It is a pity this controversy should have arisen.  CBF perform a function.  I am inclined to believe&mdash; and it is not a belief which is popularly held in the trade&mdash;that CBF should be given the powers to purchase and sell on the strict understanding that no loss would be subvented.  There are new markets which commercial firms are slow to undertake.  They are markets on which we should keep an eye.  CBF have an important role to play.  The meat industry should give them equal support to the livestock industry.  The Government should be more generous in their approach to CBF.  They have failed to back CBF as an export-oriented State body.</P>
    <P>I am quite pleased with our fisheries policy.  I am delighted we have introduced a conservation measure which will exclude large trawlers from a 50-mile <Col N="1737" /> zone off our coasts.  This was needed.  I have some knowledge of the herring industry because Dunmore East is in my constituency.  That industry has suffered badly over the past two years because of the lack of a herring season.  Of all the policies which have evolved over the past few months, I am particularly proud of our attitude to fishery limits and fishery conservation.</P>
    <P>I spoke during the discussion on the Maritime Jurisdiction Bill and I condemned then as I do now the fact that Fianna Fáil sold our fisheries industry down the drain when we entered Europe.  They negotiated an extraordinarily bad deal for the Irish fishing industry.  It was left to this Government to rectify a disastrous situation.  We now have something which was almost inconceivable five years ago.  We have a 200-mile economic zone.  This Government succeeded in negotiating with their EEC partners and introducing a 200-mile economic zone which may have very important consequences for Ireland in the future.  We have now introduced a solid, constructive fish conservation policy by which in effect and certainly from the point of view of the raping of our fish resources, we have taken measures that keep out the fishing fleets that have done most damage to our resources. The large fishing fleets of Russia, Germany and Holland will now be excluded from our 50-mile band.  That is a great step forward in conservation and it is allowable under the EEC treaty because it is not discriminatory; it affects all fishing trawlers of 110 feet length.  This is a measure which we should not be slow about using at any time in the future.  We must now back it up by having a policing force second to none.  I visualise a greater part being played by our Air Corps and I am pleased to see in the budget moneys for an extra fisheries protection vessel. We may need two more and, if I may, for my own constituency, I plead for the permanent location off Dunmore East of a fishery protection vessel.  This is very important during the herring fishing season.</P>
    <P>I must also plead for a major industry for my own constituency.  We have <Col N="1738" /> suffered more than any other city from the present recession mainly because a number of our older industries went by the board in the last few years.  I have aired this matter before but I must repeat my views here: we need at least one major industry in Waterford to take up the slack from the present recession.  We also need a second bridge.  The existing old bridge does not adequately serve the city in its present industrial capacity.  If anything happened to that bridge Waterford would be isolated.  The city's industrial potential is being negatived by the lack of a proper approach road. The necessity for the second bridge is quite obvious and perhaps the Minister would take note of this and keep it in mind when discussing the development of the south-east with his Cabinet colleagues.</P>
    <P>One other problem that has arisen is the necessity to replace the courthouse in Waterford.  There is a <i>mandamus</i> against the Minister for Justice for this and the estimated cost is anything from £400,000 to £600,000. It is most unjust to ask the people of the city and county of Waterford to finance a courthouse to that extent and perhaps new legislation will be introduced to make this a charge on central funds.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>This was a most disappointing budget for the ordinary man and woman.  Obviously the Minister made a major blunder in bringing in an election budget without giving a thought to putting the nation first, adequately financing priorities and stating clearly the Government's fiscal policies and development plans for the coming decade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The budget has done nothing significant (1) for the promotion of industry, (2) for development of our educational system and preventing the phasing out of the school transport service, (3) for the proper planning and financing of the local government service so that it will at least keep pace with inflation, (4) to encourage semi-State bodies including Bord Fáilte, the ESB and CIE, (5) to make proper provision for the financing of our health and social services, (6) to develop our great agricultural potential, (7) properly to develop <Col N="1739" /> and finance an adequate land policy and forestry development plan, (8) to provide sufficient funds for an adequate Garda protection and security service for the ordinary citizen, (9) properly to tap and develop what I think is one of our great natural resources, the fishing industry, (10) to make adequate provision for job and employment opportunities, (11) to encourage the people of the Gaeltacht and let them see that there is something other than a good PRO job being done for them, (12) to say whether the Government are again afraid this year to have a census of population carried out, (13) to provide finance to develop our amenities, (14) to make further and better provisions for IRA veterans and widows and (15) to provide a proper tax system and better all-round facilities and opportunities for lower paid workers.  I maintain that on each of these 15 scores the Government have failed in their budgetary provision.</P>
    <P>I intend to develop each of these points as far as time allows me. Nothing significant was provided in the budget to ensure that we would have the necessary number of jobs for the unemployed and potentially unemployed. In my constituency of south Kerry, particularly on the southern and eastern side, in the Killarney-Kenmare-Castletownbere area no new industry was provided in the past four years.  There is mass unemployment there.  The position of the IDA and the Department of Industry and Commerce is such that a site recently acquired by the IDA in Kenmare was offered to Kerry County Council for a burial ground.  In Killarney a sizeable acreage of land was purchased as an industrial site some years ago.  It is not even serviced yet which shows that the intention, never mind the will, to provide industry in this area does not exist.</P>
    <P>The amount provided in the budget for education, particularly the amount over and above what is mentioned in the capital programme, will not be nearly sufficient to enable that Department to carry out their programme for 1977&mdash;if the Department have a programme <Col N="1740" /> at all.  It is well known that schools that were to be completed last June or July have not yet been finished.  Due to lack of funds there is no sense of urgency on the part of the Minister or the Department and no one is pushing the builders to keep to schedule and complete the schools needed to provide the educational facilities for the pupils in areas with an increasingly high young population.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBegley" hpid="Mr. Begley Mr. Begley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Begley</NameTxt>
      <P>How many schools in Killarney?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two. Could the Parliamentary Secretary tell me why one which was to be finished last June has not yet been completed?</P>
      <P>A committee was set up to investigate school transport.  We were not told the purpose of this committee but it is well known that the school transport system is about to be phased out by this Government.  It is also well known that the transport system from closed school areas is in serious jeopardy. This is very serious and is causing grave concern to the parents of school-going children in these areas.  It could cause serious difficulties in the immediate future.  The Government should clearly state their policies, where they are going and where they are leading the people because, as I said, there is great unease among the parents in rural Ireland about the transport system.</P>
      <P>There is nothing significant in this budget which would lead me to believe that the Government are seriously considering adequately financing the local government services.  I also believe that inadequate housing and unemployment provide the greatest social evils here to-day.  The budget provides a very minor increase for housing when compared with housing needs.  The test in real terms is not the amount of money being provided compared with previous years but the waiting list for local authority housing.  This is the acid test.  Are the waiting lists being reduced?  If not, there is something seriously wrong.  It is my honest opinion that they are not being reduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1741" /> No serious worth-while provision was made in the budget for financing sanitary services.  It is practically impossible to get a new sewerage scheme under way in any village.  It is extremely difficult to get an extension to any sewerage scheme in any rural area to-day.  The capital allocations for water schemes merely enable the local authorities to carry on with existing schemes.  No provision has been made to eradicate this very serious problem. No financial provision has been made for the improvement of the natural environment.  The general public are very interested in this matter.  The local authorities which are probably the greatest polluters, are hindered by a lack of money.  The members of all local authorities are very concerned about this.  They realise how serious these problems are but without a properly financed programme nothing can be done.</P>
    <P>I was very disappointed that no provision was made for the improvement of the scale for eligibility for housing grants and loans.  We all know how serious the housing problems is but, as I said previously, nothing significant has been provided in the budget for people in need of rehousing.  If something significant had been done to make more people eligible for housing grants and loans it would have been welcomed and would have had an impact on the housing lists.  The majority of people building houses no longer qualify for housing grants and local authority loans.  This means that eventually these people will find their way on to the local authority housing lists for rehousing.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand the thinking behind this policy&mdash;if there is any thinking behind it&mdash;except that there is a lack of adequate finance and capital. The position in relation to finance for the maintenance and improvement of our roads is very serious because the amount of money needed is substantial and local authorities must meet these charges by increasing the rates.  The amount of State grants is diminishing in real terms.  Lack of adequate finance is preventing local authorities from planning the improvement of both national and secondary roads.  This is a <Col N="1742" /> sure sign that they have no confidence in the future because they do not know what grants they will get in the coming years.  The problem is particularly serious from the point of view of the motorist.  We all know how the rate of taxation on cars and petrol has increased and it is only right that a fair proportion of this money should be ploughed back into the development and improvement of our roads.</P>
    <P>This lack of adequate finance is also having an impact on the employment situation because road works were a great source of employment and many people were involved in the maintenance of the machines used in such work.  In many local authority areas the grants have been raised this year by no more than 15 per cent despite the fact that the Minister promised an increase of 30 per cent in his budget speech.  Everybody knows that the cost of some raw materials, particularly bitument, chips and machinery, went up by over 50 per cent during the past year and an increase of 30 per cent in the grants would not keep up with these inflated costs.  It is quite obvious that within the local government service as a whole there is no positive planning because there is no guarantee of financial backing and I would appeal to the Minister to take some action to improve this situation.</P>
    <P>I mentioned earlier the inadequate financing of transport and power.  It is well known that Bord Fáilte's development plans and marketing programme are hindered by lack of such finance.  I was surprised that the Government do not comment on the disastrous report published recently by CIE.  This calls for a special statement by the Taoiseach about the Government's intentions regarding CIE.  The transport services provided by CIE should be seen as a social service and should receive the necessary State backing.</P>
    <P>Lack of finance is also hindering the ESB.  Recently a Bill went through this House to provide £300,000 for the provision of electricity for certain categories of persons but so far the ESB have not been informed by the Department of Transport and Power as to the exact position.  This is very serious because the general public <Col N="1743" /> have a right to know how they stand. Many areas were promised electricity at a substantially reduced rate and the people should be fully informed of their entitlements.  When this Bill was going through the House the Minister said it was intended to introduce a scheme to assist people who are building new houses in rural areas.  This scheme has not yet been announced and the ESB have no details about it. I was amazed that there was no mention in the budget of any provision for this scheme.  We do not know when it will start or finish and the general public are concerned about this matter.</P>
    <P>Our health and social services are now at breaking point due to inadequate financing.  They are in complete disarray for the want of adequate money.  The health boards are in serious financial difficulty.  I cannot see them providing additional jobs, as forecast by the Minister in his budget statement, because the additional money provided for them is urgently required to meet the ordinary day-to-day services provided by them.  The withdrawal of so many medical cards recently by health boards clearly indicates the financial difficulties they are in.  In County Kerry more than 1,000 medical cards were withdrawn over a period of a few months.  Despite the increase of the guide scale, I believe there is still discrimination against various sections of the community who apply for medical cards.  Small farmers are having their applications for the renewal of medical cards turned down.  Are the health boards on the verge of bankruptcy?  They are withdrawing medical cards from young married people whose only source of income is a small wage and small farmers who have a very low land valuation.</P>
    <P>It is amazing that when the crunch comes it lies heavily on the less well-off section of the community.  The Minister should tell the health boards to give a statement to each small-holder and to each person in the less well-off section of the community, whose medical cards are not being renewed, setting out the reason why and <Col N="1744" /> what the income limit is in the particular health board.  The least a small farmer or a working man is entitled to get with his refusal docket is a statement setting out clearly how the conclusion was arrived at that he is not entitled to a medical card within the guide scale laid down by the health board.  People who appear to be eligible for medical cards but are not getting them are greatly concerned about this.  Those people are entitled to more than the blanket circular stating that they do not appear to be eligible.</P>
    <P>The medical and nursing staffs of hospitals throughout the country are very concerned about the inadequate maintenance and upkeep grants for those institutions.  This is particularly serious in institutions where no repairs and maintenance have been carried out for the past two years.  The staff fear that money will not be available for this purpose for a few years when the cost of doing the work will be so great that the health boards may be forced to shy away from their responsibilities.</P>
    <P>The health and social services in the country, due to lack of finance, are in complete disarray.  The public are seriously concerned about the delay in considering applications for unemployment assistance.  It is now virtually impossible for self-employed people, who are now unemployed because of the serious economic crisis due to the mismanagement of our financial affairs, to get the maximum rate of unemployment assistance.  I have a question down to the Minister for Social Welfare on this matter next week.  The Department of Social Welfare have either not sufficient money to pay unemployment assistance at the maximum rate or else the instructions that went out to the officials of the Department have been misinterpreted. This matter requires clarification. Many former self-employed people, who are now unemployed, only get 50 per cent of the normal rate of unemployment assistance.</P>
    <P>Many people in the agricultural community cannot understand why there is such a long delay by the Department of Agriculture in paying <Col N="1745" /> the EEC cattle headage grants and the farm modernisation grants.  The Minister should state clearly what the financial position of his Department is. I believe the farmers would understand if the money is not there.  Many farmers are waiting for substantial grants for long periods to pay builders and to pay their ordinary debts.  This is leading to a serious crisis between the farming community and the Department of Agriculture.  It is well-known that it is virtually impossible for farmers to get their grants without making representations to public representatives.  That is a sorry state of affairs. The pressures on the farming community are so serious that they are very short of working capital.  The Minister should tell us whether he is not getting the money from the EEC or whether he is not getting sufficient finance to back-up EEC grants.</P>
    <P>The budget did not make any provision for the creation of worth-while opportunities on the land.  It did not contain any financial plan for the development of agriculture.  Some incentive should have been given to owners of smallholdings to improve their output, particularly in relation to horticulture. Owners of smallholdings should be encouraged to develop their land in an intensive way because that is the only way they can derive a gainful livelihood from their farms.</P>
    <P>There is no reference in the budget to any proposals to introduce an adequate land policy.  I can recall that when a Bill concerning land was going through this House some time ago the then Minister for Lands told us that a scheme would be brought into operation whereby the payment for land acquired by the Land Commission in the form of land bonds would be phased out but we have heard nothing about that since.  The Land Commission should be given sufficient cash to enable them to buy land on the open market.  There are various ways that can be done without the Land Commission being identified as the purchasers.  Until sufficient cash is provided it will be impossible for the Land Commission to produce a land policy.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1746" /> It is also impossible to prepare a proper programme for the development of our forests without sufficient finance.  That industry holds out great potential.  I have always maintained that more money should be provided for the development of our forests. Land not suitable for agricultural purposes should be planted.  I am also concerned that no additional finance is being made available to extend and improve the services carried out by the Garda.  It is accepted by everybody that overtime in the force is essential. Last year the Minister for Justice announced that it was his intention to recruit an extra 500 gardaí but in my view it will take a few more years before that is done.  The strength in some rural stations has been reduced by approximately 20 per cent.  I am aware that in one provincial town the number was reduced from 22 to 18. This was done at a time when the population was increasing.  It should be remembered that some of the 18 gardaí must do duty outside their district and along the Border.</P>
    <P>I was surprised to see the paltry sum made available for the development of our fishing industry.  The figure is insignificant in comparison with the amount required to improve this industry.  The provision in the budget will only buy one good fishing vessel.  It is time an imaginative scheme for the improvement of that industry was introduced.  More people should be trained and new piers constructed. Our harbours and fishing plants should be improved.  Fishing is one of the greatest of our natural resources and it is a pity that industry has not been financed adequately, particularly when fish are becoming scarce and when fish stocks are running low in the world's seas.</P>
    <P>Unemployment has reached a critical stage but it was glossed over in a glib fashion by the Minister in his budget statement.  It is well known that the additional money being made available to the Departments of Health, Education and Local Government, money which on the surface would provide additional employment, will barely cover day-to-day administration in these Departments.  In view <Col N="1747" /> of the serious unemployment problem, it is tragic that this money could not have been earmarked specially for the provision of new jobs instead of being glossed over by the Minister.  I hope he will answer me in his reply as to what significant steps have been taken since budget day to provide job opportunities in these three Departments. A great opportunity was lost in the budget in this respect.</P>
    <P>Last year the Government were afraid to carry out a census of the population because, as the public know, the figures would have shown up a serious lack of planning in respect of schools, housing, roads, sanitary services, environment improvement generally.  I am firmly convinced that the population has been growing at such a rate that the number of people under the age of five years is far more than the Government would like us to know because of their lack of planning in relation to schools, housing, road improvement and general services.  There is an absolute lack of a positive physical planning policy.</P>
    <P>Earlier in my remarks I referred to the absence of worth-while budgetary provision for Old IRA veterans and their widows.  Earlier today Deputy Meaney outlined the position.  There are many IRA widows who need financial assistance by way of allowances and other concessions and the Minister should reconsider the Department of Defence Estimate to allow for an improvement in the lot of these people.</P>
    <P>The budget has done very little for the less well-off sections in industry indeed, the greater the income, the better a person will fare under this budget.  I would appeal to the Minister, if there is any use in appealing to him, to examine the position in regard to the taxation of workers' insurance contributions.  I cannot understand why a worker must pay tax on his social welfare contributions.  This is a matter that should be straightened out immediately between the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Social Welfare because, as the system is operated, there is something radically wrong with it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1748" /> In conclusion, I believe that the kernel of the problem is the lack of leadership.  There appears to be no real leadership.  This is evident from the fact that the Government have failed to come to any conclusion in regard to carrying out a census of population.  One Minister argues publicly against another Minister, as happened in the case of the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Agriculture on a few occasions last year.  It also happened in the case of the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Health when the Minister for Finance, as spokesman for the Government, stated it was the intention to discontinue the children's allowances scheme.  We had another glaring example of lack of leadership recently when, despite the fierce opposition of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Minister for Fisheries did exactly the contrary of what the former wanted. We had the Taoiseach forecasting gloom and doom late last year and then we had the Minister for Finance coming along trying to cod the general public by saying in his budget statement the recession was over when everybody knows we are in the height of a serious economic crisis because of the grave mishandling of the affairs of State by the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>It is my belief that the general public have taken very little notice of this latest budget.  The people regard it as an election budget and nothing more, but they are seriously concerned about the real crisis facing the country in the coming months.  It is quite obvious we are running into probably one of the most serious economic crises that ever hit this country or, indeed, any country in western Europe.  The evolution is quite evident now due primarily to the fact that nothing significant has been done to relieve the situation since the day the Minister for Finance made his budget statement.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>This budget has been hailed by Government speakers as one which will be of tremendous benefit to the country as a whole and as one which will do something positive to restore the economy to a <Col N="1749" /> healthy state and thereby provide the impetus to do something worth while. The Taoiseach describes it as an incentive budget.  It has been spoken of in similar terms by other Government speakers.  When one teases out the figures, however, it is very easy to see that we have nothing like what has been promised by the Minister for Finance or his Government.</P>
      <P>One of the most important Departments is the Department of Local Government.  Here we find one of the biggest problems.  Here we find the greatest lack of investment to ensure the smooth operation of that Department. Every Member is aware of the serious housing problem.  Even though revenue was buoyant and the Minister had more money available it is quite amazing to discover he was not able to do something for the housing section of the Department of Local Government. There was no reference to the housing grants which were removed. There was no question of increased loans and no question of improving income limits.  We are all aware of the tradition.  The biggest percentage of our people want to provide and own their own homes.  Since this Government took office we find ourselves in a situation where the State is taking over and local authority homes are being provided for the people.  The last thing most people want to do, particularly in rural areas, is to ask the local authority to provide them with houses. But that is what they are being driven into doing because the incentives which were there by way of loan and grant are no longer there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All this is a sad reflection on a Government which calls itself socialist and tries to create the impression that it is working in the interests of the downtrodden and the less well off.  The Department of Local Government is in the hands of a member of the Labour Party.  One would think he above all <Col N="1750" /> should make some effort to get the necessary finances from his colleague in the Department of Finance to alter and improve the present unsatisfactory situation.</P>

      <P>On 27th October, 1976, when replying to a similar question from the Deputy in relation to Glenfarne I said I was advised that the amount of timber likely to be available in the area up to 1981 would not support an additional timber processing industry there.  There are no proposals at present before the Industrial Development Authority for such a project.  However, the Authority are carrying out a general study of the timber industry which will be completed in a matter of months.  It is intended that this survey will produce guidelines as to how the industry should be developed and as to suitable locations for future expansion.  The scope for further expansion of the timber industry in the Manorhamilton area will then be reassessed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McLaughlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Manorhamilton is a very central part of County Leitrim and is convenient to Sligo and the establishment of such an industry would be very useful in the area.

      <P>I appreciate the Deputy's position but, as I said, there is not at present scope for an additional processing industry.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I have indicated that there is an IDA study which will be finished in a matter of months.  It is a fact that if you have to haul timber for processing for a distance greater than 20 miles or of that order of magnitude the basic economics of it go the wrong way.  It is important to have locate processing close to where the timber is and it is important to have a sufficient volume of timber to sustain <Col N="1753" /> the particular investment.  As I have indicated to Deputies, the study in regard to the timber industry has been initiated.  I am expecting the report in a matter of months and the kind of questions asked by the Deputies will be looked at actively in the light of what we are told.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if, in reference to a deputation he received from Ballyshannon last October, he is in a position to announce any scheme or incentives to offset the disadvantage under which some industries in Donegal and other Border counties must operate in competition with similar concerns which are highly subsidised on the other side of the Border.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>The deputation which I received last October was concerned with a service industry of a type which is not considered by the IDA to be eligible for grant assistance.  I indicated <Col N="1755" /> then that if, because of its circumstances, this particular case were to be reconsidered as a special one, certain additional information would have to be made available.  So far this information has not been forthcoming.  It would not be practicable to introduce any special scheme or incentives as envisaged by the Deputy, solely in relation to industries in the Border areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not consider seeking this information himself?  His Department would be in a much better position to obtain it; a phone call would get the information. Is the Minister aware that cross-Border industries particularly where heavy transport is involved&mdash;among others I am referring to metal and concrete products&mdash;have subsidised machinery, cheaper vehicles, lower insurance costs and cheaper petrol?  It is impossible for our industries to compete against this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>The inquiries the Deputy urges me to make have been made.  They reveal that so far as we are aware there is no Government assistance to the particular category of industry to which the Deputy has referred. This is the result of our inquiries which perhaps explains why the people to whom I was speaking did not forward information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister deny that these industries have machinery where the depreciation factor is much more advantageous than anything we have, that they have a subsidy for the purchase of machinery, that they have lower insurance and that they can buy cement cheaper than we can even though it is manufactured here?  All these factors make it impossible for our industries to compete.  Is the Minister insisting that the specific industry about which the deputation approached him on that occasion is a service industry?  There is an element of manufacturing in it and there is also a large employment content involved.  The Minister is aware that the IDA frequently give substantial grants for the employment of a <Col N="1756" /> few people in industries which have a lower employment content than the one in question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a number of strands in that question.  The IDA have always exercised judgment in the matter of the level of grant, taking into account all the relevant factors, not just a single one.  The Deputy made observations about cost comparisons of the widest possible kind. Those cost comparisons are not all in one direction.  The nub of the matter was that I was assured that there was assistance in Northern Ireland for the particular category of industry to which this belongs.  I asked the people on that delegation to send me some information and I told them I would see what we could do about it.  I got no information.  I asked for the information myself and I found there was no such assistance in Northern Ireland. If the Deputy can bring some new light or some real data to bear on the situation I will be willing to look at it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that industries in Border counties must compete with similar industries in Northern Ireland using subsidised transport?  They are subsidised if you take into account the fact that they get a grant for replacement when the transport is written off while we must pay the full amount.  The original price of trucks in Northern Ireland is considerably less, the insurance is less, the tax is less, the petrol is less.  As well as that they get a subsidy for the replacement of machinery whether it is static or transport.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>My information, which is not from the observations of any individual but from careful comparisons made between economic incentives in different parts of these islands, is that our package taken as a whole is the best one.  While there may be some truth in what the Deputy has said there are compensating advantages on this side.  I cannot accept the contention that the basic terms of competition are so different and that all the advantages are in favour of the people in Northern Ireland.</P>

      <P>The coal potential of the Leinster Coalfield, which includes the anthracite reserves in County Laois, was thoroughly explored in the course of an extensive diamond drilling survey carried out between 1959 and 1963.  The survey indicated considerable reserves of minable anthracite but the limited thickness of the seams, coupled with their depth from the surface, discourage colliery operators from undertaking development.  A number of mines within the coalfield have ceased production having reached the limit of their reserves.  The one surviving mine, Rossmore, closed in 1970 but, with the aid of State assistance reopened in 1974.</P>
      <P>I might add that I am at present considering an application for leasing facilities to work State-owned coal in County Laois.  The Deputy can rest assured that every effort is being made to encourage interest in the further exploration and development of available reserves.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if he is aware of the increasing number of allegations of ill-treatment of suspects in Garda custody; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Cooney) Patrick M. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Cooney)</NameTxt>
      <P>During the past fortnight or so widespread publicity has been given in newspapers and on radio and television to certain allegations that have been made recently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>May I first of all point out that as regards any person charged before the courts with a criminal offence it is the law that no statement made by an accused person may be admitted in evidence if it was not a voluntary statement.  This means that the statement <Col N="1761" /> must not have been obtained as a result of physical pressure or a threat or an inducement.  If any question is raised as to whether a statement was voluntary the onus of proof is on the prosecution and in any case of doubt the statement is inadmissible.</P>
    <P>Where allegations of ill-treatment by Garda have been raised as an issue in a number of criminal trials that have been completed in recent times the Garda have been vindicated.  I think it is fair to say that that has not been given very much prominence in newspaper reports that have appeared in recent days relating to alleged ill-treatment of persons in Garda custody. I emphasise that I am here referring to cases that have been completed and not to cases that are of are likely to become <i>sub judice.</i></P>
    <P>I am aware that some cases in which allegations have been raised are <i>sub judice</i> and there are others in which civil proceedings have been taken or are pending.  However I can give the House some figures that will, I think, be useful.  During the two-year period 1975-1976 the Garda Síochána say that 58 complaints of assault by gardaí on persons in or being taken into Garda custody or being questioned by the Garda were investigated by the Garda authorities.  As a result in 22 cases they referred the file to the Director of Public Prosecutions for a direction as to whether criminal proceedings should be brought against the gardaí concerned. A direction against the taking of proceedings was received in 14 cases but charges were directed in the other eight cases.  In the event, the charges were dismissed by the courts in all eight cases.</P>
    <P>Because the Garda Síochána are a disciplined force and are entitled to demand high standards, they do not accept that just because the evidence does not warrant a criminal charge the garda concerned who was the subject of the complaint is necessarily free from blame.  Accordingly internal disciplinary action was taken in four cases in which criminal proceedings had been brought even though the criminal proceedings were dismissed and disciplinary action was also taken in two other cases in which no <Col N="1762" /> criminal proceedings were brought. Nine of the 58 cases are still the subject of investigations.</P>
    <P>This means that in eight cases out of 49 so far investigated one or more members of the force were prosecuted and, even though the charges all failed, the Garda authorities themselves took disciplinary action in four instances. Again, even though the Director of Public Prosecutions decided that criminal proceedings were not warranted, disciplinary action was taken in two cases.</P>
    <P>I think that these facts show that suggestions that the Garda are not prepared seriously to consider the prosecution or disciplining of their own members where specific complaints are made to them are unfounded.</P>
    <P>Another very relevant statistic is this.  Criminal proceedings for assault have been taken against members of the force by complainants in eight cases during 1975 and 1976.  They all failed&mdash;seven were dismissed and the eighth case was not proceeded with. These are additional to the criminal charges I have already mentioned which were initiated officially by the Garda themselves.  Five civil actions which were taken against members of the force during the period are still pending.</P>
    <P>The figures I have given relate to 1975 and 1976.  As far as 1977 is concerned five allegations of ill-treatment of persons while in Garda custody are under investigation by the Garda Síochána.  However in one of these cases a criminal prosecution has been taken by the complainant.</P>
    <P>To complete this part of the story, may I add that successful civil actions against members of the Garda Síochána have been taken in two cases during the period.  Both cases however related to unlawful detention, not to allegations of violence.</P>
    <P>I think I should also advert to another aspect of the allegations in <i>The Irish Times,</i> namely the suggestion that the Garda have been found on several occasions to have misused their powers of detention under section 2 of the Emergency Powers Act&mdash;this <Col N="1763" /> allegation being linked by the newspaper, at least in general terms, with the allegation of brutality towards persons in detention.  I propose to refer briefly to the cases that have arisen.  I give the facts as I understand them to be and the facts as I state them are, to the best of my knowledge, not in dispute.</P>
    <P>Case No. 1: A man was arrested under section 2, questioned and released. Some weeks later, as a result of further substantial evidence coming into the possession of the Garda, he was rearrested and again detained. The Garda, while accepting that the Act does not allow either an immediate rearrest of a person so as effectively to prolong the period of detention permitted by the Act or a rearrest made even after a period unless there was significant fresh evidence, were of the opinion that a rearrest was authorised by the statute in the special circumstances I have mentioned and the case was the subject of legal argument accordingly.  However, a judge of the High Court held otherwise and, unless the Supreme Court some day finds to the contrary or the Act is changed, that view must now prevail.  It was however, to put it at its lowest, an arguable legal issue and not a culpable abuse of power.</P>
    <P>Case No. 2: A man voluntarily went with the gardaí to the Garda station. After some time, as a result of questioning and other information received by Garda, he was placed under arrest, pursuant to section 2, on suspicion of having been involved in very serious crime.  Later still, a Garda superintendent who came to the station decided that his detention should be extended as provided for in the Act and he made an extension order accordingly.  In doing so the superintendent was under the mistaken impression that the man had been under arrest from the time he first came to the station and the extension order was based on that assumption. The House will appreciate that the man concerned was in no way prejudiced by that error&mdash;on the contrary, it meant that the man had to be charged or released sooner than would <Col N="1764" /> have been necessary if the correct time of arrest had been known.  Nevertheless, because the time stated in the order was factually wrong, and notwithstanding that the error was, so to speak, in the suspect's favour, the detention was held in court to be irregular.</P>
    <P>Case No. 3: A man was arrested under section 2 by a garda.  Some hours later a superintendent arrived at the station and, having checked the evidence available against him, was satisfied that he should be under arrest. However, through a misunderstanding, he thought the man had not already been formally arrested so he instructed a garda to take him outside the station door and formally arrest him under section 2.  This was done and some time later the man was charged.  The court held that this constituted a second arrest which invalidated the detention.  Once again the House will see that the man's position was in no way prejudiced by what occurred, that the error was merely a technical one and that there was no element of harassment or other form of unfairness in the rearrest&mdash;in fact the main point about it was that it was an entirely unnecessary exercise but one undertaken out of a sense of punctiliousness.</P>
    <P>I mention these three cases, firstly because they have been referred to in <i>The Irish Times</i> as evidence of abuse, and by implication culpable abuse, of power by gardaí&mdash;without sufficient detail being given to show precisely what in fact had taken place&mdash;and I mention them, secondly, to indicate to the House the kind of legal restraints to which the Garda are subject.  In each of these three cases I believe that the intentions of this House in passing the Bill would have been that the Garda would be entitled to detain the persons concerned as they did.  In none of these cases can it be said that the action of the Garda in relation to the arrest was oppressive and I hope that it will in fact at some stage be possible to have some of these issues brought before the Supreme Court.</P>
    <P>Turning from the specific to the general, I would like to put the following on record.  I have never suggested, <Col N="1765" /> and to the best of my knowledge it has never been suggested by the Garda authorities, that all complaints made against the Garda that emanate from persons associated with illegal organisations should be dismissed out of hand as propaganda.  What I have said is that there is, beyond question, a deliberate effort to discredit the Garda by propaganda and that every allegation of assault that has so far been tested in court has failed, even though in many cases the circumstances were such that the onus of proof was on the Garda.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless this in no way implies that some complaints against Garda may not be justified&mdash;and, far from saying that complaints from persons associated with illegal organisations were to be dismissed merely as propaganda, I have consistently stated that any specific complaint by a person who claimed to be ill-treated will be fully investigated.  The distinction I make and will continue to make is between specific complaints by persons who claim to have been ill-treated on the one hand and, on the other hand, generalised complaints by third parties who either cannot or will not produce authenticated allegations from the person who claims to have been victimised.  The facts and figures I have given show that specific complaints are investigated by the Garda and, far from being investigated only as a formality, have in fact resulted in a number of prosecutions and in disciplinary action in certain cases.  In addition the courts are open to all citizens and we are now told that a special fund has been made available to finance cases against Garda.  We are also told that there is no shortage of legal representatives willing to take up such cases.  For my part, I am aware that certain matters which have been the subject of a great deal of publicity, in the context of this question, are likely to become <i>sub judice</i> in a criminal case shortly.  I cannot say more than that at the moment, but I expect that Deputies will be able to see for themselves in the near future.  At that point I believe that another side of the story may emerge and I trust that the press will be willing to devote space to reporting in the maximum detail what transpires <Col N="1766" /> from both sides, letting the chips fall where they may.  For my part, I will welcome that.  I hope that I do not have to emphasise that there will not be any condoning of brutality against any prisoner, and if it is shown that this has taken place strong action will certainly be taken against the persons responsible.</P>
    <P>I have not so far referred specifically to the allegation that there exists a so-called &ldquo;heavy gang&rdquo;.  I note that <i>The Irish Times</i> has expressly disclaimed any intention of alleging that any such group was set up for the purpose of dealing with prisoners in an unlawful way; that what is alleged is that serious ill-treatment has in fact occurred.  This being so, the matter is covered by what I have just said, namely, that it is to be confidently expected that allegations of this kind will come up for consideration in the courts, both criminal and civil, in the near future and the issue can then be tested in open court.  In the meantime, because of the likelihood of the proceedings to which I have referred taking place in the fairly near future, I am not in a position to say more, nor is the time opportune for me to say anything one way or the other about calls for a special tribunal outside the Garda and outside the courts system. I will be able to deal with that and with any other points that may still need to be dealt with when certain current and pending cases are disposed of but, while they remain undisposed of, I cannot deal adequately with these other issues.</P>

      <P>I wish to thank the Minister for his very full reply to my question, and I am sure he is appreciative of my efforts to see to it that the opportunity is given to him to uphold the good name of the Garda.  Arising from the Minister's comprehensive statement, of which, unfortunately, there are not copies available to us, would he accept that his responsibility &mdash;responsibility that is solely his&mdash;lies in four direct areas?  First, it is his sole responsibility to ensure that no person is ill treated while in Garda custody. Secondly, is it not his sole responsibility to ensure that if such ill-treatment has occurred, it will be <Col N="1767" /> stopped immediately?  Thirdly, that in such circumstances he must ensure that those responsible are punished either by way of prosecution or of disciplinary measures?  Finally, if the allegations made against the Garda are unfounded, is it not his sole responsibility to ensure that the good name of that force is vindicated? I wonder whether enough is being done to ascertain the facts and thereby to enable the Minister to carry out his responsibilities under these headings.</P>

      <P>It should be clear to the Deputy from my reply as to what my responsibility is in this matter.  I have indicated clearly that I would not condone any question of ill-treatment on the part of a member of the Garda against prisoners nor would such a situation be condoned by the Garda themselves.  I have indicated also that the allegations should be investigated and that allegations of this nature have been investigated in the fullest way possible.  I agree that the good name of the Garda should be vindicated but this is not a matter for me.  I can only give the facts here and trust that these will be reported fully on the conclusion of any proceedings that may be relevant to these issues.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister not agree that perhaps one of the best ways in which to safeguard the good name of the Garda would be the allowing of access to those in custody for periods of longer than two days of medical and legal advisers and also perhaps of some relatives, as was suggested by me during the debate on the emergency powers legislation in September last?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Access to legal and medical advice or assistance is available to any prisoner who requests it. There has been such access in certain cases.  Indeed there is no restriction in this regard.  The right to this advice or assistance has been found specifically by the Supreme Court.  The Deputy may recall that during the debate in question I made the point that such rights were not excluded by the legislation. <Col N="1768" /> That statement was confirmed subsequently by the Supreme Court as being a proper statement of the position. Therefore that is the situation in fact and in law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad that the Minister has said that, because there is the impression that the situation is not as he describes it.  Consequently I am glad to hear the Minister state once again that there is access to medical and legal advisers in respect of people in custody.</P>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that there have been a number of cases in which persons charged with criminal offences &mdash;more particularly since the emergency legislation was enacted&mdash;have alleged ill-treatment while in Garda custody and where the Director of Public Prosecutions has caused prosecutions to be dropped?  These were cases in which convictions would have depended on admissions made by the accused while in such custody.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware of any such case but the implication in the Deputy's question is very serious.  I shall be grateful if he will communicate the details of the cases concerned to me.  I am not aware of the reasons for the Director of Public Prosecutions deciding to proceed or not to proceed with charges.  I understand it is the practice of his office not to give reasons for such decisions.  Consequently I am at a loss to know how the implication in the Deputy's question can arise.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I will convey the information I have in this regard to the Minister.  I have no wish to mention here the names of the people involved.  Is the Minister as concerned as I am that, prior to the publication of <i>The Irish Times</i> articles which were publicised widely in Britain, there was little or no mention in the British media of the Strasbourg case, possibly perhaps because it was clear that the British Government were to be convicted of brutality and torture and that such methods of ill treatment, brutality and torture had been authorised and condoned in Great Britain even up to Cabinet level?</P>

    <Col N="1769" />
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidThornlet" hpid="Dr. Thornley Dr. Thornley">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Thornley</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I might ask some very short questions.  The Minister referred to these allegations of brutality being investigated by the Garda and members of the Garda being subject to the discipline of their own members.  In the light of these allegations does he regard investigation by the Garda as adequate?  Despite our regard for the majority of the Garda should there not be independent investigations such as were suggested from these benches during the debate on the emergency powers legislation? The Minister speaks of complaints by persons associated with illegal organisations. Would he define what he means by that because I thought we held in common the belief that people were innocent until proved guilty?</P>
      <P>A further point is one which has been made by Deputy Collins.  Is the Minister aware that these allegations were repeated on Tuesday to our detriment in every major European newspaper?  I do not think that the Minister telling us he does not read newspapers is a valid excuse.  I can make available to him copies of <i>The Times</i> and <i>The Guardian,</i> if he so wishes.</P>
      <P>Finally, assuming that these allegations are proved to be correct or, at least, given the disquiet that exists, would the Minister not agree now that my personal vote last year with the Opposition against the Emergency Powers Bill was not so eccentric as it might have seemed then despite the more conscious&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The first point is that the investigative procedures are fair and complete.  They are not confined to internal investigations by the Garda. I have indicated that the courts are available to any person who is aggrieved as a result of treatment <Col N="1770" /> alleged to have been received at the hands of the Garda.  If that treatment were found to be unlawful the person concerned would find a remedy in the courts.  I do not think anyone would suggest that our courts are anything but open and impartial. That is the sort of tribunal that is implicit in the case for a special investigation in respect of the allegations against the Garda.  The courts are in public and they are impartial.</P>
      <P>I am not responsible for what was published here nor am I responsible for what may have been repeated in the press in the rest of Europe, As for the suggestion regarding statements emanating from illegal organisations, I do not prejudge anything or anybody but those who can wear the cap should do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that because of the allegations that are being made, and being made in increasing numbers, the best way and the only way to clear the good name of the Garda would be to have a public inquiry, judicial or otherwise, into the allegations?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Many of the matters which have been the subject of allegations are, as I indicated in my reply, either already <i>sub judice</i> or likely to become <i>sub judice.</i>  Consequently a public inquiry would not be appropriate in respect of such matters.  I presume the Deputy would hope that a public inquiry would clear the air and establish facts.  I see no reason for the pending proceedings not having precisely the same result thereby eliminating the need for any other inquiry.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two very small points I wish to make and which arise from the Minister's long and comprehensive reply.  The first point relates to the first line of his reply where he mentioned specifically that no physical pressures were being used by the Garda on those in custody.  May I take it from that that there may be <Col N="1771" /> mental pressures in use in so far as interrogation is concerned?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy may not take that to be the situation nor was that what I said.  I said that this means that the statement must not have been obtained as a result of physical pressure, or a threat, or an inducement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am wondering whether this was merely unfortunate wording.  Under the iniquitous legislation enacted last year, the Emergency Powers Act, does not the seven days detention, that is, two days plus a further five days, provide solely for a situation in which mental pressures may be built up by repetitive and continuous interrogation and in very many cases a lack of sleep is allowed to the prisoners?  In regard to the assertions that the Garda have been calling in a heavy gang, of which I have read nothing, in <i>The Irish Times</i> or anywhere else, is it not a fact that whatever the group is called, there is a group that comes from headquarters in Dublin for interrogations in various parts of the country, over and above and in addition to the local interrogation that would have taken place in the first hours or days of detention?</P>

Would the Minister agree that the method of replying to the disquiet caused by leaving the matter to the courts really results in a situation where individual cases are dealt with by the courts on a disjointed basis and that, perhaps, the best way to answer that allegation would be by setting up a judicial inquiry?</P>

      <P>The fact that they will be dealt with individually case by case does not in any way take from the effectiveness of the courts as a way of dealing with them.

The type of machinery to which the Deputy refers implies that somehow the courts would be less than public or impartial.  The Deputy is asking for machinery that would have complete confidence.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 17 to 19, inclusive together.</P>
      <P>The criminal legal aid scheme provided for in the Criminal Justice (Legal Aid) Act, 1962, has been fully implemented and has in fact been in operation since 1965.  The operation of that scheme is at present being reviewed by a committee under the chairmanship of District Justice Tormey.</P>
      <P>The introduction of a comprehensive scheme of civil legal aid and advice is under examination by a committee under the chairmanship of Mr. Justice Pringle.</P>
      <P>I understand that the Pringle Committee hope to be in a position to report to me shortly.  This committee was established on 10th May, 1974, and the terms of reference are as follows:</P>
      <P>To advise on the introduction at an early date of a comprehensive scheme of legal aid and advice in civil matters and to recommend on the form, nature and administration of the scheme and on the legislation necessary to establish it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To consider whether, pending the introduction of a fully comprehensive scheme, it would be desirable and possible to develop as a matter of urgency a system of legal advice centres and legal aid in certain categories of cases which the Committee <Col N="1777" /> considered merited immediate consideration.</P>
    <P>To estimate the cost of the scheme or schemes proposed and advise on the manner in which such scheme or schemes could be financed, including the possibility of contribution from legally aided persons and from persons having a legal obligation to provide for or to compensate such persons.</P>
    <P>I am not in a position to say when the Tormey Committee will report.  They are aware of my anxiety however to have a report as soon as possible.  The Tormey Committee was established on 18th June, 1975, and its terms of reference are:</P>
    <P>To review the operation of the Criminal Legal Aid Scheme under the Criminal Justice (Legal Aid) Act, 1962, and to make recommendations as to the manner in which the scheme might be improved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister say when the Pringle Committee will report? I understand he used the expression &ldquo;shortly&rdquo;.  In relation to the Tormey Committee report there is a particularly urgent demand for the report from this committee.  I do not want in any way to reflect on the work being done by the committee and the people making up the committee, but can the Minister give any information to the House as to when the Tormey Committee might report?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot say when either committee will report but I am hopeful that they will both report to me shortly.  I am aware of the importance of the work they are doing.  It is right that I should pay tribute to the people on these committees.  They are giving their free time to difficult, time-consuming work.  I would mention that the Pringle Committee have met on no less than 67 occasions.  This is an indication of the amount of free time the members of that committee have given.  They are aware of the urgency and importance of the work and I have no doubt that they will report at the very earliest moment possible.</P>

It is a subject which has caused the greatest difficulty in other jurisdictions both as to its efficiency and in terms of cost value.  I would prefer that this committee would take their time and do a proper job rather than bring in a hasty report.  I am satisfied that there is no lack of energetic application by the committee.  They are working hard and as speedily as the subject permits.  The Tormey Committee have held 26 meetings to date.</P>

      <P>and <b>Mr. Keaveney</b> asked the Minister for Justice why <Col N="1779" /> gardaí are being transferred from Border counties in increasing numbers and replaced by colleagues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The vast majority of the members of the force who are transferred from Border counties are members who have been assigned to these counties on a temporary basis and who apply for a re-transfer after completing a minimum period of service. I understand that of the 110 members who were transferred since 1st January, 1976, 86 were transferred at their own request.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the perturbing feature of this is that, over the years while he has been in office, men have been sent from down the country up to the Border? There have been a number recently shifted who had settled in there and who did not wish to move, did not request it, did nothing that should have induced the powers that be to so shift them.  It would seem to indicate that Big Brother is somewhere around watching what is going on and that it is on unfounded reports, or certainly reports that are not capable of being shown the light of day, that some of these transfers have been made.  This is the general picture whether the Minister accepts it or not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy is giving an exaggerated view of the consequences of transfers.  It is one of the exigencies of service in a force such as the Garda Síochána that members are liable to be transferred.  When that liability falls on a member who is not anxious to be transferred, but in connection with whom there may be good reasons arising out of the exigencies of the service why he should be transferred, he is going to feel aggrieved. Unfortunately this is something that is part and parcel of a force with the responsibility and makeup of the Garda Síochána.  I would be anxious that as far as possible such grievances would be kept to the bare minimum and even removed altogether so that members would be satisfied that they are being transferred properly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>This is what I would expect any Minister for Justice to feel <Col N="1780" /> about the matter.  Allowing that there may be some exaggerations, as the Minister had suggested, I still ask him to take particular note of what I have said in regard to a number of people being transferred from an area into one which it has not always been attractive for members to be sent and that there does not seem to be, nor have there been given in certain instances, any particular reasons.  We know that Gardaí are recruited on the basis that they are subject to transfer, but they are not transferred for nothing.</P>

The question of transfers and some other matters have been the subject of recent discussions between myself, the Garda Representative Bodies and the Garda authorities.  I can assure the Deputy that steps are in the course of being taken which will meet many of the views he has expressed.</P>

      <P>The successful completion of a potential officers' course is only one of a number of requirements which have to be fulfilled before a non-commissioned officer of An Fórsa Cosanta Áitiúil can be considered for appointment to be an officer.</P>

There have been substantial increases in the cost of transport and the cost of the upkeep of uniforms.

      <P>Is the Deputy aware that in 1950 the Coalition Government introduced these payments. They remained unchanged for nearly 21 years and during most of that period Fianna Fáil were in office.  In addition to a gratuity while on annual training, a member receives the full permanent Defence Force rate of pay appropriate to his rank.  The total amount&mdash;and I emphasise total&mdash;to which a member would be entitled, assuming he attends for the 14 days annual training, is as follows.  In 1971 under Fianna Fáil, a sergeant received £70 and he now receives £137; in 1971 under Fianna Fáil, a corporal received £67 and he now receives £130; a single private recruit received £41 in 1971 under Fianna Fáil and he now receives £90.  The Deputy will agree that, even taking inflation into consideration, these are very substantial improvements in comparison with the allowances provided by Fianna Fáil when they were in office.  It is my desire and my hope that the position will be kept under review.  I assure the Deputy that, while I have no proposal to increase the gratuity at the moment, I will certainly look into the matter and give it my close personal attention.</P>

    <P Just="Right">&mdash;(The Taoiseach).</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>When I was speak ing before Question Time I was making the point that the figures in relation to the Department of Local Government are disappointing, to say the least of it.  The Minister might explain the figures in the Book of Estimates in regard to housing.  In 1966, an estimate of £119 million was provided and the outturn was £105 million.  In 1977, the estimated figure was £101.38 million which seems to be a rather drastic reduction for this Department.  In relation to sanitary services for 1976 we had a figure of £27.80 million and this year it is 27.46 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again, these figures are disappointing in that for any type of development it is necessary to provide a proper infrastructure.  In Mayo, for instance, we have a situation where industry cannot be developed without the necessary infrastructure and I believe this is an area where a great deal more money must be provided.  Because we are now in the EEC and funds such as the Regional Fund and FEOGA grants are available, one would expect that the Minister would have a great deal more money for this type of development.  Promotion of industry depends to a great extent on matters of this kind.  In one town in my constituency recently the IDA had, because of lack of water, proper sewerage and considerations of that kind, to divert to another area a certain type of industry which would have been complementary to an existing industry. It is also an area where employment would be generated if such works were available.  The figure for this year being practically the same as last year indicates that there does not seem to <Col N="1801" /> have been much thinking or planning on that aspect of it.  Perhaps it explains something to which the Minister referred and with which I intend to deal later&mdash;that 9 per cent of the capital budget estimate last year was not used despite the fact that during last year we had such a high rate of unemployment.</P>
    <P>In relation to grants from Europe, particularly FEOGA grants, the Minister should look at the situation as regards local authorities.  For instance, in harbour development a 25 per cent FEOGA grant can be obtained. The local authority do not benefit from this.  The Department of Finance benefit directly but the same contribution has to be made by the local authority.  In fairness, local authorities should at least get half the grant. When large harbour developments and works of that kind are concerned it means that very substantial sums must be provided by the local authority. When the FEOGA grant is paid the Minister can reduce his contribution by 25 per cent whereas the local authority's contribution remains at 25 per cent.  They gain nothing from the grant from Europe.</P>
    <P>There seems to be a great deal of misunderstanding as to how EEC grants can be applied, particularly in the case of the Department of Local Government.  There seems to be very little information available in the Departments as to how grants may be applied to group water schemes and such matters.  This prompts me to suggest that for the handling of grants from Europe and matters relating to Europe generally there appears to be a need for a special Government department to deal with EEC affairs in order to streamline the present situation and help local authorities and others to extract the greatest advantage from the various grants now being made available.</P>
    <P>Great play has been made about the benefits being given to social welfare recipients but I do not think the Government have anything to boast of in that respect.  What social welfare recipients are getting is only barely in line with what is being given to other sectors of the community.  The trade unions and others demand increases <Col N="1802" /> in wages so why should the Government boast when the less well-off are benefiting to some extent from the present budget?  The budget benefits must be related to what one can actually do with money at present; it is not the amount you have that matters but what you can get for it and with inflation soaring as it is, I think very much more would be necessary to keep pace with price and cost of living increases.  In the last few weeks, since the budget was introduced, we have had several price increases.  It is a question of having enough to pay for the necessities of life and I doubt if the budget provides for that.</P>
    <P>One section of the community not catered for in the budget&mdash;and it is time the Minister and the Government had a good hard look at this question&mdash;is the self-employed section. They have no protection at present.  I am sure many Deputies have the same experience as I have of small business people and others who have fallen on lean times for various reasons and find themselves in a sad plight financially.  They apply for home assistance as the last resort. Probably their pride very often prevents them from going to the home assistance officer to seek help.  When they go to the Department of Social Welfare, because they may have had a small business in the past or something like that, they find it very hard to convince the officials that they are entitled to assistance.  The only other avenue of help available to them then is the home assistance officer.  I think it is time for the Minister to introduce some scheme which would give some protection to the self-employed.</P>
    <P>If something like a stamp were introduced, possibly on a voluntary basis initially they would have some form of protection if they fell on lean times. When the self-employed, for example part-time fishermen, look for unemployment assistance, they are asked to give an account of their earnings.  Even if they give an honest account of their earnings&mdash;and I suppose most people err on the other side&mdash;their word is hardly ever accepted and the social welfare officer takes it that they are <Col N="1803" /> making a fortune.  As a result, the home assistance granted to them is not accepted.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of the social welfare payments is the question dealing with single people living with their parents. I have had hundreds of representations from people who were cut by £7 or £8 a week because, according to the social welfare officer, they have been afforded the privilege of board and lodging with their parents.  I cannot understand where in one instance the social welfare officer may take £7 or £8 from an applicant while another person gets full benefit.  This inconsistency is unfair and unjust.  If a person is unemployed, whether he lives with his parents or otherwise, the same yardstick should apply.  He should get the full amount that applies to a single person.  This would ease the work of public representatives and it would save a good deal of money on postage if we were relieved of that situation.</P>
    <P>There seems to be a fallacy abroad that people are not prepared to work. I refute this.  I believe that if people were afforded an opportunity to work they would be prepared to do so.  I accept, however, that it is hard to get people to do casual work but where permanent employment is available, people are more than willing to take it. We have several examples of that on the west coast.  People emigrate to cities and around the country because there is no employment at home.  They do not want to scrounge on the State. They will work if it is provided for them.</P>
    <P>There is no planning at national or local level to try to provide more jobs. A great deal of money comes into my county from different Government sources&mdash;Social Welfare, Bord Fáilte, Roinn na Gaeltachta, Forestry and the county councils.  If people were to plan, it would be possible to have a more productive response from State funds.  For example, in a village in the West where £50,000 is being handed out in social welfare, this money could be spent providing amenities like water, proper roads, car parks, planting trees and so on.  There are several projects that could be undertaken if <Col N="1804" /> there was some type of planning.  The extra cost to the State would not amount to a very great deal.  If £50,000 a year is spent that will amount to £500,000 in 10 years.  If that amount of money is spent in any village at the end of 10 years they will have something to show for it.  This would provide work and do away with idleness. The children would not grow up getting bad example because the people are idle.  The Minister and his officials should look at this.</P>
    <P>The Minister has provided £1 million for local improvement schemes for the whole country.  In Mayo alone we have works estimated at £2 million. The argument is often used that it would cost too much to provide these schemes and that the appointment of extra officials would not be justified to provide the kind of work I am talking about.  Mayo is an example where the work is already estimated, the schemes are prepared and all that is necessary is to get the workmen to do the jobs on local improvement roads, drainage and so on.</P>
    <P>In a parish near me, through the initiative and guidance of the parish priest, schemes have been done on a voluntary basis.  The people are doing the work and the county council are paying for the materials.  If we got this kind of spirit moving at local level, we would be doing a very good job and the State funds would be put to better use than they are at the moment.</P>
    <P>I was disappointed to find that the Minister made no reference to the Western Development Board which has been talked about for a long time.  We expected that Board to be in operation by now, that we would see the benefits that were promised and that the West would see a great deal of progress being made as a result of the setting up of this board.  We felt, too, that the EEC Regional Fund could be used to finance this board.  There is no shortage of schemes which could be implemented if this board were in operation. When the Minister is replying perhaps he will let us know when this board will be established, where it will be located and where it will operate.</P>
    <P>Another big disappointment in the budget is the amount provided by way <Col N="1805" /> of grants for third level education. These grants take no account of the increased costs which have to be faced by students.  Charges for board and lodgings, fees, books and transport have all increased.  Only those with plenty of money can now afford to send their children to the universities or regional colleges.  The income level for grants is really a joke.  An income of £1,800 is very little today and as I see it only the very poor and those who are at the other end of the scale can avail of university education.  This emphasises the position of the person in the middle income group, particularly the wage earner, the person on a fixed income. He pays for everything but benefits from nothing at all.  He cannot benefit under the medical schemes or the educational schemes.  We are gradually moving back again towards the situation which existed 25 or 30 years ago and this is cause for grave concern.  There are students who are making an honest effort to pay their own way through university by taking up part-time employment but when they have finished their education they may find themselves without a job. This is a very sad reflection on the state of our economy.</P>
    <P>Bord Fáilte have in the past few years prepared a number of plans at both national and local level for the expansion and development of tourism. Again, the amount of money made available is very small.  Last year in Mayo we received a grant of £9,000 and the local authority backed that by providing another £9,000 for schemes such as access roads to beaches and so on.  What can one do with that kind of money in this day and age?  It is a paltry sum.  In view of the importance of tourism to the national economy the Minister should have been more generous in his grants for this very important industry.  The tourist industry has run into problems because of the Northern situation, but it has a great future.  Money spent in the development of the industry would bear fruit and it is disappointing that such a small sum is provided for Bord Fáilte this year.</P>
    <P>I notice that the Minister has decided to make some extra money <Col N="1806" /> available to Óstlanna Iompair Éireann Teoranta.  He stated that the estimated expenditure of £15 million in 1977 is in respect of the provision of improved facilities and equipment in the company's hotels.  This is rather ironic when Óstlanna Iompair Éireann Teoranta are now closing three of their hotels.  One of these is within eight miles of my own home and it has been a part of the place for about a century.  It provided the only local employment.  The Minister may say that the closure of this hotel is not his responsibility because it is owned by a semi-State company, but surely he has some say in deciding the future of these hotels.  I am asking the Minister now to consider the decision to close this hotel which is of a very high standard.  We do not have many hotels of that type in Mayo and I think that the Minister might ask Óstlanna Iompair Éireann Teoranta to reconsider their decision.</P>
    <P>The sum provided for fisheries is ridiculous, especially when one relates it to the statement by the Minister for Foreign Affairs after the meeting at The Hague.  We were informed then that Ireland was to increase its fishing fleet by 300 boats in 1979, that we were to have more harbour facilities and more grants and aids for processing.  The figure provided makes a complete joke of the statement of the Minister for Foreign Affairs at that time.  It is quite obvious that there are no plans on the lines suggested by him.  If there were, the figure would be shown in the budget to indicate that the Government are serious on this question.  Everybody will admit that the Minister for Foreign Affairs was just talking off the top of his head without considering the whole question of the fishing industry or without considering the statements he gave to the people, the press and the media at that time.  He has not done himself, the Government or the industry any good by using the press and the media to try to give the Irish people the impression that he got something for them.</P>
    <P>In a BIM boatyard 30 per cent of the workers have been told that they may be laid off shortly.  It is quite obvious that the Minister was only <Col N="1807" /> fooling himself by the statements he made on that occasion.  It is next to impossible for a fisherman to get a loan for a second-hand boat.  The Government policy is that the boatyards must be maintained.  I agree with this.  I do not want to see any unemployment in our boatyards, but the Government should surely make provision for people who want to buy second-hand boats.  Many of our fishermen started off by buying second-hand boats They were in a position to buy these boats cheaply.  After fishing for some time they were able to buy new and larger boats.  It is a pity, with the importance of the industry and the necessity for expansion which is brought home to us every day, that we have not the money available to do a good job.</P>
    <P>The Minister has made money available for an exploratory vessel, which is very welcome.  When will we have it built?  Money should be made available to get boats of this kind on hire until we have sufficient of our own available.  Last week there was a statement from the Department of Oceanography in UCG saying they are not able to continue their research because of lack of funds.  The information they are seeking is very vital to the industry.  We are trying to prove to our EEC partners that conservation and other measures are necessary.  It is deplorable that we do not have sufficient funds to carry on this very important work.  The professor responsible made a public statement saying that it will be necessary to suspend some of the work and have some people engaged there released because of lack of funds.</P>
    <P>This ties up with what I have been saying about the completely irresponsible attitude of the Minister for Foreign Affairs in his statements about what we were planning and hoping to get for the fishing industry.  One might say, as a result of what has happened in the last few days, that the Taoiseach recognises this fact because he appointed a Minister for Fisheries and sent him to Brussels to get what appears to be for the time being a better deal for the fishermen.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1808" /> I want to say something about income tax paid by fishermen under the PAYE system.  This has been the subject of a High Court action.  The decision has not been in favour of the fishermen.  It is impossible to have a PAYE system put into operation as far as fishermen are concerned.  There may be one week when they can fish and do reasonably well but there may be three when, because of bad weather or something else, they cannot fish and they have no income.  It is ridiculous to try to apply the PAYE system where they are concerned.  I am not saying that they should not pay tax. I accept that they, like everybody else who has sufficient income, should pay tax on that income.  The Minister however might ask the Revenue Commissioners to have another look at this matter and devise some means of collecting tax from fishermen besides the PAYE system.</P>
    <P>I know there is one port where an arrangement has been worked out.  It seems to be working very satisfactorily, but they are slightly different from the situation we have around the coast in general.  It would be to the benefit of the Exchequer if some other type of collection were arranged instead of using the PAYE system where fishermen are concerned.  I do not believe that the tax can be collected effectively in that way or that it is fair to use that method to collect income tax from fishermen.</P>
    <P>We should be spending a great deal more money on the development of our land.  It is the greatest resource we have.  The position in relation to arterial drainage schemes is that only a small sum is made available for this work.  There is also a small amount available for local improvement schemes and joint works undertaken under the farm modernisation scheme. They are the only grants available for land drainage but the country is crying out for this kind of development. Huge sums are made available to the IDA for the promotion of industry&mdash;I am not saying this is wrong; I agree that most of it is well spent&mdash; but it is a reflection on ourselves that so much of our land is non-productive due to the lack of investment in drainage. <Col N="1809" /> A great deal more should be invested in that type of work.  Many acres of bog could be developed and provide a greater income for owners of small holdings.  An Foras Talúntais studied this matter in an effort to find out what could be done to make this type of land productive.  The ground work has been carried out and the money should be made available to get on with the job.</P>
    <P>In this regard I am sure a case could be made to the EEC to provide moneys for the underdeveloped areas. Such an investment would be of more lasting benefit than grants made available to industrialists who very often when something goes wrong pull out, with the result that the State loses thousands of millions of pounds. Money invested in land would show a return.</P>
    <P>The amount of money available for the EEC retirement scheme is not attractive.  We are not getting the response one would expect because people do not see any advantage in handing over their land to the Land Commission for division among young farmers.  The pensions being offered are not attractive enough.  It is hard to know what is the best course to adopt.  Is a promotion effort necessary to sell the idea to the farming community? Are we doing enough to encourage elderly farmers to dispose of their land?  On the question of the distribution of land there is a tendency where land is being divided by the Land Commission to give land to the person with a large holding.  Looking at it from the point of view of the agricultural benefit of that situation it may be the best arrangement, but one must relate the division of land to the social structure.</P>
    <P>Deputy Seán Flanagan often referred to off-farm employment for people who did not have sufficient land.  He suggested that they be given employment.  That is the best course to follow.  Where land is available for distribution those most in need should get it.  A great deal more would be done for the social structure if that method was followed rather than creating bigger holdings for those with a good deal of land.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1810" /> A matter that will cause a big problem for industry is the proposed higher telephone charges.  The service at present is desperate, particularly in the west.  One must experience the difficulty involved in getting a call through from the city to any part of the west to believe it.  I cannot see increased charges bringing in extra revenue because people will use the telephone as little as possible.  Communication is very important to industry and one would expect a greater injection of capital for the improvement of this service.  We are still awaiting the erection of automatic exchanges in the west and I hope we will not have to wait much longer.</P>
    <P>The tax on farmers is unjust in many ways.  We do not say that farmers should not pay tax; we accept that, like everybody else, they should pay their fair share.  There are not many farmers in Mayo with big holdings but there is a matter in the Minister's speech which frightened farmers in Mayo.  That concerns a farmer with a small holding who also has a job.  The reason such a farmer had to take up a job is because his holding was too small to give him a decent living. Between the two, such a farmer is able to have a higher standard of living and it is too bad that he finds himself taxed as a result of this budget.  Representations have been made to the Minister on this and I hope he will have a look at it because it is a harsh provision.</P>
    <P>Recently we had before us a Bill to provide electricity in areas which have not had such a service.  I understand the ESB are still awaiting instructions from the Department, that they still do not know whether money will be made available to enable them to provide this necessary service.  I hope that instructions will soon be given to the ESB to proceed with this work and thereby help the backward areas.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the earlier speakers from the Government side had a very good sense of humour.  He said the budget has made the Government more popular.  I suppose there is nothing wrong in a Government seeking to make themselves popular but with such a gigantic task facing them they need a much greater instrument of national financing than the budget to make them popular.  That Deputy spoke with more enthusiasm than realism.  Any one who distributes money widely should be popular, and that goes for Governments, but people like to examine the source of such money and how it has to be paid back.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Here we have reached a stage when we must begin to look much more seriously at our social problems.  I would not for a moment cast doubts on the sincerity of the Minister for Finance in his efforts to solve the problems facing us.  We on this side <Col N="1812" /> do not claim a monopoly of interest but we must ask whether this is an election budget.  Of course we do not know yet if there will be an election this year.  However, after 50 years of self-government, we should be getting down to an examination of the problems and of the possibilities for developing our society into what we could justifiably call a Christian society.  I use that description in the widest possible sense because we all must share concern for our less well-off neighbours.</P>
    <P>At the moment in European society many old people are being pushed to the wall.  I read in a medical journal published in Ireland a question about what will happen to our old people in the 1980s.  The answer in our neighbouring island is probably euthanasia, a horrible prospect which I do not accept.  The medical journal to which I refer tried to draw attention to the necessity for an examination of the whole problem of our older people. I suggest to the Minister therefore that he should be examining the possibilities of finding more money to enable us to give better services to our old people.  Far from establishing costly institutions we should initiate a campaign of preventive medicine and encourage old people to stay at home, ensuring that they have ample assistance and care and are treated as members of society instead of shutting them away in institutions in which to spend the autumn of their lives.</P>
    <P>My second point relates to children in orphanages.  The country owes a great debt to religious orders who for many years ran these orphanages and provided shelter for these children.  We all know that there is now a decline in religious vocations and the religious who are still running these orphanages have to employ lay people to assist them.  Unfortunately the capitation grant, though increased fairly recently, is utterly inadequate.  I am familiar with an orphanage which caters for about 50 children.  The building is an old one and the cost of heating it is taking almost half the capitation grant of each child with the result that there is only half left to feed and clothe the children.  The Government <Col N="1813" /> must answer the call for more funds, thereby repaying to some extent the selfless dedication of these religious down through the years.  In the past they made no claim.  Their services were given freely.  They are still serving but their numbers are unfortunately decreasing.</P>
    <P>A very important aspect of the budget is the Government's attitude to the construction industry.  Some amazing statements have been made by Ministers as to the progress of the housing drive.  There are over 20,000 unemployed building operatives.  There is a slump in the housing drive.  The housing waiting list in this city is certainly not getting any shorter.  The Minister for Local Government quoted 5,000 people on the waiting list of Dublin Corporation.  That is the official figure but the members of the corporation&mdash;Labour Party, Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil&mdash;do not accept this figure.  There are many more waiting for houses but for some reason they do not apply.  Some know it is no good applying.  They would not be accepted. A childless couple will not be put on the waiting list.  A family with only one child has very little chance of being housed.  There are people in the older city areas who do not want to change and they do not apply until the corporation bulldozes the area and rehouses them elsewhere.  I would put the figure at 8,000 at least.  That figure does not take cognisance of houses which are growing progressively obsolete. We will always have a waiting list. As someone said, the only city without a housing problem is a dying city. Dublin is very far from that and our housing problem is growing.</P>
    <P>We were very disappointed with the amount provided by the Minister for the construction industry.  I know the argument is that this Government have given five times whatever the figure was when Fianna Fáil were in Government. That may be so but in real terms what was given some years ago before inflation was allowed to run riot was of much more value than the higher figure given today.  I would always measure the prosperity of a country and the effectiveness of a Government by the attitude towards <Col N="1814" /> the construction industry and the state of that industry.  Nobody in the Government will have the temerity to suggest that that industry is thriving. It is not.  There are some 25,000 building operatives unemployed.  The waiting list for houses is growing.  People cannot afford to keep the existing stock of houses in proper repair because the Government have cut back on house repair grants and refuse to increase the income limits for SDA loans.  People are losing hope all the time.  Some time ago the Minister for Local Government said that because SDA loans were not being taken up he was taking £1 million from housing funds and applying that money to sanitary services.  The Minister misread the situation.  People were not taking up the loans because they did not qualify.  In the second place, if they did qualify they could not afford them. If a person earns more than £46 a week he will not qualify for the £4,500 loan.  The average price of a house is £9,000 and the question arises how a person could afford the repayments on such a wage.  Here we have what the Americans call a Catch 22 situation; if you qualify for the loan you cannot afford to take it up but if you can afford to repay the loan you do not qualify.</P>
    <P>The Minister was quite right when he said loans were not being taken up but he gave the wrong reason.  If the Government had decided to increase the SDA loan to £6,000 at least and to raise the income limit to a more reasonable figure more people would take up the loans.  This would have been a shot in the arm for the housebuilding industry.  However, this was not done and because the loans were not taken up the Minister transferred the money to sanitary services.  I realise that these services are necessary but included in this item are grants for swimming pools. People may say these are necessary but I think we should get our priorities right.  A most necessary item for any family is a proper house. Thousands of people in this city are forced to live in flats in the inner suburbs for which they pay exorbitant rents.  They do this because they cannot get together a deposit for <Col N="1815" /> a house and do not qualify for a loan.  This vicious circle continues.</P>
    <P>The Government lost a tremendous opportunity of having a really popular budget.  They could have increased the SDA loans and raised the income limits.  This would have given an impetus to the housing industry and would have given much-needed employment. Instead of paying people unemployment benefit or assistance we could have paid men a good wage while going ahead with building and reconstruction work.</P>
    <P>Bad housing breeds many social disorders and from such disorders may arise great social evils in the community. Apart from that there is the injustice of asking a young couple to start their married life in a flat which is inadequate for them.  We are missing a great opportunity of providing flats or houses which would raise the general standard of living and which would give a much-needed boost to the construction industry.  If that industry is doing well most of the economy will do well because there are many undertakings associated with the building industry.  There would be an improvement in the economy generally and we could reduce the staggering number of unemployed.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1816" /> At the moment even apprentices are being sacked and we can visualise the problems that will occur in a few year's time.  If the economy recovers we will not have sufficient trained craftsmen in the building or in other trades.  Despite the wonderful work of AnCO, even they cannot be asked to take on this huge task on their own. They need proper Government backing.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister for Finance is aware of the problems that exist.  He may say that the Government have done what they could to ease the problems but I do not accept that. Much more could have been done for the building industry which is a vital one in our economy.  I cannot understand any Government which does not give it a top priority in the allocation of resources.  There is no good in saying the Government are spending much more than last year.  When one considers the high rate of inflation it is obvious that we would have to give much more even to keep at the level obtaining five or six years ago.  The Minister may tell us that the Government have done much good in the budget.</P>

The Road Fund grants for 1977 total £26.57 millions, an increase of approximately 30 per cent over 1976, while it is estimated that cost increases affecting the building and construction industry amount to 15.5 per cent between 1976 and 1977.</P>

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 52 and 79 together.</P>
      <P>Where a person employed in the public service had prior pensionable service in the Defence Forces during the Emergency up to two years of such pensionable service is, subject to certain conditions, reckonable under pension schemes in the public service, including the civil service.  The initiative in having Emergency Defence Forces service recognised for pension purposes in the State-sponsored area rests with the individual organisations. In the time available it is not possible to ascertain from those organisations if they recognise such service.</P>
      <P>The question of linking up, for pension purposes, all pensionable service in the Defence Forces with service in the Garda Síochána and secondary teaching is at present being considered in connection with the preparation of a draft scheme for the transfer of pension rights between public service organisations and State-sponsored organisations, including the universities. The new scheme, if accepted, will enable any person serving in a pensionable capacity after the effective date, in any of the organisations which participate in the transfer network, to reckon for pension purposes any pensionable service with any of the other network members, provided</P>
      <P>(a)  no pension is payable in respect of the earlier service</P>
      <P>(b)  where a return of contributions or award of gratuity has been made, an appropriate refund is made</P>
      <P>(c)  the earlier service was not terminated by dismissal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1792" /> The draft scheme is complex and having regard to this, and to the number of organisations involved, it will be some time as yet before it is finalised. There are no arrangements for the aggregation of service for incremental purposes between the Defence Forces, Garda and secondary teaching.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Health the average waiting time <Col N="1793" /> for a patient awaiting (a) eye surgery and (b) hip surgery at a Dublin hospital; and the steps that are being taken to shorten the waiting time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Corish) Brendan Corish">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Corish)</NameTxt>
      <P>Three hospitals in Dublin carry out eye surgery and the waiting period varies from two or three weeks to five or six months depending on the hospital to which the patient is referred and the type of eye surgery involved.  Urgent cases are usually treated without delay.</P>
      <P>Steps which will have the effect of shortening the waiting time are being taken.  Within the past two years a new 18-bed ophthalmic unit has been opened at Sligo General Hospital and an extended and improved ophthalmic unit was provided at Ardkeen Hospital, Waterford. These units help to relieve the pressure on the Dublin hospitals.  The position should be improved further when a new additional post of ophthalmic surgeon at Ardkeen Hospital is filled.</P>
      <P>Recently my Department conducted a survey of ophthalmic patients in eight different hospitals, including the three Dublin hospitals, covering a period of two months.  The results of this survey are being examined at present.  It is hoped that the results will be useful in showing whether further additional facilities are needed.</P>
      <P>Hip surgery is carried out at four public hospitals in Dublin and the waiting period varies depending on the hospital and surgeon to whom the patient is referred.  Most patients are operated on within 12 months but in some cases the waiting period can be up to two or three years.</P>
      <P>The North Eastern Health Board proposes to build a second orthopaedic theatre at Navan Orthopaedic Unit, and the North-Western Health Board are considering the establishment of an orthopaedic unit in their area.  These developments should help to relieve the pressure on the Dublin orthopaedic units.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Comhairle na nOspidéal are at present studying the orthopaedic services generally and when their views are known I will be in a better position to decide what further action should <Col N="1794" /> be taken to meet the increasing demand for hip surgery.</P>

      <P>Laboratory tests of cervical smears are provided free of charge at Portiuncula Hospital for women who are eligible for free hospital services under the 1970 Health Act.  Other women attending the hospital are charged for these tests as private patients.</P>
      <P>The responsibility of providing a service for these tests in this area rests with the Western Health Board.

      <P>Priority is given, in the Eastern Health Board, to provision of dental treatment for children.  They normally have to wait about six weeks for such <Col N="1795" /> treatment.  Certain groups of adult medical card holders are given priority treatment.  These groups include expectant mothers, the handicapped, those requiring treatment for special medical reasons and the elderly.  In their case the waiting period is also about six weeks except for the elderly where the waiting period is about seven months.  Medical card holders outside the priority groups have to wait considerably longer.  Emergency treatment, usually for the relief of pain, is provided immediately in all cases at all centres.</P>
      <P>I have stated on many occasions that there is an obvious need to extend and develop the public dental services. The position is being kept under constant review to see how best improvements can be effected.  I would hope that the job creation proposals in the recent budget will allow a significant improvement to be made in these services in 1977.</P>
