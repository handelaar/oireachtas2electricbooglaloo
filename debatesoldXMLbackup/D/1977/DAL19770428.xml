      <P>The net amount originally allocated for Vote 9&mdash;Public Works and Buildings&mdash; for 1977, as shown in the Book of Estimates, was £25,868,000.  In addition to this, the Government have since allocated to the Office of Public Works a further sum of £2,000,000 out of the additional £55.5 million being provided to improve job prospects following ratification of the new national pay agreement <Col N="1720" /> in February.  This brings the net total being made available for Public Works and Buildings for the current year to £27,868,000.</P>
      <P>It is intended that the additional allocation will be distributed over three subheads as follows:</P>

    <P>I will be introducing a Supplementary Estimate later in the year to cover the additional allocation.</P>
    <P>I will now comment on the various subheads that make up the Estimate. Subheads A1, A2, B1, B2 and C cover the administrative expenses of the Office of Public Works.  The provision under subhead D covers purchases of sites and premises for various Government services, including the acquisition of the fee simple of some existing leasehold properties.  The subhead provides also for the purchase of land required for the national monuments service and for national parks and amenity areas.  As Deputies will be aware from previous statements the Commissioners of Public Works are actively engaged in the creation of a network of national parks throughout the country, in order to conserve areas of outstanding scenic, scientific, historic and recreational values for the benefit and enjoyment of our own people and visitors from abroad.  The key to the establishment of such parks is, of course, the acquisition of lands suitable for such purposes and as the commissioners have no power to acquire such lands compulsorily the success of their programme depends to a great extent on the willingness of people to sell their lands for such a worthy purpose.</P>
    <P>As we know there is a deep attachment to the soil in Ireland and a great reluctance to part with the ownership of land.  It is gratifying, therefore, to record that in their negotiations so far the commissioners have met with an understanding and co-operative <Col N="1721" /> attitude from the various landowners approached and the successful completion of negotiations was due in large measure to this attitude.</P>
    <P>During the past few months the commissioners took possession of the lands at Letterfrack and Kylemore, County Galway as a nucleus of a national park in Connemara to which I made reference when introducing last year's Estimate, and negotiations are at present in progress for a number of adjoining areas.</P>
    <P>Because of the national and international importance of the Burren, County Clare, as an area of unique botanical, geological and archaeological interest, the Minister for Finance has authorised my office to establish a national park there.  A start has been made by the acquisition of 59 acres in the Mullaghmore area north of Corrofin, a further 295 acres are at present being acquired and negotiations are in progress for the purchase of a number of other holdings.  The purchase of the highly scenic area at Glena adjoining the Killarney Lakes has been completed and negotiations are well advanced for the acquisition of some further small but significant properties to round off the national park in that area.</P>
    <P>Subhead E covers the cost of new and improved accommodation for various Government Departments and the services they administer and of improved facilities for these services. The building programme for Dublin and the provinces to which I referred last year is now in process of implementation. The cost of providing improved facilities at national parks, waterways and monuments and of certain marine works is also included under this subhead.  The total amount being made available this year for these works is £7,600,000, that is, the £6,000,000 in the Estimate and the additional allocation of £1,600,000.</P>
    <P>A list of all the works on which expenditure will be incurred in the current year has been supplied to Deputies.  I will comment on the more significient items.  The installation of a stand-by generator, to provide emergency electricity supply for Leinster House and Government Buildings <Col N="1722" /> in the event of power failure, is nearing completion.  Additional space has been provided and fitted out for Oireachtas purposes in Kildare Street. The final stage of this work was completed recently.  The space made available in Leinster House has been refurbished.  The work of refurbishing the South Block of Government Buildings is almost completed and most of the accommodation is now in use. Work on the North Block will be started this year.</P>
    <P>Provision is made for Clare Island. County Mayo, to continue a scheme to improve landing facilities in the interests of transport and communication with the mainland.  The improvements involve widening the pier, raising the level of its deck, providing a sloping quay, a crane, a winch and a boat cradle.  Due to contractual difficulties the completion of this work has suffered delay.  There is provision also for a boring survey at Inishbofin, County Galway, to investigate the feasibility and estimated cost of dredging a channel which is necessary to improve transport facilities and communications with the mainland.  Provision is also made for a boring survey at Courtmacsherry, County Cork, to investigate the possibility of constructing a new jetty in the commercial and sea angling interest.</P>
    <P>Temporary additional accommodation has been provided in part of the former St. Vincent's Hospital premises at Lower Leeson Street for some of the State Laboratory staff and the planning of a new building to provide suitable permanent accommodation for the entire State Laboratory has been commenced.</P>
    <P>Additional accommodation is being adapted and fitted out for some of the Valuation Office staff.</P>
    <P>A total of £36,500 is being provided for works at the Ordnance Survey. The new printing building has been completed and work is well advanced on a scheme of improvements to the residential quarters and on the provision of canteen facilities.</P>
    <P>A sum of £156,500 has been allocated to works for the Revenue Commissioners. £75,000 of this is in respect <Col N="1723" /> of the provision of improved office accommodation in Dublin and the remainder is for buildings in the border area, at Clones, Monaghan, Carrigans, Blacklion, Dundalk and Ballyshannon. I am glad to say that the new Customs Road Station at Monaghan and the new offices at Ballyshannon have been completed and that work is in progress at the custom post at Clones and at the Dundalk Customs Road Station.</P>
    <P>I am providing £320,000 for the provision of improved facilities at parks, on the Shannon navigation and at national monuments.</P>
    <P>A total of £77,000 is being provided for works at St. Enda's Rathfarnham. The first phase of the internal rehabilitation of the building is in progress and is expected to be completed by the end of the year.  It is hoped to start work shortly on the provision of a natural history exhibition centre and of a garage, office and store for use in connection with the maintenance of the park.</P>
    <P>The installation of the new water supply at Muckross House, Killarney is nearing completion and it is hoped to invite tenders for the sewerage scheme before the end of this year. This scheme will provide for the treatment of nutrients.  Following the recent agreement with the trustees of Muckross House, Killarney in relation to a new management structure for the House, it has been decided to improve and expand the interpretive and educational aspects of the house so that visitors to the national park may obtain the greatest possible benefit from their visits.  These improvements will be carried out over a period of three to five years and a provision of £7,000 has been included this year to enable the first stage to be put in hands.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to say that a contract has been placed for the construction of a new visitors' waiting centre and caretaker's cottage at Gearhameen at the entrance to the Upper Lake, Killarney and a sum of £22,000 is being provided for this work during the current year.</P>
    <P>Knockreer House&mdash;formerly Kenmare <Col N="1724" /> House&mdash;Killarney is to be adapted for use as a biological research and field studies centre related to Killarney National Park.  Biological research is a vital function in the scientific management of a national park especially in an area like Killarney which embraces such a varied natural and semi-natural environment.  To take advantage of the results of biological research in the park it is proposed to establish a non-residential field studies centre in this building.  The house will also be used as an auxiliary visitor centre for the national park.</P>
    <P>There is provision to clear the amount outstanding for the restoration carried out on the east wing of Kilkenny Castle.  Since it was opened to the public in August last over 15,000 have visited the castle.  Facilities are available for art exhibitions and music recitals and I am pleased that these facilities are being availed of by cultural organisations.</P>
    <P>Last year I expressed the hope that a start would be made on the provision of additional public toilets in Phoenix Park.  Due to planning difficulties the project has been delayed but it is hoped to make a start this year on the provision of toilet and car parking facilities near Knockmaroon Gate.  This area is being frequented by increasing numbers of visitors since the opening of the Furry Glen nature trail.</P>
    <P>When introducing last year's Estimate I indicated that our scheme for the development of the Phoenix Park extension was being re-examined in the light of Dublin Corporation's proposals for road improvements for the area. Deputies will recall that it was intended to incorporate a public golf course in the overall scheme.  It has since transpired that a much reduced area of land will be available for development and it has, therefore, been decided to abandon the golf course proposal.  The commissioners intend instead to prepare alternative plans for the area which will provide recreational facilities for a wider public. Details of these plans will be announced in due course.</P>
    <P>The comprehensive planning study <Col N="1725" /> of Glenveagh National Park which I mentioned last year and which is being carried out in conjunction with An Bord Fáilte is making satisfactory progress and some basic conclusions have already been reached concerning the development of access points and the location of a main visitor reception area.  Arrangements have recently been made with Donegal County Council for certain roadworks at the main access point and it is expected that these works will be undertaken shortly.  Until such time as these and other works are completed public access to the park will have to be curtailed.</P>
    <P>A sum of £8,000 has been allocated for preliminary development work at Connemara National Park.  This will include the provision of a car park and limited visitor facilities at the Letterfrack end of the park.  Planning has commenced on the development of an amenity area on the mainland opposite Garnish Island.</P>
    <P>The sum of £91,000 has been provided this year for the development of the River Shannon.  The number of people taking cruising holidays has increased steadily over the last few years and the Shannon has now become a major tourism asset.  The provision of facilities to keep pace with the increasing cruiser traffic is vitally important and to this end my office are carrying out an extensive programme of works.  These include the construction of a major new harbour at Portumna, County Galway, and of additional landing places at strategic points on the river and lakes.  The restoration of the Lough Allen Canal from Battlebridge to Acres Lough is now nearing completion and it is hoped to open this section of the navigation to traffic within a matter of months.</P>
    <P>Last year the Office of Public Works received the Shannon Tourism and Recreation Study which they had commissioned in conjunction with Bord Fáilte.  This document, which assesses the recreational and tourist development of the Shannon and what is required to cater for it, has proved very helpful and will be used as a <Col N="1726" /> basis for development on the Shannon over the next decade.</P>
    <P>A total of £22,000 is required this year for new works in connection with the provision of facilities for visitors to certain national monuments.  At Cahir Castle, County Tipperary, a national heritage exhibition centre, set up jointly by Bord Fáilte and the Office of Public Works, has been open to the public since August, 1975, and has proved to be a great attraction. The provision of the ancillary facilities will be completed this year.</P>
    <P>The restoration of the vicars choral at the Rock of Cashel to serve as a visitors' reception area, which is nearing completion, should enhance the public's appreciation of this great monument.  Improved visitor facilities are being planned at Clonmacnoise. These will operate in conjunction with a new jetty to improve accessibility to the monument from the Shannon. Negotiations for the purchase of the necessary land are in progress.  Work is well advanced on the construction of an office building at Inchicore to house staff of the computer section of the Department of the Public Service.</P>
    <P>The provision under the heading of the Department of Justice amounts to £1,282,000.  This includes for the improvement of the accommodation of the courts of justice, but the main bulk of the provision is in respect of the erection of new Garda stations and the improvement of existing Garda buildings.  This programme is going very well.  Fifteen stations were completed last year and work is in progress at 34 centres.  Three more contracts are about to be placed and planning of a number of others is in hands.  Amongst the centres recently completed are Granard, where a new district headquarters has been opened, and a new divisional headquarters at Limerick which will be opened shortly.  Work is in progress on buildings at Castleblayney, Castlerea, Kanturk, Newcastle West and Swords. A scheme for major improvements at Portlaoise Garda station has commenced and it is expected that a contract will be placed shortly for an extension to the station at Finglas. <Col N="1727" /> Planning is well advanced for a divisional headquarters at Monaghan and for district headquarters at Carrick-on-Shannon and Manorhamilton.</P>
    <P>For the purpose of providing improved accommodation for the courts of justice the former Four Courts Hotel has been purchased and accommodation leased in a new building in the vicinity.  Provision is being made for adaptation work at these premises. The new offices in Athlone for some sections of the Department of Education are nearly completed and will shortly be available for occupation.</P>
    <P>We have two projects for the National Museum.  It is hoped that work will commence this year on the rewiring of the main building. Additional accommodation is being provided in a rented development at Merrion Row and when it has been fitted out to the requirements of the Museum it will give much needed extra space for the exhibition of their expanding collections.</P>
    <P>Planning is proceeding for a scheme to provide expansion space for the National Library in premises in Kildare Street and in Leinster Lane. The library badly needs this extra space to relieve serious congestion in their existing premises.</P>
    <P>The new offices in Castlebar were completed and occupied last year and provision is made here to pay balances of contractors' and suppliers' accounts.</P>
    <P>New offices are to be provided at Furbo for some staff of the Department of the Gaeltacht.  Planning is in hands and it is expected that tenders for the construction work will be invited this year.</P>
    <P>We now come to works totalling £525,200 for the Department of Agriculture and for the Fisheries Division which was until recently part of that Department.  The items include new buildings, alterations and additions to existing buildings at various agricultural centres and improved accommodation at the Botanic Gardens, including a new library and herbarium, to provide better research facilities for students.</P>
    <P>The following is some additional <Col N="1728" /> information on particular items.  Detailed planning for the provision of new buildings at the Botanic Gardens is well advanced.  Tenders have been invited for the erection of a new staff and student canteen.  A total of £225,000 is included for works at Abbotstown Farm.  The provision of a milking parlour and incinerator is nearing completion.  Work is in progress on the new laboratory and office accommodation for the scientific and research staff of the Fisheries Division and on the erection of a residence for the field station manager.  Tenders for the provision of loose box accommodation are under consideration.</P>
    <P>Work is in progress on the provision of additional facilities, including a new office building and equipment store, at the performance testing station, Tully, County Kildare.  It is now proposed that the new building to house the butter and seed testing stations will be erected at Abbotstown Farm instead of at Thorndale as originally proposed.  The accommodation requirements are at present being drawn up by the Department of Agriculture. Work has commenced on the provision of an extension to the brucellosis laboratory at Thorndale.  A contract has been placed for the provision of a new office building for the district veterinary staff at Raphoe, County Donegal.</P>
    <P>Planning is proceeding for the provision of extra accommodation for students at Ballyhaise Agricultural College.  An extention to the fisheries research station at Dunmore East fishery harbour centre is required to cater for the expansion of the station's activities.  Provision is required for the construction of a fisheries research station at Castletownbere fishery harbour centre.  Work will commence shortly on a scheme of improvements to the Geological Survey Office in Kildare Street.</P>
    <P>A contract is about to be placed for the erection of a new training school and synoptic reporting station for the meteorological service of the Department of Transport and Power at Murrough, County Galway.  Tenders for the erection of a new meteorological station at Claremorris, County <Col N="1729" /> Mayo are under consideration.  A new meteorological station is planned for Johnstown Castle, County Wexford.</P>
    <P>A sum of £436,800 is required for the Department of Posts and Telegraphs. A new post office at Donegal, an extension to Letterkenny post office and the modernisation of Cobh post office have been completed while a new post office at Clonmel is in course of erection.  Planning for new post offices at Longford, Mullingar and Tipperary is well advanced and new post offices at Fermoy and Navan are proposed.</P>
    <P>The modernisation of Ballyhaunis post office is in progress while modernisation schemes are planned for Enniscorthy, Limerick, Roscommon, Thurles and Waterford post offices. The adaptation of a former school in Ballinlough, Cork, for use as a sorting office is in progress.  Additional sorting office accommodation in Dublin is planned.  The installation of a ventilation system in the Central Sorting Office, Sheriff Street and of a sprinkler system at St. John's Road depot have been completed.</P>
    <P>In addition to the schemes covered by this Estimate the Office of Public Works will carry out works in connection with the telephone services at an estimated cost of £4 million which will be met from the telephone capital account.</P>
    <P>An amount of £189,500 is provided for works for embassy buildings abroad.  Fitting-out has been completed at the residence for the EEC mission in Brussels, the combined residence and chancery in Moscow&mdash; including the furnishing of staff accommodation&mdash;and the chancery in Vienna.  The fitting out of the new residence in Lisbon, the chancery at Berne and the embassies at Cairo, Jeddah and Teheran is in progress.</P>
    <P>Improvements have been completed at the Paris embassy and are in progress at the London embassy and at the consulate general in New York. Improvements are being planned for the residences in Bonn and Ottawa. The erection of a new chancery and residence in Canberra is being planned.</P>
    <P>A site has been acquired at Dún <Col N="1730" /> Laoghaire for a new employment exchange and planning of the proposed new building is in hands.  I am glad to be able to say that progress is being made with the programme whereby the State will design and erect its own office buildings.  Construction work is now in progress on stage 1 of a new Garda Síochána headquarters at the Depot, Phoenix Park, on a Meteorological Office headquarters at Glasnevin and on two other office buildings, one in Shelbourne Road and the other at Earlsfort Terrace.  It is hoped to be able to invite tenders this year for a new building at Beggars Bush to house the Geological Survey and the Labour Court, and for the reconstruction of blocks 8-10 in the Upper Yard at Dublin Castle.</P>
    <P>It is also hoped to invite tenders in the current year for new Government offices at Cork, Waterford, Mullingar, Portlaoise, Thurles and Kilkenny. Planning of a number of other projects is proceeding well including headquarters for the Department of Defence, a headquarters for the Dublin Metropolitan Garda, an office development on the former St. Vincent's Hospital property at the rere of 93-99 Lower Lesson Street, the rehabilitation of nos. 14-16 Upper Merrion Street, and stage II of the Garda Headquarters at the Garda Depot.</P>
    <P>In all these developments the Office of Public Works are fully conscious of their obligations to preserve our architectural heritage through conservation and preservation of buildings of architectural or historical merit with which they are concerned. The greatest possible care is taken in relation to any such buildings which might be affected by development proposals and the policy is being continued of calling upon outside expertise as well as upon the expert knowledge available within the office.</P>
    <P>There is provision in respect of the fitting-out of premises, mainly rented office blocks, for occupation by various Departments.  This covers the erection of partitions, supply of furniture, light fittings and so on.  The scheme for the adaptation for concert <Col N="1731" /> hall purposes of part of the UCD premises at Earlsfort Terrace is almost ready and it is hoped to invite tenders within a couple of months.  If all goes well it should be possible to start work on the site at the end of this year. The work will take about two years to complete, dependent of course on the availability of the Great Hall and the other areas required.</P>
    <P>Planning is well advanced for the next stage of the restoration of the Royal Hospital.  As I mentioned last year this is a large and complex project involving careful restoration. Planning is a slow and painstaking exercise calling for a good deal of research.  While it is difficult in the circumstances to say precisely when the planning will be completed it is hoped to be in a position to invite tenders towards the end of the year. The work of restoration will extend over a period of years.</P>
    <P>Subhead F1 provides for the normal maintenance of State-owned property, which includes such varied items as Government offices, garda stations, post offices, agricultural institutions, embassies abroad and State harbours. The subhead covers also the management and maintenance of parks under the control of the Commissioners of Public Works.  Broadly speaking, the commissioners are required to manage these parks as public parks for the general purpose of the recreation and enjoyment of the public.  In the special case of national parks there is the paramount obligation to conserve the natural resources of the parks which in fact is the primary purpose of creating such parks.</P>
    <P>I should like to take this opportunity to refer again to a question which has been raised with me by a number of organisations in recent years.  This is the subject of camping in national parks.  I can understand readily why national parks would appeal to campers and caravanners alike, and I am aware that in certain countries, where national parks are very large, camping has been allowed in specific areas laid out for that purpose.  I am aware also however, that this practice has in recent years raised serious <Col N="1732" /> problems for the park services concerned. Experience has shown that these camping sites become so popular that there is an ever-increasing demand for expansion of the sites, leading to the gradual erosion and degradation of the natural resources of the parks.</P>
    <P>Originally only the simplest camping facilities were sought and provided but with the passage of time and the enactment of legislation to control such sites it became necessary to provide more sophisticated facilities such as roads, fences, water supplies, electricity and sewage hookups, restaurants, washrooms, lavatories, large reception and entertainment centres, control and supervision buildings and so on.  Such camp grounds are essentially urban in character and devoid of natural atmosphere and have in some instances been referred to as &ldquo;camping slums&rdquo;.  They also eventually create the necessity for night supervision and arrangements for the arrest and detention of offenders.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, the presence of overnight visitors in national parks poses a serious threat to wildlife.  At Killarney we have during the years had problems with deer poachers and while we now have an effective wardening system in operation we would make the wardens' job a lot more difficult if we were to permit camping or other overnight stays in the park.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that a special case can be made for scouts and other youth groups.  This I do not accept.  In the first place the commissioners would be required to decide what youth groups should and what groups should not be allowed to avail of the camp grounds.  This would be an unenviable if not impossible task.  In the second place if scouts and other organised youth groups were allowed to camp why should individual family groups, whose only chance of a holiday may be a camping holiday, be refused permission?</P>
    <P>In any event, judging by the number of applications which are received each year from scouting and other youth organisations it would be necessary to set aside an extensive area of the park to cope with the demand.  It is my firm opinion that camping and caravan sites <Col N="1733" /> would be best located outside our national parks and managed by private enterprise.  I am satisfied, therefore, that the decision not to allow camping in national parks is the right one and must stand.</P>
    <P>This subhead covers also the cost of maintaining the Shannon Navigation. As I said earlier, the popularity of the River Shannon for pleasure cruising continues to grow and all the indications are that this trend will continue in the years ahead.  This calls for a slightly increased rate of expenditure on maintenance as well as on additional facilities, but this is money well spent.  For the effective management of the Shannon navigation new bye-laws relevant to the present usage are essential but to enable such bye-laws to be made revised legislation will be required. I am hopeful that I will have a Bill ready for introduction before the end of the year.</P>
    <P>Subhead F2 provides for the supply of replacement furniture and of additional items required for existing State buildings.  Subhead F3, which provides for rents, will require a substantially increased provision over the 1976 figure.  This is accounted for partly by leases coming due for review and partly by the leasing of new premises to relieve overcrowding and to replace old premises which had become unsuitable.</P>
    <P>Subhead F4 bears the cost of fuel and light for all Government offices. The continuing increases in the cost of all fuel and the amount of additional accommodation requiring heat and light account for the increase in the provision necessary under this subhead.</P>
    <P>Subhead F5 provides for the cost of compensation and so on arising from damage to the property of external governments.  The provision of £10,000 is required to meet the balance of the expenditure incurred on the reconstruction of the former British embassy premises at Merrion Square.</P>
    <P>Subhead F6 is a new subhead which is required to meet expenditure by the Commissioners of Public Works on repairs to Waterford courthouse.  The Minister for Justice, acting under section <Col N="1734" /> 6 of the Courthouses (Provision and Maintenance) Act, 1935 directed the commissioners to put the accommodation at this courthouse into proper order.  An estimate of the cost of the work has not yet been made but it is hoped that it will be possible to have work commenced by the end of the year.  The costs and expenses incurred by the commissioners on the work are, under the Act referred to, recoverable from the local authorities.</P>
    <P>The G subheads provide for expenditure in connection with the arterial drainage programme which is being carried out under the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945.  Subhead G1 provides for the carrying out of certain hydrometric studies and of comprehensive drainage surveys which are a necessary preliminary to arterial drainage schemes.  For this, £91,000 is requested; last year's provision was £79,000.  As in the case of previous years, most of the provision is needed to continue hydrometric investigations.  The amount included for catchment surveys is £10,500.</P>
    <P>It was hoped last year to do cost-benefit studies on the Bonet and Boyle catchments but much had to be done and these studies did not get under way.  I now hope that they will be carried out this year.  The report on the Maigue study is at present being printed for publication.</P>
    <P>Subhead G2 provides for expenditure on drainage schemes in progress. The sum of £3,325,000 is being made available for 1977, that is, £3,125,000 in the Estimate and the additional allocation of £200,000.  This amount which is an increase of over £100,000, or about 45 per cent, on last year's provision, will enable operations on the Boyne and Maigue schemes to be accelerated.  It is hoped that the Corrib-Mask-Robe scheme can be commenced later in this year.</P>
    <P>Work has been in progress for more than 30 years on arterial drainage schemes carried out under the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945, and perhaps the time has come to review our policies and programmes in the light of what has been achieved in the meantime. As this House is aware, current programmes are based on settled priorities accorded to about 60 of the most important <Col N="1735" /> catchments in the country and this has facilitated orderly planning up to now.  We must, however, ask ourselves from time to time whether longestablished policies and priorities continue to be the best ones to pursue in the light of ever changing circumstances. For example, there are several hundred smaller catchments which are not included in any priority list and for which the prospects of the benefits of arterial drainage are remote so long as present policies are pursued.  I am not satisfied that the criteria of size should determine that such cases should continue to be excluded indefinitely from consideration.  While continuing, therefore, for the present to direct our main effort to the catchments in the established priority lists I have arranged for a review of policy to ascertain if it would be appropriate to broaden our present programme so that some of the smaller catchments could be included in the future.</P>
    <P>A total of £1,163,000, an increase of £134,000 over last year will be required under subhead G3 which provides for the maintenance of completed drainage schemes and embankment works.  The increase in expenditure under this heading is attributable to increased wages and other costs.  As statutorily provided, the cost of maintenance is recoverable from the county councils concerned.</P>
    <P>Last year's provision of £1,000 for the acquisition of lands under the District of Fergus Drainage Act, 1943, is being repeated.  A total of £917,000 is required for subhead H for the purchase and maintenance of engineering plant and machinery, mainly for arterial drainage work, the purchase of stores and the payment of wages to the staff of the central engineering workshop.</P>
    <P>Subhead I bears the cost of the construction and maintenance of coast protection schemes.  Coast erosion is a problem which is constantly being raised with me and I am very concerned that the Office of Public Works should be in a position to investigate and reach decisions on all cases submitted to them at a much faster rate than at present.  As we know, <Col N="1736" /> property affected by coast erosion is not just being damaged but is being irrevocably destroyed.  I have, therefore, arranged that all aspects of the service will be reviewed with a view to accelerating the pace of operations.</P>
    <P>In this connection I must mention too the contribution which the removal of sand and gravel from the seashore is making to the problem. This practice has developed from what was, some years ago, the removal by local farmers for their own use of moderate quantities of sand and gravel in cart loads, to the current large scale exploitation of these deposits by the use of tractors and trailers.  There is much evidence to show that such deposits removed from one location are being replenished almost entirely at the expense of material which is being eroded from somewhere else along the coast.  It is futile to be preparing plans for works to deal with the problem of coast erosion as long as the removal of large quantities of beach material&mdash; a contributory if not the sole cause&mdash; would continue to be permitted.</P>
    <P>The provision in this year's subhead includes £26,000 for maintenance on coast protection schemes and the balance is required for a new scheme which has been sanctioned for Enniscrone, County Sligo.  In this connection I would like to pay a tribute to the Sligo County Council who decided to provide their contribution to the cost of the scheme out of the rates to enable an early start to be made on the work.</P>
    <P>The amount of £754,000 is being provided for the national monuments service under subhead J1, to maintain the present levels of conservation activity and of archaeological research.</P>
    <P>It is proposed to start major conservation works this year at Ferns Castle, County Wexford, Gallarus Castle, County Kerry, Gleninagh Castle, County Clare, and at the ancient monastic settlement on Skellig Michael, County Kerry.  Major works of conservation are continuing at, <i>inter alia</i>, the Casino in Marino, Dublin, Lusk Church tower, County Dublin, Ross Castle, County Kerry, Charles Fort and James Fort near Kinsale, County Cork, at the Boyne <Col N="1737" /> Valley sites at Newgrange and Knowth, and at the early Christian monastery at Inishmurray Island, County Sligo.</P>
    <P>Grants for archaeological research will be made again this year, enabling the investigation of the major site at Knowth to continue as well as the archaeological excavation of the early monastic settlement on Inishcealtra Island, County Clare.</P>
    <P>I have been devoting some attention to the question of amending the legislation relating to monuments.  The principal statute at present is the National Monuments Act, 1930.  Some amendments were made in 1954 but it became quite evident that it was time that we undertook a comprehensive review to see what changes were required to bring the legislation up to date.</P>
    <P>I would like to stress that the existing legislation has been reasonably satisfactory but changes in land use and development, agricultural methods and so on, have increased the risks to our monuments and we have to devise new measures to protect them.  It is also important, as I stated last year, to stop unauthorised interference with historic wrecks in our territorial waters. I am glad to say that good progress is being made with the preparation of proposals for revised legislation.  All going well I will have a Bill ready for introduction in the House later this year or early in 1978.</P>
    <P>The total cost of the conservation and restoration of Holycross Abbey is borne initially by the grant-in-aid provided by the special subhead J2.  The cost of the restoration is being refunded by the diocesan authorities. While the main works have been completed and the building reopened for public use for some time now, there are still some minor jobs outstanding but I expect that these will be completed in a month or so.</P>
    <P>In addition to the works covered by this Vote, the Office of Public Works are also responsible for work on primary schools, telephone exchanges, prison buildings and the construction and improvement of harbour works for the Department of Fisheries and for Roinn na Gaeltachta.  This means that this year the total gross expenditure <Col N="1738" /> for which the office will be responsible will be well over £50 million.</P>
    <P>In my statement I have given an idea of the widespread and varied activities of the Office of Public Works.  If any Deputy would like further information on any matter which I have mentioned or on any matter which I have omitted to mention and in which the Deputy has a particular interest, I shall try to give it to him in my reply.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Estimate as one which covers a very large range of country.  I also welcome the fact that on three different items the Parliamentary Secretary mentioned that he is proposing new legislation to bring matters up to date.  If the Estimate were to be carried as it stands very substantial progress would be made on many aspects of the national scene. However, I must point out that the sum provided here, £25,868,000, is below the sum provided in last year's Estimate, that is, £26,088,000.  Admittedly, the Parliamentary Secretary has promised Supplementary Estimates and I do not doubt his intentions in the matter but it must be pointed out that inflation will eat so much into the money provided that many of the worthy projects mentioned in the Estimate will not be carried out, not through any lack of goodwill in the Department but because of inflation. I do not want to be churlish but the Parliamentary Secretary will have to press his Minister for more money to ensure that the Office of Public Works can make an effective contribution to the national scene.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary has given evidence of having studied a number of serious aspects and he has promised new legislation.  Even though I am a city man, I look upon the progress of our arterial drainage schemes as being very poor, not just since the Parliamentary Secretary took office.  We must remember that the Act under which we operate is now about 30 years old and I agree that it is time we looked at it.  I do not know what he will propose.  I have had queries from people in many different parts of the country about various river projects and when I have contacted the Office <Col N="1739" /> of Public Works I have been told with honesty that it will be many years, if ever, before these projects will be carried out.  I do not know if arterial drainage work has a high labour content. I know a great deal of machinery is used.  At a time of high unemployment, especially on the rural scene, we might well decide to break with tradition and intensify our efforts for arterial drainage realising the many benefits which would accrue if all the rivers which are in need of improvement were improved.  An amount of land would then become available for farming activities and the national landscape would be improved.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I welcome the Parliamentary Secretary's decision to review the legislation on arterial drainage and coast erosion.  We have a very serious coast erosion problem.  This is happening in remote parts of the coastline but it is also happening a few miles from this House, in north county Dublin.  I read the legislation governing the prevention of coast erosion and the system is very unwieldly.  It could be refined and made much more effective.  Coast erosion is a very serious problem and, if not checked, will become more serious each year.  This might provide a good avenue for employment apart from improvements in the areas affected.  I wish the Parliamentary Secretary the best of luck in his efforts to have new legislation introduced on arterial drainage and coast erosion.</P>
    <P>He mentioned a change of thinking on monuments.  I welcome this.  I hope he will try to ensure that monuments will not be taken from the countryside and exported in some cases.  We will have to take a much tougher line on the preservation of monuments and their retention here.  The second aspect may not be within the Parliamentary Secretary's bailiwick.  If not, I sugest he might interest himself in ensuring that monuments and relics of the past are retained.  In the past we had losses of many fine and valuable monuments.  We are now in a position to stop these exports and I trust the Parliamentary Secretary will be active in this matter.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1740" /> I learned from his speech that the commissioners have not got the right of compulsory acquisition, unlike a local authority or a harbour authority. The commissioners might join with the local authorities and let them use their powers of acquisition.  The work of the commissioners need land they should be able to join with the local authorities to acquire it.  I am glad to note that they have been successful in acquiring land by agreement.  This is the best way of doing it.  Sometimes there can be long delays with the result that we may become disheartened by the magnitude of the task of acquiring land.</P>
    <P>I welcome the decision to create many public parks.  I am particularly delighted to see action is being taken at the Burren in Clare.  This is a marvelous natural formation and is one of the wonders of the country.  I do not know if it is sufficiently appreciated by our own people, but it is appreciated by foreigners.  The work which is to be undertaken to make it more accessible is to be welcomed.  We on this side of the House would not be tardy in supporting the provision of money for this area.</P>
    <P>I notice there is a big building project for the civil service and for various Government Departments.  I welcome this.  I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to answer an allegation made in a newspaper some time ago that there has been a change in the system or the policy of renting offices and that, in one case, rent was paid two years in advance.  This story was brought to my notice.  I had not read about it.  I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to say if there has been any change in the commissioners' policy on paying rent for buildings.</P>
    <P>There have been some improvements in Leinster House.  The facilities available to the public to see their Deputies or Senators are not all that could be desired.  This is the national Parliament. People come here to see their Deputies or to protest.  While a poor view may be taken in official headquarters of protests outside our gates, I do not subscribe to that line of thinking. <Col N="1741" /> I think it is a sure sign that democracy will survive when I see people protesting outside the gates of the national Assembly.  I do not suggest we should encourage protests, but we should encourage people to come here and discuss their problems with their Deputies and Senators.</P>
    <P>I do not regard the interview room as being suitable.  At times it is fairly crowded.  There is not a great degree of privacy if one wants to discuss a problem with a visitor.  We should have an interview room worthy of this Parliament. The right of the citizen to see his Deputy should be safeguarded. While I appreciate that space in the House is rather limited, we should ensure that citizens who wish to come here to speak to their Deputies are given the best possible facilities.  The Parliamentary Secretary might study this point and provide a proper interview room where we would have not merely a few tables and chairs but where we would have facilities for ensuring that a citizen will be given the best attention and where the Deputy will be in a position to help that person.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that many new Government offices are being established throughout the country.  I wish to refer to Castlebar which I visited some time ago and I should like to pay tribute to the then Minister who proposed the decentralisation of Government offices. I hope this policy will be pursued to the utmost and that we will not have so many office blocks in Dublin.  I see from the Estimate that there is a proposal to build more office blocks at Beggars Bush in Dublin.  This was to have been the site of the Memorial Hall to the late President Kennedy but that project was not pursued.  In the last few years the commissioners, in co-operation with the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, erected a telephone exchange at Shelbourne Road on part of the old barrack site.  It was necessary for them to open a new road to the residential part of the barracks &mdash;when I say residential I refer to the flats there that are leased by the commissioners to the Dublin Corporation. The flats were built by the British authorities when they were in occupation here many years ago.  I should <Col N="1742" /> like to draw the attention of the Parliamentary Secretary to the condition of the site at Beggars Bush.  A roadway was constructed to the flats but it is more of a goat path than anything else.  I would ask him to ensure that the commissioners examine this matter in order to carry out some improvements. At least they could plant a few trees or shrubs and provide a proper roadway to the residential area.</P>
    <P>A disappointing feature of the Estimate is the delay in providing a concert hall for Dublin.  The Parliamentary Secretary said that it might be possible to start work at the end of the year but this is conditional on the UCD authorities being able to make the Great Hall at Earlsfort Terrace available for this purpose.  It should be possible to ascertain from the authorities when they are going to move to Belfield. For as long as I can remember we have been promised a concert hall and we must be one of the few European capitals that have not got one. When it was proposed some years ago to provide the Kennedy Memorial Hall at the Beggars Bush site in Dublin one was more hopeful than confident that this would happen.  I wish to record my disappointment at the Government's action in dropping that project. Even though a decision has been made to provide a concert hall at Earlsfort Terrace it is far from becoming a reality and I suggest that this time next year we will still be waiting for a start to the Dublin concert hall.</P>
    <P>I realise there may be more pressing problems in the country today but after all the promises made during the last 50 years we should show that we are a practical people and provide a concert hall for this city.  In the city of Strasburg, which might be regarded as comparable in size with Dublin, there is a municipal concert hall and an orchestra.  We have not got even one proper concert hall and I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will ensure that agreement will be sought with the UCD authorities that they will move out as soon as possible and make the premises available for the builders to start work on the new hall.</P>
    <P>I note with satisfaction that provision has been made for more extensive facilities for the National Library. <Col N="1743" /> Knowing how the staff and the readers have had to cope during the years I am sure they will appreciate what is being done.  There is good news also with regard to the Botanic Gardens and this will be a great boon not only to the city but to the country. I appreciate the efforts of the people who have put so much work into this. The improvements to Dublin Castle are also welcomed.</P>
    <P>I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to tell us if the premises of the former British embassy which were burned some years ago have been fully restored.  I think the ESB own them and, for my own information, I should like to know the cost of repair and acquisition of that building.  In a way I am sorry it has been decided not to go ahead with the provision of a golf course at Phoenix Park but I should like to qualify that.  I did not support the project but the Parliamentary Secretary's predecessor, the late Noel Lemass, was very keen on this project and he worked hard to achieve it.  I realise it is not going ahead because the Dublin Corporation have some road plans for the area.  As one who is jealous of any encroachment on the Phoenix Park I should like to assure the Parliamentary Secretary that I will watch carefully the proposals of the Dublin Corporation with regard to this matter.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Parliamentary Secretary if he is satisfied that all possible precautions are taken to ensure the safety of deer in the Phoenix Park.  There have been reports of people poaching the deer and injuring them and I suggest that he investigates this matter.  A constant problem for any visitor to the park is where he may park his car.  The park rangers are vigilant, and rightly so, but often it is difficult to find parking space.  People run their cars onto the grass and this is not desirable.  During the summer the rangers cannot cope with this problem. The grass is damaged by this parking and there is also the problem that children cannot play in safety in those areas.</P>
    <P>Last year we were promised improvements in the provision of toilets in the <Col N="1744" /> park but they have not yet been built. Many improvements can be made in this great park and it will be money well spent especially if we can provide and improve facilities there for thousands of visitors.  I would give this work top priority.  It must be remembered that in a few years' time more than one million people will be living in this city and we will have to provide recreational facilities for them.  We must make sure that the city is not turned into a concrete or asphalt jungle.  That is why we must jealously look after this park.</P>
    <P>St. Stephen's Green is the only park which is the responsibility of the commissioners. I am not criticising the way that park is looked after because it is very well kept, but it might be more businesslike if the local authorities accepted responsibility for it.</P>
    <P>The sum of £91,000 which has been allocated for the development of the River Shannon is to be welcomed.  This river is very popular for cruises and attracts many visitors.  When will the commissioners take over ownership of the Royal and Grand Canals which are owned by CIE at the moment?  That company hope they will soon be transferred to the commissioners, as has been promised.  What has caused the delay of this transfer of ownership? Our waterways stretch into the north.  I appreciate what is being done on the Lough Allen stretch.  The work there is nearing completion and the commissioners are to be complimented on this.  As our population grows, we will need all our natural facilities&mdash;parklands and waterways&mdash;and it is essential that we maintain our waterways at the highest standards.  From his statement I am satisfied that the Parliamentary Secretary is aware of these points.  If I were confident that the money is there to provide these facilities, I would be very pleased indeed.</P>
    <P>The building activities of the commissioners are many and varied&mdash;from primary schools to jails.  Some time ago it was proposed to establish a new women's jail in the north suburbs of Dublin.  Can the Parliamentary Secretary give us some idea if this work is going ahead?  Have his Department received a directive from the Department <Col N="1745" /> of justice about this work? Nowadays we hear a great deal of criticism about conditions in our jails. Of course, one does not necessarily accept this criticism as true.  If it was thought necessary to provide a new detention house for women prisoners a few years ago, it is more essential to go ahead with this work now.</P>
    <P>Are the new offices in Castlebar fully occupied?  How far are the commissioners co-operating with other bodies in the prevention of pollution of lakes and rivers?  If we drained all our rivers and canals, this work would come to naught if it were to be destroyed by pollution.  The commissioners have a big part to play in this national problem. Unless we solve it we will have to pay very dearly in many ways, through bad health and the destruction of the countryside.  We should learn from the mistakes made in Europe.</P>
    <P>The provision of £189,000 for work in our embassies is also to be welcomed. We should provide the best for our representatives and civil servants who work in these embassies, which can be an advertisement for Ireland.  I realise that we cannot keep up with continental Joneses by having palatial residences, and we would not want to, but we must ensure that our embassies maintain a good standard and play their part in promoting our interests abroad.</P>
    <P>The restoration of the Royal Hospital is continuing.  This is very difficult work which will take many years before being completed.  When it is completed to what use will it be put? I hope it will be accessible to the public. It was in a very bad state and a great deal of very valuable restoration work has been done.  Could the Parliamentary Secretary give me an approximate date when the restoration work will be completed and to what use the building will be put?</P>
    <P>The creation of national parks is to be welcomed.  The Parliamentary Secretary is against allowing camping there.  I can see his point to a certain extent, but he might make an exception for scouting organisations.  I appreciate his concern for the safety of wildlife in these parks, but scouting <Col N="1746" /> organisations are trained to respect and protect wildlife.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary might well reconsider this matter with regard to scouting organisations.  The Parliamentary Secretary makes the point that family groups, whose only opportunity of a holiday may be a camping one, should not be debarred. I know the line must be drawn somewhere. Indeed local authorities might welcome such activity and provide proper camping sites for family groups.  Private enterprise also can play its part here since as, in many parts of the country, it provides the only source of camping sites.  There is the feeling that camping holidays will become more popular.  Therefore local authorities, urged by the commissioners, might provide more sites. But I would make a plea for scouting organisations to be given some concessions in national parks.  They are disiplined bodies of young people who would not abuse the privilege afforded them.  Indeed I am sure the scouting organisations would be pleased to be given an opportunity of meeting the Parliamentary Secretary and the commissioners to discuss this matter.</P>
    <P>I know that the commissioners have a certain anxiety to discuss with local authorities the problem of coast erosion.  Perhaps the commissioners, through the Parliamentary Secretary, would so notify the local authorities. Many local authorities fear that they will have to pay too much for such schemes.  The system of payment is rather unique, but it would be money well spent if agreement was reached in as many cases as possible that the rating authority would provide the money, as did Sligo County Council in the case of Enniscrone, so that work may be speeded up because coast erosion waits for nobody and the damage is continuous.  Therefore there is a certain degree of urgency about this matter.  Generally local authorities are anxious to help but are somewhat afraid of being caught up in too much expenditure.  They say they may have to account to their ratepayers and while the individual ratepayers may agree it is necessary, at the same time as a body they may <Col N="1747" /> tend to feel it is excessive.  Of course as soon as there is a change of Government the Fianna Fáil Government will be removing the rates from ordinary householders and the financing of such schemes may be considered in that light.</P>
    <P>I notice also that the Dundalk customs centre has been redesigned, which must mean a vast improvement there.  I have often wondered if this should be a matter for the commissioners. I feel we should concentrate more on the provision of, say, schools and Garda barracks&mdash;certainly many of the barracks throughout the country are in an appalling state.  Customs centres, which may well disappear in some years' time as we become more integrated with Europe, may not warrant such expenditure. Therefore, I would not place too much emphasis on them at present.</P>
    <P>I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will pursue the matter of the full restoration of Scoil Éanna and the general lands there in Rathfarnham, both in memory of Pearse, who may be somewhat maligned at present, thereby showing our commitment to the continuation of the policy of previous Governments.  The work done so far is much appreciated, but it seems to be somewhat drawn out. I would suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that the job be finished with as much speed as possible.</P>
    <P>The Kilkenny Castle project, which has proved such a success, is attributable to the commissioners, their foresight and dedication.  It attracted 15,000 visitors since its opening last year, and no doubt will attract many more.  This illustrates how wise are the commissioners in undertaking such projects.  I hope they will take on many more.</P>
    <P>On the continent I know some government departments will restore an old church and spend national finances on its restoration.  We have done a little here with places such as Holy Cross Abbey and so on and on which the commissioners are to be complimented.  However I have in mind some cathedrals in this city that have had to appeal for voluntary <Col N="1748" /> funds to undertake such restoration work.  We must ensure that many of these old, historic churches do not fall into disuse and are not converted into factories or warehouses.  Again, in this city we have seen the most appalling things happen to some churches.  Perhaps they may not be architectural gems, but the fact that they were built when they were and are no longer used by the religious denomination which formerly used them is no reason for their not being retained or preserved as community halls or for some other such cultural activity.  It is indeed sad to pass by these churches and see gaudy posters advertising goods outside.  Generally they have come to be used as warehouses. The commissioners might well be empowered, with the help of local authorities, to ensure that such churches or other places of an historic value are not turned into factories, warehouses or petrol filling stations. Such does not enhance the beauty of any city or town.  There is a church not far from here, in Pearse Street, which because of a dwindling congregation has had to be disposed of.  However I am glad to note that Trinity College have purchased it and use it now for educational purposes, which is indeed gratifying.  Where at all possible the commissioners, with the help of the relevant local authorities, should ensure that such ecclesiastical and other buildings are preserved.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer once more to the Phoenix Park.  There are a number of horse riding schools in the vicinity whose trainees use the park daily but who are not restricted to any particular tracks.  At the same time, young children with their parents use the park for leisure and the children play on the grass.  The unrestricted use of the park for horse riding therefore presents a source of danger not only to the thousands of children playing there but to the horses and riders, and I suggest that a certain area be allotted for horse riding.</P>
    <P>On the matter of public parks in general, I hope that progress is being made to provide national recreation areas throughout the country.  It is a plan that deserves priority treatment <Col N="1749" /> because not only would it provide places of recreation for our people but it would help to beautify the country.</P>
    <P>I am sorry to note the size of this year's Estimate.  The Office of Public Works should be a great development, educational and humanitarian organisation and in these times of inflation it is difficult to understand why there should have been a cutback instead of an improvement in the sum allocated.  The Office of Public Works have it within their scope to improve the facilities in the Garda stations and prisons. In both areas it is necessary for us to show our goodwill and our concern for improvement.  While on this subject, I hope I will not be regarded as parochial if I refer to the Garda station at Irishtown in Dublin.  The old station is more than 150 years old and there are no facilities there for private conversations. Therefore it is an embarrassment not only for the general public but for Deputies who may wish to call there on behalf of constituents on such private matters as family rows and so on.  In general, I suggest there should not be any cutback on the programme for Garda station extensions.</P>
    <P>I have spoken on many occasions about the necessity to provide ramps for paraplegics' wheelchairs at all public buildings.  I am not convinced we are doing enough in this matter and I will go so far as to suggest that there should be a public buildings bye-law to provide such ramps for handicapped people.  Indeed I would go further and say that as our society becomes more affluent many handicapped people will be able to afford special automobiles and in such circumstances I suggest that we should provide public parks specially reserved for invalid cars.  As well, I ask the Parliamentary Secretary to use his influence with sporting organisations to improve sportsgrounds to ensure that facilities will be provided so that handicapped people will be able to attend sports meetings in comfort.</P>
    <P>I should like to congratulate the Parliamentary Secretary on his contribution. I purposely held back from trying <Col N="1750" /> to find fault with it.  There are some faults and one which worries me is the fact that the money provided is insufficient.  I do not expect that the work scheduled will be carried out because there is not sufficient money available.  If the Parliamentary Secretary when he introduces Supplementary Estimates assures me that the money will be forthcoming I will have greater confidence in him than I have at present. I want the Parliamentary Secretary to impress on the Minister for Finance that the opinion of one Deputy is that sufficient money has not been provided.  I want the Minister to ensure that the money is provided so that the excellent programme outlined by the Parliamentary Secretary will be carried out.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to congratulate the Parliamentary Secretary on the way he presented this Estimate and for the efforts he has made to satisfy all sections of the community since he took up this post.  Of the amount provided, more than £25 million and the £2 million to improve job prospects, it is not fair to allocate only £3,325,000 for drainage works.  Deputy Moore is concerned about a different aspect of the work of the Office of Public Works than I.  We all appreciate that the Office of Public Works is responsible for the upkeep of prisons, Garda stations, schools and so on but traditionally we associate that office with arterial drainage schemes, minor and major.  The Parliamentary Secretary stated:</P>
      <P>While continuing, therefore, for the present to direct our main effort to the catchments in the established priority lists I have arranged for a review of policy to ascertain if it would be appropriate to broaden our present programme so that some of the smaller catchments could be included in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not my intention to make political capital out of this or to refer to what was done in the past, but I thought minor schemes were included in a priority list with major schemes.  I believe a decision was taken about seven years ago to discontinue the list of minor catchment areas and proceed with the major schemes.  For that <Col N="1751" /> reason I was pleased to hear the Parliamentary Secretary say that a review of policy will take place.  The big problem is that there is not sufficient money.</P>
    <P>I note that it is hoped to commence the drainage scheme in Mayo which is now part of my constituency.  I hope work gets under way on that scheme soon.  The scheme on the River Nanny has been held up because of the water scheme in Tuam.  The latter scheme will soon be in progress and money will then be sought to complete the river drainage scheme.  I was under the impression that the scheme on the River Nanny was part of the original Corrib scheme and that money would be provided automatically for it, when work was about to commence.  However, following an investigation, I have learned that it must take its place on the list with other minor drainage schemes.  I want the Parliamentary Secretary to tell me if it is necessary for this scheme to take its place in competition with other minor drainage schemes or if money will be provided for it, because it was held up by the water scheme in Tuam.</P>
    <P>I should now like to deal with the Dunkellin River which flows into the sea at Clarenbridge.  Many politicians have expressed an interest in a drainage scheme for that river.  A Newcastle man tells the story that prior to every general election an engineer or a representative of the Office of Public Works surveys that area prompting the curious farmers to make inquiries.  The impression is always created that work is soon to start on that scheme but as soon as the election is over nothing more is heard about the Dunkellin River.</P>

      <P>I do not want the Parliamentary Secretary to send out any engineers because for too long people in that area have been conned. Some months ago I received a letter <Col N="1752" /> from the Parliamentary Secretary to the effect that the Dunkellin drainage scheme had now been reached on the list.  I welcome the fact that it has been reached but, looking through the Estimate, I find there is not even one word about it or, if there is, then I missed it.</P>
      <P>As I say, in the letter I got from the Parliamentary Secretary it was stated it is now being reached on the list but there were quite a few &ldquo;ifs&rdquo;&mdash;if money were available and if a cost/ benefit analysis had been done and so on and so forth.  If money is available, the job will be done.  I do not go along with that at all.  If the Dunkellin has been reached then I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to see that the work is carried out.  It is the Parliamentary Secretary who should decide about this.  The Commissioners of Public Works are no help at all, particularly as far as the west is concerned and Dunkellin.  In the last 12 years I have spoken a great deal about this and so have other public representatives from the west.  If for all the words spoken the same number of rocks had been removed from the river a great deal of work would have been done by this.  I urge the Parliamentary Secretary to get work started on the Dunkellin as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There would be no point in sending out someone to carry out a survey because that would make the whole thing a laughing stock.  Prior to every general election over the years a promise has been given but that promise has never been fulfilled. There must be a firm commitment to do the work.  I cannot understand why there is not a greater commitment where land drainage is concerned.  There are all sorts of arguments advanced.  One group wants a bird sanctuary preserved. Another group says that the fertiliser put on the land will be washed too quickly into the river. They talk about leaching.  They say that if the river drains into a lake fish life will be destroyed.  I do not want to see wildlife destroyed but one must get one's priorities right.  Flooded lands must be drained.  The money paid out in social welfare should be used to put people into employment draining <Col N="1753" /> land.  The money should be invested in productive purposes, such as the drainage of the Dunkellin, the Nanny and the Schule, and the Island river. The Dunkellin is the biggest river. Why should not social welfare benefits be directed towards productive purposes like drainage?</P>
    <P>Someone once said that it costs more to create a job than the job is actually worth.  That was stated in this House.  There is an election coming up in June and we in the west want a genuine effort made now to get these rivers drained, particularly the Dunkellin.  I do not want the Commissioners of Public Works or anyone else to stand in the way of the Parliamentary Secretary getting the Dunkellin drained.  I make that very clear.</P>
    <P>I have been in contact for years with a number of people who live along the River Shellin.  A scheme for the drainage of that river was costed with a view to getting grants from the Department of Agriculture to carry out the drainage.  On the first occasion application was made it was turned down on the ground that very little good land would be involved and the expenditure of money on such a scheme would not be justified.  The local people said that was wrong and another survey was carried out.  As a result of that and a cost/benefit analysis it was decided that the river should be done.  A big local contribution was involved.  There are several bridges and these would be the responsibility of the local authority. This would be a very suitable scheme and all the Parliamentary Secretary need do to inform himself fully about the scheme is to ask the Department of Agriculture for the data.  The Parliamentary Secretary might then direct the commissioners to have another look at the scheme.</P>
    <P>There is the Island river then at Ballymote.  It flows between Galway and Roscommon but the major part is in Galway.  That river causes a great deal of flooding.  This is another minor drainage scheme at which the Office of Public Works should take a look. As I say, it is a minor scheme, not a major drainage scheme like the Dunkellin. <Col N="1754" /> I know various excuses can be made as to why this drainage work cannot be carried out but I can see no reason why it should not be done. There is no great problem involved.</P>
    <P>Arterial drainage is the main thing that the people I represent want done, and there is no point in wasting time speaking on all the other matters dealt with here.  When there is only about one page here devoted to arterial drainage, and the expenditure of a sum of only £3,325,000 out of a total of £25 million, our priorities are all wrong.  While I appreciate that it is necessary to have national parks and other amenities, the basics must be catered for.  I understand the opinions expressed by Deputy Moore, who represents a different constituency from the one I represent.  However, when other Deputies from his side of the House speak on this Estimate it will be evident from our point of view that enough money is not being spent. Agriculture is a real money spinner for this country.  The economy is sound as long as agriculture is going well.  It can be made even better by the expenditure of relatively small sums on these drainage schemes I have mentioned.  I have dealt with the matter on a parochial basis but I am sure other Deputies could refer to similar schemes in their areas.  If the Board of Works would pay some attention to what I have said not alone would it enrich the community where I live but it would be good for the country as a whole.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>This Estimate is always regarded as a very important one.  Those of us who have at some time or other been attached to the Office of Public Works must always be interested in what is happening at 51 St. Stephen's Green.  In common with other speakers, I would like to compliment the Office of Public Works on what they have done, the quality rather than the quantity.  If the quantity is not something we can boast about, it is not the fault of the limited personnel available in the Office of Public Works. Those of us who have experience at close hand of the work of the technicians, the professional staff of the Board of Works, can only have the <Col N="1755" /> highest praise for it.  It is a pity they have not more money and more staff to do more work.</P>
      <P>That is the extraordinary thing about this Estimate.  This is the Estimate which reflects the seriousness or otherwise of a Government's determination to carry out capital works and to provide employment at a time when it is desperately needed.  These days one can hardly turn on a television set or a radio without hearing about thousands of new jobs that are going to happen some time, somewhere, by some means.  There is no explanation.  Of course everybody knows what the talk is about, but when we get down to the discussion of the agency which has the responsibility for really doing work, we find an Estimate of £25,868,000, to which £2 million has been added in the budget, making a total of £27,868,000.  From that must be deducted administrative costs in the vicinity of £4,500,000, and when deductions are made in respect of subheads F1, F2 F3 and F4, which make provision for maintenance, rents and recurring payments which must be made annually, amounting to another £13 million almost, there is in page 25 of the Book of Estimates a mere £6 million for new works.</P>
      <P>That is what the Estimate is all about, a mere £6 million to which will be added whatever portion of the £2 million provided in the budget will be available for capital works when the deductions already mentioned are made under the various headings of administration, maintenance, rents, provision of materials and so forth. That is all that is available for new works in 1977 when there are 150,000 people seeking work.  Taking into account the inflationary situation, the sum provided is barely sufficient to keep the show on the road.  It is a desperate picture at a time when everybody is calling out for more work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The last speaker, Deputy Donnellan is quite right.  There are a few checks and balances here well worth studying. Against the huge, frightening figure for unemployment assistance, a sum of £6 million for new works in the Office of Public Works is provided.  Then one <Col N="1756" /> must ask oneself: are there no works available on which this money could be expended?  This is the irony of the whole situation.  Million and millions are being paid out in unemployment assistance.  Yet every Deputy could indicate, as the last Deputy did, hundreds of necessary works in his own constituency which are crying out for immediate attention. How does one balance all that against any talk or pretence about what is intended to be done to bring about some alleviation of unemployment and inflation from which the country is suffering at present.  This is the denouement of all this nonsensical talk that has suddenly been sprung on the people in the last few weeks for a specific purpose.</P>
    <P>In the Office of Public Works there is an agency charged with the responsibility of looking after capital works, the maintenance of existing Government fixed assets throughout the country and the carrying out of new works. If any Member of the House was free to speak publicly he would have to confess that their main frustration arises from the demands for their attention in thousands of areas where essential work is there to be done but for the carrying out of which they have not got either the personnel or the funds.  Yet we have 150,000 unemployed and we are paying millions per day for that unemployment.  The whole thing is farcical.  It does not add up to any logic.</P>
    <P>I keep away from parochial things as far as possible but in the general field of activity in the Office of Public Works I have to refer to some of the things that are crying out for attention immediately and seemingly not getting it due to the lack of resources.  Coastal erosion is being only toyed with.  The number of schemes in hand or even under consideration at present is negligible, and I am not blaming the Parliamentary Secretary for the cumbersome machinery that is necessary in the legislation except to say that in his wisdom he might have brought in an amendment now, seeing in retrospect that the legislation under which the protective work is carried out is so cumbersome.  There is <Col N="1757" /> shuttling back and forth between the Office of Public Works and the local authority so often and so many classifications are required at different levels that by the time the decision is taken to carry out the work the whole area could be eroded.  In a maritime county like Donegal facing the surge of the Atlantic we have many such problems, and for that reason I refer to that area which requires legislation of a type that will permit more expeditious handling of this serious coastal problem.</P>
    <P>In the matter of public buildings generally it is easy now to be wise with hindsight, but it is regrettable that we did not build more of our own buildings when it was possible to do so. When Fianna Fáil were in power the word &ldquo;squandermania&rdquo; was being widely bandied around at the proposal to pool resources for post-war development and the short-sightedness of people who felt that this would be unnecessary expenditure must now be regretted. Opposition was raised not merely in this House but outside also. Public opinion was not in support of the proposal at the time, but people who were far-sighted&mdash;like the late Deputy Seán Lemass who saw what was likely to come in the wake of the war&mdash;were well aware that the time to do things was then because it might never be possible again to do them. When the Department of Industry and Commerce building in Kildare Street was being constructed the records of this House report the most severe criticism of the &ldquo;squandermania&rdquo; of the Government of the day in erecting such an expensive, colossal building. These are the things which should enable us to look forward and learn from past mistakes.  That building was put up for a figure which would not glaze the windows now.</P>
    <P>We are paying colossal rents per square foot all over the city for office block accommodation.  I put down a question asking for a list of the premises we have rented and the amount we are paying.  I know it is a colossal figure without getting it at all.  When there was a proposal at one time to build a new House of Parliament it met with such opposition that it was not even given further serious consideration. <Col N="1758" /> We have a shortage of necessary public buildings in this city. We should have many buildings of a type in keeping with the quality of the city and they should have been built when it was possible to get the sites and to carry out the building before inflation developed.  This did not happen.</P>
    <P>There are proposals to move part of the National Library into another building.  That is not a suitable arrangement.  To have the National Library in two separate buildings does not make for efficiency and certainly does not bring the library to meeting the requirements which a National Library should meet.  I hope this is only a temporary arrangement and that in the not-too-distant future we shall see a building which is worthy of the National Library and of which the people can be justly proud, a building which is essential and long overdue.</P>
    <P>In the field of national monuments alone we have £6 million for new works.  We could spend £60 million on national monuments.  We see them crumbling and disappearing all over the country.  Many of them have not even a preservation order on them and in many cases where there is a preservation order it is not being observed. I have seen eighth-century cemeteries with cattle grazing over them.  When I write to the county council they say &ldquo;We have no responsibility&rdquo;.  When I contact the Office of Public Works, they say &ldquo;We have a preservation order.  The county council must look at that&rdquo;.  I contact the council again and they say &ldquo;We will look up to see if there is a preservation order&rdquo;.  This fiddling goes on while Rome burns.</P>
    <P>There is an outcry about Georgian buildings being demolished or used for other purposes while at the same time some of our most valuable historic monuments are being neglected.  We have our sense of values all wrong.  I am not for a moment denigrating those who advocate the preservation of good architecture anywhere, but we must get down to those things which are going to disappear, to the heritage which should be preserved and will soon not be in existence.  I appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary to <Col N="1759" /> contact his Minister and point out to him that of all the school-leavers now unemployed many are highly qualified, trained and intelligent people who could find, even in a temporary capacity, much useful work to do in the field of the preservation of our national monuments and things of environmental interest generally.  This would merely require the provision of money and some supervision by the qualified professional personnel in the Office of Public Works.  If the office has to recruit more in the architectural and engineering branches there are many suitable people around who can find no employment.  It is an opportunity to get young people employed.  There are many other things for which they could be usefully used, but the Parliamentary Secretary will have only to turn up the records of the Office of Public Works to find the huge list of monuments of historic interest throughout the country which are receiving no attention whatever.</P>
    <P>It is sad to look at the small number of monuments that have been restored. I took great pride in the restoration work that was carried out on old Mellifont Abbey.  The work is a credit to the Office of Public Works and it speaks eloquently for the craftsmanship and the skills that went into the preservation.  It is sad that so many other monuments, so many castles and so on throughout the country have not been restored.  Such restoration work would give ample employment for some of the highly skilled graduates who are at present unemployed.</P>
    <P>Deputy Seán Moore referred to the Royal Hospital at Kilmainham and said that it was a job that would take a long time.  When I was in the Office of Public Works 20 years ago I went down to admire the work that was being done in the restoration of this hospital.  I thought that it would have taken a year to complete it at that stage, but I suppose the money allocated was not sufficient to have the work completed.  I would like to know when the second phase which was referred to by the Parliamentary Secretary will be embarked upon.  It has been suggested that the hospital might <Col N="1760" /> be used as a folk museum when it is restored.  Various objects could be stored here which would express what the Irish people have witnessed and the evolution of history from the earliest times.  The field surrounding Kilmainham Hospital and the restored hospital itself would be a suitable environment for a folk museum.  I appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary to allocate extra money to it in the next financial year to get this work completed.  My colleague here could also keep this in mind when at some not-far-distant date he may be in a position to do something about monuments generally.  In relation to the national monument which I have referred to, the Royal Hospital in Kilmainham is a comparatively young monument.</P>
    <P>The Phoenix Park has always been referred to in these Estimates, particularly by the Dublin Deputies.  The Park does not belong just to the Dublin people, simply because there are few Dublin people left.  Those who come up from the country are gravely concerned about what happens to this city, and we do not want the Phoenix Park to become a camping ground.  It is a public park, and should be preserved as a public park.  The exercise of horses has been mentioned in relation to the Park.  In my time in the Office of Public Works certain areas could be used during certain times for horse riding, usually early in the morning.  I hope that horse riding is not permitted throughout the Park without constraint. There is divided opinion on the question of a municipal golf course.  A case can be made for a municipal golf course, but the Park is not a place for it.  The Phoenix Park is one of the most beautiful parks in the world and it should not be used as an area where all sorts of people can come at regular intervals to use it for camping or anything else.  It is quite different if it has to be used for such things on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis in some circumstances, but it should be an open public park.</P>
    <P>Several million pounds should be allocated to carry out absolutely essential work, which would employ people who are becoming degraded as a result of the continuous, no hope, period of unemployment they have experienced <Col N="1761" /> in recent times.  I have not touched on the question of drainage, the operation of 1945 Arterial Drainage Scheme and the dropping of what was referred to as the intermediate drainage scheme.  I have not touched on the question of general drainage standards.  I do not complain about the standards being too low; I feel that the standards are too high.</P>

    <Title>Developments in the European Communities&mdash;Fifth, Sixth, Seventh, Eight and Ninth Reports: Motion (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann takes note of the reports: Developments in the Communities&mdash;Fifth, Sixth, Seventh, Eighth and Ninth Reports.</P>
    <P Just="Right">&mdash;(Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiBrugha" hpid="Ruairí Brugha Ruairí Brugha">
      <NameTxt>Ruairí Brugha</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I should like to refer to a matter that has been mentioned already, that is, the length of time that has elapsed since developments in the European Communities have been the subject of discussion in the House.  We have before us now five reports in respect of 1975 and 1976.  The Parliamentary Secretary has expressed regret that a discussion of this kind has not taken place for more than two years and he indicated that in future the problem may be solved by reason of the reports coinciding with the office of each presidency. However, I do not accept that as a solution.  As there are approximately three reports each year, the introduction of the precedent suggested by the Parliamentary Secretary would mean simply that the next debate would not take place for another two years, when instead of having five reports before us we would have four.  It is not possible to have so many reports dealt with adequately at the same time.  In saying that, I appreciate the difficulty of the Minister's situation, having regard to his obligation to travel abroad frequently.  However, discussion of these reports enable the Dáil and, <Col N="1762" /> consequently, the people, to understand what is taking place in Europe. The absence of such debates is creating an even greater gap in terms of understanding developments within the Community.</P>
      <P>Before dealing with the contents of the reports, I should like to draw attention to the absence in the Parliamentary Secretary's speech of any reference to the impact on our situation of the company law proposals.  We must adopt and apply regulations as they come to us by way of the various directives agreed by the Council of Ministers.  According to the recent bulletin of the CFI, the first directive in regard to company law is the only one to be implemented so far in Ireland. The second directive has been agreed by the Council of Ministers and is awaiting implementation while Directives Nos. 3 to 8 are at the proposal stage.  It is noted that the fourth directive, which would be radical for Ireland, might be passed by the end of 1977.  I am drawing attention to this matter here lest there be people in industry and business who may not be aware of these developments.  The second directive sets out regulations to govern the minimum size of capital required in respect of a public company. It outlines rules aimed at ensuring the maintenance of such capital and includes regulations also for establishing minimum capital for a public company to the extent of 25,000 units of account.  It provides also that 25 per cent of capital must be paid up fully.</P>
      <P>It should be noted that the first directive included the requirement to publish accounts but that in our case this has been postponed so far as private companies are concerned.  It should be noted by private companies that this requirement might have to be implemented by the end of this year and that this would have a significant impact on the many private companies employing numbers of people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reports before us deal with the period from the first six months of 1975, in other words the report of August, 1975, to January, 1977.  The first half of the 1975 report relates to the period during which Ireland held the presidency.  In that respect I take <Col N="1763" /> this opportunity of congratulating the Minister on the initiative and drive he applied to his work during that period. There were some commendable innovations during those six months and the Minister made a serious effort to have Community structures put into operation.  One of the innovations was the decision to have parliamentary questions answered in the European Parliament.  The Minister's presidency, too, represented a period during which the first meeting of the European Council took place and there was also the signing of the Lomé Convention. In addition it was during that period that Britain's membership of the Community was renegotiated.  It is fair comment to say that that renegotiation to some extent represented a weakening of the European situation in that it was found necessary to change the terms of membership of an existing member in order to keep that member within the Community.</P>
    <P>Another move that was initiated during that period was the bringing forward of a date for direct elections. Unlike the Governments of other members of the Community, our Government did not consult with the Opposition in regard to the setting-up of constituencies.  Consultation in that connection would have been good.  We should be able to approach this whole question on a more agreeable basis. It would have been best to have some form of independent commission.</P>
    <P>In relation to direct elections, I note that the British Government agreed that proportional representation should be used in Northern Ireland.  This was a step forward since it should ensure representation of both sides of the divided community there.  I am puzzled by a report that the former Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Mr. William Whitelaw, has opted against proportional representation for elections to the European Parliament.  If the report is correct, one wonders if Mr. Whitelaw has lost interest in the rights of the minority in Northern Ireland or if this is a question of the danger of the principle of proportional representation being accepted by the Conservative Party <Col N="1764" /> could affect their home situation.  It is unfortunate that this should be the view of Mr. Whitelaw, a prominent member of the Conservative Party.</P>
    <P>It is necessary to emphasise that the question of direct elections faces us with the problems of eventual European rule and direction.  This is why debates of this kind should take place at six-monthly intervals and not every two years.  We must ensure that our people have an understanding of the changes that will be involved.  We must be prepared for an effective Parliament with the degrees of sovereignty which the direct elections will give. This will involve our acceptance of the fact that the major partners in Europe, through their size and the proportion of seats they will hold, will be able to direct us.  I am sure that everybody in Ireland appreciates what one may describe as the apparent irrelevance of the 16 seats allocated to us and the three seats which will be held by representatives of the Northern Ireland area&mdash;19 seats in all for Ireland.</P>
    <P>I welcome the reference in one of the reports to the setting-up of a committee to propose measures to deal with the taking of hostages.  I have not been able to find any follow-up to that and I should like to know if there has been any further development.  We have introduced legislation here but I should like to know what has been done by other European countries.</P>
    <P>There is reference in the report to the question of movement of persons and I should like to know how this affects the movement of doctors among the member states of the EEC.</P>
    <P>On the question of energy policy, I note that the proposals in the earlier reports were to the effect that by 1985 consumption would be 15 per cent below that of 1973 and that by 1985 it was intended to reduce Community dependence on imported energy to 40 per cent of the amount for 1973.  I should like to know what progress has been made on this.  The Eighth Report contains a very skimpy reference to energy.  In Chapter 16 the Ninth and final Report which we are dealing with goes into more practical detail and I <Col N="1765" /> should like to spell out what the programme involves.</P>
    <P>The report states:</P>
    <P>At its meeting on 21 December, 1976 the Council approved this Community work programme for 1977 and called on the Commission to submit relevant proposals and documentation as soon as possible so that the time limits could be met.</P>
    <P>The programme is as follows:</P>
    <P>First half of 1977</P>
    <P>(a)  rational use of energy and energy savings</P>
    <P>(b)  protection and promotion of energy investments</P>
    <P>(c)  energy pricing</P>
    <P>(d)  promotion of the use of coal in electrical power stations</P>
    <P>(e)  aid for stockpiling of coal</P>
    <P>(f)  oil refining policy including</P>
    <P>&mdash;the problem of surplus refining capacity and of adapting capacities to the structure of demand and</P>
    <P>&mdash;the problem of protecting refineries against products imported from non-member countries</P>
    <P>(g)  security stocks of crude oil and/or petroleum products including</P>
    <P>&mdash;the problem of multilateral agreements concerning stocks held on the territory of a member State on behalf of undertakings established in other member States and</P>
    <P>&mdash;the problem of financing security stocks</P>
    <P>Second half of 1977</P>
    <P>(h)  examination of national programmes and Community objectives</P>
    <P>(i)  nuclear fuel supply and the nuclear fuel cycle, including the problem of radioactive waste</P>
    <P>(j)  technological projects of interest to the Community in the hydrocarbons sector, i.e., distribution <Col N="1766" /> of support for Community projects (third round) with reference to the application of Regulation 3056/76²</P>
    <P>(k)  hydrocarbons exploration</P>
    <P>(l)  coal gasification.</P>
    <P>I should like to know what progress we have made in endeavouring to implement a national energy reduction policy.  The energy problem arose in 1973 and so far as one can see from reading the Reports it was not until December of last year that the Council approved a programme.  All of us must be aware, as has been said by President Carter, that a major problem in relation to energy and energy conservation is facing the world.</P>
    <P>Mention was made last week by a Deputy of the election of Senator Yeats as Vice-President and of the failure to elect him as President of the Council of Europe.  The Deputy in question was right to criticise the action of some of the Members of our Parliament in Europe who voted against Senator Yeats.  One does not want to make comparisions between people, but there can be no question in anybody's mind that, as a candidate for that position, Senator Yeats must have surpassed any other candidate in the field.  Deputy Thornley said in his experience when we go abroad we are Irish.  It is very unfortunate to find that the Fine Gael members of the European Parliament did not support the Irish candidate in this instance. Deputies representing this Parliament in Europe must make an effort to be a good deal more mature and to think less of internal party politics within this State when they are in Europe.</P>
    <P>It is quite obvious that in Ireland agriculture is the main beneficiary from the European Communities.  It is also quite obvious that problems are beginning to arise in this area because of the fact that farm prices of essential commodities are escalating to the consumer. A couple of days ago the Government had no alternative&mdash;especially in view of the fact that this may be an election year&mdash;but to announce subsides to try to deal with increasing costs of some essential foodstuffs.  So <Col N="1767" /> far as I can gather, the Government have not yet clarified who exactly will pay for these additional subsidies and how much they will amount to.  People are asking: are these subsidies an additional charge on the Irish taxpayers? Leaving that aside, there is no doubt membership of the Community has been and is of considerable benefit to our agricultural sector.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made in this debate to the question of the social funds and how the money provided for AnCO is being used.  The Government need to examine how the grants for retraining are being used.  There is an absence of a planned approach to this problem on the part of the Government. Retraining grants should not be looked on as an easy way to keep redundant people off the unemployment queue.  They should be geared towards the possibility of providing employment. We need from the Government more evidence of a planned programme for the use of retraining funds in conjunction with IDA projects and in conjunction with possibilities of employment. It has been suggested and it is believed that some of the AnCO funds are being used to retrain people in duplication or in areas where there is no prospect of employment.</P>
    <P>One of the areas next in line to benefit, if I may put it that way, from the European Communities is the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  The Department and the Minister are very fortunate to be getting so many millions of pounds on loan at a low rate of interest to re-equip and expand our telephone system.  If we have not got a good telephone system in a few years time, it will not be the fault of the European Investment Bank or the European Community.</P>
    <P>Our membership has been of great benefit to us but so far as one can gauge the situation, there has not been progress in the efforts to redress the discrepancy between rich and poor within the community.  It may take some considerable time, but this is an area in which we should be able to contribute by way of criticism and proposal. To some extent, the problem may lie in the absence of a greater <Col N="1768" /> effort in recent years on the part of less developed EEC members such as ourselves and Italy to avail of funds for development.  It may also lie in the failure of some members to cope with and control the cost of living and inflation, notable examples being ourselves and Britain.  In this area we appear to be among the weaker members of the Community.</P>
    <P>I should like to sound a note of warning in connection with our own general attitude towards the European Communities.  It relates perhaps, to some degree, to the absence of debate, to the failure by the Minister to arrange to have debates on these reports at regular intervals.  Whatever the reason may be, our general attitude in Ireland tends to be to evaluate our membership of the European Communities from the point of view of how much we can benefit from it.  Like a citizen of any State whose personal contribution to society is an obligation in addition to the benefits he receives from that society, our aim as a member of the EEC must be to contribute to the idea and the ideals of Europe in addition to benefiting from membership.</P>

      <P>The greatest sin committed by this Government, and they have committed many, is their total mishandling of our EEC involvement. In 1972 the Irish people in what was their most important decision since the foundation of the State voted 84 per cent in favour of entry into Europe.  If the nation after four years got a second chance, I doubt if there would be even a small majority in favour of membership.  The country would not opt for membership of the EEC.</P>
      <P>Who is to blame for the situation? Is it the European institutions, the Commission, the Council, the Parliament, or is it one member or all of our eight partners?  I say that these countries and institutions are blameless. The blame for this loss of confidence by the Irish people in the EEC must lie fairly and squarely on the shoulders of the Irish Government, and particularly on the shoulders of the Ministers involved in the Council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1769" /> In 1973 at the point of entry the Irish economy had the greatest growth potential of the three acceding nations &mdash;the United Kingdom, Denmark and ourselves.  The United Kingdom was merely an offshore island of the European mainland and after the expiry of the transition period it would have to conform to the rigid disciplines of the Treaty of Rome.  With the expiry of the transition period her Commonwealth trade would have to disappear and when this was allied to the termination of her traditional food policy the economy of the United Kingdom could go only in one direction, namely, to descend.</P>
    <P>The Danish economy more or less had reached saturation point and accession to the EEC would not have this tremendous impact.  However, our economy even to the most casual observer could go in one direction only&mdash;it had to ascend.  For the first time since the Act of Union in 1800 we could terminate our over-dependence on a declining British market. Now we had full and free access to a vast and affluent consumer market of 250 million people for agricultural produce which accounts for 40 per cent of our total exports.  On this basis alone Ireland within a short few years should have experienced rapid economic expansion making our economy one of the strongest in the EEC.  At this point when we are moving towards the expiry of the transition period we should be able to conform to the rigid disciplines of the Snake currencies.</P>
    <P>It might be asked what has happened after four years.  We are now the most depressed country in the market and we are heading the European league in three vital areas&mdash; inflation, prices and unemployment. The imbalance between Ireland and the richest part of the Community, the Hamburg region of West Germany, which stood at 5:1 in 1973 is now standing at 7:1.  This is because the economies of the other countries are expanding but tragically our economy is contracting.  Unless immediate remedial action is taken that gap will continue to widen and multiply.</P>
    <P>What should the Government have done apart from keeping the domestic <Col N="1770" /> scene in order?  They should and could have activated certain mechanisms in our Treaty of Accession such as Article 139 and they should have sheltered under the broad umbrella of Protocol 30 to protect our vital national interests in the area of employment and industry, both manufacturing and agricultural.  The failure of the Government in this regard accounted for the loss of thousands of jobs in 1974 in the textile, clothing and footwear industries.  The Government's inaction in the beef and livestock sectors of agriculture at the end of 1973 and early 1974 led to the slaughtering of 30 per cent of the national dairy herd.  This has led to our continued exclusion from the more lucrative markets on the mainland for our beef.  This was brought about by inaction with regard to escalating MCAs, by the absence of a proper meat marketing board and by our failure in the area of proper transport for our exports to the markets of central Europe for agricultural produce and industrial products.</P>
    <P>Our remoteness from central European markets, involving long sea journeys&mdash;our nearest link being a 22-hour sea journey from Rosslare to Le Havre&mdash;makes our exports less competitive. In our special circumstances we would have been justified in seeking a transport subsidy from the Community.</P>
    <P>The Commission have powers under Article 80 of the Rome Treaty to do this.  Have the Government ever requested them to do it?  Last month I tabled a question to Commissioner Burke asking for a subsidy for the transportation of goods from the peripheral areas.  I mentioned Ireland as being one of the peripheral areas involved. While the Commissioner acknowledged his powers under Article 80, he was not prepared to act.  It is up to the Government to act in this vital field and to seek Community aid in the interests of the economies of deprived peripheral areas.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to our six-month's presidency.  This was very important for the country.  We handled its complex organisation with a very high degree of competence.  I know, <Col N="1771" /> from my parliamentary experience, that our partners in the other member states were very impressed. Mention was also made of the Lomé Convention.  I was privileged to be there last year and was very impressed. Here I commend the EEC for filling an economic vacuum in the APC countries, a vacuum which might otherwise be filled by one or other of the imperialistic programmes.</P>
    <P>In the final analysis what did the presidency mean to Ireland?  Did we have any influence in the Community as a result of it?  The record proves that the net effect was a minus quantity. We presided over the first meeting of the European Council held in Dublin in March, 1975, which bestowed on Britain the extension of Protocol 18, as well as an extension of their imports of dairy products from New Zealand. This created more difficulties for our dairy farmers and added to the EEC butter mountain which has led to the Commission's move to introduce the milk co-responsibility levy to reduce unwanted surpluses.  Bord Bainne, to their credit, have never put one pound of butter into Community intervention. Still our producers will now have to pay this levy.  I am saying clearly that the decision arrived at in Dublin to extend Protocol 18 of the United Kingdom's Accession Treaty did not help that situation and should have been resisted.</P>
    <P>Apart from the common agricultural policy, the next influencing factor on the 84 per cent who voted for entry into Europe was the commitment in the Preamble to the Rome Treaty to the correction of regional disparities in the Community.  This had a major influence on the 84 per cent who voted for it, and especially the people in the west of Ireland.  The Paris Summit of October, 1972, took the decision to remove these disparities.  In March, 1975, the Council, with the Minister for Foreign Affairs presiding, created the regional fund.  The fund has been a dismal failure.  Our allocation of £35 million for a three-year period should not have been accepted.  It was an insult.  Should I perhaps more correctly say that the method of distribution <Col N="1772" /> should not have been accepted but resisted?  The quota system should never have been accepted.  The amending of the draft Commission regulation and the insertion of the partial repayments clause was a criminal act pushed by the Minister for Foreign Affairs to enable his colleague, the Minister for Finance, to subsume the allocation from the regional fund into the national exchequer.</P>
    <P>The concept of additional expenditure was not applied, although the Minister would argue that it was. Despite repeated questioning here and in the European Parliament, I failed to ascertain the amount of additional expenditure going to any individual project.  The alleged beneficiaries of the fund, the industrialists or local authorities, cannot tell how much money comes from the regional fund to aid their projects.  All they receive is a grant from the IDA.  This situation arises because the Irish Government use the system in which a large number of projects are lumped together in one global application for fund aid.</P>
    <P>It must also be said that when local authorities or industrialists are raising finance for a project which clearly qualifies for aid under the fund regulation, they are wasting their time submitting their applications to Brussels, because the only grant they will receive is the national one from the IDA.</P>
    <P>How do the other member states operate their fund allocation?  For example, the United Kingdom Government passes its aid directly to local authorities when their projects are approved.  The Italian Government transfers all of its allocation to the Mezzogiorno, which of course is the underprivileged section of Italy.  There is obvious fundamental need for changes in the fund regulations which will come up for review during the course of this year.  The revised fund must be a Community one in the real sense of the word.  That means that the notion of national quotas must cease and projects emanating from regions which, by Community standards, are underdeveloped must be afforded the priority and support they need.  There must be a concentration of aid; the worst-off regions should be entitled to a higher level of aid from the fund <Col N="1773" /> which would stimulate greater investment in those most needy regions. Under such a system Ireland, which has some of the poorest regions in the Community, would qualify for a greater share of the fund than that to which we are at present entitled.</P>
    <P>In an effort to encourage high quality projects every industrialist, local authority, Government body or agency which has a project qualifying for national aid should have the right to submit it directly to Brussels. Coupled with this right must be the application of the concept of additionality. In other words, regional aid must complement national aid and there must be no reduction in the amount of national aid.  The Government Department responsible for transmitting applications to Brussels should advise the Commission on priority amongst Irish applications.</P>
    <P>Another area which clearly illustrates the failure of the Government is the vitally important one of trans-border co-operation.  A study of the north-west region is currently in progress, financed by the regional fund. This study is merely of infrastructure and will do very little to serve the chronic socio-economic problems of this troubled area.  Urgent action is needed and is being called for daily by the vast majority of the 800,000 people who occupy this troubled region&mdash;20 per cent of our total population.  Indeed I might add it is the most depressed area in the entire Community, more depressed than the poorest parts of Sicily and the Mezzogiorno. My experience has been that a growing number of those 800,000 people are becoming more and more aware of the adverse socio-economic effects of this absurd and meaningless border.  In their desperation, through their public representatives and local authorities, they are now directly approaching the institutions of Europe, having lost faith in the political wills of the two Governments concerned, Westminster and Dublin, to provide a formula for the solution of those structural and economic ills.  The formula is a very simple one; all it requires is the agreement of both Governments to provide the legal basis <Col N="1774" /> on which local or regional authorities in trans-border areas can co-operate without having to go, cap in hand, to their respective Administrations.</P>
    <P>Reference is made in the report to direct elections to the European Parliament.  I have very fixed ideas on this matter but, please God, we will be given an opportunity next week, or shortly afterwards, to make known our thinking in this regard.</P>
    <P>I should like to pay a tribute to our national airline, Aer Lingus.  I have travelled with them for the past couple of years.  Their efficiency and the courtesy of their staff are beyond reproach.  For instance, Aer Lingus can take me from my home&mdash;which is in the most remote of the peripheral regions&mdash;to Brussles or Paris and back in one day.  I feel I should put that on record.  In my opinion they are the most efficient airline operating in Europe.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be brief, but I must make certain comments of deep concern to my constituents situated in one of the 12 western counties.  I will refer particularly to the EEC Regional Fund and generally to the common agricultural policy.</P>
      <P>When we joined the EEC we did so on the understanding that we could safeguard and improve our smaller farms and we did not expect that the Treaty of Rome would be used by a croterie to make the rich richer and the poor poorer.  I am afraid this is what is happening, particularly in regard to the application of the regional fund.  From time to time in the past few years I have been referring to the inequitable application of the regional fund to the disadvantaged areas.  It is being done by way of district electoral divisions.  That may suit some European countries but it certainly does not favour small farmers in Ireland, particularly in the 12 counties of the west.  There could be a large DED with 10,000 acres in it, but if there is a town of any size in the middle the fund does not apply although there could be as much as 50 per cent of the DED in extremely poor circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In County Galway the percentage <Col N="1775" /> of small farmers is only four, and in order to get benefit from the regional fund farmers must be in the development bracket.  This means, of course, that there is very little chance for those at the bottom.  I ask the Minister&mdash;I am glad he is in the House &mdash;to take up this matter seriously in Brussels, because it appears to me that the Treaty of Rome is being ignored by certain EEC members who are bending its rules to suit themselves. I name Britain, Italy and France in this context.</P>
    <P>I foresaw when I spoke in favour of the proposal that we should enter the EEC that certain nations would try to obtain elasticity in the Treaty of Rome rules to suit their particular circumstances.  For instance, I appreciated that Britain's cheap food policy would be maintained, if possible, but I did not foresee that there would be massive departure from the rules and regulations of the Rome Treaty in the way that has been happening.  Before Britain, Denmark and Ireland became EEC members there were six countries in the organisation.  Now there are nine.  If you have a board of directors with six members and six more directors are appointed, naturally there will be a change in policy, but I never anticipated that there would be such a deviation from the Treaty of Rome since we joined as there has been. I am afraid we have been led up the garden path.  We believed before we joined the EEC that certain rules were hard and fast and had to be complied with, but there appear to be special rules for certain nations.  As I have said, certain member states seem to be able to keep the rules it suits them to keep and to disregard the others.</P>
    <P>Land settlement and the drainage of land are the greatest problems facing farmers, particularly those in the west of Ireland.  Thousands of acres of land are lying unproductive because they are water logged.  We were promised a huge injection of money from the regional fund to help us in our land settlement problem but we got little.  Most of the farmers in the west of Ireland and those living <Col N="1776" /> in disadvantaged areas need more land but it must be properly drained.</P>
    <P>This morning the House considered the Estimate for the Office of Public Works and we learned that of the total of £28 million provided for that office only £3 million will be allocated for drainage schemes.  Can anything be done to improve that situation, particularly for the west of Ireland?  I notice that a river in Galway which I pass when motoring to Dublin is in a terrible state at present and it has been on the priority list for a long time but to date a cost-benefit analysis has not been carried out on it.  We should look for help from the EEC to carry out such works.</P>
    <P>The disadvantaged areas scheme is dealt with on the basis of district electoral divisions which can in corporate up to 8,000 acres of land. I suggest that the scheme operate on the basis of townlands although I would prefer to have grants given on a per farm basis.  I expect I will be told that it would be administratively impossible&mdash;that famous phrase was used on many occasions when I suggested improvements in various farm schemes&mdash;to do this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHerbert" hpid="Mr. Herbert Mr. Herbert">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Herbert</NameTxt>
      <P>It will cost the Exchequer money and there is no money there.  Under the disadvantaged areas scheme the national Exchequer must pay 65 per cent of the grant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>If that is so, will the Government not admit this and cease to blame the EEC?  We should endeavour to get more from the EEC. That percentage should be changed. Can anything be done to impress upon the officials in Brussels that the scheme of grants is of no use to our farmers.  We expected big things when we joined the EEC but we got nothing. The Minister would need to live in a disadvantaged area to appreciate the problem fully.  I accept it is hard for a Dublin-based Minister to understand our problems, but those of us who live in such areas know we are getting nothing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHerbert" hpid="Mr. Herbert Mr. Herbert">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Herbert</NameTxt>
      <P>It would do the Deputy good to see the areas of rich land in Germany, Belgium and France <Col N="1777" /> which are classified as disadvantaged areas.  The Deputy would weep if he saw them and he should remember that they get a higher grant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>Ireland is doing very bad out of the regional fund and the disadvantaged areas scheme.  That is a shame and unless something is done more farmers will have to leave the land in the west of Ireland.  I hope the directives concerning grants and those who qualify for them and for land are scrapped.  The farmers in the west of Ireland have waited a long time to get any advantage from our membership of the EEC.  An economist recently told us how many more people would have to leave the land but where would we get employment for those people when we already have a huge unemployment problem?  The majority of small farmers in the west of Ireland live on non-viable holdings by EEC standards and we must do something to help them.</P>
      <P>The Land Commission are doing a reasonable job but they do not have sufficient money.  The farm retirement scheme has been a complete failure in that it does not attract enough elderly farmers to retire.  Land is fetching £1,000 per acre in the west of Ireland and even if the Land Commission gives a farmer land at the rate of £500 per acre he must find £5,000 for ten acres. Where would a small farmer get that amount of money?  It is clear from the type of directives issued in Brussels that the officials there know nothing about the type of land we have or the problems of our farming community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHerbert" hpid="Mr. Herbert Mr. Herbert">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Herbert</NameTxt>
      <P>The directives are very flexible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>They are not flexible and I should like to know why.  Why are we so rigid about these directives? EEC policies implemented here are detrimental to small farmers and unless they are changed to suit the needs of those people we will have fewer operating the land in the west of Ireland.  I am not blaming the Minister, a Dublin man, for not understanding the situation nor do I blame the Europeans.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The small farmers and the people <Col N="1778" /> generally in the west are losing confidence in our having gained anything by entering the EEC.  I was one of those who went all out for entry into the EEC because I believed we could and should gain from such entry.  I believed there was a potential.  I believe there still is a potential but there is not enough weight behind the arguments as to what we want and what is suitable for us.  Is the Minister aware of what is happening in the country at the moment?  We were told we would get many advantages from entry and the possibility is that, if we were a little stronger when we go abroad, we might get some of the things that were promised.  I know the Minister is a man of ability and I would like him to use that ability in the right direction but commonsense is a very valuable asset.  Education is a good thing but education without common sense can be very dangerous.  The people with the brains should go out and meet the people with common sense to discover what is hapening and find out what they should be looking for in Brussels.</P>
    <P>There is talk about direct elections to Brussels.  What power will the European Parliament have?  Will it not still be the Council of Minister who will dictate policy?  Were I a Minister in a Government, something I shall never be, I would like discussions in the national parliament about proposed changes before ever those changes were discussed in Brussels instead of the present situation.  If one puts down a question about what happens in Brussels one is told that one is now too late and nothing can be done.  Why not discuss things here before anything is done?  We hear about Directive 159 and Directive 160 and we know as little about them now as we did six months ago.  This Parliament is completely irrelevant.  There is not enough communication between Brussels and our Parliament.  We hear more outside where Brussels is concerned than we ever hear in this House.</P>
    <P>The people in the west are completely disillusioned about everything connected with the EEC.  It is not fair to expect us, public representatives, to come in here and remain silent.  I intend to go on highlighting the situation as <Col N="1779" /> far as the small farmer is concerned. We have no alternative employment for our small farmers.  We have educated young people all over the country looking for employment and we have nothing to offer them.  The best we can hope to do is to keep as many people as possible on the land.  Again, unless the small farmer has 50 per cent of his earnings coming from the land he will get no grant.  No small farmer could live on an income of 50 per cent from his land but he will not be let in under the farm modernisation scheme.</P>

I regard it as wrong that there should be any distinction.  We all want to see Europe develop.  In order to be a good European one need be a bad Irishman but the approach should be Ireland first and Europe secondly.</P>

If he has not time to do it himself, he can get his officials to do it.  I am disappointed at the way things are going.  Everyone seems to break the rules except Ireland.  There is no sheep policy in Europe.  Europe does not give a damn about the sheep farmer here.  There is no policy and what happened before could happen again.  The situation is not so good as far as pigs are concerned.  Will anyone come to our assistance?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We were told we would have a large market in Europe and we should be able to estimate reasonably production and consumption and thereby <Col N="1780" /> stabilise the market.  That has not been the evolution.  There are more ups and downs in the market now. There is no stability.  I appeal to the Minister to go back to Europe and make the best possible case there that can be made for this country.  I appeal to him to ensure the small farmer will not be moved out.  The regional policy fund is no good.  The policy with regard to the disadvantaged areas will have to be changed and changed quickly.  That must be done now, not 12 months hence.  We cannot control the buying of land but we can prevent undesirables buying land.  Of course, when we become full members in the EEC any non-national of the Nine will be able to buy land here.  This is something we should be thinking about now.  By all means, let us be good Europeans but let us ensure at the same time that nothing happens in Europe detrimental to our own people.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1781" /> In September, 1976, the County Galway Vocational Education Committee agreed to a schedule of accommodation proposed by my Department for an extension to the secondary school at Kilronan.  The schedule was based on a projected enrolment of 100 students at 9 sq. metres per student.  No changes have been agreed since then.  There will be sufficient spare capacity in the extended school to cater adequately for more than 120 students.  Planning of the project is in hands and every effort will be made to have the work undertaken as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>May I ask the Minister if, as stated in his reply to Question No. 4, before reaching any final decision on the matter he would be prepared to meet the officers of the Dalkey School Project to discuss their views locally with him in view of the fact that a substantial number of parents directly concerned in this large catchment area would wish to see set up again a national day school, of a multi-denominational and coeducational character and as comprehensive as possible?  Before reaching any final decision on either existing school developments or possible future pilot projects he might be prepared to meet the Dalkey School Project people.  I would be very appreciative if the Minister would so agree.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I would prefer not to answer hypothetical questions of that nature.  Terms have been laid down and in deference to a request made here in the House the terms of the scheme have been inserted in the annual circular being issued to schools in relation to school transport.  The requirements are that the child must be living in an isolated area with the nearest national school a considerable distance from his home; that it is not possible, or else too costly, to offer alternative transport facilities and that the situation is also one of genuine hardship.  Those terms are fairly generally phrased and it would be preferable not to go into any great detail lest one might not be doing a favour but rather excluding certain cases by stating a particular distance as being the relevant distance.  One might just as easily exclude from benefit cases where one might feel that genuine hardship did exist as one would benefit other cases which might not come <Col N="1792" /> within the category.  It is better to leave it in the general way it is at the moment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>All of those factors would be borne in mind.  If the family had two or three cars and were able to provide alternative transport themselves with relative ease even though they might be a relatively longer distance from the school than might another family, there might be grounds for considering it in one case and not in the other.  That is the approach that we would adopt.  If the Deputy has a particular case in mind in his own constituency we certainly will look at it.</P>

Therefore, I cannot say whether finance sanctioning existed when the Deputy spoke in public on the matter.  However, when I came into office this scheme was technically in being but no sanction existed.  I have obtained the sanction and therefore since February we have been in a position to make these grants available, which was not the case previously, if one were to be in order in so doing.  If the Deputy is inundated with cases in this matter I am prepared to discuss each one with him.</P>

The Parliamentary Secretary has already indicated that there has been quite a big drop in employment in fertiliser factories in 1976.  I take it that the Parliamentary Secretary is aware of the huge importation increase and that he is aware that much of this fertiliser is being imported in bags marked &ldquo;Made in Ireland&rdquo;.  What action is the Parliamentary Secretary taking to safeguard the jobs of Irish workers?  Will the Parliamentary Secretary admit that while the farming community are securing fertiliser at a cheap rate at the moment they will suffer for it in the long run when our own factories are put out of production?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have explained in replies to previous questions legislation which would regulate pyramid-selling has reached an advanced stage, but it has proved extremely difficult to devise a definition of pyramid selling which would not apply also to certain other forms of activity which are accepted as perfectly legitimate.  However, the abuse of pyramid-selling appears to have almost disappeared.  I believe that publicity has been more effective than legislation would have been.  It is of interest that whereas there were five written complaints in 1974, only four altogether were received in the years 1975, 1976 and 1977 to date.  I shall continue to monitor developments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is implicit in my reply that, given the constraints that exist in relation to the introduction of legislation, both in terms of drafting and of parliamentary time, the best use of time might not be effected by introducing legislation to curb a practice which in the first place people become involved in voluntarily and of which they can be warned adequately by the type of publicity which, no doubt the Deputy's question will be given.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, I would avail of this opportunity to warn people against becoming involved in this type of operation in which, initially, they are invited to participate in a selling operation but in which it transpires ultimately that in practice their commitment is not to sell the goods concerned but to sell the right to sell the goods to somebody else.  This procedure continues in a vicious circle with one person &ldquo;conning&rdquo; another in the taking over of an agency.  Obviously this type of operation can involve people in significant financial loss.  I trust this warning will serve to make people avoid this practice but should <Col N="1800" /> any evidence come to light to indicate a deterioration in the situation, the question of legislation could be raised again.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">

      <P>I thank the Parliamentary Secretary for that comprehensive reply but would point out that the fact that complaints have not been sent directly to the Department by people who have been &ldquo;conned&rdquo; by these crooks does not mean that the practice does not exist.  I am aware that the company operating under the name of Golden Products are alive and well and living in Garville Avenue or some such place.  They are operating in a comprehensive way.  Their diseased tentacles are spreading themselves to the north, south, east and west of the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>In the 1976-77 fertiliser year the vast bulk of imports of compound fertilisers has been from the United Kingdom.  Because of sales methods, which involve discounts and so on from the list prices, the exact levels of sales prices in the United Kingdom are difficult to ascertain.  As is the case with home-produced fertilisers, fertilisers imported from the United Kingdom are sold in Ireland at prices below the United Kingdom list prices but it is not possible to say how actual selling prices here compare with those in the United Kingdom.</P>

Can this not be regarded as a huge increase?  It is a question of 36,000 metric tons?  A situation like this must be causing serious concern to employees in the industry as well as to the industry as a whole.  In an increase of this nature there must be a serious element of dumping.

      <P>Any question in relation to the merchandise marking regulations is a separate matter.  The questions of Deputies James Gibbons and Browne relate to the price of fertilisers and the possibility of dumping. If they wish to raise such matters they should put down a separate question.  As far as price is concerned, the fact that the price of fertilisers sold from the UK into this market are higher than the price Irish manufacturers can sell at may not necessarily result from dumping by the British.  There is a significant advantageous factor in regard to British fertilisers because the British manufacturers have the availability of North Sea natural gas, an equivalent of which is not available to Irish <Col N="1803" /> manufacturers at the moment.  There, there is a price advantage in regard to calcium ammonium nitrate of £15 per ton from the point of view of British manufacturers over their Irish competitors.  The product of the Marino Point project which will come in stream in the reasonably near future will give us access to a similar source and will ensure our competitiveness <i>vis-á-vis</i> British manufacture.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice the number of gardaí attached to the Tallaght Garda station, County Dublin; and if he is satisfied that the number is sufficient to cater for the area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 16 and 17 together.</P>
      <P>I share the concern of the residents of any part of the country where house-breaking occurs particularly in an area where there is an upward trend.  In Tallaght there were 151 house-breakings in 1975 and 185 in 1976.  However, in Springfield to which the Deputy specifically refers, there were no house-breakings in 1975 and four in 1976. Furthermore, the Deputy will be glad to know that there has been an increase of 50 per cent in the strength of Tallaght station since 1st April, 1973, the present strength being 27 compared with 18 four years ago.</P>
      <P>The Commissioner informs me that the present allocation of gardaí to the centre is the maximum that can be provided at present having regard to the overall demands on available resources. No decision has yet been taken in regard to the allocation of the extra gardaí authorised by the Government but the Deputy may take it that a significant proportion of them will be allocated to the Dublin area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I am rather surprised to hear there were only four house-breakings in the Springfield area because, during the past two weekends, there were a large number of house-breakings in the area.  There was a public outcry from all the residents' associations in the area.  I am rather surprised the Minister has not been contacted directly about the matter. There appears to be some lack of information.</P>

    <P>That Dáil Éireann takes note of the reports: Developments in the European Communities&mdash;Fifth, Sixth, Seventh, Eighth and Ninth Reports.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said before, we should get tougher in Europe and we should not just accept what is handed out to us.  I should like to know if the European Community have a general policy with regard to the unemployment of young people.  I wonder if that problem is as serious in the other member states as it is in Ireland and, if it is, I should like to know what steps are being taken by the Community. Does the Minister consider that there should be a general examination of the question of automation and computerisation which is taking place in the Community to the detriment of human beings?  I should like the Minister's comments on that.</P>
      <P>There were several questions raised with the Minister for Justice a few minutes ago on the question of violence in our cities and towns.  This will continue to happen while educated young people are left unemployed.  I am sure this is a problem that affects the Community and I should like to know if there is any policy or a serious discussion about it.  The situation is bound to get worse.</P>

      <P>I want to know if there is any policy within the Community to deal with the unemployment situation.  On the Bill introduced by the Minister for Justice quite recently I stated that it was no use appointing judges or gardaí.  What is important is the environment of young people.  If educated young people are not given worth while work it is inevitable that there will be violence.</P>
      <P>I put the case of the small farmers to the Minister on a previous occasion. We are disillusioned and we are not happy about the directives from Brussels.  We want the question of the disadvantaged areas and the regional fund reconsidered.  At the moment the employment of young people is one of the most serious issues affecting our country and I am sure it is a matter of concern for our European partners. I should like to see the EEC considering these matters seriously.  A lot of lip-service is given to the employment of young people but there is no plan. I should like to know from the Minister if the practice of machines replacing people will continue while young people remain on the dole.  If this happens there is bound to be violence.  If educated people are not given work we will have a dangerous society.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Minister for Foreign Affairs (Dr. FitzGerald) Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Dr. FitzGerald)</NameTxt>
      <P>Concern has been expressed at the fact that the six-monthly reports which we publish have not been the subject of debate at regular intervals in this House.  I share the concern of the House at this and, while Deputy O'Kennedy was factually incorrect in detail in the date he gave for the last discussion, nevertheless a long interval has elapsed since these reports were debated.  As against that, regularly there are debates in the House on European affairs.  Since the last report was debated we have had a debate on the Lomé Convention in November, 1975, and we had a debate on the Supplementary Estimate at the same time; in June, 1976, we had a debate on the Food Aid Convention as well as a debate on the EEC agreement with Turkey; in November, 1976, we had a Supplementary Estimate and <Col N="1819" /> in March this year we had a debate on the budgetary powers of the European Parliament.</P>
      <P>While some of these debates were narrow in content, as the Chair would have ruled out references to aspects in the report, on the Supplementary Estimates and on the debate on the budgetary powers of the European Parliament debate could range fairly widely.  It would be a mistake to give the impression that we have not had debates concerning aspects of the EEC &mdash;some were fairly wide-ranging while others were narrower&mdash;during the period since the discussion of the last report.</P>
      <P>Having said that, clearly it is not satisfactory that debates have not taken place on these reports.  Now that we have related the reports to periods of presidencies so that we may have a complete picture of what happens in a particular presidency, I agree we should try to find the time for them in the busy schedule of this House. We are all aware of the difficulties of finding time for business in this House which is not organised in the same way as in other parliaments.  Here we make relatively little use of committees and much is discussed in plenary sessions on the floor of the House which is not done in most of the other European parliaments.  This imposes constraints on the parliamentary timetable from which all of us suffer.</P>
      <P>A number of individual points were raised in the debate and I should like to deal with them before speaking generally.  Deputy O'Kennedy raised the general point that I had confined myself strictly to issues raised in the report, that my initial speech was rather factual and did not deal with the philosophy of the Community or a general assessment of the last four years.  Perhaps that was fair comment but given that the debate related to a number of reports there were a number of important issues in them that needed to be stressed and I considered it might be better to concentrate on those and leave time at the conclusion to speak more generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Kennedy raised the question <Col N="1820" /> of the social fund and he spoke of training young people for jobs that do not exist, although he acknowledged that generally the social fund has been applied to good effect.  He said that all of us knew that much of the money is spent on training young people for jobs that do not exist and that many young people are going back to AnCO for a second run.  I do not think this is fair to AnCO or to the use we make of the social fund money.  Last year AnCO dealt with about 10,000 people, both adult and youth trainees.  Of the adult trainees between 60 per cent and 65 per cent were placed.  There are no figures for the success rate for youths. AnCO have a scheme whereby they give a training course of one year in addition to the basic course and 90 per cent of the trainees from this extra year have been successful.  The question of training people a second time does not arise.  AnCO have such a long waiting list of people wishing to train that the list is sometimes two to three years long.  If it has ever happened that someone has been trained a second time it is certainly a rare event.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister any idea why AnCO have figures regarding the employment rate for adults and not for young people?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  They have figures for the training course for one year in addition to the basic course but not for training youth trainees. They should be available and I was disappointed to find they were not.  It is important that we have this data. The problem of youth unemployment is serious, as has been mentioned by Deputy Callanan.  It is serious not only here but elsewhere and, while rates of unemployment vary in the Community, the increase in unemployment has been exceptionally sharp in many countries. We have suffered less because of the management of the economy by the Government and because of our relatively favourable situation in the agricultural sector which, through the multiplier effect of farmer spending, has helped to sustain economic growth here at a higher rate than in almost any other country of the Community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1821" /> For example, the unemployment figures in Germany have risen by 290 per cent; in France by 135 per cent; in Belgium by 150 per cent and in Britain by 110 per cent.  Whatever problems we have here, we have not matched those figures.  I have to admit that in the first three countries the base of the increase is small.  That is certainly the case. Nonetheless these are very surprising increases.  In one country, Switzerland, unemployment has increased 200 times over, which shows that they had not any unemployment before this process started.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHerbert" hpid="Mr. Herbert Mr. Herbert">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Herbert</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister give comparable figures in relation to the total work force?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The figures I am taking are from OECD reports and relate to insurable employment.  For comparative purposes one has to try to get figures that are comparable from a single international source. These figures do not match the figures normally published here for our work force, but they are comparable as the best that can be made from country to country.  That is the important thing in international comparisons.</P>

      <P>Let us hear the Minister without interruption.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Youth unemployment is disturbing the Community.  At the European Council meeting it featured as a major item on our agenda.  All countries are suffering from this very severe problem.  Even those whose total unemployment level is lower than ours, and who have suffered this very large increase in unemployment, are finding it very difficult to find jobs for young people coming on the register.  This is regarded as the most serious social problem facing the Community at the present time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The discussion which took place in the European Council was perhaps inevitably at a certain level of generality rather than of detail.  The detailed question of the techniques to be adopted to try to deal with this problem are matters for the social <Col N="1822" /> ministers.  One point raised is the question of early retirement in various walks of life with a view to providing additional posts for young people rather than leaving them without jobs. That is something we have not considered but should consider soon.  This and other possible remedies to what is now a universal European problem are under discussion in the Community.</P>
    <P>The social fund is going to be directed towards employment as well as training.  For some time past I had the feeling that the emphasis was quite inappropriate to a problem which is not primarily of training people but of finding employment for those who are trained.  From the figures I have given you will see that we have been relatively successful with adults and people on the one year training course.  Even so we can get to a point where we are training people for the sake of training and find at the end that there are no jobs for them.  The fact that the fund is being redirected towards employment is important.  This follows the general policy lines we have been proposing. Exactly what form this will take or how far the redirection will go we have yet to see.  At this stage we would press for a substantial redirection towards employment rather than training.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Kennedy spoke about the size of the regional fund&mdash;an old chestnut but one to which he was quite right to return at this stage.  He suggested that we should aim at more than doubling the fund when it comes to be reviewed.  I agree with him except that, if anything, he is underestimating the needs of the fund.  The fund as originally proposed by the Commission was twice as large as the fund which eventually emerged.  If that fund were to maintain its purchasing power today, taking Europe as a whole, it would have to be increased by something like 50 per cent.</P>
    <P>If the new fund to come into effect in 1978 were to have the same purchasing power as the Commission proposed for the original fund in 1974, and which came into effect in 1975, <Col N="1823" /> the present level would have to be trebled rather than doubled.  That is one of a number of points we have made to the Commission in connection with a review of the fund.  The Deputy can be assured that we are taking this seriously but I feel that if anything, he is underestimating the scale of the increase needed.  I am not saying that I expect the fund will be trebled, because that is another day's work, but it is only fair to point out that it would need to be trebled to achieve the objective originally set by the Commission.</P>
    <P>Several Deputies referred to the widening gap between Ireland and the better off regions of the Community. I have not had time to examine technically the figures upon which these allegations are based and I do not want to controvert them when I do not have a solid basis to go on.  I will only make the point that, as the rate of growth of the economies of member countries has been broadly similar over this period and as we are well up with the average in terms of goods and services produced and available to our people, our position as a country has not fallen behind those of other member countries.  The position is complicated by the exchange rate changes that have taken place and their impact on the availability of total resources.  I think the comparisons Deputies are referring to may be ones which are expressed simply in terms of the currencies of member states converted at each year's parities, where you are getting an impression of a widening gap which may only reflect the currency change rather than a change in real resources available.</P>
    <P>In view of the fact that our growth rate has been up to the level of the Community and even slightly above it and that the increase in the three years, 1973-76, has been 4 per cent net as against 3¾ per cent for the Community as a whole, it would be very surprising if there were to be a significant divergence in the growth of resources available to people in this country and in particular parts of other countries.  These comparisons <Col N="1824" /> would need to be looked at carefully to make sure that they are valid and are not the result of the complications introduced into international comparisons by exchange rate changes, which have taken place.  This should be examined further.  I am not being dogmatic about that, but I feel it is something we should be careful about when making comparisons.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Kennedy criticised the way our allocation from the fund is paid into the Exchequer.  I am not happy with the arrangements under which the fund works at present in this respect.  It is not a question of what we do; it is a question of the way the fund is organised and run from Brussels.  What we do is add the extra money to the resources available to us for budgetary purposes, and then add to the programmes for which we are seeking funds, whether they be for the Gaeltacht or the IDA, the appropriate amount so that the spending under various capital headings appropriate to the fund is increased each year by the amount of the extra money received.</P>
    <P>The actual allocation of the fund is a separate exercise which is carried out under a bureaucratic mechanism where we have to name for the fund projects which fall within the criteria established and for which we want assistance.  In the early period particularly it was necessary to choose projects which may already have been started before the money became available in order to ensure that we got paid the amount to which we were entitled. As at present arranged, there is no fixed provision for advance payment in the fund and there are separate figures for commitments and payments.</P>
    <P>There is no clear connection between the process by which we in our budget increase the budgets for the different sectors where regional funds can appropriately be spent and the individual items we then submit.  They may happen to coincide broadly.  But if we felt ourselves bound by the allocation we had made in the budget we might find that we had allocated, say, £1 million to the Gaeltacht, but <Col N="1825" /> when it came to the point we might find there were not £1 million worth of projects in the Gaeltacht which would reach the criteria.  Therefore, we have to use some flexibility in what we submit to ensure that we get the amounts to which we are entitled and that what can be paid in the year will be paid.  This means that those projects must be completed within that time.</P>
    <P>In the early stage, at any rate, when we had to choose industrial projects, there simply was not any in respect of which we could have made a claim and which would have been completed within the year in which payments would have been made.  Therefore we find that the way in which the Community have organised this fund quite unsatisfactory.  The comments we have made to the Commission have emphasised this and suggested changes, including advance payments, to get over this difficulty.  What should be made clear&mdash;and it is important that the Opposition should not seek to confuse this issue&mdash;is that the money provided is additional to our own resources and does increase the amount of spending in different regions of the country by the amount available.  The technical method by which the bureaucratic arrangements between the Community and ourselves works to allocate these items is a separate question which I think confuses the issue.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Deputy has not listened.  The question of the projects to which the aid is allocated is simply a bureaucratic device to ensure that we get the money under the quota and has nothing to do with the additionality question or the question of where additional resources are allocated in the budget.  The two are separate; they have to be separated because of the bureaucratic mechanism of the Community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHerbert" hpid="Mr. Herbert Mr. Herbert">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Herbert</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I think the exact opposite, as the Deputy knows, that the amount of resources allocated to the IDA, Gaeltarra Éireann, or whatever may be the body, each year is increased by the amount of money made available from the regional fund.  The Government must decide how much of that money goes to each, and adds that to the capital budget.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>They are Cabinet decisions.  The Deputy does not have to attend Cabinet meetings as yet. That has nothing to do with the question subsequently of what projects you put in order to collect the money.  That is a collection device. That collection device has to operate sometimes in relation to projects which in fact started some time previously.  If one did not do that then they would not be finished in time, by the end of the year, to collect the money and we would end up not getting the money for that year to which we are entitled.  It is an absurd system the Community have introduced.  It is one which leads to confusion and one we would like to see abolished.  Certainly one cannot in any sense blame the Government because of that.  We are making representations to have the system changed so that the projects we would submit would be related directly to the areas for which we had planned to <Col N="1827" /> use the additional sums available.  I have explained that twice, once when the Deputy was not here and once when he was, and I think I ought to get on with my speech.  I am not sure what is the time limit.

      <P>Just one point, the partial repayments clause was inserted in the amendment to the draft fund regualtion, as proposed by the Commission and amended by the Council in March, 1975.  Was the Minister a party to that insertion, that change if it was amended by the Council?</P>

      <P>I do not follow the Deputy's point or what it has to do in any sense with the question of additionality.  What we are now proposing in the annual review, among other things, is that there should be advance payments.  Therefore, the problem we are up against is that of having to submit projects which have already started in order to collect the money, which are not the projects which arise from the additional moneys provided, so that that problem will be overcome.</P>

      <P>We feel there should be advance payments which would get over this problem.  Whatever the Deputy may say, I am sure he agrees with me on that point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The quota system has been criticised. The Deputy claims we would have done better out of the fund were it not for the quota system.  Of course, one can argue that, but I am not sure of its basis.  Where there is no quota, as in the case of the social fund, the <Col N="1828" /> share we have got has been about 6 per cent, which is slightly less than the quota in the regional fund.  Therefore, it may be that it would not make very much difference.  Frankly, if the Deputy had been present when the negotiations were going on within the different countries about the distribution of the fund and had seen the determination with which especially the larger countries were fighting to get their shares, he would not have been too happy to leave this question without the protection of a quota.  At least in the early stages, when there was a very determined battle over this, when larger countries were seeking to get, I felt, totally disproportionate shares, unless we had got a quota increased by two-thirds over the original figure proposed, I do not think we would have got our fair share at all.  As the quota in fact roughly coincides with what we have got from the social fund&mdash;an area which is much less controversial and where the political impact is much less&mdash;it suggests that probably in the end it may not have mattered very much.  Nonetheless we were safer in this area with a quota in the early stages of the fund than we would have been without it.</P>
    <P>The Deputy also propsoed annual endowment to the fund rather than having the fund for three years, as happended in the first case, which would mean it would have to be reviewed along with the budgets of parliaments each year.  We would welcome this proposal.  We have in fact supported it in what we have said to the Commission, I think, for the same reasons as Deputy O'Kennedy very properly suggested.  I think we are in agreement on that point.</P>
    <P>Some references were made in the debate to European elections.  I do not want to dwell on this because the Bill has been published and the debate will take place shortly.  I shall make just one point at this stage to draw attention to one aspect of the Bill which makes provision for nationals of other member states voting for the European election in this country. This is an important point.  I am not certain that it should necessarily apply in all other countries.  I think some of <Col N="1829" /> them intend not to permit nationals of other member states to vote, which I must say I regard as wrong.  Of course, there is a basic problem here: that different countries have different philosophies.  In some countries&mdash;for example, Italy&mdash;people who return home from emigration can vote whereas we require people to be resident here on a certain date in September to vote.  These differences in national practice have influenced the approach to the franchise.  In our circumstances, being concerned to act in the European manner, it is right that the vote should be extended to nationals of other member states as well as to Irish citizens.  I do not want to dwell on the European elections because there will be a debate on this subject.  Unless the Deputy wants to raise particular points I should prefer to leave it until then.</P>
    <P>Deputies raised the question about the relative performance of our economy and suggested that we had not made the most of our opportunities in the Community; indeed that we had lagged behind other countries. Factually this is simply not the case. I am puzzled that this allegation should have been made.  For example, if we take gross national product, our growth over the years 1973 to 1976 has been 4 per cent.  In France it was about 7 per cent; in Belgium and the Netherlands about 5 per cent; Denmark and Italy about 4 per cent; Germany 3 per cent; the United Kingdom nil and Luxembourg minus 2½ per cent.  The average for those as a whole is 3¾ per cent.  Therefore clearly we are just about average in that respect and our performance can not be faulted as falling behind.  If one takes the industrial production figures, whether one takes them from the year 1972 to the year 1976 or from the fourth quarter of 1972 to the fourth quarter of 1976&mdash;the latter is probably the most relevant comparison for the performance of our Government&mdash; whichever one takes, the figure is rather similar.</P>
    <P>In the case of Italy it is an 18 per cent increase&mdash;from the fourth quarter of 1972 to the fourth quarter of 1976; Ireland, 16 per cent; Belgium, 8 per <Col N="1830" /> cent; France, 7 per cent; the Netherlands, 6 per cent; Germany, 4½ per cent; Britain, minus 2 per cent and Luxembourg, minus 8 per cent.  We have come a close second to Italy with a rate of growth twice as high as any other country in the Community over the four-year period, May, 1972, to May, 1976, as far as industrial production is concerned.  On the basic figures there is no doubt about it that our performance compares favourably, in the industrial sector in particular, with other countries and overall compares favourably with the Community as a whole.  Allegations to the contrary are simply unfounded and of a propaganda character.</P>
    <P>Another point which has been raised during the discussion&mdash;certainly it has been mentioned in the newspapers from time to time&mdash;is how we have done in the job share-out in Brussels.  Jobs, of course, always arouse quite inordinate interest here.  Much has been written about this but very little published in the way of facts.  I have gone to the trouble of extracting the relevant facts in the hope that we could settle this issue once and for all.  The figures relate to December, 1976, and they are the latest figures available to us from the Community institutions.  Firstly, I should like to point out that we have 1.2 per cent of the population of the Community and our contribution to its resources will be of the order of .65 per cent when we are making our full contribution.  It is against that background that any figure of share of jobs has to be seen.  Overall, 1¾ per cent of the jobs in the European Commission are held by Irish people, substantially more than our share of population but the share at the higher level is much greater than at the lower level.  In the groups, B, C, D, and L&mdash;I trust no Deputy will ask me to explain which each of these are; they are the categories of staff other than the A grade, the policy making staff&mdash;we have 1.4 per cent of the posts which is just above our share of the population and is more than twice our share of contribution to the Community.  When one moves to the lower levels of the A, policy-making grades, grades 4 to 7, we have 2.1 per cent of the posts and at <Col N="1831" /> the higher level, A 1, 2 and 3, we have 3.8 per cent or more than three times our share of the population and about six times our contribution to the Community. By any standards we have not done badly.</P>
    <P>The figures for the Parliament are, 4.6 per cent of the A posts and for the Council of Ministers, 5.0 per cent of the A posts.  It is suggested at times that other new member states have done better than we have in this respect but that is not the case.  If we take the high policy making grades, A 1, 2 and 3, we have 3.8 per cent of the posts while Denmark, with a population 50 per cent cent greater than ours, has 2.9 per cent and Britain, with a population 19 times ours and whose contribution to the Community is nearly 30 times ours, has 15.1 per cent, nearly four times as many jobs as we have.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHerbert" hpid="Mr. Herbert Mr. Herbert">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Herbert</NameTxt>
      <P>How many A 1 posts have we in the Commission?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>As can be seen from this morning's newspapers we have one A 1 position.  The total number of A 1 posts in the Commission is 38 and we have one which is roughly 2.6 per cent for 1.2 per cent of the population.  We had two such posts temporarily because a particular official was asked for because of his skills and merits but one A 1 post is more or less appropriate to our share.  Our position in relation to other new member states and in relation to our population and contribution as far as jobs in the Community is concerned is one about which we cannot have too much to complain.  There are particular lower grades, one of them at least, in which our share seems a little low but we must appreciate that local employees are taken on for certain types of employment such as messengers and chauffeurs.  The local countries, Belgium and Luxembourg, have a disproportionate number of jobs in those grades.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to try to evaluate our period in the Community and the progress of the Community in recent years. It is noticeable that when we have these debates everybody asserts that we were misled in the referendum.  It is <Col N="1832" /> held, in particular, that the people were misled about the regional fund.  I intend doing a study over the referendum debates because my recollection is&mdash;I am reasonably clear about this because I bore more than my share of the debate on the regional policy side and I do not recall getting as much assistance as I would have liked from the then Government on it&mdash;that the regional policy side came into the debate only as a counter-argument to the argument from the left or the extremes that all capital would tend to flow to the centre in a Community of this kind because of the free movement of capital.  I countered that by pointing out that this had not, in fact, happened in the then Community, that through various funds and mechanisms&mdash;there was no regional fund then&mdash;the capital flows were countered and, in fact, in that period&mdash;up to the time we had the referendum&mdash;there was a marked tendency for the flow of capital to move towards the periphery of the Community and this had led to faster growth in peripheral areas than in central area.  This was validated by the figures published in the Commission's document on regional policy at that time.</P>
    <P>The regional fund was mentioned as something which was impending and which we hoped would come about and help in this process.  It was certainly not the major argument in the referendum. It was an ancillary to a counter-argument on a particular point.  In fact, the greater burden of the discussion in the referendum was on the agricultural side.  Neither the social fund nor the regional fund as such featured largely. The regional fund was only a gleam in somebody's eye at the time.  The issue was, would there be a flow of capital to the centre and my answer was no, this had not been happening in a Community which did not have a regional fund; the flow was the other way and growth was faster in the periphery.  It was held that any regional fund which would be created would help this process. There was no reliance on the regional fund as a major argument for entry.  That is simply historically absurd.  It is a myth which is being perpetrated now, and foolishly so, and one which should be exploded.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1833" /> In our case, far from capital flowing to the centre following our membership, there has been a continuing outflow of capital towards us and, quite apart from capital flows occurring through the regional fund and through the European Investment Bank flows to us deriving directly from our membership, the private capital flows to us have been of a large scale in recent years as our balance of payments analysis shows.  Despite the propaganda from the other side of the House that the wealth tax would drive capital out of the country it has had the exact opposite effect.  People felt this was a good country in which to have their money.  The estate duties, which exists in Britain, have been abolished and replaced by a much more rational system of wealth taxes.  In fact, the flow of capital has continued to come in here as statistics show.</P>
    <P>The regional fund, even if it has met all our expectations and hopes in the negotiations, could not have equalled or come anywhere near matching the inflow of funds from the Community under other headings.  From the agricultural fund the flows have been of the order of three times as large as the figures we expected when we joined.  Even discounting for the effect of inflation they have been much greater in real terms than we expected. As we see from the latest of these reports the flows are now very large indeed, the most recent figure being of the order of £140 million, representing the equivalent of almost 10 per cent of our budget.</P>
    <P>Those who argue about the benefits of our membership of the Community should ask where we would get this money from if we were not in the Community or what services we would have to do without, had we not got that money.  We are, of course, by far the largest net beneficiaries from Community membership and this should be borne in mind when people make strident propaganda claims to the effect that we are being badly done by or that we should get more.  There is a limit to the extent to which it is wise or prudent constantly to adopt a poor mouth attitude and say to people who are transferring to us sums equivalent <Col N="1834" /> to 10 per cent of our budget that they are behaving badly by not providing much more.  Some sense of reality has to break in here and if the grasping and unrealistic attitude advocated in this House from Opposition benches were pursued by the Government we would be the object of growing hostility in Europe.  In fact, we have succeeded, while getting very substantial benefits from membership, in remaining respected by other member countries.  It is remarkable that our standing is as high as it is. Other countries accept us as a constructive member of the Community and do not resent the scale of transfers accruing to us.  That is what diplomacy is all about; it is to achieve that result. Some recognition of that would be appropriate.</P>
    <P>Regarding the effects of membership on the Irish economy, these are difficult to disentangle.  I think one could say that the effects have been sharper and more sudden in both directions, both the beneficial effects and the disadvantageous ones.  As I have said, the flow of funds to us is far greater than was anticipated when we joined.  The price rise to farmers has been very much greater than they anticipated.  Part of this, of course, reflects inflation and that part of it which relates to green £ adjustments reflects the devaluation of the £, which is a consequence of inflation in the UK.  Possibly the annual price reviews may have involved slightly higher figures were we not in an inflationary period.  Even discounting the inflationary effect, the increases in agricultural prices in terms of real value to the farmer have been greater than anybody would have dared to forecast.  The impact on milk output has been greater than we foresaw.  I intend to go back and look at the estimates which I made during the campaign and put on record.  I think I will find that I was much too cautious and pessimistic by comparison with what has happened since.</P>
    <P>Exports of our manufactured goods to the continent, especially when combined with the inflow of foreign investment to Irish industry&mdash;using Ireland as a base from which to approach the Community&mdash;have risen <Col N="1835" /> far more rapidly than foreseen.  Some of these increases have been absolutely phenomenal and no one in his right senses in 1972 would have thought of mentioning figures of the order of magnitude of these increases.  It is the combination of increased output and incomes in the agricultural sector and the very rapid increase in manufactured exports, above all to the continent, which has kept our economy moving ahead when otherwise it would have been dragged down by the economic difficulties of Britain. We would have found ourselves, like Britain, with a nil rate of growth in the economy and a minus rate of growth in industry over the past four years.  This reflects not merely good management by the Government but the impact of EEC membership on our manufactured exports to the continent and on our agricultural sector.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, it must also be said that because of the world recession coinciding within a year of Irish membership, the free trade effects of the later years of the Anglo-Irish trade agreement and the marginal extra effects of free trade with other EEC members&mdash;which is not a significant factor, as the ultimate free trade derived from the Anglo-Irish free trade agreement&mdash;the effects which were due to happen and to have an impact on our industry in the years following EEC membership came more suddenly and with less time to offset them with new jobs than we foresaw when we joined.  We were naturally assuming some general continuance of economic growth in the seventies.  None of us foresaw the oil crisis and the consequent world recession.  The sudden halt in growth in world trade and the decline of trade and output which hit all the countries in our region did accelerate the process of loss of business in domestic markets which would have come more gradually, more acceptably and with more chance to replace it with other employment under different conditions.  I do not think anyone could track down very easily how many of the redundancy problems we have faced relate to the free trade effects being accelerated and how many relate to the decline in the home market <Col N="1836" /> and in export markets.  The fact that the recession came at this time, when they would in any event have been facing up to the final stages of the freeing of trade, certainly created difficulties for us and the sudden sharp rise in unemployment and redundancies a couple of years ago was due to this.</P>
    <P>Moreover, it is fair to say that most of us probably took a far more optimistic view of the evolution of the UK economy in 1972 than events have justified.  Certainly the difficulties we have faced and overcome in this period have been greater than we foresaw because the UK market has been effectively stagnant and in certain periods declining.  Although EEC membership has enabled us to diversify our trade, something approaching half of our exports go to the UK and a large part of our invisible receipts from activities such as tourism comes from the UK.  The continued stagnation and decline in certain fields in the UK has been worse than we expected and has certainly been a major factor hitting our economy.  EEC membership is not the cause of that.  The fact is that EEC membership has cushioned for us the effects of the UK crisis by giving us access to new markets and giving us the bonus of higher prices and incentive to higher output in the agricultural sector.</P>
    <P>One other factor has to be mentioned which was not expected and took everybody by surprise&mdash;the cattle crisis of 1974.  The assumption made by all of us during the campaign, including the opponents of membership, was that there would be a continuing shortage of beef for the foreseeable future and that the opening of markets in the UK would provide an incentive for an increase in cattle output and that these cattle would be easily and profitably disposed of.  Yet, within not much more of a year of membership, a world cattle surplus developed and the EEC system could not cope adequately with this.  It was designed to cope with surpluses of goods which are more easily storable and was not adequate to cope with this cattle surplus, particularly with its effects on a country on the periphery of the Community.  There were defects there which we have to <Col N="1837" /> recognise.  On the other hand, had we not been in the Community the effect would have been totally disastrous because there is nowhere in the world to which we could have exported any beef in 1974, not to mention 1975, had we not had access to the Community. Had Britain been inside and we outside we would have had an enormous volume of cattle which we would simply have had to kill and throw away because nobody anywhere would have bought them.  The fact is we were able to dispose of a large portion and others were put into intervention, admittedly at disturbingly low prices, but prices that gave at least some return to the farmers and, without this EEC system, with all its defects, in the cattle trade that could not have happened.</P>
    <P>When we come to sum up this question of how economically the Community has affected us the test is whether our growth has been maintained and it has been maintained at the Community level, or slightly better, and that happened despite the exceptional impact of the cattle cycle which last year was the cause of a 10 per cent cut in farm output as calculated in terms of the number of calves born.  We have achieved this sustained growth despite our continued exposure to the effects of difficulties in the UK and despite the inflationary impact of the 35 per cent decline in sterling in the 18 months ended October last.</P>
    <P>Problems such as the cattle cycle have been transitional problems and with prices generally in agriculture now at a realistic level following the adjustments to membership, the green £ adjustments and the price reviews of the last four or five years, our problem in the years ahead will be to switch the direction of thinking on the part of the farming community away from the expectations to which they have become accustomed in these years of adjustment of continual price increases and towards achieving higher efficiency in production and increasing output on this new and firm basis that has been established.  There is a danger that the fact that each year the combination of accession and adjustments &mdash;in later years green £ adjustments&mdash;<Col N="1838" /> and the price reviews, some of them relatively large in a period of inflation, may have given rise to some kind of expectation in the farming community that prices would continue to rise indefinitely. That will not be the evolution. The process of adjustment to EEC price levels in agriculture has now been completed in the recent price review and from now on, assuming the £ sterling maintains its value, as we hope it will, and there are no more green £ problems, and given that there are no more accession adjustments, all we have to look to is the annual increase in the price review.  This year it was no more than 3½ per cent and next year it may be no more than 3½ per cent again and instead of the very large increase in prices achieved in pretty well every one of the recent years, farmers will have to face next year and in the years to follow the fact that price increases will be modest, price increases which, because of the surplus in agricultural produce, will probably be less than the increase in the consumer price index.  The maintenance in the increase in their standard of living from now on will have to be built not on what can be done by our negotiators in Brussels but what can be done by the farmers at home increasing output efficiency now that they have for the first time in history a decent return for their work and a chance of earning a decent livelihood. It is important that should be said lest next year and the year after there should be confusion on the subject and this is the moment to say it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHerbert" hpid="Mr. Herbert Mr. Herbert">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Herbert</NameTxt>
      <P>As a producer I would be prepared to accept the small Community increase provided the inflation rate at home is kept within reasonable bounds.  Surely that is the answer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>What I am saying is that it is quite possible that the price increase rate in the Community's agricultural produce may be less than the inflation rate in member countries, and not just here, because the surplus situation is such that the tendency may be to increase certain farm prices less than the increase in consumer prices in order gradually to phase out the surplus.  It is a fact of life that <Col N="1839" /> that tendency will be there and farmers cannot expect their price increases in Brussels to be as great as the consumer price in the Community as a whole.  It is, of course, our duty to try to keep our price increases down to Community level and that must be our aim and object.  It is towards that that we will be making progress in the second half of this year now that we have behind us the bulk of the price increases brought about by the 35 per cent drop in sterling in the 18 months ended October last.  That having worked through our system we are moving in now to a period of relative price stability especially with the help of the national wage agreement.  It is expected that in the second half of this year we shall move into single figure inflation and then next year to a level of inflation of the kind we were used to before this crisis started.  That is the object of our policy and all our efforts must now be bent towards that objective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Coming to the impact of public opinion on membership of the Community, I think that probably it has not been as positive as would be justified on a straightforward economic analysis because membership has, of course, coincided with a world slump and people do not easily distinguish causes and effects.  The last four years have been a difficult period because of the world economic situation and the fact that has coincided with membership of the EEC may confuse some people into thinking there is a relationship between them.  It must be said that a large part of the benefits of membership has been concentrated in rural areas and such bad effects as there have been on prices and unemployment have been largely concentrated in urban areas.  Other factors which had an impact on public opinion and damped down some of the earlier enthusiasm have been the exceptional slump which affected opinion in farming circles in 1974 and 1975 and, throughout the country generally and disappointment with the regional fund, even though it was not built up in the campaign some people have alleged.  The fact is we had a <Col N="1840" /> long negotiation about this at the end of which we certainly got a much bigger share of the fund than we started with but still quite inadequate.</P>
    <P>Another thing which has made some impact on public opinion of an unfavourable kind in a general way is that there seems to be a lot of national in-fighting in the Community and countries seem to be constantly jockeying for position to their own advantage.  I think it is entirely proper for the Irish Government to do this but most improper for other countries to follow suit.  If we do not fight our corner with great enthusiasm and vigour we are subject to criticism at home, and that is as it should be, but then the same critic will say that the Community really is not what it was cracked up to be with all these countries trying to get something for themselves.  Of course, the same person would be very upset if we were not trying to get what we feel we are entitled to.</P>
    <P>Part of the adverse impression of in-fighting in the Community derives from the fact that this kind of conflict situation makes news and is highlighted in the media rather than the cases where results are achieved.  One of the curious features of the Community is that most of the results in terms of concrete legislation involving decisions that affect our lives positively are achieved quietly, silently and effectively and emerge at the Council of Ministers at what is called A points, decisions which have been agreed without ever having to come before Ministers even to discuss never mind disagree about or fight over.  These never make headlines.  In fact, they pass unnoticed by the public and sometimes by ourselves.  Some of these decisions are quite important and sometimes one comes across an important decision of which one had not been aware at the time because it was not necessary for that important decision to come up for discussion at Government level.</P>
    <P>An area where there is disagreement between countries and where it reaches ministerial level is a great dramatic exercise making headlines in the papers and forming a source of <Col N="1841" /> material for our television programmes. The period we have gone through has been one in which the amount of such in-fighting by different countries seeking to safeguard their own interests has probably been greater than normal not merely because of the general world slump, which makes countries more sensitive to even relatively small national interests, but also because, and this is not sufficiently appreciated, these have been very difficult years during which the Community has been adjusting to enlargement.</P>
    <P>The original Community was established on the basis of the common interest of the six original members. They did not need a mutton and lamb policy.  Mutton and lamb are not eaten to any extent and it was felt that there was no need for such a policy.  They did need a fish access policy where they saw other countries joining them because they wanted to get access to their fish, and so a pattern of Community policies emerged reflecting the interest, or lack of interest in some cases, of the six original member countries in the different sectors of the economy.</P>
    <P>Then the Community was enlarged. Three new countries joined, two of them islands, one a peninsula, all with different attitudes and approaches to many problems and having different interests.  Immediately we are in the position where we find that, in the absence of a mutton and lamb policy, our lamb cannot be exported to France at every period of the year. This is, by all normal standards of what the Community is about, completely against the principle of the Community.  But this arrangement as it stands is in the interests of and satisfies the six original members, so we have to fight to get it changed, to fight to get the Community policies modified to meet the needs of an enlarged Community.  Then we come into conflict with France on that.</P>
    <P>Again in the case of the fish policy, Britain and ourselves find that the policy adopted in 1970 in anticipation of our membership is totally unrelated to our needs and is antipathetical to our interests, and we have to <Col N="1842" /> fight to get that changed.  Therefore, part of the conflicts that have occurred during these years between member states have been conflicts arising from the adjustments needed to an enlarged Community, and this has again given the impression that the Community is composed of countries pursuing only their own interests and not concerned with general Community interests.</P>
    <P>That is a misleading impression but it is not a totally false one, because each country has to have regard to its own interest.  It is only by each country fighting its own corner that a balanced policy covering the interest of all will eventually emerge.  However, the impression one gets of constant conflicts and of national interests being pursued without any regard to others is in fact false.  One of the interesting things about the Community, which is difficult to communicate but which one feels very quickly when one is involved in its processes, is the extent to which there is a Community with its own conventions as well as laws&mdash;conventions in a sense of parliamentary conventions rather in the sense of international agreements&mdash;conventions unwritten, unspoken and difficult to pin down, under which you may not push a national interest beyond a certain point of unreason; if you do you will evoke such hostility from others that, if it should be a large and important country, you will find it very inconvenient in the period that follows when you come to discuss other matters in which you have an interest.</P>
    <P>Therefore, there is a constraint on the operation of national interest.  It is a constraint which varies according to the topic; it varies according to the country.  It is easier for a large country to get away with pursuing a national interest, perhaps a smallish national interest, than it is for a small country to get away with pursuing even quite a large national interest.  There is not complete equality, but all countries are constrained by the need to make the system work by the disastrous effects on all of them if it broke down. None of them therefore can pursue a national interest beyond a certain <Col N="1843" /> point.  The British Agriculture Minister discovered this in the last few weeks. He tried to get too much at the last meeting and found that that led to such resistance that, whatever his domestic opinion was, whatever his Cabinet told him he ought to try and get, it was simply not possible to improve significantly on the package he had achieved.  He had gone as far as anybody was going to allow him to go.</P>
    <P>These constraints are there, and they are unseen and unhighlighted.  They are not things that people generally are conscious of, but it is the operation of these constraints that prevents the pursuit of national self-interest from breaking down the Community.  What is striking about the Community is that, despite the strains imposed by a period of economic difficulties and the problems, on top of that, of adjusting to a large Community, the Community has come through these years battered, not in terribly good shape but still alive and going strong and without any diminution in its achievements obtained before this difficult period.  What was called the <i>acquis communantaire</i> has been maintained.  There has not been a growth of protectionism.  Despite all the pressures, free trade has been maintained with only very minor deviations in exceptional cases within the Community, and the Community is basically unaffected at its roots by all that has happened in this period.</P>
    <P>At the same time I would not diminish the failures of the Community in this period.  It is important that we should be conscious of them. They are failures at several levels.  They are not fatal failures.  They have not undermined the Community, but they have certainly prevented it from making progress which all had expected and many had hoped.</P>
    <P>The economic setback deriving from the oil crisis has had a bad effect here. It has brought out the innate nationalism of countries more strongly than perhaps otherwise would have been the case.  For example, when the oil embargo was imposed, there was a notable lack of solidarity among member states at that time.  Countries, instead of realising that only by joining together could they effectively <Col N="1844" /> protect themselves from the effects of the oil embargo, selfishly pursued their own interests and only afterwards, on reflecting, realised that that had perhaps been a mistake.</P>
    <P>Moreover, the fact that one of the three new member states is one which still thinks as a post-imperial nation state, and which has not psychologically accepted the idea of being part of the Community, has certainly made more difficult progress towards some of the Community's objectives.  Within the Community one country, France, has always, since the time the Community started in 1958, been very conscious of its national interest and concerned to protect its national sovereignty, and has been throughout this period unenthusiastic about a significant further evolution towards a political integration or even towards much further economic integration.  The hesitations of that country are in some way reinforced by the fact that it has another member state which, with a somewhat similar history of trying to adjust to the period after the end of empire, has found it difficult to accept psychologically all the implications of Community membership. France as a continental country, as a founder member longer in the Community, has less difficulty in accepting the disciplines of the Community as a whole as it is than Britain, but those countries tend to think in terms more of their interests of a nation state, and both have difficulty in realising how much their own interest could in the longer run be better served were they really to pool all their resources with other member countries and to operate genuinely as a Community.</P>
    <P>There is also the complicating factor that the long historic rivalry between Britain and France is by no means entirely dead.  While both of them tend to pursue rather more national policies than the other member states, that does not mean that they are doing so in harmony or in parallel; occasionally they do so in opposite directions, which complicates the job of the Community in trying to reach agreement on policies.</P>
    <P>Our interest in this country lies in strengthening the institutions of the Community with all their defects.  This <Col N="1845" /> has been a consistent Irish position, respected even by those who take a different viewpoint&mdash;for example, I think, by France.  Our calculation here is compounded of interest and idealism. I think the idea of working a united Europe is one which commands among many people in Ireland consent and in some instances enthusiasm. We see it as others do, as a longish process.  Were it to move too rapidly ahead we, like others, would find this uncomfortable at times.  We see the future as lying in a closer political and economic intergration of the Community countries, now perhaps to be further enlarged.  Within such a Community moving towards greater integration we are anxious that the institutional structure shall be capable of operating effectively, so that decisions are taken instead of being indefinitely postponed.  There also should be a system which will safeguard the genuine interests of member countries, and above all of the smaller and weaker member countries.  It has been the experience of those who have been in the Community much longer than we, Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg that their interests as smaller smaller countries are best preserved against possible encroachments by larger neighbours through the use of the institutional structure of the Community and above all through the role of the Commission with their exclusive right of initiative.  There are times when we could be forgiven for being a little sceptical about this because inevitably from time to time the Commission use the power of initiative in a manner unsatisfactory to a particular country.  On several occasions they have used it in a manner certainly unsatisfactory to us.  That was true of their original policy proposals for distribution of the regional fund between countries.  It has been true of their initial proposals.  Is the Deputy shaking his head.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>We amended in negotiation.  We succeeded in getting our share increased by two-thirds from four to six and a fraction per cent. The regional proposal of the Commission for the division of the fund gave too much weight to Britian and France for reasons that seem to us not to be solidly founded in logic and that Commission initiative initially was one with which we were unhappy.</P>
      <P>Finally, on fisheries, the Commission's proposals last September are not satisfactory to us and we require that they be amended to take account of the need in our case for a coastal band.  While in general the right of the Commission is important to protect the interests of the smaller countries, and while in the long run it is by protecting this right and preventing it from being eroded that our interests will be best served, but this does not mean that every initiative of the Commission suits us and at times the Commission may take a wrong turning. But overall it is a Community in which a body such as the Commission with a measure of independence plays the important role of taking the initiative in the first instance.  It is in such a Community that our interests will be best protected.  One should not over-estimate the extent to which the sheer weight of numbers and economic power of larger countries could overshadow the interests of smaller ones in a Community of this kind were there not institutional structures to protect us.  Anything which would weaken the Commission would, we believe, to be our disadvantage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have seen recently an example of how our interests could be adversely affected if the Commission's role is not respected.  There has been, as the House will know, a series of economic summits in recent years in Rambouillet and Puerto Rico and so on, and there will be one in London in about ten days' time.  The first summit was called at rather short notice.  It surprised us. We were not ready for it.  The smaller countries in the Community were not in a position to assert that their interests <Col N="1847" /> required representation of the Community as such on that occasion. However, when it became clear that another summit was about to take place we did raise the flag of battle on behalf of the interests of the smaller countries in the Community and the rights of the Commission.  Our assertion of our rights, while it did not produce immediate results, established a very firm position upon which we built when the third summit became a possibility. Consequently in Rome at the last European Council meeting some weeks ago the five smaller countries, united in protection of their interests and those of the Community, insisted that the Community be present as such at the London economic summit.  Despite the fact that there were objections to this, this principle was conceded in relation to those matters which involved Community competences which was precisely what we were concerned about.  Since then there has been further difficulty about representation of the Community through the Commission at a preparatory meeting of the economic summit.  That battle has also been fought and won and the Commission has been represented at the relevant preparatory meeting.</P>
    <P>I regard this issue as important intrinsically, because it is simply not acceptable that at these economic meeting some members of the Community will be present and others not, and that there would be no representation of the Community and the interests of the other countries through the presence of the Commission as well as through the President of the Council of Ministers in his capacity as such. He can also speak in his own right should he happen to be the head of Government of one of the larger countries.</P>
    <P>Moreover, what has been achieved at Rome and since is important because it represents the first step in halting a process of gradual, not very evident erosion of the Community system that has tended to go on in recent years. We have fought a battle where we have lost a number of skirmishes and where some of us have become somewhat pessimistic as to whether it was possible to assert the Community's rights <Col N="1848" /> successfully if a big power or big powers wished otherwise.  Rome showed that it is possible and that if the five smaller countries are united to protect their interests they can achieve an important result.  What has happened there has given heart to us all and it is seen as something of a turning point in a process of erosion of the Community which has gone on for some years past.</P>
    <P>A major issue faces us to which we will have to give attention in the period ahead.  This is the question of enlarging the Community.  It came up in the debate and Deputy O'Kennedy seemed critical of the fact that when the issue of enlargement came up in the case of Greece I raised, on behalf of our Government, some points of a general character, not about Greece but about the impact of enlargement on the Community.  I endeavoured by way of interruption then to explain part of our thinking but I was not able to explain it all.  The Chair will realise that interruption is not entirely satisfactory for conveying the full nuances of one's position.  I will come back to this point.</P>
    <P>We raised two separate issues when Greek membership came up.  One of these related to the question of the resources of the Community and their adequacy if the Community were to be enlarged.  We are concerned that an enlarged Community should have the resources necessary to undertake the activities the Community have undertaken already but in this wider context.  We accordingly raised this and we made a commitment in principle on this issue a precondition of opening negotiations for membership of a new country.  I made the point at the time that this had nothing to do with Greece as such, that far from representing an action in any way detrimental to Greece, on the contrary it was as important to Greece as it was to us that the Community would be committed to enlarging their resources <i>pro rata</i> with membership. Following the case I made, it was agreed as follows at the Council: that the consequences, in particular the financial consequences, of enlargement must not be detrimental to the common projects and policies of the <Col N="1849" /> Community or to those which it intends to carry out in the future: that enlargement must help to strengthen the Community dynamic in its aspirations and not weaken or reduce in effectiveness institutional structures and possibilities for action.  With this in view the Council are agreed that, subject to usual budgetary procedures, on Greek accession appropriate provision will be made for the needs of the enlarged Community.</P>
    <P>We were the only Government to raise this point, though others were grateful that we had raised it when they reflected on the matter.  While there was some resistance at that point to enter into any commitment on this issue before negotiations began, I made it clear that we regarded it as an essential precondition because I saw the danger that, once negotiations started and gained momentum, it would be very difficult to insist at the end on this point if we had not insisted on it in the beginning.  I make no apology for doing so and I think that the Greek Government must be grateful rather than concerned that I raised this point, because I have ensured through this not only that our interests be protected against an erosion of resources available to us but that adequate resources will be available to assist Greece in her transition to full membership.</P>
    <P>The second precondition I made was that the decision making mechanisms of the Community be improved so as to be able to operate effectively in a Community of ten, 11 or 12, because it was evident at that time, as it is now, that the Greek application would be followed by others from Portugal and Spain in particular. The question of the decision making mechanism of the Community is important and complex, and it is a question to which more thought needs to be given.  As a Community of six the process worked reasonably well, though patchily.  The clocks often had to be stopped for days on end to take difficult decisions, especially in the Council of Agricultural Ministers.  But when the Community <Col N="1850" /> was enlarged to nine countries it became difficult, because there were that many more issues on which some one country was likely to find a difficulty and the decision making process slowed down.  No doubt this was influenced by the world economic recession, but it is influenced by the sheer number of member countries as well.  At the Luxembourg compromise of 1965 France reserved its position in respect of the use of qualified majority voting where matters arose that were of French national vital interest. That qualification on the use of the qualified majority voting system gradually spread to decisions which could not possibly affect any vital national interest.  It became the rule that if a country did not like something, however unimportant, they implied that they would not be prepared to allow the matter to go ahead and that they would use a veto, even if technically the veto was never used.</P>
    <P>The effect of the Luxembourg compromise was not to limit the use of qualified majority voting to a few instances where vital national interests were involved, but to prevent it coming into operation at all.  For ten years no vote was taken in the General Council by a qualified majority.  Votes were and still are taken in the Budget Council.  The Luxembourg decision never interfered with that.  Countries which do not want to provide money for projects can be outvoted and are outvoted in the Budget Council.  The Agricultural Council have also voted on certain issues.  But in the General Council of Foreign Ministers the effect of the Luxembourg compromise was to halt all progress towards qualified majority voting, which was due to come into effect at that time under the terms of the Treaty.  No matter how small an issue a member country will dig its heels in and refuse to allow the matter to be decided.  At the Paris Summit in 1974 it was proposed that we try to get rid of this abuse, and a good resolution was passed.  But, like all good resolutions, it has not operated as fully as one would have liked. It was our duty in the presidency to put it into effect as speedily as possible and to some extent we succeeded, <Col N="1851" /> although the progress we made has not been fully sustained since.</P>
    <P>I made it clear at the first meeting that it was my intention to notify at the beginning of each Council meeting the character of each item on the agenda, whether it was something to be decided under the Treaty by unanimity, by qualified majority voting, or whether it was simply a general orientation not requiring a decision.  I got legal advice from the Council on each occasion and read out what was involved.  My initial formulation of this was challenged.  I reformulated it at the second meeting in terms which could not be challenged, and from then on I made this clear distinction at the beginning of each meeting, inviting member states to say in respect of those matters subject to qualified majority voting whether they had a vital national interest which would preclude them from permitting its use. In other words, I tried to establish a convention that the vital national interest claim would be made only in genuine cases and only by advance notice.</P>
    <P>At the last meeting in our presidency an issue arose on which agreement could not be reached because France and Germany had a different view, not on the content but on the procedure by which the matter would be settled.  I then called a qualified majority vote in which France was defeated and the decision was taken. I had a feeling that the French representative was not unhappy to be defeated because at that time France was anxious to have the decision of the Paris Summit implemented and the British Government were very keen to have this matter settled.  While the British Foreign Secretary, now the Prime Minister, had shown great dissatisfaction and worry about my proceeding in this way in the Council, he could not refuse a qualified majority vote that he was certain to win, so the principle of qualified majority voting was established in the Council. Regrettably it has not happened since, <Col N="1852" /> for reasons that are not entirely clear, but partly because we have not had many things before us that would be subject to qualified majority voting. Whether that is because of being dropped lower down the line in the administrative system I am not entirely clear.</P>
    <P>The progress we made at that time should be enlarged upon.  If we are going to get the system to work properly, we must lay down in the tightest possible terms the limits to be imposed on the use of the veto, so that it would be the norm to have qualified majority voting on issues subject to qualified majority voting and so that it would be only on a rare occasion&mdash;when a country declares with great solemnity that an issue is of vital national interest&mdash;that the qualified majority voting system will not be used.  Something of that kind must be done unless we are to have a Community of 12 in which nothing ever happens.  We will press this issue from now on.  It will come up for discussion at a private meeting of Foreign Ministers in Britain on the weekend of 21st and 22nd May.  This is not an easy matter.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that other member countries may see this differently.  There have been suggestions and hints, and the Economic Summit was perhaps an indication that others may feel that the way to take decisions more rapidly is to establish some kind of directory of a small number of countries, preferably larger countries in the Community, which would have some kind of power to take decisions over the heads of others.  We will never agree to such a destruction of the Community system as we know it today.  There is only one way forward to the taking of decisions effectively and that is by using the mechanism of qualified majority voting.</P>
