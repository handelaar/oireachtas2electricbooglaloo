    <Title>Oil Pollution of the Sea (Amendment) Bill, 1976 [Seanad]: Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick, Cavan) Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Cavan</i>): The main purposes of this Bill are : (a) to enable Ireland to become a party to the International Convention relating to Intervention on the High Seas in Cases of Oil Pollution Casualties, 1969; (b) to enable Ireland to accept certain amendments to the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution of the Sea by Oil, 1954; (c) to extend and strengthen the powers of the Minister for Transport and Power in relation to oil pollution of the sea; and (d) to resolve a jurisdictional difficulty in relation to the Oil Pollution of the Sea Acts, 1956 and 1965 and increase the penalties for offences under these Acts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The problem of oil pollution of the sea is not a new one but it has become particularly serious over the last years or so during which time the volume of oil carried by sea has increased very substantially.  In the past, oil pollution of the sea mainly occurred through the practice of <Col N="126" /> dumping oil residues from tankers at sea.  Nowadays, however, because of the vastly increased quantities of oil being carried by sea in tankers of ever-increasing size, a major threat is also posed by spillages following marine casualties.</P>
    <P>The Inter-Governmental Maritime Consultative Organisation (IMCO), of which Ireland is a member, decided to take the initiative in prompting international agreements to strengthen the hands of coastal states.  To date IMCO have adopted four conventions dealing with the problem of oil pollution.  This Bill is concerned with two of these, <i>viz.</i>,</P>
    <P>the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution of the Sea by Oil, 1954; and</P>
    <P>the International Convention relating to Intervention on the High Seas in Cases of Oil Pollution Casualties, 1969.</P>
    <P>Two further conventions&mdash;the International Convention on Civil Liability for Oil Pollution Damage, 1969, and the International Convention relating to the Establishment of an International Fund for Oil Pollution Damage, 1971&mdash;deal with civil liability in cases of oil pollution damage and provide for the setting up of an international compensation fund to meet the cost of major spillages.  Legislation to enable Ireland to ratify these latter conventions is at an advanced stage of preparation and I would hope to present it to the House for consideration later this year.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution of the Sea by Oil, 1954, which was drafted prior to the advent of the mammoth tankers, is to reduce the risk of pollution of the sea by oil discharged from ships.  The principal means adopted in 1954 was the designation of certain zones of the sea into which the discharge of oil was prohibited. Amendments to strengthen the convention were adopted by IMCO in April, 1962.  Both the convention and 1962 amendments are in force internationally, i.e., they have been adopted by the requisite number of states in respect of their own ships, and are implemented in Ireland by the Oil <Col N="127" /> Pollution of the Sea Acts, 1956 and 1965.</P>
    <P>IMCO adopted further amendments to the 1954 convention in October, 1969 and October, 1971.  The 1969 amendments will come into force internationally on 20th January, 1978. The 1971 amendments have not yet received the required number of ratifications.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the amendments adopted in 1969 is to ensure more effective control of the discharge of oil into the sea by ships.  This is done by introducing more restrictive controls and by making the whole sea, rather than certain specified sections, a prohibited area as far as unrestricted discharges are concerned. Tighter restrictions are, moreover, imposed on all discharges including, for example, discharges of ballast, in areas within 50 miles of land.</P>
    <P>The ultimate object of these amendments, as expressed in the assembly resolution adopting the amendments, is to enable significant progress to be made towards the achievement of complete avoidance of discharges.  The principal amendments adopted in October, 1971 establish requirements relating to tank arrangements and the limitation of tank sizes of tankers in order to minimise pollution of the sea by oil in the event of an accident involving a large oil tanker.</P>
    <P>A further amendment adopted in 1971 deals with the protection of the Great Barrier Reef, that great natural phenomenon of coral reefs and cays off the Australian coast.  Although the amendment is of no practical significance to us, we intend to accept it as, by doing so, we will be contributing towards its entry into force.</P>
    <P>Deputies may have difficulty in relating the foregoing to the various provisions of the Bill.  I should explain that the sections dealing with the amendments to the 1954 convention are, basically, sections 9, 12, 13 and 18.  These are couched in general terms and the actual implementation of the 1969 and 1971 amendments will be done by way of statutory orders and regulations.  For example, the 1971 amendments relating to tank sizes will <Col N="128" /> be implemented by a statutory instrument made under section 16 of the Oil Pollution of the Sea Act, 1956 as amended by section 12 of the present Bill.  This section enables me to make regulations concerning the construction and fitting of ships with a view to the prevention or reduction of oil pollution.</P>
    <P>Sections 2 to 5, inclusive, provide in detail for the implementation of the International Convention relating to Intervention on the High Seas in Cases of Oil Pollution Casualties, 1969.  This convention arose from a special international legal conference which was convened by IMCO in Brussels in 1969 in the wake of the <i>Torrey Canyon</i> incident.  IMCO accepted that there were serious deficiencies in the powers available to coastal states for dealing with shipping casualties involving large tankers and the consequential risk of major pollution of coastlines. Bearing in mind that existing maritime law embodies the principle of freedom of the seas, IMCO decided that it was essential to adopt an international agreement which would empower coastal states to take whatever action might be necessary to safeguard their coasts.  Accordingly, the intervention convention authorises a coastal state to intervene and take measures, e.g. by sinking or towing away offending vessels, to protect its coastal and other related interests whenever such a casualty occurs.  The convention stipulates the conditions under which, and the procedures through which, such measures are to be taken.  A state which took measures that went beyond what was reasonably necessary to achieve the ends stated in the convention would be obliged to pay compensation for any damage resulting from such unjustified action.  The convention also provides for the settlement of disputes which might arise from such measures.  It is intended that Ireland will ratify the convention, which came into force internationally on 6th May, 1975, as soon as possible after this Bill becomes law.</P>
    <P>I trust that Deputies will appreciate that, while the powers conferred on me by section 2 of the Bill are, on first glance, virtually without limit, there <Col N="129" /> are two effective controls on the exercise of such powers.  Firstly, they may only be used in cases where there is grave and imminent danger of major harmful consequences arising from a maritime casualty involving oil pollution. Secondly, section 3 of the Bill provides recourse to the courts for compensation for any person who establishes that any action taken under the Bill was unreasonably severe or unnecessary.  I consider that these are adequate safeguards and I feel that I reflect the wishes of the House when I say that I sincerely hope that the circumstances which would make it necessary for me to act under section 2 will never arise.</P>
    <P>I should, of course, point out that the convention relates only to intervention in cases on the high seas.  As it is within the competence of Governments to enact legislation in regard to intervention within their territories without the sanction of an international agreement, the convention did not concern itself with territorial waters.  The Bill is structured so that it will be possible to apply its provisions to Irish ships and to Irish territorial waters in advance of applying such provisions to foreign ships outside territorial waters.</P>
    <P>Section 7 of the Bill, dealing with the place of commission of an oil pollution offence, is designed to remedy a defect which has been discovered in the Oil Pollution Acts.  Briefly, the problem is that, while the 1956 and 1965 Acts clearly created the offence of polluting the sea by oil, they did not, it has recently emerged, confer jurisdiction on any court to try such offences.  The areas of jurisdiction of the District Courts are fixed by reference to the district electoral divisions, and do not, therefore, extend to our territorial waters.  As summary proceedings are dealt with at District Court level and proceedings on indictment are initiated at that level, it is clear that, as the Acts stand, no future proceedings could be initiated for offences under them.  Section 7 remedies this defect in a manner which is used in many other instances, e.g. fisheries protection and air hijackings.</P>
    <P>Finally, the present Bill extends and <Col N="130" /> updates the provisions of the 1956 and 1965 Oil Pollution of the Sea Acts.  It grants additional powers to oil pollution inspectors, the most important being that such inspectors will, in future, be empowered to take samples of oil from any ship.  This will assist in the sometimes difficult task of assigning responsibility for a particular spillage.  A further important strengthening of the law is effected by section 6 of the Bill which provides powers to detain vessels which are suspected of being in breach of the Acts.  As regards offences under the Oil Pollution of the Sea Acts, it will be seen that the Bill provides for substantial increases in the penalties for such offences.  During the passage of the Bill through the Seanad, I undertook to look again at the penalties provided in the Bill for summary offences with a view to increasing these where possible.  Deputies will appreciate that there are Constitutional constraints on the size of the penalties which may be provided for summary convictions.  I am advised that, at the moment, the maximum permissible penalty for a summary conviction is £500 or 12 months' imprisonment or both.  I have, therefore, submitted a number of amendments, for consideration on Committee Stage, to make this maximum the standard penalty throughout the Bill for summary offences.</P>
    <P>To summarise, therefore, this Bill will enable Ireland to ratify and implement the latest internationally accepted law on the subject of oil pollution offences.  The Bill recognises the fact that although Ireland is an island, we do not live in isolation.  Our interest lies in full support of international measures to prevent pollution.  It is only fair to emphasise here that Irish shipowners in general have an excellent record in this field and, indeed, I am satisfied that foreign ships calling at Irish ports also have due regard for the desirability of keeping our seas free from pollution.  This Bill and the 1956 and 1965 Acts provide adequate controls and, where necessary, deterrents in the form of fines and possible imprisonment.  As such I hope that the shipowners' and the general public's <Col N="131" /> awareness of the potential seriousness of the problem of oil pollution will be heightened and that we may thus move nearer to the goal of a cleaner marine environment.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett </NameTxt>
      <P>We welcome the introduction of this Bill and we would think it might have been the occasion for introducing also ratification of the two further conventions which the Minister mentioned, namely the International Convention on Civil Liability for Oil Pollution and the International Fund for Oil Pollution Damage on which he has said he will introduce the necessary legislation in the fairly near future.  I agree that our interest lies in the full support of international measures to prevent pollution but we would like to ask what facilities will exist to enable the Minister to implement the powers that he will now have under this Bill when passed by the House.</P>
      <P>I understand that there are approximately 85 million tons of oil products passing between ourselves and Britain each year.  By any standard this is a sizeable quantity of oil products passing near our coasts and we need to think seriously about what the Minister will be able to do to implement the powers given to him under the Bill.  These tankers range in size from 20,000 tons to 500,000 tons and this has to be taken into consideration. The Minister might elaborate when replying on how he intends to tackle this problem.  This might be an occasion on which to give serious consideration to establishing some form of coastguard service.  It is something that will have to be considered eventually.  The policing problems involved with any arrangement for the maintenance of fishery stocks will streth the Naval Service to the full. It is, therefore, extremely doubtful if the Naval Service will be able to assist the Minister in any way with regard to implementing the powers granted to him under this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another matter that should be considered is the increased activity in the exploration for oil off our coasts.  This <Col N="132" /> activity would suggest greater co-ordination between the State operated coastal services and shore agencies.  It is doubtful if our Naval Service would be the ideal unit for looking after this aspect of the matter.  The production of oil off the coast, and we all hope oil will be produced, does not seem to be covered.  We would like to know what exactly is covered by the word &ldquo;ship&rdquo; which is used throughout the Bill.  Does it cover drilling rigs and oil platforms, whether static or mobile? Does it cover production platforms, fixed or floating?  This is something that should be clarified, something that should be covered in the Bill if not already covered under the word &ldquo;ship&rdquo;.  Perhaps the Minister would elaborate on this.</P>
    <P>There are many types of structures that might require to be dealt with in the same way as the conventional &ldquo;ship&rdquo;.  Oil using or oil carrying vessels should automatically, in the context of this Bill, be covered.  Does the Minister think he has sufficient powers with regard to jurisdiction over oil carrying pipelines which we may very well have in the not too distant future?  This is something that should be spelled out specifically in the Bill. Would the Minister have power to deal with spillages which might occur &mdash;we hope they will not&mdash;from such pipelines?  There was an incident off the coast of California not very long ago involving production platforms and the American navy had to be called out to deal with the matter. While we are all proud of our own Naval Service it may not be equipped to deal with a major oil spillage. Perhaps the Minister would clarify the position.</P>
    <P>Could this Bill be used to permit an Irish Minister to deal with vessels carrying other types of noxious materials, such as nuclear waste and chemical effluents of all types?  These are capable of having very serious effects on the environment.  The Bill would seem to be somewhat narrow but that does not mean we do not welcome it.  We would have liked it to be somewhat wider from the point of view of the powers conferred on the Minister.  Remembering the small <Col N="133" /> percentage of tonnage directly attributable to this nation there should be some method of obtaining international assistance towards defraying the cost of coastal surveillance through the medium of some convention to which we subscribe.  We are entitled to be prepared properly for any eventuality which might be deleterious to the environment and the cost should not have to be borne by either the taxpayer or the ratepayer.  Will the Minister make representations or ensure that representations are made for financial assistance to defray the cost of surveillance and for the training of suitable personnel?  We would be entitled to such assistance through the medium of some convention to which we subscribe.  If the word &ldquo;ship&rdquo; does not cover what I have suggested it should cover then, perhaps, we should consider amending the section.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan </NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill and I hope it will, as Deputy Barrett said, include more safeguards.  I know the effect an oil spillage can have on a major tourist area such as I represent. I know the millions that can be lost in the tourist season because of such a spillage.  I would hope the Bill would go winder than it does.  Would it be possible to ensure that these oil tankers carry some sort of material to deal with an oil spillage in the initial stages?  There should be some international agreement in that respect.  We are optimistic about an oil strike off the west coast.  People who come in may benefit but, for example, if a gusher does not operate in the right way the consequences may be catastrophic for a tourist area.  On the west coast we are very anxious to see that all the necessary safeguards are provided. This is also important from the point of view of fish life.  The major oil tankers carry huge quantities of oil and surely they can arrange to have adequate first-aid equipment.  Many of the people concerned are in the business for the fast &ldquo;buck&rdquo; and they should be able to provide their own safeguards.  I welcome this Bill.  I hope it will provide safeguards for our shores.  I am conscious of the need for <Col N="134" /> such safeguards, particularly in my constituency which is a tourist area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy </NameTxt>
      <P>All of us welcome the Bill but, at the same time, some of us have queries to ask, if not on this Stage then on Committee Stage.  In so far as this Bill is giving effect to the convention of 1969 regarding oil pollution, the question must be asked why we are only now introducing this legislation.  Perhaps for once the blame can be attributed to both sides; there was a three-year delay on the part of the previous Administration and there has been three or four years delay on the part of the present Government.  If this Bill is to protect our shores against oil pollution from vessels within our territorial waters, it would have been desirable to introduce it long before now.</P>
      <P>To the extent that the powers of this Bill will help to protect our shores, our economy and our environment against oil spillages, accidental or otherwise&mdash;and many of them are not accidental&mdash;we must ask the question: what great sense of urgency exists here?  We have not introduced any effective legislation in the past seven years.  In 1956 and in 1965 legislation was passed in connection with this matter but the powers of the Minister under this Bill, not simply amendments of the previous Acts, are significant powers.  In section 6 there is power to detain a vessel and this does not seem to be merely an extension of the powers of the previous Acts.  The other significant powers in relation to penalties and compensation are matters that should have been dealt with before now.  It is an indictment of all of us that this was not done.  I would be glad if the Minister would tell me it is not quite like that but I do not think that is the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have not been as conscious of environmental protection as have other countries.  The fact that we have not a separate spokesman in the Government for the environment&mdash;a matter I raised on a number of occasions&mdash;is evidence of the lack of concern on the part of the Government.  Significantly, we are possibly the only country in Europe that has not a separate Ministry <Col N="135" /> to deal with the environment.  In this country the Minister for Transport and Power deals with this matter.  We are glad that somebody has the job but, after all, the function of that Minister is to promote transport and power and he has a wide range of responsibilities. He has to deal with organisations such as CIE, the ESB, Bord Fáilte and others but we assume that the environment is another responsibility we can give to him because it has something to do with oil.  What we are talking about is not oil used for energy purposes. This matter relates to protection against oil spillage and it is not something that would normally come within the functions of a Minister for Transport and Power.  I am not attaching any blame to the present Minister&mdash;far from it.  He is doing the job that nobody else is there to do.  However, it underlines the point I have made more than once, namely, that it is time for the Government to reflect in their personnel and constitution their thinking on the protection of the environment. So far that has not been done.</P>
    <P>When the Taoiseach came to office nearly four years ago some of us had hopes that something would be done about this matter because in his first speech he said that the appointment of new Ministers of State would be contemplated. However, four years later nothing has been done.  The public are very concerned about the environment and particularly about any damage that may be caused to our coastline as a result of actions of other countries. The introduction of this Bill highlights the present need for action in this area and perhaps future determination but it also pinpoints past carelessness on our part.  In this context I mean carelessness on the part of all of us&mdash;I am not making a party political point. The matter needs more effective measures than are proposed in this Bill.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barrett raised a few significant points.  He wanted to know if the Bill covered pipelines and all the other sources of transmission.  Does it include chemical waste and all the other things that are major causes of pollution? On the face of it, there is no <Col N="136" /> evidence that the Bill covers all those factors.</P>
    <P>This Bill is introduced at a time when the Conference on the International Law of the Sea is in session. As many of us know, that conference has adopted a new concept in its single negotiating text, namely, the concept of the 200-mile economic zone.  Many of us, and particularly Deputy Gallagher, are aware of what that means in relation to fisheries in terms of conservation and the right to coastal bands.  We are aware that the economic zone concept extends to coastal states, to maximise the development potential of such states and the surrounding waters.  Incidentally, I am awaiting a copy of the single negotiating text from the Library; apparently it is rather difficult to come by.  However, I recall from reading it previously that it also relates to protection against pollution and this is quite understandable.  Coastal states have suffered considerably from pollution caused by ships of other countries and this has not been limited to pollution caused within territorial waters.</P>
    <P>With regard to this Bill, the powers conferred on the Minister relate to powers to deal with damage or spillage within territorial waters, namely, up to 12 miles.  However, that is not the end of it.  I do not know what powers this Bill purports to give to spillages that have been effected outside of 12 miles within the economic zone of 200 miles.  This is where the new development is occurring.  If the economic zone concept is as is defined in the single negotiating text of the law of the sea, relating to fisheries and all kinds of exploration rights and to pollution and pollution control I want to know where are the powers in this Bill to deal with that outside of territorial waters and within the economic zone?</P>
    <P>It is important to note that one of the reasons for the development of the economic zone concept since 1972 &mdash;I have to keep stressing that for those who seem to think that it was in existence when we joined the European Community&mdash;by the coastal states, particularly of South American <Col N="137" /> and subsequently of North America and Europe, was to protect their environment. They made the point, from the very start, that whatever may be the level of agreement on their right to explore out to 50 miles or 200 miles or their right to exclusive fisheries out to 50 or 200 miles one thing on which there could not be a compromise, generally, was their right to protect their shores within 200 miles by spillages caused, accidentally or otherwise, by ships passing through those waters.  They may be high seas in one sense but to the extent that the new concept has brought the 200-mile zone within the control of the coastal state I hope the Minister can explain to me to what extent does he have power under this legislation to deal with spillages outside 12 miles, that is between 12 miles and 200 miles, within the economic zone area, which can some time later damage our coastline in more ways than one.  I do not see any powers in this Bill in relation to that.  I hope there are.  I certainly do not see the same powers in it as relate to the powers conferred on the Minister in relation to territorial waters. Perhaps if I get the single negotiating text before I conclude I might be able to illustrate precisely what my concern has been.</P>
    <P>The other point I want to refer to is the whole question of patrol.  We are at a stage when powers conferred by this House, even in furtherance of international conventions, are of little consequence unless we have the capacity to implement them.  The capacity in this case will obviously relate to the right to detain a vessel even within the territorial waters.  That obviously involves a very much increased naval patrol service, over and above what we have at the moment. All of this highlights, as Deputy Barrett mentioned, the need to strengthen our position in regard to patrol generally.  Obviously, with proper patrol facilities, we will not confine their activities just to pollution patrol.  They will also be concerned with fisheries patrol and all the other elements of it which are so vital to us. That is something which may not be quite as complex, as far as this Bill is <Col N="138" /> concerned, as it would be for fishery infringement.  So far as we are talking about the powers this State will have to detain vessels and arrest them for certain offences designated under the Act, it is obviously important that the powers which will be required will be capable of being implemented.</P>
    <P>I suggest it is pretty obvious at the moment that we are not in that position. It is less than effective that we should introduce legislation, which everybody welcomes, without being in a position to guarantee that we can effectively implement it to protect our own position.  One of the significant things about pollution of the seas, as pointed out by Deputy Barrett, is that generally, as far as we are concerned as an island state, the resources of the seas within our territorial waters and even, as we have been arguing here for a considerable time, within a significant band of the economic zone, belong to the coastal state.  That has now become an internationally accepted principle.  On the other hand, the damage that can be done to those resources, particularly fishery resources and all other forms of sea and marine life, will be done by other states, whose boats either pass through those waters or outside them and cause the damage.  That is particularly so in a case like ours where we have a relatively undeveloped nation that, frankly, does not have a large fleet, whether a fishing fleet, merchant navy or anything else to compare with the major fleets of other nations which pass near or around our shores.</P>
    <P>It is vitally important that we have the necessary powers to ensure that our resources are protected against the acts of other nations, accidentally or otherwise, of oil pollution or of pollution from other sources, chemical or otherwise.  One always works on the basis that there is an international consensus to prevent such damage and this is why this convention is being introduced but we want to ensure that that convention will be made effective. To the extent that it is not, we will be the losers and not necessarily the polluting states.  If the international conventions are concerned to ensure effective action against such damage <Col N="139" /> we should ask to what extent are they prepared financially to support the coastal states in enabling them to have effective patrolling of their coasts and of their waters either to conserve fisheries or otherwise against any pollution of the type we are referring to in this Bill.</P>
    <P>It is a matter, in the first instance, of national concern but it is also a matter of international concern.  To the extent that the national coastal state will have the bigger obligation and obviously the bigger financial burden it is only reasonable to expect that the international conventions would also provide for some financial assistance for them.  The Minister said :</P>
    <P>I should, of course, point out that the convention only relates to intervention in cases on the high seas.</P>
    <P>To what extent of the high seas are we talking about?  How far out are we going?</P>

      <P>Section 5 states that the Government may apply :</P>
      <P>the provisions of section 2 of this Act to ships to which the Convention of 1969 applies when such ships are outside the territorial seas of the State.</P>
      <P>Section 2 gives the power to give directions to prevent, mitigate or eliminate the effects of oil pollution.  Section 2 does not give power to detain vessels. Section 6 gives that power.  Section 6 says :</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Whenever the Minister or a harbour master has reasonable cause to believe that a vessel is in breach of the Act of 1956, the Act of 1965, or of this Act, and the vessel is within <Col N="140" /> the territorial seas of the State, the Minister, or the harbour master concerned, may halt and detain the vessel.</P>
    <P>It seems to limit the detention powers of the Minister to a vessel within the territorial waters.  Section 2 obviously applies to the right of the Minister to give directions to prevent or mitigate oil pollution, but it does not seem to give powers of detention.  I would be glad if the Minister would clarify this point.  How far out in the high seas do the powers we are now conferring on the Minister apply?</P>
    <P>The Minister said:</P>
    <P>As it is within the competence of Governments to enact legislation in regard to intervention within their territories without the sanction of an international agreement, the convention did not concern itself with territorial waters.</P>
    <P>Since 1969 the whole concept of territorial waters has been changed, if not made anachronistic by the International Law of the Sea Conference which no longer talks in terms of territorial waters but in terms of economic zones and confers within the 200-mile economic zone powers on coastal states which hitherto they could only exercise within territorial waters.  I am concerned as to what our position is between the territorial waters and the 200-mile economic zone.  The Minister's script referred to the single negotiating text of the law of the sea. This should be clarified.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.  It is somewhat belated, perhaps, and the wrong Minister is in the House in relation to it.  A Minister for Transport and Power is not necessarily a Minister against pollution.  The man who should be dealing with this is a Minister for the Environment, but if he does not exist, we will have to put up with it. I would like clarification in relation to our powers of control.  To what extent does this apply outside our territorial waters?  It appears that there are matters which need to be discussed in some detail on Committee Stage and I hope we will have the opportunity of doing so.</P>

      <P>Obviously a Bill of this nature is welcomed in the House. I am glad the Opposition have welcomed the Bill.  The importance of preserving and conserving the natural amenities of our coastline and the cleanliness of the seas around us is obvious.  The terrible damage that can be wrought by modern-day tankers has been brought home to us quite clearly. Not only the sinking of these tankers, but the accidental release of huge quantities of oil can do terrible damage to a coastline.  So far we have been relatively lucky; we have had minor incidents but no major incident of pollution on our coast.  It is a fair reflection on the attitude of our harbour boards and the Department involved that there is a monitoring system in relation to the spotting of vast oil slicks which we hear about. The monitoring system used in seeking out large oil slicks could be strengthened within our own territorial waters.  The Air Corps and the Naval Service should always be very alert in looking for oil slicks in our territorial waters.  If they are found in time action can be taken to dissolve or contain such slicks.  We should increase our air patrols in this respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Within the territorial waters we have full jurisdiction, although the Minister mentioned that the State is confined in relation to summary convictions, where at the moment the maximum penalty is £500, or 12 months' imprisonment or both.  Obviously such a penalty is ludicrous.  I am glad a number of amendments will be considered on Committee Stage in relation to a standard penalty for summary offences.  Far more severe penalties should be enforced where a conviction is obtained in relation to pollution of our coasts. Compensation which would be forthcoming should be spoken of not in hundreds of pounds but in tens of thousands of pounds.  This is a real problem which is difficult to resolve, constitutionally and legally, but it must be tackled and resolved.  We have legal jurisdiction over our territorial waters. Is the recently declared 200-mile economic zone territorial waters within the meaning of this Bill?  Is it reckoned as territorial waters under the complete <Col N="142" /> jurisdiction of the Government, or is it termed as high seas within the meaning of the Act, for the purpose of various conventions to which we are signatories?  I hope that the 200-mile economic zone for the purpose of this Bill is reckoned as territorial waters, because it would give us greater powers in relation to detaining and towing away vessels, or taking reasonable action to preserve our coastline.  I look forward to having clarification of this matter.</P>
    <P>The Inter-Governmental Maritime Consultative Organisation is an organisation of which we hear very little; yet it has concluded four conventions and some agreements which are of vital interest to this nation.  We already have legislation covering the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution of the Sea by Oil, 1954 and the International Convention relating to Intervention on the High Seas in Cases of Oil Pollution Casualties, 1969.  Both of these conventions are already covered by law within the State, and I look forward to legislation coming forth as soon as possible to cover the other two conventions, the International Convention on Civil Liability for Oil Pollution Damage, 1969, and the International Convention relating to the Establishment of an International Fund for Oil Pollution Damage, 1971.</P>
    <P>It is important that these conventions have teeth and that an offending signatory nation should be brought to court and whatever compensation is necessary be extracted from such nation.  It is of vital interest to us, especially when we are dealing with matters on the high seas over which we have little control, over which it is very difficult even to establish the culpits, that the penalty for polluting the high seas should be severe.  The International Law of the Sea Conference is having great difficulty in dealing with the law of the high seas.  It is a conference which seems to be going nowhere fast.  It is revealing to me, may I say in passing, to know that the European Economic Community have been making progress in relation to conservation of fish stocks around the western coasts <Col N="143" /> of Europe.  It is not an easy task. There are many interests involved, and we know only too well that Irish interests differ from those of other European states.  We are far more concerned about the conservation of fish stocks than, say, the Germans or the French.  We have our own resources and we wish to keep them; yet we must work within the framework of the EEC Treaty of Accession and within the Treaty of Rome.  I digress, but I digress merely to show that it is not easy to deal with international matters affecting different nations in different ways.</P>
    <P>In relation to these specific conventions here, there should be an annual report to Parliament on their effectiveness. It is all right to be a signatory to a convention, but although we are members of the Inter-Governmental Maritime Consultative Organisation, I do not know who represents Ireland. No doubt, it is an expert from the Department, but we are a Parliament elected democratically.  The word &ldquo;assembly&rdquo; has been mentioned here, so I take it there is an assembly in which conventions and amendments to them are debated.  Members of Parliament should be involved in the drawing up of such conventions.</P>
    <P>If I may digress slightly again.  I would say that apart from Premiers and Foreign Ministers, I am not aware of any Member of this Parliament who has gone to the United Nations General Assembly to contribute to a debate.  It seems peculiar to me that in relation to such international institutions there should be no parliamentary representation.  I understand that under the governing treaties either a Member of Parliament or a civil servant may represent the country.  We as parliamentarians should be more involved in international discussions, in the framing of conventions, in matters affecting us, say, at the United Nations.</P>
    <P>Here are four conventions which vitally affect us in Ireland.  I wonder how many Members in this House have ever read the conventions, have ever contributed to their evolvement <Col N="144" /> or are even aware of the distinction between our legal powers in territorial waters, in the economic zone and on the high seas.  This may be looked on as a technical matter, but to me it is of high democratic principle that Members of Parliament should be deeply involved in these matters.</P>
    <P>After the <i>Torrey Canyon</i> incident the IMCO became aware of the serious deficiencies in the powers available to coastal states for dealing with shipping casualties involving large tankers and the consequential risk of major pollution of coastlines.  It is only eight years since the problem really came home to us.  It was after that incident that the International Convention authorised coastal states to intervene and take certain measures.  This was a step forward.  I think the House will feel that even greater powers should be given to signatory states.  However, a question I want to put is this : if the vessel which causes the pollution is not a flagship of a state which is a signatory to one of these conventions, what right has a coastal state such as Ireland in respect of that ship or in respect of getting compensation for the damage done to the coastline and to the territorial waters by the offending ship?  The countries of eastern Europe are not signatories to the convention. Where do we stand in relation to them?  Where do we get compensation? To whom do we turn to prosecute?</P>
    <P>These are questions which I would like to see answered, not from the point of view of politics&mdash;I do not think politics enters into this&mdash;but from the point of view of law, of the conservation of our legal rights in respect of our coastline and seas.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.  I look forward to another being introduced soon in respect of the two remaining conventions, the 1969 on Civil Liability and the 1971 on the Establishment of an International Fund.  It appears to be such a recent development that the problem encountered is a new one. Certainly, it has assumed international importance in recent years.  It is important that we keep our legislation up to date.  It is important also that our civil servants, working within the <Col N="145" /> framework of the Inter-Governmental Maritime and Consultative Organisation, be aware of the problems as they emerge and affect us.  We should be ever vigilant in ensuring that whatever steps may be necessary are taken to protect our interests and environment. Environment is something very precious.  For instance, under this Bill and a number of conventions, we can only be compensated for oil pollution of our coast.  But what about the great damage done to our sea stocks by a massive oil spillage?  One must remember what terrible damage has been done even by controlled oil discharges.</P>
    <P>I wonder is it now opportune for the EEC to set up a research institute to look into all of these matters affecting the seas around Europe, the effects of over-fishing, of fishing with small nets and with suction equipment which kills off the spawn, the basis of future stocks.  Such a research institute might examine the damage done by oil leaks and spillages to the coastlines, to the life and environment of western Europe.  These may appear to be very vague problems but they are very real, indeed, to anybody interested in the question of environment. I should like to see parliamentarians in general more involved in discussions and so on in relation to this matter.  Unfortunately, too often in this House, we seem to be involved in local politics and our own constituencies, perhaps to the exclusion of such matters.  Obviously, our own constituencies are of vital importance to us but, perhaps, too often we play on some party point affecting them while other matters of vital importance&mdash;such as those pertaining to environment&mdash;remain undiscussed in the House.  The question of oil pollution of the sea is a typical subject this Parliament does not discuss sufficiently.  Let us hope that some farseeing Minister will evolve a system not only in relation to these conventions, but many others also, of making an annual report to parliament.  An annual debate on the subject would keep us informed of what is happening in this sphere.</P>
    <P>I look forward to further Bills <Col N="146" /> which will ensure that our interests are always fully protected in relation to our territorial waters and the high seas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, welcome this Bill.  This is an area in which effective measures were necessary.  However, introducing legislation is one thing but its implementation is quite a different matter.  I can foresee that we will have a considerable task implementing the necessary provisions when this legislation is passed.</P>
      <P>My colleagues, Deputies Barrett and O'Kennedy mentioned the question of a coastguard service and suggested that, in the implementation of this Bill, we might take a new look at this question and possibly have some tie-up with the naval and fishery protection services.  I agree that it is time we did so and, perhaps, examined what has been happening in America and Norway where coastguard services are provided on a completely different basis from what we seem to have thought was the only possible one.  We are inclined to consider a Naval Service only.  We think always in terms of a navy rather than a localisation of the services.  Such could be done by providing smaller boats, with more of them distributed around our coast, in that way ensuring a more effective service than obtains at present.  The question of funding such a service would be considerable.  Perhaps the Minister would inform us if any international bodies have suggested any means of assisting member states in the funding of the provision of boats and other equipment necessary to make this legislation effective.  One might ask also: what part do the oil companies or shipping magnates play in the provision of an international fund in which they could play their part in assisting states affected by oil spillages? It is well known that they reap huge profits.  Therefore, it is quite reasonable to ask that they make some contribution towards such a fund to be used in the event of any serious oil spillage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister if any survey has been carried out on what it might cost us to provide the <Col N="147" /> boats, the materials and the training of personnel for this kind of work.  I am sure the figure would be quite considerable. All this will have to be considered in the light of the new legislation now before us.  We all realise the serious consequences an oil spillage can have on fish life.  We were horrified at what happened in the Bantry area some years ago when the livelihood of fishermen was endangered.  Any measures taken to try to prevent an occurrence of that kind are very welcome and should have the support of everybody.  One shudders to think what might happen if a tourist area were affected by an oil spillage.</P>
    <P>This whole question suggests something we are not dealing with in this Bill but when we consider oil drilling and the possibility of oil being brought into our coast in the not too distant future, we hope, we also have to consider the possibility of having an overall plan to designate areas for harbour development, to designate oil areas, and tourist areas, and fishing areas.  I do not know whether this would come within the Minister's field or the field of the Minister for Local Government, but it highlights the need to have some kind of overall plan for coastal development.  I would ask the Minister and the Government to give serious consideration to this matter.  It should be looked at fairly urgently.  It has to be dealt with fairly quickly.</P>
    <P>It strikes me that the penalties mentioned in the Bill do not seem to be adequate.  They should be far more severe.  In the light of the experience we had off our coast it would seem some of the trouble was caused by carelessness.  It is hard to understand why, when oil was being taken from a ship to a refinery, we should have suffered damage to the extent we witnessed in the south at that time.  If we had very drastic and very severe penalties they would ensure there would not be the type of carelessness there was on that occasion.</P>
    <P>Those are a few of my ideas on this Bill.  We on this side of the House welcome it.  It will not be too easy to implement this legislation.  I sincerely hope the Minister has studied that <Col N="148" /> aspect carefully and that we will have a follow-up in the provision of the services which will be necessary to make the legislation effective.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancisTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill has been welcomed particularly by people in our maritime counties, by people who reside in tourist areas, and by people who live in a county like Clare which is practically surrounded by the Atlantic and the Shannon and where oil pollution has caused some concern. This Bill makes adequate provision to extend the Minister's powers in relation to oil pollution of the sea and to increase penalties for offences. The most important reference made by the Minister was his reference to the regulations concerning the construction and fitting of ships with a view to the prevention of oil pollution. Taking precautions is a sensible approach because if you do not take adequate precautions you cannot have a very effective remedy.</P>
      <P>Because of the increase in the use of oil over the past 20 years, the risks of spillages and of pollution have increased. Dumping of residues from tankers at sea has caused much concern particularly to our fishermen. Recently many methods of mopping up oil slicks have been successfully introduced.  Strangely enough, some of the new methods have not been utilised effectively for some reason or other. There are methods of controlling and encircling oil slicks which have not been explored effectively.  The method of using an inflated boom or raft which encircles the slick is much more effective than the use of detergents which seriously affect our fish life. Thank goodness spillages are few and far between around our coast.  The risks have increased because of the increased use of oil.  This legislation to give some authority to the Minister is absolutely necessary.  The Inter-Governmental Maritime Consultative Organisation, of which we are a member, have taken the initiative in the promotion of international agreements to put teeth into or to strengthen the legislation of coastal states.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill is absolutely vital.  People who depend on tourism will also appreciate that they will now have <Col N="149" /> less to worry about.  Previously they were very uneasy about the precautions taken to control oil pollution of the sea.  They were conscious of the fact that there was the danger of an oil slick destroying our beaches during the holiday season.  In other areas we found a great deal of concern about the establishment of industries which dealt with oil storage, oil refining or the unloading or refining of oil.  Panic had been created by people who were misinformed about the methods of controlling pollution.  This discouraged the promotion of industries in areas where industry was vital.</P>
    <P>This Bill will give the Minister authority to introduce the statutory orders and regulations which are vital if we are to have effective control. This control is internationally acceptted. I hope it will not be necessary for us to have recourse to our courts. At the moment they do not seem to have adequate powers to deal with this type of problem.  If this Bill is accepted by all Members, it will give a much needed assurance to people who are unduly worried about pollution and the effects of pollution.  For that reason this Bill will be accepted by all.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>Like other Deputies, I welcome this Bill.  We must first ask ourselves if it is the powerful instrument we need to play our part in preventing the pollution of our seas. If it is, can we implement the provisions of this legislation?  In recent years everybody, especially those who live on an island, have become more and more aware of the dangers of oil pollution.  I regard this Bill as important as the legislation on fishery control and preservation.</P>
      <P>One of the biggest menaces to marine life is oil.  I wonder if we are really tackling this pollution problem properly.  We must realise that some oil companies are more powerful than national governments.  Their colossal profits would make many a national budget appear tiny.  These people have a very vital role to play because we depend on oil to maintain our standard of living.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="150" /> First, I will deal with the oil companies. There should be an international conference where governments could point out to them that they have their part to play.  They have great wealth and power.  Oil pollution could destroy our seas and could kill not alone life in the seas but also in the estuaries.</P>
    <P>We will have difficulty patrolling our seas but this country, small as we are, can play a very big part showing the world that we are 100 per cent behind this legislation and will do everything we can to make it effective. I would ask the Minister to look around our coast and ensure that every port authority has an effective anti-pollution unit.  I doubt if we would find many ports with such a unit.  The Dublin Port and Docks Board have a reasonably efficient unit to control pollution when a tanker is being loaded or is transferring its cargo from one ship to another.</P>
    <P>I want to congratulate the Thames Authority who have done such a fantastic job cleaning that river.  A few years ago marine life in that river had died and if at certain points a human being fell in, it meant almost certain death.  That river has been cleaned and there is marine life there now.  Unlike London, we do not have such badly polluted waters but we can learn from their mistakes.</P>
    <P>The oil companies have a responsibility to play their part.  To prevent the seas being destroyed by oil pollution we want these companies to invest large sums to help us preserve our seas.  I am sure we would have the goodwill of many of these oil barons if we asked them for help.  As I said, some of them are more powerful and have more money than national governments.</P>
    <P>While the Minister must have power to prosecute people who break the law, we should seek the goodwill of these companies and make sure they do their part by ensuring that their ships will reduce the possibility of pollution should an accident occur. Human nature being what it is, there may be some oil cowboys who may not want to pay the necessary attention to anti-pollution.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="151" /> Therefore, I suggest we make every endeavour to establish an effective coastguard service composed of our Air Corps, our Naval Service and all Irish registered vessels, big and small, in an all-out endeavour to fight the pollution of our waters.  If we can show to the masters and crews of the tankers who bring oil to our ports that we have a clear conscience as far as our rivers and estuaries are concerned, I feel sure we will get co-operation from them to keep the high seas free of pollution.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the penalties to be imposed on offenders&mdash;for a summary conviction, a fine of £500 or 12 months' imprisonment or both.  It is all very well to talk of penalties but we must set about prevention rather than cure in this matter.  On the east coast our people show great awareness of the possibility of pollution as, I am sure, do the inhabitants of the west coast of Britain.  That is to the good, but we must have an efficient corps of protection vessels, as well as planes, to combat the possibility of pollution of our seas.  Our fishery protection vessels could participate in spotting pollution and reporting it.  We would need also a large type vessel to haul away any tankers which become beached in our ports.</P>
    <P>We welcome this Bill but we should like to be assured that we will be prepared to spend sufficient money to build up a pollution fighting service. Posterity will not thank us if we show neglect in this matter.  If the human race is to survive, there must be coordinated efforts to fight pollution at sea as well as on land.  If we do not spend now in this desirable pursuit, it will cost us much more later.</P>
    <P>The River Liffey at times was heavily polluted and great efforts were made to cure it.  These days, because of heavier traffic and other things, the type of pollution is much more deadly. This is mainly because there are so many careless people who have no respect for clear water.  We must be seen to be very much in earnest in administering the provisions of this Bill and we must impose the full rigours of the law on those who break <Col N="152" /> it.  As I said earlier, particularly in matters involving pollution, prevention is the side of it we should concentrate on and this can be achieved by the establishment of the type of efficient observation corps I suggested earlier. This is now an international matter and most nations have come to appreciate the importance of the preservation of the environment as a means of ensuring the survival of the human race.</P>
    <P>If we are to follow up the enactment of this Bill by effective action this means allocation of adequate moneys to give us proper anti-pollution forces. I emphasise that we must have the goodwill of all the people involved, and perhaps the Minister would call on the oil companies here to co-operate with him and the Government in this field.  The oil companies make vast profits every year and might well be induced to provide endowment scholarships not alone in our schools and universities but also in the military college at the Curragh and the naval base at Cork to enable them to train their candidates and their crews in the prevention of oil pollution on the seas. If possible an institute should be endowed which would have as its sole task the study of pollution and how to prevent it, or perhaps a chair at some university could give itself over to that task entirely.  It is important that this be done, otherwise we will have disease and destruction from the polluted seas.  When we remember that two-thirds of the world's surface is covered by water we realise what a gigantic task this is.  In our educational establishments at all levels we should emphasise that, being an island, our vital interests lie in the seas around us and these have to be preserved. Although oil has brought many benefits, at the same time it can be a destroyer of marine life and then human life.  This Bill keeps us in line with international requirements, but with the pollution menace growing all the time more legislation will be needed in the future.  That is why I ask for an investment by the oil company giants in the establishment of an institute for the detailed study of possible measures to prevent pollution. There is goodwill among the oil companies <Col N="153" /> and among the national Governments.</P>
    <P>This Bill is much more important than one might think at first.  There is hardly a Deputy or a person living on this island who in some way or other is not involved in this vital matter of prevention of pollution.  The pressure on our fishing grounds has become great in recent times and we rightly have taken steps to protect our fishing rights, but unless we can control pollution there will be very little fish left in ten or 15 years.  We have to start at the beginning and ensure that our measures for the prevention of pollution are as adequate as we can make them.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and hope that the Minister's amendments, as promised, on Committee Stage will make it an even more effective Bill.  The Irish people, being an island race, are very jealous of their seas and would subscribe to any effective measure which would ensure that those seas are kept free from oil.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill, but I believe that the Minister should have availed of the opportunity in introducing this legislation to deal in a more comprehensive fashion with the pollution of the sea and coastal waters generally.  Oil pollution of the sea, coastal waters, harbours and beaches is causing increasing worldwide concern.  It arises from systematic, deliberate discharge of oil waste from vessels at sea and from accidental escapes resulting from collisions or inadvertency.  The Irish small shipping fleet is not a serious cause for concern in this regard but in the light of the existence of major world shipping lanes off our south and south-east coasts, the constantly increasing volume of oil traffic and the growing size of tankers, our coasts and beaches may at any time be subject to serious pollution.  Sporadic <Col N="154" /> instances have been detected and reported.</P>
      <P>We must also bear in mind that pollution of the sea is caused by the discharge of substances and matters other than oil.  I would like the Minister to state what exactly is being done about these matters and the prevention of this form of pollution.  For example, there are discharges overboard of rubbish, waste and plastic containers which are most damaging. There is the escape, deliberate or otherwise, from cargo vessels of toxic materials and waste.  This Bill deals solely with the ratification of a convention and with oil, but in bringing this Bill before the House the opportunity should be availed of to cover in a most comprehensive fashion all forms of pollution of the sea.</P>
      <P>Oil pollution of the sea is a most serious matter, far more serious than the ordinary man realises.  One should see and experience for oneself the effects of oil pollution on strands and beaches as was evident within the last few years on a few occasions on the beautiful coastline around Bantry and west Cork.  It is of vital importance that our beaches and strands should be kept clean, free from all forms of pollution, particularly pollution from oil spillages.  In order to retain our amenities and maintain our high standards of cleanliness generally every effort must be made to ensure no damage is done to our beaches by oil spillages.  Even adverse reports abroad about spillages could affect our image from the point of view of tourism.  A good environment is essential to the promotion of tourism.</P>
      <P>Local authorities should be compensated as well as being better geared to deal with oil spillages.  They should be constantly on the alert.  As previous speakers have said, we are an island state and the necessity to take all the necessary steps to prevent oil pollution of our seas and beaches is more important to us than it is to any other European country.  Some of our great natural resources, such as our fisheries, could be adversely affected apart altogether from our amenities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot understand why it took close on two years to bring in this Bill <Col N="155" /> ratifying the convention which came into force internationally in May, 1975. The penalty proposed is too low.  A maximum fine of £500 with the possibility of a jail sentence will not be a serious deterrent to big shipping companies or to those who may be prepared to take a chance.</P>
    <P>The discussion here and in the Seanad on the Local Government Water Pollution Bill clearly showed that there should be a Department for the Environment.  The time has come when such a Department should be set up.  There are 13 different agencies dealing with environmental matters.  A number of State Departments and Ministers also deal with these matters. There is bound to be overlapping and duplication.  There should be one separate Department dealing with environmental matters.</P>
    <P>The problem of clearing oil pollution has been under examination for a number of years.  The overall responsibility is assigned to the Minister for Local Government.  Immediate practical responsibility for initiating action is placed on coastal local authorities with, if necessary, outside assistance. It now appears that the Minister for Transport and Power is responsible for legislation and control as regards pollution of the sea, particularly oil pollution.</P>

      <P>All environmental matters, including anti-pollution campaigns, should be under the control of one Department and one Minister. The Minister may argue that this Bill deals with shipping.  I believe it deals with pollution and the control of pollution. It is vitally important to protect and preserve our environment and there is a grave responsibility on us to ensure that that environment is protected for the benefit of future generations. The environment does not belong to any one generation and steps, legislative and otherwise, must be taken to ensure the environment is not damaged. <Col N="156" /> I believe this Bill should cover in a comprehensive pattern the pollution of the sea from all forms of pollution and not just oil pollution.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill. I regret its introduction was delayed. Efforts to control pollution over the years have met with varying degrees of success.  They have been limited to some extent by problems of legislative jurisdiction.  Conventions help to spread the area of jurisdiction and, hopefully, the result will be the further control of pollution.  Although many communities have enacted legislation, the problem of pollution continues.  In 1881 the Chicago City Council were very worried about smoke pollution and they enacted the first smoke ordinance in the United States.  It and other ordinances successfully reduced pollution from smoke, but the problem persisted because of other contaminants.</P>
      <P>Today New York, and London to a lesser degree, are seriously involved in the problem of smog resulting in emphysema or, to use the Irish term, múchadh, with resultant deaths.  Continuing efforts must be made to control pollution.  This Bill deals with oil pollution of the sea.  Water is our most abundant resource.  Most of that water is in our seas and oceans and the waters carry a wide variety of dissolved salts in relatively high concentrates which makes it difficult to use these waters to the full.  There are certain industrial processes which desalinate these waters.  Many of these processes depend on petroleum fuels. This Bill relates entirely to oil pollution of the sea and we see a direct link-up there because in any process of desalinisation of the sea oil would be vital.</P>
      <P>Chicago introduced regulations in 1881 to control smoke.  Of course, the difficulty is that while this may happen polluted air or water does not respect any kind of city, state or continental boundary and this emphasises the need for international conventions. While one state might make great efforts in this matter, unless the efforts are continued by neighbouring countries and by all states eventually the effort will probably prove futile.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="157" /> With regard to rivers, especially long rivers that flow through national boundaries, unless there is co-operation from riparian owners in the various countries there will be pollution. Rivers are a vital economic lifeline to the sea.  Many years ago a regional abatement plan was adopted for the Ruhr river in West Germany.  This was an example of a co-operative venture. In June, 1964 the 17 countries who were involved in the Council of Europe linked up with the United States and Japan at a meeting in Strasbourg to plan a common offensive against oil pollution.  Immediately after that we had the International Hydrological Decade which promised to develop further international co-operation and control of water resources.</P>
    <P>It may be appropriate to recall that 10 years ago on 18th March there was the terrible disaster of the <i>Torrey Canyon</i> in the vicinity of the Scilly Isles and Land's End.  The <i>Torrey Canyon</i> was carrying 117,000 tons of crude oil and was bound for Milford Haven when the disaster occurred.  It resulted in some 30,000 tons being released initially into the sea.  Many of us can recall the efforts made to control the extent of the damage and to safeguard the beaches.  From this disaster we can learn a lesson to be ever vigilant.  On 25th March 100 miles of beach were affected by oil.  At the time the options were to pump out and transfer the remaining oil to another tanker, to refloat it or to burn it off.</P>
    <P>Eventually it was decided to bomb the ship in order to burn out the remaining oil in the holds.  At the time efforts continued on the coastline with the aid of sprays and absorbents of all kinds to safeguard amenities, both living and still.  We can recall that a boom of neoprene blocks was assembled and it was attempted to utilise this to enclose the ship and its dreadful spillage.  However, the seas were too rough and it was decided to use this aid instead to protect harbours and coastlines.  Perhaps the Minister would tell the House if we have stockpiles of this vital material to protect our coastline.  Is it stocked centrally?  I know local authorities put aside a certain amount each year in <Col N="158" /> their Estimates and on them falls the primary duty, along with the Minister for Local Government, to protect the coast.  Around that time local authorities were afforded demonstrations on various beach-cleaning methods.  This poses the question whether there is need for similar demonstrations now. Are we sufficiently up to date with modern techniques?</P>
    <P>We gather from a British White Paper on the <i>Torrey Canyon</i> that deep water fishing was not affected&mdash;that was their opinion at the time&mdash;but that shellfish and lobsters were affected in the shallows.  We saw the tragic photographs and newsreel shots of bird and marine life as they suffered.  We should take full stock of the situation and be vigilant.  Conventions are good in themselves.  They are vital because legislative boundaries are not considered by pollutants of the air or sea.  There are certain things we can do and while they may be outside the scope of this Bill they are akin to it.  Perhaps the Minister in his reply will be able to deal with some of the matters I raised.  We know of the tragic pollution of some of the great lakes in the United States&mdash;Lake Michigan and Lake Erie&mdash;where marine life is being killed.  Some of our own rivers at home are affected by various forms of pollution.</P>
    <P>On the local front, what precisely is the role of the local authorities? How are they aided through central funds to prevent a disaster?  I should hate any of the beautiful beaches in my constituency to be affected by pollution. Certainly it would affect very many people because those beaches are used extensively by many of the large population of Dublin.  I repeat my question: have we the most modern equipment and up-to-date techniques to deal with an emergency?</P>
    <P>Other speakers have said that in the context of the tourist industry cleanliness is very important.  By its very nature oil tends to destroy.  We must protect our heritage, both still and living.  I assume that the Civil Defence would have a large role to play in the event of any disaster where there was a subsequent washing up of pollution on our coasts.  They are <Col N="159" /> geared to this type of thing.  We have the benefit of sea currents.  Where would we be without the Gulf Stream?  Let us hope that those currents will not bring pollutants to our coastline.  Conventions can help but vigilance and an educational involvement and awareness of people are also vital.</P>
    <P>The penalties mentioned in this Bill should be a deterrent as a last resort.  We should have many other hurdles there before the final one of penalties.  Continuous vigilance and an involvement by the State, by other states and by international companies who use the seas are important to ensure that our heritage is protected and that oil pollution of the sea will be kept to a minimum.  We know that accidents occur but we should try to ensure that pollution is kept to a minimum and that our people will have the benefit of our amenities for many years to come.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister indicate clearly to the House if an oil spillage takes place, whether from a vessel which is broken up as a result of an accident or from exploration work for oil off our coasts, that, when clearing up the oil spillages, materials will not be used which are toxic to fish life?  There is very great concern about this along the west coast in particular.  Because of the prevailing winds, they could cause an oil spillage as far out as 200 to 300 miles off the coast.  There is every possibility that if the prevailing winds were 85 per cent south west and west the oil would reach the inner fishing grounds.</P>
      <P>Tourist interests are also concerned about oil spillage on the shores. There is a great possibility that an oil spillage far out at sea would not drift off to some other location and be lost out in the Atlantic but that it would turn in our direction.  I am anxious about the danger to fish life.  Chemicals have been used in the past which have been toxic.  Can the Minister give a guarantee that such chemicals will not be used in the event of a serious oil spillage either from a maritime accident or oil exploration?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>In common with the other speakers, I consider this is a very important Bill.  I give it my whole-hearted support and welcome it to the House but I feel it does not go far enough.  Nevertheless, it is a step in the right direction.  As a Deputy who represents a constituency where a considerable amount of oil spillage has taken place, I appreciate the various aspects of this Bill which will help in the future.  We always have a situation in any developing country where there is an invasion of the environment when development takes place.  We have to ensure that a proper balance is struck in that invasion.  The people are becoming more and more aware that while jobs are obviously the very necessity of life, nevertheless, the quality of life is also very important.</P>
      <P>I feel that any conservation Bill is worthy of the greatest possible support from all sides of the House.  This is one thing we can be non-political about. We have an obligation to work together to provide a better quality of life for all our people in the future. President Kennedy said in a message to Congress in 1962:</P>
      <P>Conservation is the wise use of our natural environment.  It is in the final analysis the highest form of national thrift, the prevention of waste and despoilment while preserving, improving and renewing the quality and usefulness of all our resources.</P>
      <P>That is very important.  The word &ldquo;conservation&rdquo; to some people has very unacceptable connotations.  They look on it as something against change or disliking change.  We have all sorts of pressure groups representing their views who wish to preserve the <i>status quo.</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We cannot emphasise enough here that communities in this technological age are dependent on technological and scientific advances and that we, through our Government, should do everything possible to gain from the vast amount of research being carried out in this field at the moment.  We are all aware that it is increasingly realised that natural resources are not inexhaustible, whether they are minerals, timber, oil or the products of the sea. They are dependent on proper husbandry <Col N="161" /> and looking after.  As far as one can see in a lot of other countries it is probably too late to start the cycle of renewal.  We should learn from what has happened through this type of haphazard development where there was no foresight at the planning stages.  We must remember also that the waters of the world, especially the seas, are an essential part of nature's equilibrium.  We as human animals, are very much dependent on nature.  I am of the opinion that the seas probably contribute towards our life cycle more than any other single asset we have in the world.</P>
    <P>Nobody stops to think how oxygen is provided.  Without being a scientist or understanding it, we are all aware that there is a wonderful cycle in nature, in which the seas and the green lands and plants play an important part.  If we allow any aspect of that to be eroded we are putting the continuance of civilisation in peril.  Any pollution of the seas, especially oil pollution, threatens the existence of this cycle.  It is established that the oceans contribute a considerable part of the oxygen we breathe.  When we take into account that already man has destroyed vast tracts of land in various parts of the world let us ensure that we do not destroy parts of the ocean for which we have direct responsibility.</P>
    <P>When the Minister is replying he might let us know what happened in relation to the research that may have taken place after we signed the agreement on the implementation of the European project on pollution.  The name of the project was Analysis of Organic Micro-Pollutants in Water.  We brought this before the House before the election in 1972.  Have we had any playback, or visits from people abroad as a result of the passing of that important legislation?  If we do not actively pursue the terms of these agreements it is a waste of time bringing them before the House.  The Minister should consult more with marine biologists and in the aftermath of these consultations he could occasionally issue a Press release about what action he has taken, the state of our oceans at present, and the dangers, and a <Col N="162" /> proper education programme could be conducted through the media to ensure that people are aware of the assets that our oceans give us.  I read a report recently where a marine biologist was of the opinion that at the end of the century the seas may be dead.  We could have a situation as we had in the Mediterranean where all the vitality of that sea was destroyed.  None of us wants that situation.  We are not being alarmists when we point out that if proper steps are not taken we could have a situation in the Atlantic similar to that which we had in the Meditterranean. Apart from the tremendous loss in revenue so far as the State is concerned in relation to the fishing industry we would have a serious imbalance in nature as a result.</P>
    <P>Historically the ocean has always been the sink where we disposed of all our waste.  It has done a relatively successful job of converting that refuse into something more important and in restoring it.  Are we now arriving at the stage where a saturation point has been reached in relation to what we are asking the sea to absorb?  It is no longer the effective sink that it was.  On occasions like this it is useful to point out the vast material losses that can accrue to the State as a result of the lack of a proper conservation policy. The fishery industry is a very important part of the livelihood of our rural communities.  In these rural communities we also have a thriving tourist industry.  In Bantry due to the unfortunate spillages we had there not alone were fishermen affected but the tourist industry was affected as well.  These industries were equally affected by the use of detergents in cleaning the oil spillages which in some cases were toxic.  The utilisation of peat moss rather than these powerful detergents could be implemented.  Maybe a non-toxic detergent has been invented since which does not cause the type of mess that has been created in the past few years.</P>
    <P>Over a considerable period there was an agreement among shipowners that any discharging or dumping of oil and petrol from their tankers would be done not less than 50 miles from any coastline.  As we know, that <Col N="163" /> is no protection, depending as it does on the prevailing winds and currents for the various coastlines involved. Even if oil is dumped way out at sea inevitably it seems to get back to the coast.  Everybody who has been on the beaches around the country will recall seeing filthy lumps of tar on various beaches.  Most of these tar-like substances on our beaches come from oil tankers transporting crude oil.  Very often after they discharge their contents they move out loaded with water to serve as ballast but they still retain oil products which mix with the water and which are eventually put into the sea.  Even after this sort of cleaning a sticky mess remains.  I have seen this first hand, where hot steam has to be put through and it comes out as lumps of tar discharged into the sea.  This sludge has to be treated with steam and hot water under pressure to liquify it.  Once it is liquified it moves out into the sea and solidifies again. Nothing is being done about it.  I cannot make any concrete suggestion on how we can monitor the situation. This type of situation is occuring on a sufficiently large scale to cause a lot of dispute to those who are aware of it.</P>
    <P>There is a certain amount of carelessness by the captains of tankers. Where small leaks occur they do nothing about repairing them, and there may also be unknown leakages of oil and grease into the sea.  The penalties imposed by legislation are not stringent enough in respect of such offences. Our life style and, indeed, our survival are eventually dependent on the sea and the health of the sea, and no penalties would be too great for such offenders.  Not alone are these leakages and the sludge that goes into the sea destructive in themselves, but they are evil-smelling.  Even if people were not aware that this sort of pollution was taking place they would be well aware of it from the dreadful smell that one gets in the vicinity of these spillages, and they cause considerable annoyance to people who come in contact with them.  The only way to put an end to the situation is to impose severe penalties.  Some of <Col N="164" /> these offenders take liberties when they know the consequences are not going to be too harsh.  Captains of tankers work under very severe commercial pressure.  They have to meet heavy schedules.  They must load, unload and clean out as fast as possible, and some of them when under that type of pressure take short cuts.  We should have a monitoring service to ensure that that does not happen.</P>
    <P>I do not know how best that can be done, and I am not convinced that the local authority are the right people to do it.  I do not know how else it can be done unless we involve ourselves in a great deal of expense.  May be this is not the best time to start on that kind of proposition; nevertheless, it is so important that thought must be given to the idea of an absolutely separate arm of the State looking after the quality of our life and preventing the pollution of our waters.</P>
    <P>It is important also that there should not be a repetition of what happened with Gulf Oil where there was what could be described without exaggeration as a massive spillage. They tried to con us into thinking it was only about 150 gallons when anybody who was down there or who was even within five miles of the spillage could see it was on a far greater scale. We should ask for honesty in relation to the extent of spillages.  If we get honesty and an open admission that a spillage has occured and the quantity of the spillage, that should always be taken into account in any legislation that is enacted.  The cover-up in Bantry was fairly dramatic, but in fairness to Gulf, I think that at the end of the day they did give all the relevant facts.  Maybe it was the fault of people thinking they were doing a favour to Gulf; they were not doing a favour to anybody, least of all to Gulf.</P>
    <P>On the whole question of oil pollution, we cannot be too vigilant.  A situation cannot be allowed to occur again as happened with the <i>Torrey Canyon</i>.  Where spillages occur there should be immediate notification of them.  Not alone that but the personnel and the techniques must be available to go into immediate action to ensure that the minimum damage occurs as a <Col N="165" /> result of the spillages.  As I said at the outset, where there is development there is a certain amount of destruction. A balance must be kept at all times.  I wonder if the Minister would not see his way to extending the scope of this Bill not alone to include oil pollution in the seas but to bring in a comprehensive Bill to cover all types of pollution and what would be a sort of almanac of conservation.  More and more situations will arise like that in Cork lately in regard to the establishment of an asbestos industry where the debate was fairly wide&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Possibly I can concede that, and that is why I am suggesting that the Bill is a bit narrow and should be extended to cover a far wider range of the aspects of conservation. Nevertheless, I think we all welcome the Bill.  We hope it is the first of many and that the Minister may, in his own time, introduce a Bill which will cover the broader aspects of pollution and conservation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick, Cavan) Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Cavan):</i> I want to thank the Deputies from both sides of the House who contributed to the debate and for the general welcome they extended to this measure. Although this Bill has been introduced to deal with three or four specific matters on which I will elaborate later, it <Col N="166" /> was not surprising that a fairly wide field in the pollution area was covered by Deputies who spoke.  All of us are concerned about the preservation of the environment so that the quality of life on this island may be maintained. We are particularly concerned that our seas remain clean and that all reasonable steps be taken to avoid pollution.</P>
      <P>Deputy Crowley introduced the aspect of striking a fair balance.  Pollution is a very emotive topic.  I suppose some pollution is the cost of development and progress.  Again, I suppose we could ensure that this island remains absolutely free from pollution of any kind but the result of that might be that we would be deprived of a lot of what people might regard as amenities, of a lot of wealth-producing operations and activities. And while this island might then be a very beautiful and highly desirable place to live nonetheless it might be difficult because we would not have the wherewithal to afford us the standard of living we would like.  On the other hand, it would be quite easy to turn this island into a place where a lot of wealth could be generated, with a lot of manufacturing operations going on but which would also render it a comparatively dirty place.  None of us would want that.  Such would render it a place where people could make a lot of money but where they might not want to settle down or rear their families because of pollution.  That is why, in approaching the subject, we must strike a reasonable balance.  We are not a fully developed country; we are, perhaps, a late developer.  As a result we can benefit from the examples of other countries and from what has happened to them.  We should be careful, as we shall be, to ensure that our environment is not damaged, that pollution does not destroy the quality of life here.  But, at the same time, we must strike a reasonable balance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was not surprised that the question of the setting up of a Department of the Environment, with a Minister in charge, was raised early in the debate. Quite frequently there is one or other lobby suggesting that there be a <Col N="167" /> separate Ministry for this, whether it be termed tourism, the environment or anything else.  In that respect we must have a reasonable approach also.  We are a small island with a growing population and not a very wealthy community.  We are restrained by the Constitution in the number of Ministers that may be appointed.  Apart altogether from that we are not an Empire and cannot afford to behave as if we were.  After considerable consideration it was decided that the best way to deal with the question of environment was to place it under the charge of the Minister for Local Government. I feel that was the correct decision because he oversees many activities that could be damaging to the environment.  Under the aegis of his Department there are the local authorities throughout the country&mdash; whether they be in maritime or inland counties&mdash;operated by elected representatives who surely have the concern of their areas at heart, who should be able to strike at least a sensible balance between the provision of employment and the generation of wealth on the one hand and the value of the environment, a pleasant countryside and the anti-pollution aspect on the other.  For those reasons the Minister for Local Government is the correct person to have overall responsibility for the environment.  Of course, he will have to consult with and rely on other agencies in implementing such overall environmental policy.</P>
    <P>I come now to the Bill itself.  I do not propose to follow the very many points raised because, while I can understand them having been raised, I do not consider them relevant to this measure.  The Bill before the House sets out to accomplish a number of objectives.  The first of those is to enable Ireland to accept certain amendments to the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution of the Sea by Oil, 1954.  We subscribed to that convention and have ratified it.  But, since 1954, a number of amendments have been introduced to that convention.  I should tell the House that the organisation responsible for that international convention is the Inter-Governmental <Col N="168" /> Maritime Consultative Organisation, known as IMCO.  That organisation promoted the convention in question as far back as 1954, to which a number of amendments have since been made, the last being those in 1969 and 1971.  During debate in the House complaint has been made that we delayed unduly in some way in introducing this Bill in order to implement those amendments.  It is right that I should put on record that the 1969 amendments do not come into operation until next year and that, even had the Bill been on the Statute Book last year or the year before, it would not have had any effect in regard to them. Furthermore, the 1971 amendments to the 1954 convention have not yet been ratified or received sufficient signatures to make them law.  We do not know when they will become law and we are not dealing with them in this Bill.  Therefore, it will be seen by the House that, so far as the 1969 amendments to the 1954 convention are concerned, no time or anything else has been lost.</P>

Mar adúirt mé, tá fadhbanna ag <i>Amárach</i>, agus i Mí Bealtaine seo caite dúirt mé le lucht stiúrtha <i>Amárach</i> dá ndéanfadh siad iarracht an díolachán a mhéadú agus tacaíocht a fháil ó mhuintir na Gaeltachta don pháipéar sin go mbéinn sásta púnt don phúnt a thabhairt nó rud éigin mar sin.  Nuair a tháinig lucht stiúrtha <i>Amárach</i> chun cainte liom mí ó shin cuireadh in iúl dom, cé go ndearna siad teagmháil le thar 70 eagrais ar fud na Gaeltachta, nach bhfuair siad freagra ach ó thrí cinn.  Bhí sé soiléir ansin nach raibh tacaíocht mhuintir na Gaeltachta á tabhairt don nuachtán seo.

      <P>(<i>Cavan</i>): The contract was first placed as far back as 1969.  The contract ran into difficulties in regard to the tower.  The tower had to be re-sited by the contractor. Following that, certain arrangements had to be made in regard to the staff.  The total cost to date is £259,000 of which £215,000 is for equipment and the balance of £44,000 is for building construction and ancillary works.  It is estimated there will be a further £5,000 approximately to meet then.  As I understand, it is not yet ready for checking, but it is expected that the equipment will be ready for flight checking and commissioning before the end of 1977.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  We all have our own style of doing things and, as they were about to board the aircraft arriving in Dublin an hour and a quarter later as the Deputy is well aware, it seemed to me more appropriate to communicate rapidly instead of at that hour of the night moving through the normal channels and, by doing so, I succeeded in alerting the media.  The Deputy may feel that is unusual but if one is lying in bed and has nothing else to do and there is a matter of great urgency then it seems to one useful to do one's bit in those circumstances, and I did.</P>

In certain cases where my notification of the desire of the Minister and Parliamentary Secretary to make a further statement at Dublin Airport led to further discussion and informal inquiries, I did reply, for the record, to the questions asked and I expressed the view in one or two cases, I think &mdash;it is difficult to remember every detail as the Deputy will appreciate&mdash; that once the possibility existed of a Community solution which could be as satisfactory, or even more satisfactory, than a unilateral one, I felt the Government were justified in postponing action until they discovered what the new proposals would be.</P>

      <P>I spoke to Commissioner Gundelach on the telephone on 26th February.  I do not recall the statement of the Parliamentary Secretary and therefore, I cannot comment on it.  The intention was to communicate with Commissioner Gundelach much earlier in the week, on Tuesday.  However, he was in the United States and it was arranged that I would communicate with him on Friday.  His return was postponed and the actual communication took place on Saturday.  If the Parliamentary Secretary said what the Deputy now suggests it is possible he was working on what the intention had been before it was frustrated by the Commissioner's exceptionally prolonged absence in the United States.  I met the Parliamentary Secretary on Sunday and briefed him fully on the discussion I had with Commissioner Gundelach.</P>

      <P>Telephone connection, rental and call charges are standard and apply equally to all subscribers without exception.  Reduced rates, granted in favour of any individual or group of subscribers, would <Col N="192" /> be a social benefit, similar to the schemes for free electricity and free television licences.

The Deputy will appreciate it is primarily a matter for the Department of Social Welfare.  In relation to his original inquiry, I do not think any particular survey of costs is necessary. My Department, in conjunction with the Department of Social Welfare, should be able to bring to light any data required to cost anything of this kind that might be undertaken but whether it is the best use of scarce resources to alleviate hardship is a question for the Department of Social Welfare.

      <P>The Authority may, on such terms and conditions as the Minister may, with the consent of the Minister for the Public Service, approve...</P>
      <P>This seems to me to arrogate to the Minister for the Public Service and the Minister for Agriculture total control over the operations of the proposed new authority and any pretension it may have to the facade of democratic control falls when one examines the wording of this section. I suggest that the Minister consider this and also the possibility of amending this section.  If he does not this side of the House will have to consider submitting an amendment on Report Stage.  It must be self-evident even to the Minister that part of the subsection I referred to is obviously constrictive and is obviously arrogating to the political heads of the new authority all worthwhile control, including control over matters such as research, where there should not be political control of such an allpervasive kind as is granted in this section.

      <P>There may possibly be some misunderstanding of what is intended in the section.  This section is intended to provide for situations where a relatively small proportion of the duties of a Department's office are proper to the authority and it would not be advisable to transfer them to that body.  For instance, the teaching functions of certain members of the staff of the Botanic Gardens who give courses in horticulture is an instance of this kind.  The Botanic Gardens are not being transferred but <Col N="204" /> the amenity courses are.  Therefore, a very small proportion of the time of the people who give those amenity courses is involved.  Their main work is in the Botanic Gardens as such. It is to permit of this sort of agency basis transaction, to allow them to do this on behalf of the authority that the subsection is so worded.  There may be cases where we would want to do this in reverse.  It is only to make legal provision to enable that to happen.  It is extremely sensible.  I believe the objection raised arises from a misunderstanding of what is intended in the section.</P>

I would like the Minister's assurance that this is not a provision under which, possibly at some later stage, the advisory services will become a fee-charging institution and that farmers availing of them may not under this section at any time in the future be required to pay a fee to the Minister or to the authority.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 12, between lines 5 and 6, to insert the following paragraphs:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(b)  The Minister may, in the order referred to in paragraph (a), in relation to the Board to be established on the commencement of section 25, provide, as regards the member or members who are to be representative of the staff of the Authority, for the selection for nomination, on or before a specified date, of a representative or representatives of the said staff and, notwithstanding the fact that, in the period between the establishment of that Board and the date of the appointment to that Board of the said representative or representatives, there are not any members who are representative of the said staff, nothing done by or on behalf of the Board or the Authority shall be invalid solely by reason of that fact.</P>

    <P>I am introducing this amendment because it is possible that the board of the authority may be appointed prior to the transfer of some or all of the existing staff designated for transfer. This amendment proposes to enable the board to carry out their functions in the interim period, prior to the transfer of staff, even though there will be no staff representation on the board.  It is really to enable us to set up the staff of the authority, give representation to the board subsequently, and also to empower the board to function until it is possible to have that done.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>We oppose this section.  The Minister is aware of the fairly widespread disquiet about the proposals in this section for the establishment of the board of the new organisation.  From a layman's reading of the section it seems fairly obvious that the ability of the Minister to make up the personnel of the board in a manner that will be acceptable to himself is too widespread.  It is also worth mentioning that there have been very strong representations made, I understand, to the Minister himself and certainly to the Fianna Fáil Party from the General Council of Committees of Agriculture who will have a very important part to play in the implementation of this proposal and <Col N="207" /> indeed in the carrying out of any advisory service that might be contemplated under this or any similar Bill. It is proposed in this section that the General Council of Committees of Agriculture would have only one representative of the 24.  It is not nearly as clear that this general council should be entitled to as much representation as but no more than the Government Department, namely, the Department of Education.  If the Minister is satisfied that the present arrangement and those arrangements envisaged in the Bill for the future constitution of committees of agriculture, and the general council that would be drawn from them, are adequate he cannot very well argue that the representation he proposes to give them thereafter in this section is adequate also because it is not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not propose to alter in any way my opinion, to which the Minister referred in his Second Reading speech, on the general revision of the advisory services, including committees of agriculture. But I am assuming, as one must that the Minister is satisfied with the proposed constitution of the general council.  At the same time he will give no more, and possibly less, representation than he would give to the universities or to the farming organisations whose democratic structure would not be able to withstand the same type of examination as would that of the general council.  It is manifestly reasonable that on the board of the Authority there should be representations from the farming organisations. It is of vital importance also that people placed on the board derive their presence there from some democratic source.  Certainly this can be said of the members of the General Council of Committees of Agriculture. I may have misunderstood my informant when he said that the Minister, when he met a deputation from the General Council of Committees of Agriculture, said that this section was capable of amendment and that he would not object to an amendment if one were put down.  If the Minister is of such an opinion I suggest that he make the amendment himself or, at <Col N="208" /> any rate, if this party make such an amendment that he would look favourably on it.</P>
    <P>In this attitude of the Minister there is a certain Pontius Pilate element in that while he would not wish to increase the representation of the general council it seems he would not, at the same time, object to somebody else making that type of amendment. Why does the Minister not take a stand one way or the other?  I suggest that he do so.  There has been vocal and well-expressed anxiety that local representatives of the countries should have a larger say in the composition of the board.  For instance, subsection (3) of this section says that a great many of the board members shall be selected for nomination in accordance with the provisions of an order made for that purpose by the Minister and that any such order shall indicate the procedure for filling casual vacancies in the membership of the board.  As I understand it, the Minister will make an order which will permit him to nominate people to the board.  I presume he can make an order in such a manner as will permit him to nominate the people he wants to place on the board, in other words, people of the Minister's political persuasion.</P>
    <P>I do not want to labour the question of patronage but we cannot avoid some reference to it.  We cannot avoid a backward glance at the appalling record of Fine Gael, in particular, and the Coalition Government, in general, in this respect.  Having a lively recollection of what they are capable of, their cynical blackguardism in the matter of patronage, one shudders at the power the Minister can take under section 26 and the use he can make of it.  When one considers the position in regard to every board under the general aegis of the Department of Agriculture since the Minister took office, one cannot expect that this authority will be treated any differently. For that reason I cannot do anything but oppose the section.</P>

      <P>I should like to make a few remarks on the statement of Deputy Gibbons.  Far be it from me to take up the time of the House, which <Col N="209" /> I rarely do, by going into the general principles of the Bill, but I think the position taken by Deputy Gibbons is basically correct.  Speaking as a university teacher, I feel that the bringing in of research institutes into the purview of civil service Departments is a retrograde, regressive step and I do not think we should be doing it in this instance.  It has always tended to stultify research.</P>
      <P>Deputy Gibbons said that the Coalition parties have had an unhappy record in the matter of appointments of people to boards of this kind.  In my view both Fianna Fáil and the Coalition Government have got equally unhappy records and I am concerned to express my view that the staffs concerned in research institutions like this should be people who ultimately will determine the manner in which they conduct their business and earn their livelihood.</P>
      <P>I am a member of the Coalition and if Deputy Gibbons presses this to a vote I will have to direct my feet in the general direction of the Government of which I am a junior member, but I want to put on the record of the House that I regard this Bill as an extremely bad one, an extremely stupid one, and I think that in this case Deputy Gibbons is correct.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad that at least one member of the Government parties had the courage to come in and express his opinion on the Bill, even if he goes into the Government lobby to vote.  I cannot understand why the Minister has decided to give such a small percentage of the representation on this board to people working on the land.  Already the great work the advisory services have been doing has been mentioned and I wish to compliment them once more. I suggest to the Minister that one-third of the representation on this board should be given to members of the General Council of Committees of Agriculture.  They are free agents, elected by the people.  The ratepayers will be paying a large contribution towards the running of this new body and their representatives should have at least one-third representation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="210" /> Theory is all very well but the people who put theory into practice on the land deserve more consideration than the Minister is giving them here.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I ask the Minister to bring in an amendment on Report Stage to ensure that one-third of this board will be members of county committees of agriculture.  That would be a representation of eight, four from each province.  Throughout the years these committees have helped in an unequalled way to promote the interests of agriculture.  Among other things they helped in the development of the co-operative movement.  Their advisory services have always been available to all local organisations. Deputy Thornley pointed out the irony of putting research under the control of the Department of Agriculture. The Minister could redeem himself a little by giving strong representation to those who do the practical work on the land and I therefore appeal to him to amend the section to that effect.</P>

      <P>Since I last spoke on this Bill I have been meeting quite a number of elected representatives, nearly all of whom feel that they should have a stronger representation on the board than 50 per cent.  Most of these are young people who are taking an interest in public life and in being elected. They go to the trouble of being elected and they should have at least 75 per cent representation on behalf of the agricultural community on this board.</P>
      <P>In the past, agricultural instructors went out into the rural areas during the winter months conducting lectures and night classes until the middle of March or 1st April.  I hope the Minister will ensure that those lectures will be continued.  They instructed the people on the yield that should come from the land&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>This section, like some of the previous sections we were discussing last night, is a further step on the road to bureaucracy, having regard to the representation of the people who are elected by the public and having regard to the composition of the board under this section.  Rightly, we are opposing this section for the reasons which have been outlined.  So far as the elected representatives of the people are concerned, the representation outlined in this section is very small.  I have no doubt but that the Minister will reconsider this section and that on Report Stage he will bring in an amendment to give adequate representation to the General Council of Committees of Agriculture on this new board.  This is necessary, because the public representatives are the people who have to provide 50 per cent of the finances at local level, and they are also aware of the needs of the farming community and of the rural community in regard to the proper implementation of this new authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This section provides that agricultural and rural organisations will be selected for nomination in accordance with an order made by the Minister. I feel that at this stage they should be named, and I would like to know if the rural and agricultural organisations who are currently represented on the board of An Foras Talúntais will now have an opportunity of nominating a representative, or a representative from a grouping to the new board, and also if other agricultural and rural organisations will be involved in the nomination of members. The Minister should consider the fact that some of the groupings of the organisations are not proper groupings. I am referring to those groups <Col N="212" /> which have nominations on to the board of An Foras Talúntais and which, I have no doubt, will have power to nominate to this new board under section 26.  I would like to see certain organisations having direct representation on the new board.</P>
    <P>However, the most important aspect of this Bill is the representation of the elected members and this is something the Minister should consider very carefully. Having come up through the ranks and being an elected member, I am sure he appreciates the role they play.</P>

      <P>I would like to add my voice to those of my colleagues and I would hope the Minister would take heed of what Deputy Thornley has said as a person involved in education, that this Bill was bad and stupid.  However, I was concerned when I heard him say once again he would let his feet control his head or better judgment.</P>
      <P>We on this side of the House must be concerned about the composition of this board which seemingly will be under complete departmental control. Having regard to the contribution that has to be made to the up-keep of this, the Minister should have spelt out clearly what he had in mind and given some indication of the organisations he proposes should have nominations to that board.  Reading the Bill I can see it could very well be that there might be only one elected representative out of a total of 24, which would be a serious imbalance.  I hope the Minister will use his better judgment and give a fair representation to the elected representatives because they are well equipped to contribute and have contributed a great deal in the past to those organisations.  It would be a sad day if he cut off the line of communication of public representatives to such boards. Therefore I hope he will listen to the Deputies on this side of the House as well as his colleague up in the right hand corner.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to add my voice to the opposition to this section.  I spoke on this already when the Bill was being introduced.  It is a very dangerous practice to get away from <Col N="213" /> the principle of giving elected representatives the majority membership on a board such as this.  The board will make a demand on the ratepayers. The county council will have to meet that demand regardless of its size. They will have no say in where the money will be spent, or whether it will be spent in the local authority area in which the demand is made.  It is only right and proper that the people making that demand should have to face the general public and answer for their stewardship at election time. Elected representatives have to do that and, therefore, they are quite cautious in making demands of that nature. They make sure that whatever demand is made, whatever money is asked for, will be spent wisely.</P>
      <P>Under this section the Minister will appoint one member.  The Minister for Education will appoint another, and one will be appointed by the General Council of the County Committees of Agriculture.  I assume that is correct, even though I consider one member from the General Council totally inadequate.  Other farming organisations will be demanding representation on the board.  This will leave the number of public representatives on the board very small indeed. This is a very dangerous departure. I earnestly hope the Minister will have a rethink on this matter.  I am sure every member of his own party who is a member of a local authority, or who was a member of a committee of agriculture, will tell him the same thing as we are telling him this afternoon. I hope he will heed our demands in this respect.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCrinion" hpid="Mr. Crinion Mr. Crinion">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crinion</NameTxt>
      <P>I also believe the General Council of the County Committees of Agriculture should have more representation than one member on a board of 24.  They represent the committees of agriculture, 27 in all. The Minister says they will have at least one member but I believe a specific number should be written into the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another educational sector is not being catered for in this Bill, the schools of domestic rural economy. Those people have been making their views known to the Minister and his <Col N="214" /> Department and they have been turned down.  These schools have done dedicated work for young girls in rural Ireland.  A large number of the Minister's staff in the poultry section and in the farm home advisory service came through the rural domestic economy schools.  Many men who have married these girls are very appreciative of the training they received in those schools.  Most of them are in convents run by very dedicated people.  Even as members of a group they should have one member on the board.  I know we have a large number of rural organisations but these people are giving a very good service.  To a large extent this Bill is devoted to farmers but we must look after the girls as well.</P>

By no stretch of the imagination was Deputy Thornley relevant to the section and Deputy McLaughlin was talking about section 42 which we will come to later.</P>
      <P>This section provides for the appointment of the members of the board by the Minister on the nomination of bodies such as the General Council of the County Committees of Agriculture, such farming and rural organisations as the IFA, the ICMSA, Macra na Feirme, the Irish Countrywomen's Association, the Irish Creamery Managers' Association, the staff of the authority, the universities, the Irish Veterinary Association, the IAOS, the processing and marketing sectors of the industry, and the livestock breeders.  These are the rural groups I have in mind who will nominate people to this board.  How can Deputies opposite by any stretch of the imagination say it will be rigged and only people I want&mdash;&mdash;</P>

It will be a board which can be expected to ensure that the staff of the authority will be able to carry out their duties without any undue or unnecessary interference. I assume that all these people, when they are nominated, will be concerned to get the best possible service for agriculture.  That is why I propose to put them on the board and for no other reason.

The Minister did not give us any indication of what he intended to do about public representatives on the board. We are dealing with the composition of the board at top level.  This board will make a demand on the rates in different counties.  I can prove that under this Bill it is possible that there might not be any public representative on this board.  The Minister has not spelled out how many public representatives will be on the board.  He still says he will give them one but in <Col N="216" /> my opinion we would need more than one.</P>
      <P>Directive 161 was mentioned here last night.  Is that directive not being well implemented by the advisory services and the county committees at present?

I met the deputation and they made their case very strongly and of course I listened to their case.  I have been misrepresented here on more than one occasion.  I never said I will only give one seat.  Deputy Callanan used that expression.  I said I would give at least one.</P>

      <P>The Minister went to great pains to protest his innocence and wipe his hands of any fell intentions. Before he sat down the cat hopped out of the bag when he said he had not yet decided how many members he would give to the general council.  The slant behind all that is that the Minister will decide the personnel of the board.  He wondered whether the people on this side of the House had gone daft but this afternoon only two members of the Government parties spoke and both spoke against the Bill.</P>
      <P>I do not think Deputy McLaughlin was up with the play, but I understood him to say he wanted 75 per cent representation from committees of agriculture on the board.  Possibly I misunderstood him because he was difficult to hear, but there was no doubt at all about what Deputy Thornley said.  He said what we were saying yesterday, that the destruction of An Foras Talúntais and its somethering in this new organisation is a detrimental, retrograde, ill-informed step.  He is in a particularly sensitive position because he has an academic background and understands these matters more sensitively than the normal person.  As an academic he immediately sees the fatal flaw in this, that is, the destruction of the concept of agricultural research.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="218" /> The Minister said we expected him to do something daft but he has already done it&mdash;he introduced this Bill.  When replying to our observations on this section, I was waiting to hear if he would give any indication of the future composition of the board. It would not be unreasonable if we were to ask him to tell us if there will be four IFA representatives, three ICMSA, two representatives from the Irish Countrywomen's Association and how many Macra people will be on the board.  I would like the Minister to give some indication of the line-out because we have not got any so far.</P>

      <P>As the Minister knows, party representation on the General Council of the County Committees of Agriculture is fairly balanced and we are talking here about a committee of the General Council of County Committees of Agriculture.  As I said on Second Stage, I sat on a committee where there were seven members from the Government parties and two from Fianna Fáil.  The General Council of County Committees of Agriculture <Col N="219" /> should have a majority on this board. Now they have decided that they will accept one-third.  That would give two to each province.  That is very little. Public representatives should get fair play.  County Leitrim is completely Fine Gael but there are good men on the general council.  We do not discuss politics on that council. I want to make that quite clear.  It is wrong to deprive public representatives of proper representation.  It is wrong that this can be arranged in such a way that there need not be one public representative on the board.  We could not possibly support that suggestion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a great pity there are not more <Col N="220" /> men like Deputy Thornley and Deputy Coogan prepared to stand up here and give their opinions.  They may vote with their party but they will give their honest opinions.  I give my honest opinion but I vote with my party.  If my party make a decision I stand behind that decision but I am not ashamed to stand up and give my opinion.  I know what the opinions are on the Government side.  I could name Deputies but I will not do that, but I know they do not agree with the constitution of the board.  Why will they not stand up here and say so? That will not prevent them voting with their party.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 6:</P>
      <P>In page 13, lines 10 to 12, to delete subsection (2).</P>
      <P>The inclusion of subsection (2) in this section is a restoration of what seems to me to be the confusion of thought in the drafters of the Bill in that they get education, advisory and research functions mixed up together in the way a scrambled egg is.  Even accepting the Minister's proposition that there must be an amalgamation the merging of the three functions of the authority and the supremacy of the Minister in all those functions, as indicated in subsection (2), is unacceptable.  We cannot but reject that subsection.  That is why I put down this amendment.</P>

      <P>I cannot accept this amendment as I consider the board of an authority of such importance to the development of the agricultural industry should have the right to consult with and make proposals to the Minister on all matters coming under the Minister's responsibility.  I do not know how Deputy Gibbons can see it as something wrong that this right should be there to consult with those organisations and agencies that are coming together now in a single aggregated authority.  Where would the Minister get his information; where would he get the material for his policy-making if not through such a group?  I do not understand Deputy Gibbons's point in objecting to this because I do not know how a Minister could carry on without having this contact.</P>

      <P>It does not require a great deal of imagination to conceive a situation in research where a large measure of confidentiality is essential and the research might be of a kind that would have a commercial implication.  The unwarranted intrusion of uninformed people, either from the authority or the servants of the Minister, by being uninformed if for no other reason, could cause a great upset in the carrying out of any worthwhile research.  Research in certain cases requires a measure of confidentiality that should be proof against the intrusion of the Minister or any of his servants, who would not have technical <Col N="224" /> competence, to intervene in the normal operation of this.  It is not workable. I ask the Minister to recognise this reality.</P>

      <P>The purpose of the subsection is to give the authority the right to consult with the Minister if they so desire.  They need not consult with the Minister if they do not want to.  That is why I think it is a misunderstanding of the situation.  It is to give them that right to consult but they do not have to consult with the Minister.</P>

      <P>Deputy Callanan is not quite correct in what he says about An Foras Talúntais.  Section 12 of the Agricultural Institute Act states:</P>
      <P>For the purpose of assisting the Institute to carry out effectively its functions under this Act, there shall be paid to the Institute in every financial year, out of monies provided by the Oireachtas, a grant towards the expenses of the Institute, the amount of which shall be determined by the Minister for Finance in consultation with the Minister and the Council, after due consideration of any information furnished under subsection (2) of this section.</P>
      <P>That is one part.  Subsection (2) of that section states:</P>
      <P>The Council shall furnish to the Minister such information regarding its income and expenditure as he may from time to time require.</P>
      <P>A lot of things were required in the An Foras Talúntais Act that we are losing sight of.  I am giving them the right to consult with the Minister if they desire.  They need not consult with him if they do not want to.</P>

Why <Col N="225" /> write it into the Bill?  We seem to have consultation with the Minister right through this Bill.  This is what people are worried about.

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>In the creation of the Minister's new pyramid of power there will have to be a director.  This section makes provision for this office, with the remarkable difference in the appointment of the first and all subsequent directors.  The first director will be nominated directly by the Minister; he will be a Minister's man. Thereafter the directors will be appointed by the board.  Perhaps the Minister would tell us why all subsequent boards will be competent to appoint a director while the first will not.  I cannot see any logical reason for this and perhaps the Minister would elaborate on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the construction of the directorate of the new establishment it strikes me that, since the authority will have three main functions&mdash;those in respect of education, advice and research&mdash;it might be as well, in this or some subsequent section, to arrange for deputy directors with responsibility in each of those three main subfields. I make that suggestion <Col N="227" /> principally bearing in mind the recent death of An Foras Talúntais and the need existing for the maintenance of some separate identity of the research function that might be afforded some kind of survival by the appointment of a separate director.  I would regard it merely as a temporary and unsatisfactory expedient but it would be better than nothing.  A more radical method will have to be utilised at a later date to repair the damage contemplated in the Bill.  But, as a holding measure&mdash;to prevent the total extinction of agricultural research&mdash;I suggest that the Minister consider the appointment of three deputy directors. I would ask him to explain the differentiation in the appointment of the first director directly by the Minister and of all his successors by the board.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>

      <P>The sole concern of the director of An Foras Talúntais was research and it bore magnificent fruits for the country.  The institute are now being abolished, finished, destroyed and the director of the new body will have responsibility not only for research but for the entire unreformed services which I forecast will not be nearly as good as they have been.  I cannot understand the mentality of a Minister who would try to argue that agricultural research will be as well served by a director who will have two other fields to serve.  The Minister knows that is not so.</P>
      <P>I know all the narks and grievances that gave rise to the abolition of An Foras Talúntais.  The Department of Agriculture have a few things to be proud of but they have a few things to be ashamed of, and this is one of them.  There is nothing this party can do to stop the passage of the Bill once the bit has been shoved between the Minister's teeth by the interested parties in the Department.  I reiterate that the situation in regard to the proper carrying out of research will have to be restored by a future Government who will not be as amenable to being pushed around by interested people in the Department as the Minister seems to think.</P>

Otherwise I would not have brought it to the House.  On the point in relation to the deputy director, when Fianna Fáil set up An Foras Talúntais they made no provision for such a post but a deputy director was appointed subsequently by the board because they felt it necessary to do so.  One of the purposes for which the board are being established is to see that there are adequate staff. If I were to decide what the staff should be I would be told by the Opposition that I would be dictating to the board before they were set up.</P>

      <P>The Minister is inclined to contradict himself on subsection (3) of the section.  On other sections he said he would leave the running of the functions to the authority that would be appointed.  Subsection (3) provides:</P>
      <P>The programme as adopted by the Board shall be submitted to the Minister for his approval.  The Minister may, in conveying approval, indicate such further amendments of the programme as he considers necessary.</P>
      <P>It goes on to say:</P>
      <P>The Board may, however, with the approval of the Minister, make such alterations to the programme as it subsequently considers necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is the approval of the Minister that I am concerned about.  Can we presume then that this affects factors outside of financial requirements, and can <Col N="232" /> we presume that if the board consider an item, either educational or one of research, important enough to be included, it can be deleted by the Minister under the subsection?  Why not give the authority full power to run their programme of research or education as he has indicated in the previous sections?  Why take the control from them here?  It is a contradiction by the Minister when one considers the other sections.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>A few minutes ago the Minister seemed to be greatly concerned with leaving the control with the director.  Subsection (3) would certainly give us cause for concern because, as Deputy Noonan has pointed out, the Minister may, in conveying approval, make such further amendments in the programme as he considers necessary.</P>
      <P>Over the last few years the stock phrases from this Government were &ldquo;financial constraint&rdquo; and &ldquo;shortage of money&rdquo;.  There is no doubt that if any agricultural development programmes went over the last few years to the Department they would be slashed.  In this subsection we are coming back to complete departmental control and that is what we must fear.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>This subsection proves conclusively that we are correct in stating that this board has no authority at all.  Subsection (3) places the Minister in the position of the board.  The board can do nothing here.  Everything has to be submitted to the Minister.  Questions of finance must be submitted to the Minister. Therefore in regard to any research or development programme the Minister can put down his foot and say it cannot be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I dealt with this fairly exhaustively when replying on Second Stage, but it might be no harm to spell out again what is intended here.  I stated on Second Stage that the Minister for Agriculture has responsibility for the development of all aspects of the agricultural industry. He has to satisfy himself that the necessary resources are applied to whatever sector needs support at any <Col N="233" /> time.  We have given an undertaking in this Bill that the moneys provided for this new authority will be not less in real terms than the moneys at present being provided for the separate authorities that are coming together in an integrated service.  That surely is an assurance to those concerned. We have just been told that the Government could decide to starve the services and provide no money for them.  Specific provision is being made that in real terms it cannot be less than it is at present.  Therefore Deputies should not have fears about something that cannot happen.</P>
      <P>The proposed authority will have such an influence on agricultural development that the Minister must satisfy himself that the programme is adequate before he gives it his approval to go ahead.  I think that is reasonable.  However, when the programme has been agreed, the authority will be completely free in carrying it out and in publishing their own results.  The Government will have nothing to do with publishing results and they will not compel them to publish results of the individual experiments on researches they are doing.  I think a Minister for Agriculture should not interfere in the day-to-day conduct of research or in the publication of the results of this research.  That should be the responsibility of the research authority, and that is the way I want it to remain.</P>

    <P>The position, however, is that most of the finance needed by the authority will come from the State.  While I have no intention of insisting that he who pays the piper should call the tune, a Minister for Agriculture could be charged by this House with evasion of responsibility if he were not concerned always with the setting up of priorities in regard to what projects ought to be undertaken at any time to promote the development of agriculture. I believe that it is a gross exaggeration to say that it will impinge on the freedom of the staff of the authority if the Minister is interested in and concerned about what this new authority, that is all-embracing in its service to agriculture, should be engaged in.  In almost every country <Col N="234" /> around the world the Minister for Agriculture takes a vital interest in the functions which will be the concern of the authority, and I think that is as it should be.  This does not prevent such countries being among the leaders in agricultural development, and the countries to which I am referring are the envy of most of us. Therefore, I could not possibly accept that there is anything wrong about this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I would ask the Minister to tell the House that this section does not mean what I suspect it means, that people on the staff, whether they be specialists of one kind or another engaged in research or advisory or educational work, will all be equated and made into a kind of milk pudding mixture in which men will lose their identity and be stamped with a particular grade, a Department of Agriculture grade, like eggs and the possible reward for specialisation which might go to a more independent authority will be gone under the provisions of this section?  I would ask the Minister to enlighten us as to the true meaning of this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>In this section the method of recruitment and the determination of the staff's conditions of service are set out, and the board of the authority are given the widest possible discretion in regard to staff matters.  Why should people lose their identity suddenly when they are run by another board?  Why should that board decide that a man with certain qualifications should not be put in an appropriate position and get an appropriate job to do?  That will give him his own identity if he has what is necessary to identify himself in his work.  I know something about the people Deputy Gibbons is concerned about.  These people will always come through as exceptional people if they are entitled to identification.  They are part of a bigger organisation and that is a good thing for them as well as for the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of people have voiced their concern about the position of staff within the new authority.  I take <Col N="239" /> this opportunity to dispel these anxieties which are, I am certain, totally unwarranted.  First, it has been suggested that the considerable freedom given to the board in section 33, which will take effect immediately following the establishment of the authority, will be nullified through the subsequent application of section 34 which requires the board to submit a staff scheme or schemes for the regulation, control and management of the authority staff to the Minister and to the Minister for the Public Service for their approval.  The point is that there is no reason why the autonomy in regard to staff matters which the board will enjoy initally by virtue of section 33 should not be subsequently incorporated in the general scheme or schemes under section 34. A good deal of anxiety has been felt about this matter and I wanted to clear it.  What I am saying is that people come into the authority with certain rights.  They retain those rights absolutely and no staff scheme can change them unless the staff want voluntarily to accept what is being offered in the new staff scheme that may be subsequently prepared.  Therefore, in my view there should be no fears for staff coming into this authority.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I am relieved by the assurances given by the Minister, but which are not necessarily contained in section 33, in relation to the staff transfer situation.  It is undoubtedly true that there has been a good deal of concern about the full implications of this section.  There is a particular difficulty in relation to this section and that is that the board will be given authority under it to determine from time to time the qualifications, numbers, grades, tenure of office, conditions of service and so on, of the staff of the new authority.  This is, of course, subject to sections 34 and 65.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I am pleased to note the Minister has amended section 65, the full import of section 33 is still a matter of some concern.  It is not unfair to draw the Minister's attention to the somewhat similar proposals <Col N="240" /> which are contained in the Bill relating to the National Board of Science and Technology where such stringency as is seen in sections 33 and 34 are not to be found.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to discuss section 33 in its entirely because subsections (4) and (5) are subject to sections 34 and 65. Perhaps we should have taken sections 33 and 34 together.  In no way should the concern of the staff of the Agricultural Institute be heightened by the complex staff industrial relations situation which inevitably exists in any relatively large organisation.</P>
    <P>While I am certain the Minister will honour the undertakings he has given that in no way will staff conditions be worsened on transfer&mdash;that is implicit, clearly understood and accepted by the staff&mdash;nevertheless, I would have been happier, and the trade unions involved would have been happier, if section 33 had been permitted to stand apart without the caveat being entered into in relation to section 34.</P>
    <P>As an ex-trade union official, I do not know of any other legislation, even when we were drafting for organisations like AnCO, the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards and so on, where such implicit control was inserted.  I am fearful that there may be industrial relations problems in relation to section 33.  Admittedly the board can now proceed, on immediate transition, to determine the qualifications, numbers, grades and so on subject to section 34, that is, subject to their submitting a staff scheme as soon as convenient.</P>
    <P>In any organisation where there is a wide variety of grades, research staffs and so on employed, it is almost impossible to define just what is a staff scheme.  Knowing how bloody-minded some people can be, it may take an inordinately long time to get a consensus, particularly with a new board, on what precisely constitutes a staff scheme.  Under section 33 this would be subject to the Minister, the senior hierarchy of his Department, the Minister for the Public Service and the Houses of the Oireachtas.  Perhaps the Minister would have a fresh look at this before Report Stage so that undue fears may be mitigated.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="241" /> I fully accept the Minister's good faith in this regard.  I know his intentions are the very best but I am concerned lest it would unnecessarily give rise to areas of what one might call disaffection and contrariness which would impose undue restrictions on the negotiating staff procedures, particularly of the Agricultural Institute.  Perhaps I might remind the Minister that his ministerial colleagues when introducing legislation did not find it necessary to have such rigidity as exists in this Bill.  Sections 33 and 34 could be composed in a more flexible manner.  I share the Minister's view that we need integration and rationalisation, but unfortunately some people are interpreting this as a dilution of their status, prospects or salary scales.</P>
    <P>Inevitably one is suspicious of a new organisation.  One always tends to fear the worst.  I would be quite happy with subsections (4) and (5) standing as they are without being subject to section 34.  Somebody must be the final arbitrator, the Minister for Agriculture in relation to the global provisions and the Minister for the Public Service in relation to staff structuring.  Organisations are, of course, very complex.  Invariably one has in them a wide variety of expertise and skills.  Invariably there are certain precedents.  Over the 20-year period of their existence the Agricultural Institute had built up their own structure and their own negotiating procedures.  It is important that in this transition undue friction should be avoided.  To avoid anything like friction the Minister should have a look at sections 33 and 34 between now and Report Stage to see if there is a necessity to have staff schemes formally approved by the Oireachtas.  God knows, we have enough to do without embroiling ourselves in staffing arrangements.</P>

      <P>I fully appreciate the difficulties we are facing here and I agree with Deputy Desmond there is no precedent.  However, there is no time within which a scheme or schemes must be prepared.  The section simply requires the board to submit a scheme as soon as it finds it convenient to do so.  The reason for specifying the submission of such a scheme is to provide for the closer integration of the existing staff groups which will be combined within the new authority so that the staff will act as a team in a proper environment designed to make the maximum contribution to the development of agriculture. The scheme will have to be agreed voluntary and so it should not hold any fears for the staff.  I repeat that the existing staff come in with all the rights they have at the moment <Col N="243" /> unchanged and with all the conditions they enjoy at present.  The approach will be one of encouragement, not coercion.  That, in my view, would be counter-productive.  There is no question of the conditions of the staff transferred being worsened.  I emphasise that.</P>

      <P>I would like to accept the Minister's assurances but I simply cannot.  First of all, I do not see the necessity for the collectivisation of all the people involved in all the different sectors amalgamated in the new authority.  It is as if the Minister put all of them into khaki uniforms of the same kind and deprived them of any personality or identity of their own.  I do not think this will be readily accepted by people in the service, whether on the advisory services, in what is left of the remnants of An Foras Talúntais or in agricultural education.  I do not think it will be popular with any of them.  I do not see any need for treating a man whose business is teaching in the same way as a man whose business is research or possibly a third person whose work is advisory.  They are three different separate functions.  This section will give rise to trouble because it seeks to impose uniformity that does not exist.</P>

      <P>There is no doubt in my mind but that it will give rise to trouble.  However, the fact that there is nothing binding on the staff and that such a scheme can come into existence only with the agreement of the staff makes it worth-while.  I was asked if I would be prepared to look at this matter again before Report Stage and, of course, I am prepared to do this.  If anything it puts additional work and responsibility on whoever is in my place and on the people responsible for the effective working of the organisation subsequently but if it could be done it would be desirable to bring the staff together, to let them feel they were all staff of the one authority and as a result, they would work more as a team.  That was the reason for including the provision.  I am not particularly tied to it and, if <Col N="244" /> it is the wish of the House that I should look at it between now and Report Stage I will do so.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for his comments on this matter. Perhaps the inclusion of the words &ldquo;following consultation with the relevant staff organisation concerned&rdquo; after the words &ldquo;the board shall prepare and submit to the Minister&rdquo; might be considered.  This would be a major acceptance that these things are subject to negotiations.  I am only suggesting consultations at this stage because inevitably the question of negotiations will arise.  In relation to section 4 the Minister may consider it unnecessary.  For example, the order for an increase in the salaries of Deputies was placed before the House some weeks ago but it will not go through before the middle of May.  We will not get any money before June but people in the country will think we are getting another rise.  The Minister might want to have an urgent amendment of the staff scheme following national wage negotiations or some internal negotiations.  The board might submit this to the Department and it would have to be before the House for 21 sitting days.  We might be in the middle of the summer recess&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It is generally accepted that the functions and duties <Col N="245" /> of committees of agriculture as we have known them are going to be radically changed by the provisions of this section and this will apply to the composition of committees.  The last function they had as independent bodies in the appointment of temporary staff is mercifully being taken away.  However, there is a considerable opinion that new arrangements for the new committees will convert them into rubber stamp organisations.  It is thought they may talk until the cows come home but they will have little effect on policy if what they recommend does not meet with the approval of the Minister and his most immediate servants in the Department of Agriculture.</P>
      <P>I made certain suggestions about the advisory services.  They are my own ideas and I stand over them and if the Minister wants to regale the House by quoting them again he is at liberty to do so.  There is a large body of opinion, in his party as well as in other parties, that would reject the removal from committees of agriculture of the last little vestige of authority which they had.  I do not approve of the creation of rubber stamp bodies of any kind.  I should prefer to see proper county committees of agriculture elected possibly by a restricted electorate composed of people from the farming and food producing industries, including food processing as well as food producing.  An electorate such as that could exercise their franchise just as other people use their local authority franchise.  I put that idea before the House as my own idea of a possible way out, of creating a democratically elected worth-while organisation.  The individuals concerned would be elected by people from the food industry to carry out similar functions to those envisaged in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is an anomaly in this Bill. This afternoon the Minister accredited some considerable importance to the General Council of County Committees of Agriculture.  He indicated that their representation on the board will be at least one member.  It could possibly be two, three or four.  Under this section the real effectiveness of the committees of agriculture is taken away. A considerable part of their democratic <Col N="246" /> structure is taken away along with it. It is all very fine to say that we will have representatives from the IFA, the ICMSA and other organisations, like Macra na Feirme, that may or may not be represented on the committee of agriculture.  It is unsatisfactory that the people we are talking about will not have been elected by the people from the industry as they could fairly easily be elected by people from the farming industry or from the industries that develop from farming.</P>
    <P>That is not the kind of committee we will get under section 36.  We will get a committee that is neither fish, flesh nor good red herring.  There are some realities that stand out no matter what one's general approach to agricultural research and advice may be. One of those is the very strong county allegiance.  It does not matter that one might say that the county boundaries were prepared by different English administrations in the country in the 16th and 17th centuries but the county allegiance is very strong.  One has to live with it whether or not one likes it.  If we take a sample of popular opinion from farmers and people in the industry in general, a very heavy majority I believe favour the continuance of the committee of agriculture. Since this is so, the committee of agriculture should be a worth-while community representative of the industry. I do not think we can get that under section 36 and, therefore, I oppose it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am opposed to this section because it suggests that county committees of agriculture will only be in an advisory capacity.  The way they will be constituted under this Bill the people who pay the piper will have very little to say.  As the Minister knows, the people to whom he will give representation are elected by the county committee of agriculture.  The Minister proposes a 50 : 50 basis on the advisory committee.  All the powers which the county committees had are taken from them.  We are not sorry about some of them particularly the one relating to the appointment of temporary staff.  I believe the county committees of agriculture were doing a reasonably good job.  I cannot see what the benefit will be.  I am chairman <Col N="247" /> of a county committee of agriculture and I know we would like to do a lot more.  We could only get so many pence in the pound.  Since it was increased, the amount of money is still inadequate.  We have still to get a certain amount of money from the ratepayers.  It is 50 : 50 in the east and in the west of Ireland it is 75 : 25.  That is the ratio of the collection of money from the ratepayers.</P>
      <P>It could happen, if some public representatives did not want a particular man to get on to the committee, and they lined up with rural organisations that no member of the local authority or any elected representatives need be on the general council.  The general council will get direct representation on to the board.  This is completely undemocratic. We all want to see farming organisations on the county committees of agriculture but at least 75 per cent of them should be elected representatives so that we can be sure that the people who pay the piper know a little about how the tune is being called.</P>
      <P>This is not a party issue.  I do not know what is wrong with this House. Everybody knows political parties and that one must toe the line or get out when a vote is called but I did not think we were compelled to sit down and not express our views.  I am always prepared to vote for my party but I will stand up and express my views.  I know the views about county committees of agriculture on the Government side of the House but there are empty benches there this evening.  I cannot understand why they do not come in here and try to convince the Minister to change the system which he has put into the Bill. The Minister said he wanted us to be the watch dog for the people but this is a watch dog without any teeth whatever.  We are going away from democracy here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know that good people may get on to this new council but they have no responsibility.  They have not to go back to anybody or give an account of their stewardship to the people who <Col N="248" /> pay the piper.  If the elected representatives do not do a good job, the people will tell them in four or five years time to get out.  We are taking from the people who pay the piper the power to remove people who do not do a good job when 75 per cent of the members of those committees are not public representatives.</P>
    <P>I know that the Minister can come back at me and say that this is not the case.  My own county can be fired back at me.  It does not mean that any county do everything correctly.  In the interests of democracy the public representatives should be in the majority so that enough of them get on to the body that the Minister will give representation on.  It is important that the county committees are constituted from elected representatives from every county.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as I can see, the functions are nil.  As Deputy Gibbons said, they are a rubber stamp. County committees cannot put up programmes because they will be vetoed along the line.  Now there will be a board consisting of 24 members that will examine programmes submitted by every county.  If the board do not like a certain programme submitted by a particular committee, they may go back to that committee saying, perhaps: &ldquo;You will have to modify this in some way&rdquo;.  When the money is pooled, what will happen committees at present doing a good job who are, perhaps, spending a little more money than others?  The board will have a say in what will it be spent in, say, County Galway, County Kildare and so on.  They will vet the programmes submitted by the various county committees. When one has no responsibility there is the tendency to prepare very elaborate programmes and such may be the case with regard to people who did very little before this board was set up.  For instance, if I were a member of a committee with no responsibility but charged merely with <Col N="249" /> the job of preparing a programme of agricultural advice in my county, I could prepare one that would be completely unrealistic from a financial point of view.  Is there a danger that, when the county committees of agriculture have lost their status, they would be somewhat irresponsible in preparing programmes for their counties?</P>
      <P>I believe the Minister, in this Bill, will be doing a bad day's work by taking that responsibility from the present county committees of agriculture. At present they know the amount of money they can get from the ratepayers; they have to keep within that estimate and spend it to the best of their ability.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the Chair's ruling but I thought it was relevant to the duties of the county committees of agriculture with which we are now dealing.  The functions of such committees are to prepare programmes and submit them to the new authority. I contend that a committee, having no responsibility, might prepare very elaborate programmes.  I am afraid also that, when all the programmes from all the rubber stamp committees have been submitted to the authority for fine combing, the new board will have an impossible task.  I should like the Minister's opinion on that aspect. I am speaking of the advisory committees, having no responsibility, everybody wanting to do the best they can, getting as much money as possible from the authority.  I know that the ratepayers of such counties will have to put up the money but the county committees will not care if they do not have to account to their ratepayers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>They will not because they will not be public representatives, except, perhaps, very few of them.  Therefore, they will be able to prepare any type of elaborate <Col N="250" /> programme and shove it over on the ratepayers of their county.  The problem I foresee is that of rubber stamp committees preparing unrealistic programmes with no responsibility whatever for their implementation or financing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>Subsection (1) says that every committee of agriculture shall submit the programme to the authority for consideration by the board, which programme may or may not be accepted.  Will the county committees of agriculture themselves have any further function in this regard? Can the relevant programme be returned to the committee in question by the board for further scrutiny with, perhaps, further consideration by the board subsequently?</P>
      <P>Subsection (2) (a) says:</P>
      <P>Every committee of agriculture shall have, in addition to the powers and functions mentioned in subsection (1), the functions that were exercised or performed, or were capable of being exercised or performed, by it immediately before the commencement of this section....</P>
      <P>This brings me to the point raised by Deputy Gibbons about the functions of the county committees of agriculture, the powers being transferred by them to the new board.  What will be left to the county committees of agriculture? One might answer that they will submit programmes for their counties that may or may not be accepted by the board.  Therefore, the situation will be that we will have county committees of agriculture with no real power.  Here-tofore they had the power of selecting and appointing staff&mdash;although that was not very satisfactory from the point of view of temporary staff. Nevertheless, they had the power to provide education and advice which, as was rightly pointed out by Deputy Gibbons, is now being taken from them.  Henceforth they will be rubber stamp committees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputy Gibbons further pointed out, it would be far better to have no committees at all than have ones such as are proposed in this Bill which would be more or less talking shops or rubber stamp committees for want of <Col N="251" /> a better description.  The Minister should give further thought to these county committees.  I am not speaking here of their composition, which will arise later in the Bill, but rather of their functions under this section. Perhaps the Minister would comment on the power the committee may or may not have if a programme, as submitted by them, is rejected by the board.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>The question may correctly be raised: have the county committees of agriculture any functions at all left?  In future, I fear their programme will tend to be over-ambitious, that they will aim high knowing that such programmes will be diminished, thus leading to a lot of frustration when they would see that they had no real power left.</P>
      <P>I foresee great danger in this Bill for the weaker agricultural counties, that they will not receive proper attention. There arises also the question of the pooling of funds.  How does the Minister propose that such funds be used because it would be very difficult to have them spread evenly.  Certainly, I feel it will be the cause of a lot of frustration within the county committees of agriculture and that they will become ineffective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I might say that the functions of the county committees of agriculture are spelled out very clearly in the White Paper.  If the House wishes me to restate those functions, I shall do so.  My opinion is that such committees of agriculture will continue to perform a very important function under the new authority.  Any board, and particularly that of the new authority composed of the people I described earlier, would be less than responsible and would not be doing their job properly had they not considerable regard to the programmes put up by the people living on the spot.  Deputy Gibbons is quite right when he says that there is and will continue to be a lot of county loyalty, so to speak, and pride in what happens locally.  This is a good thing, but they are given a very important role in the first instance. They will have to decide what they <Col N="252" /> believe is the sort of programme that should be provided by the authority for individual areas in the county and individual counties.</P>
      <P>Deputy Noonan asked what they can do when they have that done.  Can they do nothing more about it?  Can they appeal to anybody else if this is rejected? Of course the answer is that they can appeal.  Section 36 (1) (a) says they may:</P>
      <P>review, and make recommendations to the Minister and the Board, as appropriate, regarding, the operation of such programme and the schemes operated by the Minister in the county;</P>
      <P>When they submit a programme they can follow it up and make representations either directly to the Minister or to the board.  How effectively county committees will continue to function in future will depend to a very considerable extent on the sort of man the CAO in the county happens to be whether or not he is a dynamic, interested person, concerned with providing the best possible services for the farmers in that area.  It will depend too on the quality of the county committees.</P>
      <P>Deputy Callanan is concerned about the quality.  We will be talking later on about that.  He does not agree with the composition, but this is not the section under which to discuss that. However, it is unnecessary for me to go down through (a), (b), (c) and (d) of the responsibilities that are left with the county committees.  They are important responsibilities and they will continue to be very important.  I would be extremely disappointed if the committees regarded them as anything else and if they did not make the maximum use of organisations in existence at the moment and use them as they should be used.</P>

There is a lot of development that could be done in agriculture in every area.  If there was a dynamic committee in each area not responsible for paying the piper, the Minister will have a very <Col N="254" /> heavy and expensive programme coming from every county if the committees are worth their salt.  The Minister must say whether the board or the Minister will prevail finally.  If we in Galway put up a scheme which is not acceptable to the board and we appeal to the Minister will he go to the board and say &ldquo;The county committee have put up a scheme and why have the board turned it down&rdquo;?  The board may still turn it down.  Is it the Minister or the board who then has the final decision as to whether the programme will be allowed or not?

He will have committees putting forward a fairly ambitious programme which in all probability will be turned down in many cases and will be going to the Minister for appeal and the matter will be back in the political ring with a tug here and a tug there to see that one county would get more than the other. Does he not see a danger in this that he will have to set up, as the Minister for Local Government had, an appeals board?</P>

Part of the responsibility of the board will be to see that every area in the country <Col N="255" /> gets fair play as far as the money available from the State and from the local authorities will go to providing the best possible services available. Deputy Callanan does not like the job of going back to the county council to look for some of this money.  He has that responsibility at the moment.

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>It has emerged from discussion of this section that both the Minister and this side of the House share the view that committees of agriculture in counties are necessary. My party holds the view that committees, as the Minister envisages them in this Bill, will be deprived of any real value and of any function. The Minister appears to feel obliged to retain committees of agriculture because it would be politically unacceptable to do anything else but in retaining them he wants to deprive them of any effectiveness that they might have.  I put it to the Minister that this is not necessary.</P>
      <P>Since we require committees of agriculture we require them to be as effective as possible.  In order to be as effective as possible they should be elected by people from the industry. I reject, and have always rejected, the idea that people from casual occupations have a real function on committees of agriculture.  Other people in my party and in this House do not share my view.  It should be possible to have an electoral list confined to people in the industry, farmers, farm workers and their families, workers in the fruit processing industry and their families, people in industries like Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann whose business is producing and selling food, whose livelihood and future is wrapped up in the food industry.  They have a legitimate case for forming a specialised committee in each county to represent the food industry people, a committee with real functions who can say that they are the democratically elected representatives of the people from agriculture.  Elections of this kind can be carried out at the same time as local government elections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can see no objection to a person who is a Member of the Dáil, a county council or a corporation, being also a member of a committee of <Col N="257" /> agriculture, provided he is from the industry.  Until people have a democratic base and have the right to call themselves democratically elected representatives of the people, they cannot insist on a certain status, and the committees of agriculture will not mean much.  They will mean less than ever when the Minister's Bill is law.  They meant little enough under the two-tier appointment system we have at present.  Under the system I am suggesting, people from the farming organisations, from Macra na Feirme and so on, could put themselves forward for election on the same basis as everybody else.  People from the processing side of the industry are entitled to representation.  It is feasible to make a restricted electoral roll which would carry out the business of electing these committees of agriculture.  If we do that we will have committees of agriculture with a real function.  I would be grateful for the Minister's views on this suggestion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>When a scheme is submitted, presumably by a local committee, the Minister can either accept or reject it.  I am referring specifically to subsection (2).  This seems to bear out what we said earlier, that the new committees can talk their heads off for as long as they like but if the Minister decides a scheme is not to his liking he can reject it.  I do not believe this is a good system in modern days and it will bear very heavily on counties like Leitrim and Mayo, areas like west Cork, west Limerick, parts of Kerry and the Ulster counties in our jurisdiction. Subsection (4) will bear on county rates and militate against development in poorer counties, possibly to the overall advantage of the better-off counties.  This is contrary to what should be national policy. If I am mistaken in what I have been saying I apologise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no change here.  Seventy-five per cent of the salaries of staffs was met by the State and that will continue to be the position in those counties.  We can therefore say that special consideration was and is being given to poorer counties. If the board have the money and if those counties want more staff there is no reason why they cannot get them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Fisheries (Mr. Donegan)</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the debate was adjourned last night I had had only half-a-minute to speak.  To my mind, the matter at issue is straightforward and clear.  All the scientific evidence available to me is to the effect that for some years we have been over-exploiting our salmon stocks and that if we did not take action by way of conservation measures over and above those in existence, irreparable damage would be caused to our stocks.  The limitation in salmon drift nets to 30 meshes is considered to be the most equitable and effective.  These measures were mooted last year and because of interference with fishermen it was decided, in the wisdom of the Parliamentary Secretary of the day, to postpone them for one year.  That gave everybody full notice of what was being done.</P>
      <P>Deputy Gallagher implies the bye-law is unfair on the grounds that drift net fishing, particularly drift net fishing at sea, is not responsible for the decline in the stocks.  He contends that in the open sea the salmon have ample scope for avoiding the nets and that the real cause of the problem is the scale of catch by the private traps on a limited number of rivers.  However, taking the total 1976 catch of salmon, we find that drift nets accounted for approximately 70 per cent of the catch, the draft nets, 20 per cent of the catch, all other commercial engines, which included traps, seven per cent, and rod fishing, three per cent.  These figures clearly disprove Deputy Gallagher's assertions.  Our statistics for 1975 and 1976 are still provisional as they have not yet been published in our annual reports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will now advert briefly to the matter I first gave mention to, as anybody in charge of fisheries would, that is the question of catching Irish poachers.  In their deputations to me drift net and draft net fishermen have complained that on the bays of the counties of Mayo, Limerick and Clare <Col N="262" /> trawlers are spreading long drift nets far above the legal maximum, and that these drift nets extend for literally miles and that huge catches of salmon are being got by these trawlers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Foreign trawlers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the House and fishermen in general will agree with me that if such is the case, those trawler fishermen who are illegally fishing should be apprehended and brought to justice.  In relation to the catching of these poachers, the resources of the boards of conservators are totally inadequate.  The boards of conservators always act first in regard to rivers and then to fishing along the bays and drift net fishing in the estuaries.  Some of them have pilot launches for the apprehension of poachers.  Pilot launches are not much use 15 or 20 miles out at sea and the apprehension of a marauding trawler by a launch of the board of conservators is not physically possible. In that regard I have indicated today to my colleague, the Minister for Defence, that we shall have a discussion, official to official, and Minister to Minister, next week so that we can decide in what manner we shall try to apprehend these poachers who are capturing very large hauls of salmon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware that in so doing I may become politically unpopular and that the apprehension of an Irish poacher is something that may be regarded as quite foreign to anything that happened before.  It may be suggested that I am for the lords of the manor and not for the poor fishermen.  Large trawler owners are not poor fishermen. There is a trawler extant at the moment, not in Irish waters but bought with Irish money and crewed, thank goodness, by a good young Irishman, that cost £1,100,000.  The average cost of a trawler now with very little frills and fancies on it of the order of 65 to 80 feet is a minimum of £350,000 to £360,000.  Therefore this type of illegal fishing engine, and that is what it is, is extremely deleterious to our catch of salmon and may be far worse than the question of drift netting which we are now discussing.  I am told <Col N="263" /> that hauls of salmon worth as much as £10,000 and £20,000 in one haul have been effected.</P>

      <P>Deputy Gallagher also implied that the owners of these salmon traps are not required to give annual returns of catch.  This is not so.  Under the Statistics Act, however, we are precluded from publishing details of their catch that would enable the catch of an individual owner to be identified.  I mentioned earlier that the catch of all commercial engines including traps but excluding drift and draft nets constituted about 7 per cent of the total catch in 1976.  I might now add that the total catch of the traps on their own was as low as 2.5 per cent of the overall landings of salmon.  So much for the private trap owners.  We are not for <Col N="265" /> the lords and masters of the soil.  We are for good salmon fishing by the decent salmon fishermen of this country.  We are for their future and for the expansion of their trade and the increasing of their catch by legitimate means.</P>
      <P>Deputy Fahey, while appearing to support the bye-law, contends that it leans too heavily on a particular section of the coast that it will reduce the catch of Ardmore fishermen by as much as 75 per cent.  The technical officers of my Department have produced to me a figure of 10 per cent. They are familiar with the conditions in this area.  They have carried out tagging experiments there and would strongly contest the claim of a possible loss of 75 per cent in earnings.  In any event, as Deputy Fahey must know, it is not always easy to frame a conservation measure so that it will give an acceptable solution for every part of the coast.  The bye-law in question has generally been accepted as fair and just.  If we were to make exclusions for certain areas I have no doubt this would lead to pressures from other areas for concessions in regard to their fishing.</P>
      <P>In any event, I have promised, and I will carry out, a review of the bye-law at the end of the 1977 season in the light of experience.  Even if the bye-law does pinch, it should provide a much-needed bonus by way of additional escapement of fish to fresh waters and the increased spawning there achieved will be of great benefit to all sectors of the salmon industry in the years ahead.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Fahey referred to the economic difficulties of drift net fishermen in his area, I do not think it would be out of place for me to give the following statistics.  In 1967, 101 drift net fishermen in the Lismore fishery district earned £342,000 from salmon fishing, or an average of £3,386 per licence.  In the Waterford district, 218 drift net men earned £573,000 or an average of £2,628 per licence.  Also, one must bear in mind that these earnings are made in a season of approximately ten weeks. In all these circumstances I cannot accept the motion.</P>

      <P>It is an extraordinary performance that the Minister who is responsible for our trouble in putting down this motion, and for other troubles which are not the subject matter of this debate, should make such a rapid exit after fulminating and saying nothing for about five or six minutes.</P>
      <P>In supporting this motion, I want to endorse the view expressed by Deputy Gallagher and Deputy Fahey. We in Fianna Fáil as a party are and as a Government always were, and will be concerned about the fishing industry and its future.  We favour any conservation measures introduced by any Government and any measures which propose to preserve our fish stocks, including salmon.  I want to reiterate that view with all the emphasis I can command.  It would appear from what the Minister said before he disappeared, and what the Parliamentary Secretary said last night, that we do not support that view and that we in Fianna Fáil are virtually poachers and that we support poachers.  That is virtually what the Minister said.  If he did not say it, he implied it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to remind the House that the first real and effective step towards salmon fishery conservation was the bye-law introduced by Deputy Fahey when he was Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries in 1972.  That <Col N="267" /> bye-law restricted the number of salmon drift net licences.  Contrary to what the Parliamentary Secretary said last night I want to state categorically that the genuine traditional salmon drift fishermen of this country, and certainly of the part I represent, the Ardmore, Youghal, Lismore area, did not kick up a hullabaloo about it.  They welcomed it as a measure which would protect them and as a measure which was intended to exclude speculators of all kinds including professional men of all kinds who held licences.  As a matter of fact, my colleague Deputy Gallagher held one of those licences and by virtue of that bye-law he lost it.  He did not complain.  We in Fianna Fáil did not complain about it.  At the time it was made a political issue at a general election by members of the present Coalition Government.</P>
    <P>The fishermen welcomed that measure and felt it was for their benefit.  It transpired that it was.  They still object to the system of allocation of licences which followed upon the introduction of that measure.  No system can be perfect.  The system still contains a large number of anomalies which exclude genuine fishermen who in the ordinary course of events, would be entitled to hold licences.  I refer in particular to young fishermen who have done the Bord Iascaigh Mhara course, who were given boats by BIM, subsidised by BIM, and who cannot qualify for a drift net licence by virtue, if I may use the legal phrase, of the three years' equity clause or condition which requires that a fisherman must have been fishing for three years previous to the date of his application for a drift net licence.  That is very unfair.  I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to have a look at that matter and rectify it if possible, especially in cases of hardship.  Perhaps he has protegés of his own with boats and gear belonging to BIM who are not allowed to fish for salmon.</P>
    <P>I also want to endorse the general remarks and arguments advanced by Deputy Gallagher in regard to the conservation of salmon stocks on a <Col N="268" /> national scale.  I want particularly to refer to his criticism of the activities of the commercial interests which the Parliamentary Secretary got mixed up last night with the rod men.  I agree with the sentiments expressed by Deputy Barrett.  The riparian owners, the successors to the landlords, who own the rivers seem to be able to kill and slaughter fish without any restriction or restraint whatsoever and to do so with impunity.  They can use dragnets and all kinds of sophisticated devices to slaughter untold thousands of salmon.  We apparently do not have the figures and the facts about the number of fish killed by these gentlemen.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about the situation in the Youghal-Ardmore district.  Like Deputy Fahey, I think a special case should be made for the fishermen in that district.  The situation in that area is <i>sui generis</i> and special and unique circumstances apply.  The Parliamentary Secretary, the Minister and the officials, some of whom are present, are aware of those unique circumstances because they have been told about the situation repeatedly and eloquently by members of the Youghal Fishermen's Association.  They know that because of a combination of conditions and circumstances, such as tides, currents, the vagaries of wind and weather and even sometimes the idiosyncracies of the fishermen themselves, that deep nets have been fished in that area for generations without any interruption by the Department. As I said, this case was made by them frequently and the fishermen thought the case was accepted by the Department, the officials and the experts we hear so much about, but apparently it was not, because they still insist on imposing this prohibition on these fishermen, who are in a unique situation, and the fishermen in other parts of the country.</P>
    <P>I would also have thought that the fishermen and their spokesmen had convinced the Department that no injury had been done over the years to the stocks of fish in that area by these fishermen and that there was no threat to the conservation and preservation of salmon by this type of fishing.  By <Col N="269" /> way of deputation and other representations recently I thought they had convinced the Department that more salmon went up the Blackwater last year than ever before and that the weirs, traps and other devices used by riparian owners were so over-worked that on a number of occasions they had to be emptied.  That is the information I got.  I submit it is better information than the hearsay the Minister used before he ran out of this House about what was happening, and about the salmon catches of £20,000 and £30,000 which were being landed off the coast of Mayo and Limerick.</P>
    <P>I would like to remind the House of another argument advanced by these people.  The fishermen in the upper reaches of the Blackwater have made no complaint to the Department about any damage done by drift net fishermen in the area.  Those fishermen have the complete and enthusiastic support of the fishermen in the upper reaches of the river, for their case to be excluded from the provisions of this Order.  It is also a fact&mdash;it is not hearsay&mdash;that the Chairman of the Board of Conservators for the Lismore area is in favour of making an exception of the drift fishermen in the Youghal-Ardmore area.  He told the Department that he is in favour if not of a 60 mesh net, then of a compromise 45 mesh net.  If that is not so, I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary, the Minister or somebody to deny it.</P>
    <P>The Irish Salmon and Inshore Fishermen's Association represent salmon interests all over the country&mdash; including fishermen, distributors, exporters and so on&mdash;with the possible exception of West Cork, and they are completely in favour of making an exception of the Youghal area.  They have written to the Minister and said they were in complete agreement with the introduction of this bye-law, except in the case of the Lismore district where the fishermen fish traditionally. They made a statement to that effect in the national newspapers and the Minister has a copy.  These people are interested in fishing and the conservation and preservation of salmon stocks.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="270" /> The most convincing argument of all is the attitude of the fishermen directly involved.  I refer to the members of the Youghal Fishermen's Association. I know them and I assure the House they are particularly concerned with the preservation of stocks in that area because they are concerned about the preservation of their own livelihoods. They are traditional fishermen whose forebears never did anything except engage in fishing from time immemorial.  I defy anybody from the Minister down to the lowest official in the Department to deny that these men have been meticulous in their observation of the regulations with regard to the hours of fishing, the days, the location and the treatment of the fishing grounds.  They have been their own bailiffs.  Since the association was founded 25 years ago they have patrolled and policed the fishing grounds.  I do not think there has been any more than, perhaps, two prosecutions, and these were brought at the instance of the fishermen themselves.  I have made inquiries, and the people prosecuted were not traditional genuine drift net fishermen.</P>
    <P>Apparently the Minister will persist in enforcing this bye-law.  If he does persist I warn him that he will work great hardship on these fishermen.  This will be a real threat to their traditional livelihood.  There are about 40 boats involved with a crew of three in each, something over 100 men.  These will be thrown on the unemployment scrapheap, which is large enough already. If a factory employing 50 or 100 people were closing down there would be a regular outcry, but here the Minister and his officials are knowingly and deliberately jeopardising the traditional livelihood of more than 100 people. Many of these are full-time fishermen. In the off season for salmon they engage in lobster fishing, herring fishing or trawling for other kinds of fish.  This merely complements the salmon fishing, and unless they can make a reasonable income from salmon fishing they will not be able to maintain the boats and the crews and therefore they will be unable to fish for other fish.  This bye-law will wind up in making not alone salmon extinct but the breed of fishermen in that area also extinct.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="271" /> I was on a deputation to the Minister, and I do not know whether he understood or whether he was even interested in what the fishermen were trying to tell him.  I am not an expert on salmon fishing but I certainly understood one point they made.  If the fishermen are compelled to use the shallow net the resultant situation will not lead to conservation.  It will lead to chaos, confusion and consternation. There will be 60 or 70 boats concerntrating on the mouth of the river where there are only a dozen berths and these 60 or 70 boats will be manoeuvring to get these berths.  In that situation the inevitable result will be that no fish at all will get up the river except during the off-fishing hours.  That will lead to what the Minister and his advisers tell us they want to prevent.</P>
    <P>The fishermen have been dealt a very harsh blow by the increase in the licence from £3 to £50, an unprecedented rise even for this Government under which everything is going up.  The Duke of Devonshire did not increase his licence.  There is naturally alarm and consternation among the fishermen. They feel that this is a civil right, and they are protesting with dignity and restraint against the erosion of that civil right.  When the Minister for Fisheries was appointed we were filled with great hope for the future of the industry.  We thought it would never again be treated as the poor relation of agriculture.  Unfortunately that has not been the evolution.  Our hopes have been dashed by a Minister from whom we expected so much.  He made a mess of the negotiations with regard to the fishery limits in collaboration with his colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs.</P>
    <P>In spite of that debate he tries to foist this intolerable situation on the fishermen of Ireland, and particularly on the drift salmon fishermen of Youghal and Ardmore.  There is a fear and suspicion that the Minister in order to restore his political image and reputation will use this issue to demonstrate his strength as a Minister, that he will exploit the misfortune of these fishermen to show his mettle as a Minister.  I hope these fears and <Col N="272" /> suspicions are unfounded, but the only way for the Minister to demonstrate this is to accede to our request to him.  Last night Deputy Fahey asked him to compromise, to take the advise of the chairman of the Lismore Board of Conservators, Mr. Villiers-Stuart, and give the fishermen of that area a 45 mesh net.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The salmon fishermen, those who fish for salmon on a commercial basis, have been under very powerful attack for some years past.  It has become evident, particularly in the past four years, that there is in existence a powerful lobby of people who are opposed to the use of drift nets and even draft nets for the catching of salmon.  This lobby represents some of the most influential personages in the industrial and commercial life of the country.  I have some experience of this lobby and the weight and finances that are available to them in their attack particularly against the drift net fishermen.  They have sponsored advertisements in public newspapers and they are responsible for articles in the papers that pointedly attack the drift net fishermen.  They have accused them of being responsible for the possible extinction of salmon as a species.</P>
      <P>As far back as 1967 this attack was carried out by that lobby.  The use of drift nets off the Galway coast was prohibited in 1967.  I attended certain meetings at that time and discussions were held among local small farmers and part-time fishermen as to how we could make it legal to use drift nets off the west coast.  There were three fishery districts involved, Ballinakill, Connemara and Galway.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister at the time had the authority to hold a public inquiry and to decide whether he would allow drift netting off the Galway coast again.  It was barred under a law of 1908.  At the inquiry these people had to show their faces.  They emerged represented by some of the leading senior counsel in the country.  The money and funds were behind the lobby.  It was a lobby of riparian owners, whose sole interests is in <Col N="273" /> maintaining their own position, the private ownership of some of the most valuable inland salmon fisheries in the country.</P>
    <P>The argument used at that time in opposing the legalising of drift netting for salmon off the Galway coast, a strong argument made by eminent lawyers on behalf of the lobby, was that if the Minister conceded the request in this instance it would threaten the life of salmon, and they said we could say goodbye to salmon as a species in our rivers.  The Minister used wise judgment when he came to decide on the arguments made for and against drift netting.  Happily he decided in favour of the fishermen who brought that application, through me, before him and to the public inquiry that followed.</P>
    <P>The figures, as recorded in the publication of the Inland Fisheries Commission, including appendices, show the catches from 1969 to 1974.  Despite the fact that the Minister allowed drift netting in those three fishery districts there is no indication of a fall-off in the quantity of salmon or in the number of species.  There is no indication of any threat to the salmon continuing as a species in the waters of this country.</P>
    <P>Those people with vested interests have used emotional arguments to oppose the small commercial fishermen who use boats to fish for salmon by drifting off our coasts.  They have been using those arguments for so long that the statistics are disproving them.  However, they still persist, and it is sad to see a new Minister, fresh in the Department, already influenced by this lobby. He is giving in and conceding to the arguments they have made and which they will continue to make.  The salmon drift net fishermen have been under attack for some years past, and it is a matter of great regret that a new Minister has imposed another restriction on them.</P>
    <P>The restriction on this occasion will hit hardest in the southern part of the country.  It will not have the same effect in the waters off the Galway and Mayo coasts.  There is a need for the larger net in the southern area, and <Col N="274" /> that need has been long established.  If there was not such a need these fishermen would be very foolish to use a 60 mesh net.  Has the Minister or the Parliamentary Secretary ever tried to haul in a 60 mesh net?  Do they know the amount of muscle that is required to drag in those nets into small boats? Having dragged in the net from the sea, possibly in rough weather, the fishermen may find only one salmon or no salmon in the net.  The net has then to be put out again and hauled in.  I have gone out with these fishermen and I was amazed at their preseverance in their very difficult business of making a living.  If it was not necessary to use a 60 mesh net in those waters I am sure they would use a 30 mesh net, as is being used mainly off the Galway coast.  Why should they impose this extra hardship on themselves if it was not the only way to fish successfully for salmon?  It is necessary to use the larger net because of the deeper waters and the conditions that apply in the area in being close to shipping lanes. This does not apply to the west coast.</P>
    <P>The Minister adopted a completely new attitude yesterday and again today in the course of his speech regarding his Department and the use of the Navy in fishing protection services off our coasts.</P>
    <P>For many years there have been well publicised complaints that foreign owned fishing trawlers have been poaching in Irish fishing waters along the west and down to the south, and we are aware that in recent years some of those foreign owned vessels have been poaching in the salmon grounds.  I have never heard a complaint that Irish owned trawlers were passing out those miles of drift netting the Minister referred to and were in fact fishing illegally 15, 20 and 30 miles out from the coast.  I have never heard that allegation made except against foreign owned trawlers.  It amazed me to hear the Minister make that allegation against the Mayo trawler owners.  It was unfortunate that he mentioned even the size of some of the boats, which would clearly indicate whether he had certain persons in mind.  I have checked with Deputy Gallagher, and I understand that the largest size <Col N="275" /> trawler fishing off the Mayo coast is a 65-foot vessel.  The Minister referred to larger sized ones, which are obviously not Mayo owned.  After allowing the foreign owned trawlers to poach due to an inadequate fishery protection service, we are now, apparently, to instruct the Navy that they are to patrol all the Irish trawlers to ensure they are not throwing out nets for salmon.  If the Minister has evidence which would possibly justify this extraordinary action on his part he should have given it to the House, but he did not.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated that there were cases where 22,000 salmon were taken by large Irish trawlers which were fishing illegally.  He did not state where the salmon were landed.  He did not give us any further information.  It creates a very great doubt in our minds as to whether this is a bottle of smoke the Minister is building up for himself. I ask him to study the fishing industry on the ground, get out of his office, go down and talk to those people, study the boats, the gear and the equipment they are using around the coasts, see them fishing in the bad weather as in the fine weather, see the conditions in which they operate and judge for himself the justification for his recent directive, to be implemented through some meeting next week, that the Irish navy are to receive instructions from two Ministers, the Minister for Defence and the Minister for Fisheries, to direct their attention to Irish trawlers reputedly drifting for salmon off the Mayo coast.</P>
    <P>If anybody heard about it surely Deputy Gallagher, who has been a fisherman and who has represented fishermen on Bord Iascaigh Mhara for many years and who has very close connection with the trade, would know about this.  He knows every person involved in the fishing industry along the Mayo and Galway coast.  He expressed his amazement, during the course of the discussion, at the Minister's allegation.  It escapes me why the matter assumes the importance the Minister has given it.  I am sure it also escapes other Members, particularly on this side of the House.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to be very <Col N="276" /> careful and to thread very warily in introducing restrictions against drift net fishermen, to weigh the matter well before he takes any action.  There is a powerful lobby which is presenting one side of the picture.  The riparian interests are pointing the finger at the drift net fishermen as being the destroyers of a species which has existed in the country for many hundreds of years.  They have no scientific basis for the allegation.  The Minister opened his remarks by saying that all scientific evidence available to him showed that the species was in danger. If there is one species in the world, about which there is very little scientific knowledge, it is the salmon. Many books have been written but the extent of the questions unanswered in regard to the life cycle of the salmon is quite amazing.  If the Minister is informing the House that scientific evidence is a bundle of statistics given to him by officials of his Department, then I question his decision to introduce those restrictions and whatever further ones he has in mind.</P>
    <P>The salmon has baffled scientists since time immemorial but our Minister has all the scientific knowledge presented to him in his Department. This is a wonderful discovery.  I am sure if they write a book about it it will be very much in demand.  All sorts of theories exist about the life cycle of the salmon.  If riparian owners are being represented in the Department, as they were until quite recently, in certain individuals, it is a matter of regret.  I warn the Minister to thread warily, weigh everything carefully and not believe all the propaganda which has been pouring out from this source over the past ten years.  It has not been established, scientifically or otherwise, that the salmon species is in danger.  What they said ten years ago has been disproved in the years in between. If there is some new scientific knowledge available it was not made available to the House.</P>
    <P>I never heard the Parliamentary Secretary give the House scientific information in regard to the life span of the salmon or scientific proof that the <Col N="277" /> salmon species was in danger.  Any child can examine statistics.  The statistics show that the catch from drift netting has increased substantially during the past ten years, and because of this the Department and the riparian owners argue that we must stop drift netting because if this goes on the salmon will disappear. That is not a scientific analysis of the effect of drift netting, the more efficient nets which are now being manufactured or the greater availability of small boats and engines than were in the past when these men relied on the oar.</P>
    <P>This is balanced on the other side by a drop in the draft catch to a certain extent.  If the Department, representing as they seem to be the views of the riparian owners, are disturbed that the quantity of salmon being caught in the country will have this effect on the continuance of the salmon as a species then let them cut out the trap catches at the estuaries, which are owned by the people who are making the argument against the drift net fishermen. Why should we tolerate a situation in the country where in narrow rivers private owners are empowered under the law to catch unlimited quantities of salmon, which have no chance of escape?  The drift net fishermen must take their chance with the elements, the light, the waves, the wind and be restricted to very short hours during the week at a certain time in the year in the vast expanse of the seas.  We are told they are the danger men.  The way the regulations are drawn up, a huge quantity of salmon are and will continue to pass the draft and drift nets.  Those salmon should be allowed free access up the rivers to spawn. They should not be slaughtered in a narrow river by riparian or privately owned fisheries.</P>
    <P>These people have carried out dirty tricks that have never been reported and about which they have never been brought to court.  There is supposed to be a place called the Queen's Gap&mdash;I suppose that is now an historical name &mdash;where they have been seen and have been known to throw stones in order to guide the salmon back into the nets. That is illegal.  Has any of them ever <Col N="278" /> been prosecuted for so doing?  Has any of them ever appeared before a judge?  Has any of their equipment ever been confiscated?  It is like the story of the old cowboys: no, these are the good guys and the fellows out at sea are the bad guys.  I am completely dismayed that the Minister considers them to be the bad guys.  He said that today, and that he expected to be daubed as believing that they were bad guys.  He made a similar remark about boats.</P>
    <P>Anybody with any knowledge of fishermen will know that damn few of them ever vote.  The fishermen know that themselves.  That is why they have felt recently, when their industry came under the microscope when major decisions were required&mdash;because they were not a political force their plea fell on deaf ears in regard to the establishment of a 50-mile exclusive band for them around our coast.  If the weather is right and an election is held at a time of the year when fish are to be caught the fishermen, unfortunately for the politicians, have been known to remain at sea and not come in to vote.  To contend that the motivation of the Fianna Fáil Party in putting down this motion was one of catching votes can be dismissed out of hand. We are concerned to ensure that a small section of our community will not be walked on by bureaucracy or by big brother in the person of the present Minister.  In representing their views and in fighting to defend them we are not motivated by the couple of votes the Minister seems to think are so important to us.  We are motivated because we want to see justice done, justice to large sections of the community as well as to the small.  And the minority&mdash;and they are a very small minority&mdash;who earn their living from the sea deserve proper representation of their views just as do the large sections, such as the farmers, represented by such powerful organisations as the IFA.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately the Minister has left the House.  We understand he has gone to meet some people in the fishing industry, and we hope he will listen to their counsel.  It is a pity he has not been here to hear the excellent case made by Deputy Brosnan who has <Col N="279" /> practical knowledge of the drift-net sea fishing industry in his own county, Cork.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to reconsider the bye-laws introduced restricting the number of licences, particulary that under discussion here in regard to the size of the mesh.  These restrictions on the number of licences were introduced before the Parliamentary Secretary came into office.  Anything new of such nature demands annual review until a proper pattern is established.  Unfortunately the Parliamentary Secretary has acted quite stubbornly in this matter and has insisted on letting matters remain as they were.  I have pleaded with him here time and time again to reconsider the bye-laws and the restrictions on the number of licences as it applies under existing regulations.</P>
    <P>Island fishermen in my constituency, off the coast of Galway, have had no opportunity of applying for drift net licences because of the recent history following the inquiry of 1968, when it was found that there was no tradition of drift net fishing there because the prohibition existed.  When the prohibition was lifted and the order made allowing licences to be obtained the Aran Island community were not aware, at that time, that that was a viable proposition for them.  It is by trial and error only that things can be found out.  That discovery was not made in 1969, but rather around the year 1971&mdash;that drift netting could be carried out successfully from the island.  Now the position is that the Inishmaan community cannot obtain a licence under the regulations as drawn up at present.  Neither can the Inisheer community.  There exist about four or five licences on Inishmore, those two islands representing a population of some 2,000.</P>
    <P>The Aran Islands constitute the backbone of the sea-fishing industry off the west coast.  They have shown the lead; they have taken the larger boats, given employment and have been responsible for the catches landed at Galway Harbour.  Those who own the larger boats can employ only <Col N="280" /> five or six people while the small boat owner has to seek his living from lobster and line fishing which is very hazardous.  But the regulations, as they obtain at present, make no concession to such islanders.  It is dreadful to see that prohibition continuing.  My previous pleas have failed and I expect this one will also but I cannot speak on drift net fishing without mentioning such people. However, I reiterate that plea for those poor people living on small western islands and who are deprived of whatever little income they could derive from salmon drift-net fishing because the Parliamentary Secretary and the Minister stubbornly refuse to change the regulations even very slightly.</P>
    <P>The same applies to other islands, not merely those off the Galway coast&mdash;Bofin, Turbot, Clare, but particularly Bofin and the Aran Islands where an exception should and has not been made.  I make a final plea to the Parliamentary Secretary to consider making such an exception.</P>
    <P>Finally I add my voice to the excellent cases made by Deputies Gallagher and Brosnan while I was present in the House and to the other speeches made by Members from this side I did not hear.  I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to reconsider reverting to the 30 mesh and meeting the fishermen again, when it might be possible to find a suitable compromise.  But to hold out for the reduction to 30 without any hope of a change will mean a loss of income and employment in these times, which is something I am sure Members on all sides of the House would like to avoid.</P>

      <P>I take a very poor view that the Minister saw fit to introduce this bye-law requiring the mesh to be from 60 to 30 for drift nets.  The fishermen sought a meeting with the Minister but the Minister did not see fit at any time to meet them and my information from the drift-net fishermen was that they would have reached a compromise at a mesh of 45.  Even at this late stage the Minister should meet them and agree to have the mesh reduced to 45.</P>
      <P>Many of the drift-net fishermen use very small boats and can fish only during the day-time.  The Minister is depriving them of a living by reducing the mesh to 30.  The fishermen have informed me that the salmon swim very low in the sea during the day and that the 30 mesh nets are not suitable for salmon fishing.  Many of those drift-net fishermen draw social welfare payment for six months of the year and the introduction of this bye-law will put them on social welfare for 12 months of the year.</P>
      <P>Also recently the licence fee was increased from £3 to £50 and many of those using small boats will not be able to afford the licence fee now, especially when the gear and the boats are costing so much and their catch will be reduced because of the reduction of the mesh.  I come from a county where a lot of fishing is done. In County Kerry there are only nine drift-net licences but in County Cork there are 134.  This is a very unfair distribution.  Many of the fishermen from my county applied for drift-net licences for the past couple of years and did not succeed in obtaining them.  The 134 drift-net licences are in the Parliamentary Secretary's own immediate constituency.  Many rod fishermen in my county claim that it is due to the fact that there are so few salmon in the river that the Parliamentary Secretary gave so many drift-net licences in his constituency a number of years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fenit is a great fishing village and there are 110 fishermen there.  They are mainly oyster fishermen and they finish on 1st February.  They would welcome an opportunity to do drift-net fishing, but unfortunately there is <Col N="282" /> no drift-net licence at all for the Fenit area.  I appeal to the Minister now to grant some drift-net licences to the fishermen in the Fenit area.  The nine drift-net licences in my county are mainly in Brandon and in Dingle.</P>

      <P>This is certainly not a responsible statement.  Last night we heard a great deal about the necessity for introducing this bye-law. We were told that it represented the thinking of the Inland Fisheries Commission.  As one who sat with the Inland Fisheries Commission until coming into this House I can say that they did excellent work.  The members of the commission, the chairman and the officials representing the Department, were dedicated, honest and cultured people and they tried to do a very good job in compiling their report.  However, the interim report which was introduced in relation to drift netting was prepared in the light of our EEC accession.  At that time we were facing the possibility of Europeans coming right into our estuaries, and I recall well the urgency of having this interim report prepared. We wanted to guard against the possibility of European trawlers coming into our estuaries, and at the time the only way we could protect the interests of all our fishermen, and particularly salmon fishermen was by having this interim report produced here.  It was on conservation.  There was an urgency about it, and the Department afterwards used it in order to have the measures introduced here, to restrict our own fishermen. I made this point when I was on a deputation to Deputy Fahey, who was then Parliamentary Secretary, and pressed very strongly that something which was introduced at the time because of equal accession, was being implemented here.  It was never intended in that report to place any restriction on traditional fishermen. Professional people who were not gaining a livelihood from fishing were <Col N="284" /> using salmon licences to catch salmon. I agree entirely that it was necessary to restrict that kind of fishing.  As was stated by Deputy Brosnan I had a drift net licence at some stage and as a result of the new order I lost the licence.  I agree that this was necessary.</P>
      <P>The bye-laws that have been introduced by the Parliamentary Secretary come down more heavily on the traditional type of fishermen than on everybody else.  It shows the lack of knowledge on the part of the Minister about what has been happening on the Mayo coast.  Drift-net fishermen in Donegal, Mayo and Galway use 30 mesh net because they fish at night and the salmon will mesh nearer the top of the water at night.</P>
      <P>As has been stressed by so many speakers, fishermen on the south coast will be really hit by this new bye-law. They are fishermen using small open boats, traditional in every sense of the word.  They have no new-fangled ideas, they are not in a position to provide any of the modern equipment that so many larger trawlers can avail themselves of.  They are part-time fishermen. Most of them buy their own nets.  The Minister has acted rather hastily in this. When there was a situation where the boards of conservators and the fishermen were prepared to compromise, the Minister should have given attention to their plea.  Instead he just went ahead without giving any consideration to the case the fishermen had to make.  The fishermen are in the position that if they give up their fishing, as they will have to as a result of this order, they will have no compensation, they cannot claim redundancy.  Will the Minister help them in any way as a result of their having to tie up their boats for the summer because they cannot catch salmon due to the new restrictions? They will not be helped by the State or by the Minister.  Many of them will have to join the dole queues, although they are long enough already. It has been suggested that fish farming could be carried out by these part-time fishermen.  This is very expensive, and I cannot see many of our smaller fishermen being in a position to carry out anything of that nature.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The whole question of drift-net <Col N="285" /> licences and drift net fishing has caused a good deal of concern right around the coast because the issuing of licences has not been equitable.  It is unjust to find one area of coast having 140 licences and another area having only nine or 10.  There is every reason for the fishermen to resent this type of handling of the situation.  There is no question but that the riparian owners are the people who are doing the greatest damage to salmon stocks in this country.</P>

      <P>Deputy Dowling gave me notice of his intention to raise on the Adjournment the subject matter of Question No. 2 of 16th March last.  In accordance with Standing Orders, the Dáil must adjourn not later than 9 p.m.  Therefore, by agreement, Deputy Dowling may speak for ten minutes and the Minister for five minutes in reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter arises out of the question of the 16th March in relation to Caritas College, Dromfin Road, Ballyfermot.  I now wish to bring to the attention of the House the grave injustice that has been done and is being done to the many pupils in the Ballyfermot area as a result of the undue delay by the Department of Education in providing even the basic requirements for this college.  I believe in equal opportunities in education for all children, and I accept that the new Minister for Education is as concerned about this issue as I am.  Knowing that and that he is a reasonable man, I am sure he will accept that equal opportunities cannot be available unless there are equal conditions in relation to facilities, student-teacher ratio and other factors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is regrettable that in relation to equal opportunities the children of this <Col N="289" /> area have been victimised.  The enormous effort by dedicated and capable sisters and teachers to offset the disadvantages must be applauded. However, the effort and strain on both teachers and pupils must be depressing. Therefore, I would ask the Minister to give an unqualified undertaking that the necessary building programme will proceed without further delay and that the necessary finance will be available.</P>
    <P>The requirements of the college are well known to the Department of Education.  The essentials required immediately in order to minimise the injustices to the college and to provide equal opportunities to pupils in the area are a science hall, an art room, an all-purpose room, a room for remedial training, a career guidance room and suitable accommodation for staff and chaplain.  I believe these are basic requirements.  Domestic science is a curricular subject and should be available to all girl students who wish to pursue it.  At present there are no facilities which would enable the subject to be taught even if pupils wished to study it.  Likewise, senior cycle girls taking pure science as a subject have to travel to the vocational school which is a considerable distance away, thereby losing one and a half hour's instruction each day that this occurs.  However, the vocational school must be praised for its co-operation.  The position in relation to the art class is that the subject it taught in a redundant prefabricated building with no water laid on and students are obliged to carry water supplies in buckets.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister will agree that this situation is most unsatisfactory. One of the major problems in the school is the need for remedial training and a centre, and additional remedial teachers above the present quota.  I trust the Minister will give a clear indication of his acceptance of the validity of my case by giving a guarantee that the pupils of this excellent college will have equal opportunities with those of their fellow students in other schools.</P>
    <P>I need not remind the Minister that the students studying under these enormous handicaps are expected to compete in examinations on the same basis as pupils with every modern facility, <Col N="290" /> comfort and convenience.  When examinations are being set the Department of Education do not take into consideration difficulties under which students and teachers in this school are operating.</P>
    <P>Again, I would ask the Minister to indicate the date on which work will commence on the additional facilities required so urgently by this school and when I can stop worrying about the manner in which the daughters of my constituents are now being neglected. I could bore the Minister with statistics but I know his Department are fully acquainted with the situation. Only last night I and other members who represent the area were at a meeting in Ballyfermot for a considerable number of hours discussing this development problem and the erratic situation in relation to education in that area.  The dedicated personnel have to devote some of their time and energies to pursuing avenues other than that of education, and this is doing the teachers and the pupils a grave injustice.</P>
    <P>I would hope that we shall get here tonight a firm undertaking from the Minister that this work will commence at an early date so that no longer will the pupils of this school be victimised in the manner I have outlined.  I do not hold the Minister responsible for the delay.  He is a new Minister and I have found him to be considerate in all matters relating to the problems that have been presented to him. Therefore, I hope that in the near future the parents, teachers and pupils will be able to get down to the real problem of developing the talents of the children so that they can avail of job opportunities that arise, and so that when they enter the labour market they will be able to cope with the problems that confront them.  We all know the difficulties that are there at the moment for young girls, the grave obstacles in their way, the fact that they cannot obtain social benefits when they leave school.  They must go direct to employment, and they can only get employment if they are equipped educationally and otherwise for the opportunities that present themselves.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="291" /> If we do not get a clear undertaking in this respect from the Minister, we shall be back to him again and again until such time as justice is done to this school and to this area and, indeed, to other areas in Dublin city and elsewhere where there are defects which must be remedied, some of them defects of long standing.  However, blame-placing is no solution to this problem. Immediate and effective action is required to ensure that the lot of those studying in this school, and in the other schools in the area, is brightened by an immediate start on the work which is so essential to provide the teachers and sisters with the opportunity to educate these children under ideal conditions.  Ideal conditions, nothing less, are good enough for any Irish child.  There may be financial problems.  A comprehensive survey has been carried out by a responsible organisation in Ballyfermot.  Statistics are available. The unemployment rate is twice the national average.  That survey, carried out recently, indicated that 23 per cent of the 1969 school leavers are still unemployed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. P. Barry)</NameTxt>
      <P>This adjournment debate is taking place as a result of a question put down by Deputy Dowling on 16th March.  The Deputy wanted to know when the first stage of the development of Caritas College, Dromfin Road, Ballyfermot, commenced and <Col N="292" /> the date it was completed, when the second stage commenced, the date of its completion and the reason for the delay, when the third stage was likely to commence, the present plans for the extensions of the school and the areas that will get priority, and when the application was made for additional space to meet the ever-increasing needs.  When I answered that question, unfortunately Deputy Dowling was unable to be present to ask supplementary questions.  I told him that planning for the third stage of building has commenced and the meeting with the manager and her consultants will take place at an early date.  I also said the third stage of building will comprise specialists classrooms and a general purpose area.</P>
      <P>Something must have happened in the Ballyfermot area between last Wednesday, the eve of the national holiday, and this morning when Deputy Dowling gave notice that he would raise this matter on the Adjournment tonight.  A meeting was held last night and, if Deputy Dowling was present, he must have heard Deputy O'Connell from the same area giving all the information which Deputy Dowling sought here tonight. Deputy O'Connell contacted me in my office yesterday and asked me for any details which would be helpful to him in answering questions at the meeting of the parents and the staff of the college. We gave all the relevant details and told him the time scale involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I presume Deputy O'Connell related all this to the people at the meeting last night.  Perhaps Deputy Dowling was not listening.  He may have been called out of the room to attend to some other constituency matter.  A man as busy and as popular as Deputy Dowling has many calls on his time and might not be able to give his full attention to meetings concerned with schools in his area.  Of course, it was his right to ask to have this matter raised on the Adjournment tonight.  I am very happy to repeat here tonight the assurances Deputy O'Connell gave to the parents and teachers last night.  I am sure Deputy Dowling will be glad to hear that Deputy O'Connell came to me this morning <Col N="293" /> and asked me to receive a deputation from parents and teachers from the area.  I was very happy to accede to that request.</P>
    <P>I am very glad to meet deputations of this nature from specific areas, especially when I have good news to impart to them.  A Minister is not often in the fortunate and happy position of being able to impart good news to deputations.  I will meet that deputation next week.  I do not know whether Deputy Dowling will be on it but, if he is, for the fourth time I will be able to give him the same information which he heard last night from Deputy O'Connell, which I gave in the Dáil last week, and which I am giving him again tonight.  At the informal gathering in my room some day next week I will be happy to repeat the information again.</P>
    <P>Inspectors from my Department have had consultations with the manager.  The recommendation is that the addition of one arts and crafts area, one needlework classroom, a small special tuition room for remedial work and a dining and assembly area should be provided.  The manager and her consultants will be coming into my Department in the first week in April to discuss the final details. After that, it will be a matter for her consultants to draw up plans and submit them to my Department.  As I said, Deputy Dowling probably had to go out of the room when this information was being imparted to the meeting last night.  We all understand the many calls on his time.</P>

      <P>Perhaps he was chatting to the person next to him, but it is funny that he did not hear that information last night.  I am sure it was no fault of his.  It was probably just a coincidence that he was talking to somebody else when this information was being imparted.  If Deputy <Col N="294" /> Dowling did not hear the information last night, and was not present last week when I answered the question, he is perfectly entitled to raise the matter on the Adjournment tonight and I am happy to give him the same information again.</P>

      <P>The following statement gives, for each county, (a) the basic weekly rate of wages paid to forestry workers for a 40-hour week. An incentive bonus is payable in addition to these rates, (b) weekly rates of wages, excluding service pay, paid by county councils to road workers for a 40-hour week, (c) statutory minimum remuneration (weekly rates) payable to adult agricultural workers under the employment regulation order of the Agricultural Workers Joint Labour Committee. These rates apply to a 45-hour week in the period March to October inclusive and a 42½ hour week during the remainder of the year.</P>
      <P>In the case of forestry and road workers the rates quoted incorporate the first phase of the 1977 national wage agreement and will come into effect on 1st April next.  The rates for agricultural workers came into effect on 1st March, 1977.</P>
