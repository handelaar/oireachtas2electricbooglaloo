      <NameTxt>Mr. W. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>When we adjourned yesterday I was speaking about the urgent need to bring small type industries to rural Ireland.  I was, of course, concerned with my own rural constituency of West Limerick. Since then we have received the great news of the arrival of Alcan.  We are fortunate in that constituency, particuluarly in an area where over the past <Col N="3" /> 25 years our population has declined by 15,000 people that we are now rewarded with a project of almost £300 million.  A total of 800 skilled workers will go into this area.  This will bring great joy to the people of Limerick.</P>
      <P>In 1974 we first heard the news of the possibility of the arrival of this monster industry.  They applied for planning permission in April, 1974. This was objected to by a number of residents in the area.  After six months the planning application was renewed and the then Minister gave planning permission without any alteration.  I would like to pay a tribute to our county manager, Mr. Haslam, who put a lot of work into the infrastructure in that area.  At that time it was necessary to take into consideration the urgent need for piped water in that area.  A detailed study has been carried out and plans have now been made to provide between five million gallons and approximately 50 million gallons of water a day if necessary to this location.</P>
      <P>The council have also purchased land in the three areas adjacent to the location.  This is very necessary for the erection of houses.  The arrival of Alcan in this area will bring joy to our former Minister for Industry and Commerce who played a major role in trying to bring this industry to Ireland.  I know it is a joy to our present Minister who is a Limerick man.  It is a joy to all public representatives in the area.  Our former Minister for the Gaeltacht, Deputy Tom O'Donnell, played an important role in trying to bring major industry to Limerick.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is very necessary to bring small industries to Ireland.  The foreign industrialists must always be welcome but we must never forget our local family industries which have stood the test of time during a very severe economic depression.  The IDA should give as much help as possible to those small industries.  I would like to see more money put into Irish industries not alone in extensions but in establishing new factories, particularly small industries, because they may succeed and be of greater benefit <Col N="4" /> than the larger factories which may fail to keep going.</P>
    <P>I would like to see a new package of incentives given to attract small industries to towns with a population of less than 2,000.  This programme should be given a local rather than a national impetus.  This is not a revolutionary idea but is more in keeping with the same kind of programme in Britain where incentives are given to small towns with a population of less than 5,000 people.  We all recognise the importance of job creation but we must never forget the importance of job preservation.  Every public representative and everybody concerned with the welfare of the workers should remind trade union members, management and shop stewards that they have a major role to play in keeping our industries going, many of which have cost millions and many restless days for people like the IDA and others associated with industry in general. The last move should be closing the doors of such industries.  I appeal to people concerned with industry to be prepared to sit around the table and discuss their grievances.  I say this as a Member of this House and a member of a trade union.  In the interests of the workers we will have to be responsible.  I should like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to AnCO which at this stage is doing a wonderful job in assisting industrialists to train their employees.  I should also like to pay tribute to SFADCo and to the local development team who are doing a wonderful job.  They have played a major part in bringing industry into the country.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I should like to thank the IDA for what they have given us in Limerick.  There we have a great deal to offer.  We have an international airport.  We have a very efficient work-force. We have water.  We have everything that is needed for heavy industry and I sincerely hope that the move made by Alcan will be an incentive to many other industrialists to come here. I certainly welcome this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall speak as briefly as possible because a great deal of what requires to be said has already <Col N="5" /> been said.  We are all aware of the background against which this Bill is reintroduced in that the broad outline of the Bill was formulated by the previous Government.  I am glad that the present Government and the present Minister have seen fit to reintroduce the Bill as quickly as they have done.  I understand&mdash;I am open to correction on this&mdash;that there is essentially not a great deal of difference between this Bill and the Bill circulated by the previous Government.  That really points the collective consensus about the necessity to provide jobs. However, if one looks at that consensus it very quickly begins to evaporate when one studies the ways in which jobs can be created.</P>
      <P>As far as the Labour Party are concerned, we accept that private enterprise means &ldquo;private&rdquo; enterprise, that the whole ethos upon which the system is based is essentially private and that the primary concern of people engaged in private enterprise, and of the bankers who provide the capital, is to create profit and not to perform some kind of social good.  The reality for most people who have any connection with business is that frequently the maximisation of profit all too readily results in a reduction of work in the short term.  We as a community and many in this House are being less than honest if we say that private enterprise can itself create jobs and, at the same time, do not wish to see any interference with the private enterprise system or the ethos that underpins it.</P>
      <P>It is my view that we should accept that when people talk about private enterprise they mean what they say and we should not expect from such a group the performance of social functions and social roles outside their competence or their terms of reference. We should take them at their word and not dishonestly expect them to do two things&mdash;make a profit for themselves and provide jobs as well&mdash;when frequently these two objectives can be directly in conflict with one another.</P>

      <P>I wish the Deputy could relate this to the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="6" />
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am relating it in the sense that we are talking about the creation of jobs and the role of this agency is to create jobs and attract capital and enterprises into the country, enterprises that have the capacity to create jobs, and I am simply saying that in many cases, unless the actions of this agency under the powers conferred on it by this Bill, are directed in a certain way the common consensus shared by everyone here of the necessity to create jobs will not necessarily be achieved.</P>
      <P>We would like to see the Government take a more positive and creative responsibility for job creation.  We would see within the IDA a reservoir of expertise which can be tapped positively by the Government and we would hope that when this Bill becomes law the Government would give very specific guidelines to the IDA about the kind of industrial strategy the Government would like to see, the kind of jobs they would like provided and the way in which they propose to assist the IDA in its work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me spell out what I mean in that context.  At the moment the IDA attracts enterprises on the basis of a number of financial incentives, a package of grants, factory provision, administration skills, and so on, and, perhaps most important of all, export tax relief.  The recent announcement about Alcan, for example, is one we welcome but I would suggest to the Minister&mdash;I shall be interested to hear his reply&mdash;that if the major incentive, and I assume he will agree it is tax relief for many companies, remains untouched there will be two effects.  First of all, I understand it is increasingly under pressure from the EEC and therefore its duration has a question mark over it.  The other effect is that I believe there is very little incentive in the package for a company to generate new work in terms of an industrial process.  The maximum financial benefit it will derive will come only if it produces a product and exports it in order to gain tax relief, and so on.  In other words, there is little incentive for a company to come <Col N="7" /> in here to manufacture something which can be further processed down-stream by another company and added to by yet another company thereby creating jobs at a number of outlets instead of at just one outlet.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister that he might have a look into the functioning of the IDA and the common consensus of creating new work and new employment with a multiplier effect which does not exist at the moment because of the necessity to avail of the primary incentive, that incentive being to export the product immeditely. Within the competence of the Minister and of his colleague, the Minister for Finance, I suggest that if they seriously wish to achieve the objective of job creation then the whole question of taxation as an integral part of Government policy should be looked at.</P>
    <P>There are a number of points I should like to make with regard to this specific section.  Section 2 provides for the restructuring of existing industries and the rationalisation of certain sectors.  This is welcome.  However, I am not quite clear what active role the Government and specifically the IDA will play in ensuring that such restructuring comes about.  I have in mind the background of the CIO reports in the 1960s which in many cases forecast the sort of closures industries subsequently faced in the early 1970s.  These were voluntary reports. In regard to some industries, like the shoe industry, they were told long in advance that unless they did X, Y and Z, they would be in trouble. Now the climate has changed and it is no longer adequate for these kinds of reports to remain merely voluntary.</P>
    <P>There should be some positive policy, other than simply a voluntary recommendation, to induce firms which have been identified as being in a sector that needs rationalisation and restructuring to achieve the rationalisation or restructuring outlined, and the trade unions concerned in such industries should be involved actively in the formation of any rationalisation or restructuring, because the alternative is not an acceptable one.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="8" /> The alternative is that in a period of time an industry may conceal its true position from the workers, and in some cases from the shareholders. It could be in extremely difficult circumstances and apply to Fóir Teoranta, and the workers will be faced suddenly with redundancy without having received any prior waring. Therefore, when this Bill becomes law the Government should ask the IDA to take positive steps to identify sectors of Irish industry which are in need of restructuring so that they can come forward, with proposals from the IDA or other departmental agencies, and those proposals should be made known to everybody involved in the industry.  In such circumstances we would not have situations like in the past, with reports collecting dust on shelves and workers not knowing they were facing redundancy until they were confronted with it.</P>
    <P>A further major proposal is contained in section 9 which deals with equity participation, and I should like the Minister or the Parliamentary Secretary to elaborate on the Government's policy in this respect.  It seems to me that some forms of equity participation are little less and little more than a form of passive banking, that there is hardly any benefit that could accrue to the IDA, the Government and accordingly to the Irish people. The capital, in the form of shares, would be tied up, unsaleable, in such undertakings.</P>
    <P>I therefore ask the Parliamentary Secretary at some stage to indicate what the Government's attitude is to taking out a 5 per cent equity in a subsidiary of a large multinational firm established here.  Five per cent gives little or no control in terms of company policy, and because the company are a subsidiary the shares are not even marketable, the capital can hardly be redeemed and any attempt at valuation of such shares is subject to considerable manipulation between the subsidiaries and the major company.</P>
    <P>I welcome equity participation but there are two forms of it and I should like the Government to indicate their attitude to the advisability of equity participation, the situations in which <Col N="9" /> such participation would be advisable and the percentage participation we are talking about.  I would envisage the Government, possibly in conjunction with a local bank, taking an equity stake of up to 40 per cent in companies wholly owned here in their own right.  Such a stake is big enough for the Government to have a say in the policy of the company through the IDA.  Such a company would be directly accessible and there would be no need to plough through the myriad channels associated with multinational companies.</P>
    <P>Our capacity and power to take up equity participation are to be recommended but we need clarification in regard to the functions participation will have, what expertise we will contribute to such participation and the precise benefits we will derive.  I question whether giving somebody a grant in exchange for equity participation at the level of 5 per cent would be of much value because I fail to see, if a company go wallop, what benefit that company will give.  If the company are successful I fail to see how the participation can be saleable or cashable.</P>
    <P>We could have a situation in five or ten years in which the people here, through Government agencies, would have bits and shares in all sorts of companies, and unless there is some coherent plan we could have a lot of capital, as such, which would be tied up which could easily have been put to better use.</P>
    <P>In addition to the financial implications of such participation, I should like to have clarification on the Government's attitude to the appointment of directors, where they arise, by the Government or the Minister.  I should like to know if the IDA have a stake of equity in a company and being entitled to a number of directorships, whether there are any guidelines in regard to the sort of people who would be appointed: will they be IDA employees or will they be friends of the Government of the day?  Governments appoint a number of people, not Members of the Oireachtas, in a quasi-political role and it is only natural that the Government of the day would appoint people who reflect or who <Col N="10" /> sympathise with their policies.  Is it simply enough to give a directorship to an IDA employee who is over-worked anyway, or who should be? The taking up of three or four directorships by some such person should not be allowed in certain circumstances.  In regard to political friends, I have no objection provided they are competent to do the job.  We now must try to acquire some sort of expertise in this field and consequently the traditional criteria that have been applied by both sides of the House should no longer be applied.</P>
    <P>It behoves the IDA and the Government to clarify the implications of enlarged powers under this section. There should be a clear-cut understanding of the role of such directors, what their function is and the kind of people who would be eligible for appointment.  Otherwise the benefit of participation is highly doubtful and hard to assess.  If the capital is tied up in the form of some kind of passive banking, why call it equity participation?  Why not just give a grant and be done with it?  If the individual has little or no understanding of the enterprise involved he can offer little at board level to the role of that company.</P>
    <P>Clarification is needed on the role of equity participation and some indication of the attitude of the Minister and his Department is absolutely essential.  During the debate on the Bill dealing with Bula Limited the Minister in question was extremely critical of the whole nature of equity participation by the State and certainly of the scale of 49 per cent proposed by the then Minister.  It is one of the core elements of this Bill and a policy description by the Minister on section 9 is required at the end of the Second Stage debate.</P>
    <P>I am also interested, and I have been involved in a minor way, in the question of overseas aid and the export of Irish expertise to Third World and APC countries.  I welcome the provision in section 4 on the grounds that it attempts to achieve a number of objectives which we all favour.  The establishment of DEVCO was an extremely <Col N="11" /> good idea and I would hope that the enlarged powers conferred on the IDA will be used in a positive manner in order that Third World countries may be able to benefit from the not inconsiderable experience and expertise gained by the IDA over the years.</P>
    <P>The reason we are all in favour of such action is twofold.  First, it is because of the chronic human needs within the Third World for development and job creation and the raising of living standards.  That is essential in moral terms alone but it is also essential in a number of other ways.  It is essential for the people of the West and the people of rich and well-fed Ireland who wish to maintain any kind of global stability towards the end of this century.  We may think that relative to the golden triangle of Europe we are a very poor country but if my memory is correct we rank twentieth in the world in the table of wealth.  We certainly do not rank with those who starve and have not adequate housing and sewerage.  Any action taken by the Irish people at governmental level, as distinct from the work done by the voluntary organisations, is to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>There is a specific reason why the IDA and the Government should become directly involved in such aid. It is because we are non-aligned politically and to a certain extent economically, and the advice which can be given by DEVCO, the IMI or the ESB is not simply salesmanship for an industrial concern at home.  All too often, for example, German electrical consultants will not only design a system for a country but will specify German industrial plant, not because it is the best or the cheapest or the most suitable but because this is how they see their role.  The British, the French and the Belgians are no different. There is a great advantage in the capacity of the Irish development agencies to offer sincere and neutral advice without commercial salesmanship overtones.  I would say to the Government that they should develop their commitment to aid in the positive sense, bearing in mind the old <Col N="12" /> saying that the person who teaches a starving man how to grow two ears of corn where there was previously one is doing far more than someone who gives that person a loaf of bread.</P>
    <P>There is at the end of the day a benefit for the Irish economy in that by raising the living standards of people and enabling them to develop their own resources we are expanding the market for Irish goods in a global sense.  There is a moral obligation, a political non-aligned obligation and an economic justification for welcoming section 4 and for urging that when the Bill becomes law the IDA should be encouraged to develop their activities.</P>
    <P>I want to turn to an area that has been discussed at length by some Members who feel that because they do not represent a Dublin constituency they have a monopoly on hardship and employment and a monopoly on whatever is going in terms of factories or jobs.  I am reminded of the situation not too far from this House where arguments about the allocation of space are similar to arguments about wages, in which an employer simply tells two groups of workers, neither of whom is being properly paid, that there is a certain amount in the wages pot and they can sort it out for themselves; they very quickly put their hands into the pot without having the sense to realise that the pot is not big enough in the first place. If we as Members of this House try to grab whatever is coming from an agency and do not consider what we really need as a national community we will play into the hands both locally and nationally of the people who create scarcity in the first place.  The necessity to attract jobs to this country has in some cases forced us to sell ourselves short and not to value fully the resources under our command which are appreciating day by day. The fact is that the entire country needs jobs of one kind or another. Another fact is that half of the jobs forecasted&mdash;the figures of 28,000 and 38,000 have been bandied about&mdash;will be required in the Dublin area.  If we talk in terms of trying to divert jobs to this sector and that sector without committing ourselves to expanding the <Col N="13" /> total supply of jobs, we are playing the old game of trying to shove our hands into a pot that is too small without directing our energies towards making it larger.  In other words, the squabble over the available jobs is diverting our attention from the real issue.</P>
    <P>The IDA have an extremely difficult task in that they are trying to do two things.  They have been criticised in this House and elsewhere for their failure to help small Irish firms.  It is an unfair criticism.  I have had personal experience of the IDA and believe that they are a competent and professional organisation.  In my opinion, they have shattered all the cliches about bureaucracy in the civil service.  They move fast and efficiently and are decisive and very tough.  They are also very commercial.  On more than one occasion my own profession have complained about the commercial toughness of the IDA in forcing firms to cut fees and to provide package deals for professional services involving architecture, engineering, quantity surveying and so on.  We can discuss that aspect of their work at another time.  I simply introduced it to show that the IDA are a tough professional organisation.</P>
    <P>Let us consider how and where the expertise of the IDA has been gathered.  Their energies have been mainly directed towards attracting foreign companies to this country, which involves long periods of travel abroad, dealing with large commercial companies, such as the one that has resurrected its plant at Shannon. When you are dealing with large commercial concerns you are dealing with people who have a high level of expertise in accountancy and management. You can go to a company like Merck, Sharp Dohme or Alcan and say: &ldquo;What are your projections for the next five years and what is your current budget and capital structure?&rdquo; You will not be given this information on the back of an envelope because such firms produce carefully calculated reports.  This means that the position of such a company can be easily assessed before an approach is made. <Col N="14" /> There is no doubt that the IDA have been successful in their dealings with the multi-nationals.  After concluding such large business deals, it is unreasonable to expect the IDA to direct their attention to the 3,000 small Irish firms that employ no more than 20 people each.  The implications of dealing with smaller firms on a personal level may not be as glamorous as dealing with large firms.  In weather like this it is not a glamorous task to drive to the west or the midlands to discuss business with the owner of a small factory, when another member of the organisation could be on his way to New York in a jumbo jet to deal with a more sophisticated company.</P>
    <P>It is easy to understand why the task of increasing employment in our small business sector has not received the same attention.  By successfully closing one major deal with a company like Alcan you can announce that you have delivered 800 jobs.  You would have to conclude many more deals with small Irish firms before the job total would reach 800.  There is a natural incentive for those charged with delivering numbers every year to go for the big ones, the ones that are easily assessed and can deliver more jobs.  When people complain of the failure of the IDA to promote our small industries they should recognise that those factors exist.  I am not saying they are positive causes but they must exist in some shape or form.</P>
    <P>If we accept that that is so, what should we do about it?  We should question whether the IDA should have any responsibilities for encouraging domestic employment from small companies or whether a special section should be established to deal with small companies.  It has been said that if you were to encourage the 3,000 odd Irish firms to create on average ten jobs each in any one year they would provide 30,000 jobs.  That is a large increase.  In many cases it could be done by simply acquiring new machinery which would only involve a small capital outlay.  The failure in the past is mainly due to the fact that it has been difficult for a Dublin-based Government agency to identify <Col N="15" /> the many opportunities that exist throughout the country.  Every Deputy can talk about a little industry which could employ four or five more if it had this or that.  We can identify them because we are on the spot.  To expect someone to do that from the fifth floor of an office block in Dublin would be expecting a super-human effort.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the powers regarding financial incentives, of giving grants, training and so on, being conferred by this Bill, on top of the existing powers, on the IDA in so far as we are concerned with the Irish business sector, have a different structure and that possibly a new agency under the overall direction of the IDA should be established.  Essentially, it should be a regional orientated agency.  The regional development organisations should be given the power and teeth to do at local level what the IDA are doing internationally.  The capacity to provide the money, to examine, help and assist small industries should be decentralised.  Until such time as it is decentralised we are not going to get the commitment to discover the opportunities.</P>
    <P>In addition, local authorities should have a role in the regional development authorities in a way they do not adequately have at present.  I am aware that it varies in different parts of the country, but in the Dublin context the input from local councillors to the regional development organisation is effectively nil in terms of the reciprocated political impact on the city council of the regional organisation. It seems to be the concern of the House to significantly expand Irish domestic industry and the employment that goes with it.  In this context we must look at this stage at a Bill which proposes to confer additional powers on the IDA and ask ourselves whether the IDA is the correct agency in its present form and structure to do the job of attracting foreign enterprises&mdash; a job it is carrying out very well at present&mdash;but also simultaneously to increase domestic employment in small industries.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister and the <Col N="16" /> Department to consider at some stage during the debate the questions I raised and give some indication of their attitude to the area of improving incentives to domestic industry and a way in which those incentives can be communicated to local businesses.  In all of this the involvement of those on the shop floor in such a business is essential.  Their commitment to the expension of employment is essential. Their knowledge and understanding that they will have a stake and a share as by right in the benefits that will accrue from such improvements must be made known.  In this context the role of the trade union movement is essential.  We will not get the commitment to expand employment and jobs within our society if those on the shop floor, at the coal face so speak, feel that moves are being taken without adequate consultation which will have the short-term effect of endangering their jobs, let alone increase employment.  If we do not have the co-operation of the people in the enterprise, from the person who makes the tea to the person in management, we are not going to get the kind of lift-off in job creation we are all looking for.</P>
    <P>We are fortunate that in many small industries&mdash;I am talking about industries employing fewer than 30 people&mdash;by virtue of the group dynamics of 30 people working together frequently there are not the sort of personal relation problems which become industrial disputes with larger concerns.  If we are to interfere and intervene in the way this Bill gives the IDA the power to do so, there has to be adequate understanding taken of the position of people in such industries and their right to participate, be consulted and have a say in decision-making.  As far as the Labour Party are concerned, unless the ordinary working people, and their labour representatives in the form of the trade union movement, have an adequate say in the decision-making in relation to industrial employment and industrial creation we will not get the take-off we all know is necessary. There is a consensus about the necessity to create jobs in our society <Col N="17" /> and at last there is a consensus about the urgency of those jobs.  There is probably also a consensus about the numbers required but that consensus quickly starts to evaporate when one looks at the way jobs are to be created.</P>
    <P>The Bill gives the IDA a number of powers and, in balance, it must be welcomed.  However, in conferring these powers on the IDA it behoves the Government, and not the IDA, to indicate their policy and position in philosophical economic terms to certain fundamental questions which will arise when this Bill is passed.  The first major one is the question of equity participation.  I am concerned at the lack of such clear-cut position by the Government as the result of the statements by the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy when in Opposition.  It is pointless for the Government to introduce this Bill where such powers are proposed if they are not in a position to clarify at the end of this debate the conditions where they would refuse consent for large scale participation by the IDA in a certain firm if these powers are being given.  If the Government are to be given the power to refuse such participation at certain levels then the Minister should indicate the philisophical principles which would underpin the Government's attitude to that sector.</P>
    <P>That, in turn, reverts back to the area where the consensus of job creation here ends and where the conflict over two alternative approaches begins.  That conflict is clear and explicit.  As far as we are concerned the private enterprise sector, with the best will in the world, with every conceivable grant, with every Deputy for the relevant constituency lobbying and petitioning, cannot produce the necessary level of jobs we need.  By private enterprise sector I do not necessarily mean the Irish enterprise sector.  The multi-national private enterprise sector is equally incapable of providing all the jobs our society needs.  That is not some kind of theory propounded.  That is a simple analysis of historical fact.  The private sector has never provided the necessary level <Col N="18" /> of jobs required.  Why should we expect it to do so?  Yet, when the Labour Party say that private enterprise can only produce so much with all the incentives, why can we not supply the balance by getting the State directly involved in certain areas.</P>
    <P>We have the record of the role of the State in this area and very few Deputies would say that we should close down the Irish Sugar Company, Bord na Móna, the ESB or other agencies which are the sort of models we have in mind.  They have provided not only vast numbers of jobs but have also created security of employment for many people in a way that the private sector was totally incapable of doing.  This is not the place or time to go into a debate on the alternatives of a private or public sector attitude to economic development.  But it is the place to ask the Government to clarify their position on the whole question of equity participation in the light of the issues that arise at the back of such participation.  It is only to highlight those issues that I have referred back in brief form to what I see is the essential political, economic conflict between this and that side of the House.</P>
    <P>I am particularly anxious that the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy should play an active role, under the section on foreign aid, section 4, in ensuring that encouragement be given by the Department in this area, that there be active liaison between the Department and the Department of Foreign Affairs for the reasons outlined.  I should like the Parliamentary Secretary, the Minister or whoever will be replying to this debate to clarify their position on this, to indicate how much capital will be made available to the IDA to pursue this activity because, having the power to do it, as outlined in section 4, will not be of much use if the money is not provided.  In that context the interaction of the enlarged powers of the IDA, through DEVCo, with the role of APSO and the whole question of bi-lateral aid that we would give, and our participation in a programme such as the Lomé Convention, the EDF, is an area that must be developed by <Col N="19" /> the commercial sector of the Government as much as by the foreign affairs sector.  To that extent if the Government propose such power and provision in this Bill we should be given some indication, at the close of the Second Stage debate, of the Government's attitude within the Department of Industry, Commerce and Energy as to how they regard the commercial implications of foreign aid programmes.</P>
    <P>I mentioned earlier the obvious moral and political obligations, as I would define them, of the necessity to improve our role with regard to aid. But in view of the fact that this is a specific Bill coming from a specific Government Department charged with making an honest and accurate appraisal, the commercial implications for Irish industry of such aid programmes should be clarified.  From what I know of the operation of aid programmes in other countries&mdash;countries not very far away from here&mdash; they are really financial carrots or, in more precise cases, financial sticks whereby the company comes in on the basis of offering aid to a Third World country and then demands that that Third World country commit itself commercially to a whole range of products from the company, which in the initial stages appeared to be bringing gifts without strings attached. The spectrum is wide-ranging: the worst would probably be either the French or the British and at the other end of the scale we have Swedes who apply no such strings to their aid programmes.  Therefore, there are commerical implications to an aid programme.  Some of them are not very clean, to use a specific word for it.</P>
    <P>The Government, in reply, should recognise that such commercial implications do exist and indicate what their attitude is likely to be or, if I am asking too much too soon, to give some indication as to when they would let it be known what is their attitude and perhaps get involved with the Department of Foreign Affairs on this and, in particular, the Confederation of Irish Industry, who are also involved.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="20" /> There is a final major point I should like to revert to briefly, because I should like a reply to it.  It is the whole question of the small industries and the role of the IDA.  The IDA is a tough professional organisation.  It acquired that expertise and position in a certain area.  There is a difficulty of a very major kind being thrust on the IDA if we ask them to be good at that level and in another sphere as well.  Accordingly, I question whether we do not need to regionalise this aspect of the IDA's work, to lock it in in a much more positive fashion with local authorities and the RDOs in order to get the lift-off with the 3,000 small Irish businesses who could in many cases significantly expand their employment with very little capital aid from the State.</P>
    <P>A final proviso would be that in the granting of any such aid to any private company the whole position, to begin with, of trade union recognition, of the rights of trade unions, of access for shop stewards, all of that must&mdash; if it is not already so&mdash;be a condition of such aid being granted.  Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary would be good enough to have that position clarified for me.  I am not sufficiently familiar with the practices of the IDA in this regard to be sure whether or not that is already the case; I suspect that possibly it is.  Certainly, if it is not the case, we would be moving on Committee Stage to have it so.</P>
    <P>I should like to conclude by saying that we welcome the speedy reintroduction of this Bill.  We recognise that the Government have a difficult task in terms of job creation.  We recognise that they are forced into playing a numbers game and frequently the numbers will be altered or changed if the game appears too difficult, as we saw yesterday for the first time.  Two attitudes can be taken on that.  It could be said that it was a purely cynical, dishonest political move.  I would not describe it as such a motive.  I would say, more openly and honestly, it is an indication from the people in charge of the steering wheel at present just how great is the crisis of unemployment here.  Therefore, there is the overriding necessity to do something quickly <Col N="21" /> about it.  In so far as this Bill confers additional powers which the IDA themselves sought to provide such employment, I welcome it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity of making my maiden speech on the Industrial Development Authority Bill especially since it is concerned with enhancing job creation facilities.</P>
      <P>Reviewing the IDA and its role to date in the development of the Irish industrial sector there is no doubt but that it has made a major contribution. In fact the activities of the IDA have been well recognised not alone here but abroad, as was evidenced recently by the American award to the managing director of that body.  However, like all human organisations, it can be improved. I should like to offer some suggestions in the hope that they may be of help to the IDA as they redirect their efforts in the pivotal test of the creation of jobs in this country.  We all appreciate that is the cardinal job we must undertake today, the provision of jobs for our people.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to the three main programmes operated by the IDA.  I should like to refer to each of those.  Under the new industrial programme, concerned mainly with the attraction of new projects from overseas, I should like to suggest and recommend that the IDA become more selective under two main headings. There must be greater technological selectivity.  In other words, the IDA should concentrate on a number of key industries rather than adopting a haphazard approach.  Such key industries should be related to sectors where Ireland has distinct natural advantages. Despite our need for job creation we should try to keep away what are called &ldquo;dirty&rdquo; industries.  We must remember that the tourist industry is our second largest industry and we must maintain a balance between industrialisation and preservation of the natural beauty and the environment of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the second heading the IDA should be more selective in the location of industries.  With regard to foreign industries, the IDA should locate similar industries adjacent to <Col N="22" /> each other in order to get linked development.  I welcome the announcement by the Minister that he is extending the programme of small industry clusters.</P>
    <P>The IDA should be asked for their plans for their industrial location strategy in the next five years.  In 1972 they produced regional development plans.  Prior to that there was the Buchanan Report on the location of industry throughout the country.  So far as County Cork is concerned the IDA appear to be implementing the Buchanan line rather than their own industrial plans.  For instance, in the Cork city area they have 1,100 acres of land for industrial development but 60 miles away in Bantry, which has one of the finest natural harbours in the world and which is an area that is denuded of population, the IDA have not one acre of industrial land to provide jobs for the people.  I hope that the Minister will examine that anomaly so far as Cork is concerned.</P>
    <P>Greater selectivity by the IDA in terms of the type of new industry and their location would lead to linked development, to upstream and downstream development, and the creation of supply and service industries to add to the multiplier effect of jobs created by the industry itself.  An example of such linked development through the location of similar industries is in Cork.  Since the American Pfizer Corporation came to the Lower Harbour area of Cork in 1970 Cork has become a pharmaceutical centre of excellence. United States, German, Swedish and Italian pharmaceutical firms have located in Little Island since the advent of the Pfizer company at Ringaskiddy.</P>
    <P>In discussing the continued attraction of foreign industry here, it is absolutely essential that we maintain our incentives, especially the tax holiday incentive up to 1990.  As the House is aware, this incentive was obtained as a special protocol by Fianna Fáil during our entry negotiations to the EEC.  I should like to compliment the Minister on his dynamic approach to retaining this incentive. However, in the context of continuing and protracted EEC <Col N="23" /> negotiations I would express my disquiet at the recent announcement that the IDA have closed their Brussels office.  We are not abandoning Brussels at this time.  I think we should get more involved there and I cannot understand the decision to close the IDA office.  I regard that as a retrograde step and I would ask the Minister to see that the decision is re-examined as a matter of critical national importance.</P>
    <P>The second main programme of the IDA is the home industries programme which is related to the development of industry and the maintenance of existing industries.  We should be as concerned about the maintenance of existing industries as we are about the creation of new undertakings.  At the moment we have a bizarre situation where more than £1 million per week is being spent on attracting new industries while at the same time long-established existing industries are being squeezed to anaemic commercial skeletons by punitive company taxation. At least part of the money being spent on attracting new industries should be used to reduce company taxation.  With regard to new companies, I suggest a five-year moratorium on tax.  Company tax is a cost on the cash flow of a company and money saved in that area could be used for further development and further job creation.</P>
    <P>In this regard I welcome the concession given in the last budget where for certain industries corporation profits tax can be reduced to 25 per cent where there is an increase in production of 5 per cent and an increase in employment of 3 per cent. There is an incentive here to have additional jobs within a company whereas certain other expenditures, for instance, for re-equipment may modify or improve the plant in the company but much of the new plant and development is sometimes associated with redundancies and a reduction in the labour force because of automation and specialisation.</P>
    <P>In the past the IDA have tended to neglect Irish-owned industries in their singular concentration on attracting <Col N="24" /> foreign industries.  One could argue that it was only in 1974 when the IDA were charged with responsibility for Irish FEOGA grant applications that the authority became more familiar with the unprecedented potential of the Irish food-processing industry and agriculture-based industries generally. Because of this past neglect I welcome the fact that the major objective of the Bill is the encouragement and assistance of domestic industry, especially that based on Irish raw materials and entrepreneurial ability.</P>
    <P>In examining domestic industries I should like to draw the attention of the House to the important role of agriculture and agriculture-based industries involving both primary food production and food-processing activities. At present employment in the food-processing sector is 45,000 people and in 1976 exports were valued at £664 million.  However, even beyond that so far as rural Ireland and reversing rural decay are concerned the regional significance of the food industry is of paramount importance where jobs tend to be located close to the source of raw materials.  The regional importance of agriculture-based industries is important nationally, socially and economically above and beyond the size of the industry concerned.  I would commend to the IDA, to the Department of Industry, Commerce and Energy and to the Department of Agriculture the untapped potential of Irish agriculture-based industries to fuel the expansion of future industrial development.</P>
    <P>Recently experts referred to &ldquo;green gold&rdquo;, highlighting the ability of our temperate climate to grow grass and convert it into valuable livestock, meat and dairy products.  While other countries may be able to boast of their gold mines and oil wells, we should never forget that our comparable natural resource or wealth is represented by our food factories and food processing plants.</P>
    <P>I now draw attention to our four-legged gold.  Other speakers have referred to the economic drain caused by the continual export of cattle on the hoof.  I would like to see the establishment of a sophisticated value-added <Col N="25" /> meat processing industry where the meat would be processed all the way to the consumer's table.  We would do well to remember that we are the largest exporters of livestock in the EEC.</P>
    <P>I welcome the recent initiative of the IDA in commissioning the Cooper and Lybran report on the meat processing industry.  I hope those recommendations will be implemented and translated into commercial operations by the IDA and other relevant bodies, such as CBF and the industrial firms involved in this business.  I would like to compliment the Minister for Agriculture on his recent advice to the CBF board to find new markets involving value added products because the more processing we do, the more jobs will be created and the more industrial activity we will have.</P>
    <P>The final element of the IDA's existing programme has been the small industries programme.  Other speakers have advanced the view, and I support it strongly, that the IDA, in tending to ignore domestic industry, were especially culpable in overlooking small firms.  Therefore, I recommend that the small industries programme be completely revamped and a much greater injection of dynamism and aggressiveness be introduced.</P>
    <P>The second main objective of the Bill&mdash;the stimulation of the emergence of new entrepreneurs in much greater numbers&mdash;is an implied admission that the small industries programme has not been as successful as it should have been.  The IDA have their main offices in Dublin with offices in major cities around the country, and they are not as familiar as they might be with the industrial problems in small rural towns.  I suggest and recommend that the responsibilities for small industries employing fewer than 25 persons be handed over to the county development teams already in existence. I do not wish to recommend that a new body be set up because those teams have the local knowledge and are conversant with problems in rural towns.  At present they are strait-jacketed by the IDA's list of what are called sensitive industries.  Some industries which are considered sensitive <Col N="26" /> and therefore not eligible for grant aids would benefit by help from the IDA.  I cannot understand why the IDA cannot give aid to industries in small rural towns which would provide gainful employment and which would not in any way diminish the ability of the larger industries in the same field.</P>
    <P>We have an indication of this in west Cork.  In the peninsula areas, 100 miles from Cork city, quarrying and road surfacing materials are being drawn from Cork city and the trucks are damaging road structure around the county.  Those industries will not get grant aids from the IDA even though quarrying is the greatest natural asset in those areas.  In Clonakilty we have a broiler processing plant employing up to 50 people.  They do not get grant aids because they are not processing in excess of a million birds per annum.  The IDA are unduly restrictive in this area and I recommend that the responsibility for those industries be handed over to the county development teams.</P>
    <P>In his introductory comments the Minister referred to four new measures which the IDA introduced in recent years.  I suggest that these activities are very relevant to the development of small industrial undertakings.  In the context of the joint venture scheme and the project identification units based on import substitution, the IDA should work closely with Córas Tráchtála who are attuned to the opportunities for export substitution and the potential for exports and who have a number of excellent offices well manned around the world to provide the IDA with this information.</P>
    <P>The IDA should work in close liaison with relevant bodies, such as An Foras Talúntais, The Institute for Industrial Research and Standards, An Foras Forbartha, the National Economic and Social Council and our universities, who may suggest very important ideas which could have commercial implications.  The IDA could liaise more effectively with those bodies.  Perhaps the Minister for Economic Planning and Development might look into this matter.  Closer liaison between the IDA and semi-State <Col N="27" /> bodies, such as An Bord Bainne, Bord na Móna and Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann Teoranta, would inject greater dynamism into the IDA's product development scheme, the uptake of which has not been very encouraging to date.  However, the lifting of the ceiling from £15,000 to £50,000, as proposed in this Bill, should act as an added incentive.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the new powers being proposed to allow the IDA to take majority shareholdings in new industrial undertakings in the future. This will allow the authority to provide risk venture capital for industrial projects with commercial interests which may not be able to undertake these risks on their own.  This development should encourage Irish entrepreneurs to come forward with their ideas more readily.</P>
    <P>I now come to the final section of my contribution.  I would like to comment on the merits of the National Development Corporation compared with this Government's proposal for an industrial development consortium.  I support the Government's approach and reject the concept of a national development corporation for three reasons.  First, the setting up of a new structure in this difficult area is no guarantee of success. In fact, it is more likely to be the opposite.  We have only to look across the water at the many problems of the National Enterprise Board, and we are all aware of the problems of British Leyland in recent years.  Secondly, another body, I believe, would create unnecessary duplication in this area; and, thirdly, and related to this, I believe the creation of a national development corporation would raise artificial problems of overlapping and demarcation with existing organisations and in particular overlapping with the IDA.</P>
    <P>I recommend that we adopt the well-proved method of setting up a special semi-State body or State-sponsored body to fill the particular industrial vacuum as it occurs.  I would like, in supporting the practical concept of an industrial development consortium with its inherent avoidance of duplication, demarcation and overlapping, to make <Col N="28" /> two suggestions.  First&mdash;I consider this to be of paramount importance&mdash;the Minister and Secretary of the Department of Agriculture should be involved in this consortium from the outset.  I cannot understand how we can have a consortium with responsibility for industrial development without our greatest industry.  I strongly recommend that the Minister and Secretary of the Department of Agriculture be involved in this consortium from the very start.  The Minister in his opening speech referred to co-ordinating the activities of existing new semi-State agencies, to examining the contributions of these agencies to industrial development. Secondly, I recommend in this regard a flexible approach especially in terms of membership of the new body.  I would argue that, as well as the obvious choices of the IDA, Córas Tráchtála, the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards, AnCO, the Industrial Credit Corporation, Fóir Teoranta, other research institutions and semi-State companies should be included in this consortium as well as the new Board of Science and Technology which will act as a direct link with the universities and be helpful to the input of outside technological innovation.</P>
    <P>I suggest that no organisation which possesses a potential for contribution in any way in industrial development should be left out of the consortium. In case anybody would regard the size of this body as elephantine in proportion I believe that in practice participation by the various bodies involved would be facilitated by the formation of relevant sub-committees which would report back to the Ministerial consortium.  I suggest that entrepreneurs and bureaucracy are strange bedfellows and if the consortium is to be successful it has to be innovative and pioneering in its activities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>When one reflects on the history of industrial expansion in this country from the early years of protectionism to the establishment of the IDA under a former Coalition Government and right up to the sophisticated approach involved in the expansion programme, one can see <Col N="29" /> how ineffective we have been in really progressing industrially as a nation. We have not made a great contribution to employment in manufacturing industries here.  The reason is basically simple.  We are a peripheral nation, we are on the edge of the Atlantic and we have no road network directly into the heart of the main market in England and Europe.  It is not very attractive for some industries to come here.  We still find it difficult, even with our incentives and policies, ranging from grants to tax holidays, advance factories and everything else. The Minister mentioned that in his speech.</P>
      <P>I am perturbed at the reports from Brussels, taking into account that we are a peripheral nation and a member of a huge wealthy European club, that the EEC are reviewing their policy towards grant attractions being given by member states.  I am aware that the Minister made a public statement on the matter but even after that there was another report saying that the EEC were reviewing their attitude to the policy of giving grants and attracting new industry.  The Minister should elaborate fully on what exactly is happening in the EEC, what new industrialists can expect from the Government in the foreseeable future.  We cannot afford, under any circumstances, any watering down of our existing attractive policies in relation to new industry and expanding industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There must be a full commitment from the Government that they will not allow the EEC to change their policy in this field.  It is all the more important because the whole country has been designated an underdeveloped country by the EEC for the purposes of the Regional Fund and regional policies.  It must be realised in that context that we cannot afford to be hobbled in any way in relation to our industrial policies.  The size of the Regional Fund gives cause for concern and also the percentage we receive is pathetically low <i>vis-á-vis</i> the actual wealth which exists in the Community and <i>vis-á-vis</i> the moneys which other countries are getting in absolute terms.  There must be a far greater commitment from the EEC to Ireland, <Col N="30" /> there must be a full understanding of our need for industrialisation and a full commitment in Brussels towards us as a developing nation in regard to industrialisation and regional policy.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in introducing the Bill, acknowledged that the Bill was mostly the brainchild of the National Coalition Government.  It was there when the new Government came into power and they were satisfied it had merits.  Even though the Government are adding two new sections to the Bill, basically it is the brainchild of the National Coalition Government.</P>
    <P>Before I deal with that I want to quote the Minister at column 150 of the Official Report of 2nd November:</P>
    <P>Already the Government have initiated a series of measures in key areas which will create over 5,000 new jobs in 1977 and will contribute to the target of 20,000 new jobs in the year to mid-1978.</P>
    <P>We, on this side, would dearly like to see the unemployment figures decreasing and the employment figures increasing.  The Government can be assured of our full support in any positive measures they take to achieve that object but the statistics produced weekly by the Central Statistics Office do not show that employment is increasing or that unemployment is decreasing. Quite the contrary.  Unemployment appears to be increasing. While I accept the seasonality involved in that increase, nevertheless the promises made by the Government during the last election in June do not appear to be fulfilled.  There is a motion down for the Adjournment in respect of this. The Government are failing in their promises and, while we do not like to see them failing, we must say that those of us in responsible political parties will not go around promising the impossible.  We will examine the figures as they come to see the effectiveness of Government policy.  To date all the signs are that the Government promises will not be fulfilled.</P>
    <P>The Minister outlined the three basic functions of the IDA, a new industrial programme designed basically to attract industry from overseas, the home industries programme and the small industries programme.  These <Col N="31" /> have been the basic activities of the IDA in which they have been successful. Deputy Quinn praised the members of the IDA and I should like to re-echo what he said.  It is a professional body with a positive approach to the need for industrialisation.  That is important.  It is good.  The members of that body must be <i>au fait</i> with industry both here and abroad.  They must be competent.  They must have money at their disposal, money the House has always granted them, to ensure a flexible policy in attracting industry here and expanding existing industry.  That is the aim of the IDA and they have been doing a good job.</P>
    <P>There were two services we introduced, the joint venture scheme and the services industry scheme.  These were brought in two or three years back.  It was part of the up-dating of a more flexible approach.  The joint venture scheme appeals to me very much because many old established small concerns which are not prospering, basically because they have not got the know-how, the money and the expertise, can be helped by the IDA by that body bringing them together with bigger industries, whether domestic or foreign.  That is a positive approach.  The services industry has a great deal to offer.  Indeed, they have a highly valuable export commodity to offer.</P>
    <P>The powers of the IDA are being expanded and, instead of only a minority, they will now in certain circumstances be able to increase equity holdings to 100 per cent sometimes with Government approval.  This is an innovation, a departure from the traditional role of the IDA.  So is the guarenteeing of loans and the giving of interest subsidies not only to first time industrialists but also in the case of mergers and acquisitions.  That is a major departure.</P>
    <P>The Minister emphasised the commitment to home industry and its restructuring.  That is a vital part, and a successful part, of the role of the IDA.  I am aware there are reports by experts in regard to certain industries in relation to so-called over-capacity. In certain industries the IDA refuse to <Col N="32" /> give grants.  Possibly they are too strict in this respect.  There may be need for a more limited approach in giving grants to existing holdings.  Though a question of over-capacity might arise the best judges of efficiency, capacity and profitability are those directly engaged in the industry and they should not be discouraged by the IDA; if anything, they should be encouraged to modernise and increase capacity.</P>
    <P>These two major departures, the power to take shareholding and the power to guarantee loans and grant interest subsidies, bring me to a point at which I should like the House to consider the role of the IDA <i>vis-à-vis</i> the Industrial Credit Company and Fóir Teoranta.  Both these bodies are actively engaged in the industrial and commercial life of the country.  I think Fóir Teoranta come in the role of a rescue operation, a last resource where industries are in difficulties.  Many Deputies have made representations to Fóir Teoranta and are all well aware of their flexibility.  Fóir Teoranta appoint directors and chief executives. Generally they are doing a very good job and have protected employment in a number of industries.  I should like to pay a special tribute to them in regard to their work in the past two difficult years.</P>
    <P>Another semi-State body which have already participated in equity and grant loans are the ICC.  They are a more commercial organisation and are now virtually an independent merchant bank.  They are very commercially geared, they are flexible in relation to participation in industrial concerns, but there is the problem that the IDA are now coming into this field of equity and interest subsidy as well as loan guarantees, and I wonder is there overlapping. Should the IDA not remain a purely grant giving authority and leave the equity and loan guarantee business to the ICC in the first instance? The Minister acknowledged this problem when he said that a more comprehensive view of the IDA's powers and functions will be undertaken in relation to Fóir Teoranta.  He said in his opening statement:</P>
    <P>I have in mind the possibility that Fóir Teo. might be revamped <Col N="33" /> into a body not associated with impending &ldquo;bankruptcy&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>He seemed to admit that there is a dichotomy in relation to the activities of the IDA and Fóir Teoranta.  The Minister went on:</P>
    <P>Such possible restructuring might entail transfer of shareholdings acquired by the IDA and other bodies to the new entity.  But further study and deliberation will be needed before we can come to final conclusions on these matters.</P>
    <P>Therefore, the Minister sees the need for rationalisation of the services offered by the State in this sphere through a comprehensive united approach where everybody would see exactly what his functions and responsibilities will be and where there will be no overlapping.</P>
    <P>Because of the provision of this Bill there must be an expert review of the roles of these three bodies in regard to industrial promotion and employment maintenance.  I should like the Minister to expand on this matter when he is replying.</P>
    <P>The innovation in regard to the taking of shares and the guaranteeing of loan interest subsidies is welcomed and is a further reflection of the flexible approach to the attracting of industries.  However, I am worried about new concerns coming into the country either by way of joint venture with existing Irish industries or as independent foreign companies.  Any firm receiving State grants require thorough investigation.  Great care must be taken by the IDA to ensure that a new company will be established properly, that they will be properly incorporated and that their articles of association and memoranda are seen to be crystal clear by experts in the field.  It must be seen that they have technical capabilities and that they are fully capitalised.  I know of one firm which were grossly undercapitalised and when they began to lose money they were not able to survive.  That sort of thing must be avoided in future.  Care should also be taken to provide that all new companies in receipt of State grants will have six-monthly audits of their accounts by a responsible, recognised <Col N="34" /> firm of accountants.  All these things are vitally important.  In their absence there is danger of unnecessary collapses.</P>
    <P>The last speaker referred to the role of local IDA offices.  I should like to point out that the IDA regional offices are very active.  In the industrial estate in Waterford they have acquired a land bank in which there is a site which would be very suitable for the establishment of a smelter.  I sincerely hope such an undertaking will be built in Waterford, which has been badly hit by the recent recession.  Some old firms collapsed as well as some of the new ones in the industrial estate.  In the case of the Wellworthy organisation, there were great hopes that 800 or 1,000 people would be employed but these hopes did not materialise due to an inter-union dispute.  This is very saddening.</P>
    <P>The ICTU must be concerned about the inter-union disputes but I do not wish to enter into that.  I have always found the trade union movement very responsible in relation to the development of employment and I hope they will evolve a system to facilitate the unionisation of new factories or of existing undertakings without any of the trade unions having recourse to inter-union warfare.  We cannot afford such a situation and I firmly believe that the ICTU will devise a system to facilitate the unions in doing their proper work.  There must be a simple way forward and I hope that whatever policy is formulated will be accepted by those unions which are not affiliated to the ICTU.</P>
    <P>Sense must prevail in this area if we are to attract foreign industrialists.  The last thing they want is trouble of any description; they want proper services, proper housing for their workers and managers, a proper transport system and a good infrastructure.  We cannot sit back and see our future disrupted.</P>
    <P>The Government have decided to establish an Industrial Development Consortium instead of the national development corporation which was proposed by the Coalition Government.  I have seen the structure of the Industrial Development Consortium and I am satisfied that it will be an ineffective <Col N="35" /> body.  It is too big and unwieldy and anyone in public life would agree that the best committee is a small committee. One always gets more work done in small committees.  This monolithic body will not be successful.  Departments may pull against each other instead of with each other.  Semi-State bodies and the Departments will be vying for funds and the all-powerful eye of the Minister for Finance will be on all concerned.  We all know how penurious the coffers can become after an election.</P>
    <P>The concept of the national development corporation was sound in that it was intended to bring into the corporation experts from various fields who could consider activities in a way that private and public industry have not been able to do or in which they have not been interested or for which these sectors did not have the technical and financial capability.  It would have been a good way forward and would have been a positive step towards the realisation of our national aims.  I am sorry that the present Government are not going ahead with this plan.  Certainly the substitute consortium is only a pale image of what we considered to be necessary.</P>
    <P>I should like to hear more from the Minister about the powers and functions of this body.  What teeth will they have?  In what activities will they be involved?  Will they simply be an advisory body?  This is a half-baked solution to a problem which the Coalition Government had decided to tackle in a positive way.  I feel that the reason the present Government are not going ahead with the previous plan is that it was the brainchild of the last administration.  The new consortuim will be seen not to succeed and to be merely a talking shop.  In certain areas the IDA, the ICC, Fóir Teoranta and An Foras Forbartha are doing good work and they are very efficient but I am certain that the Industrial Development Consortium will not be effective.</P>
    <P>The matter of the training grants was raised and I should like the Minister to elaborate further on the role of AnCO and of the regional technical <Col N="36" /> colleges in relation to the training of apprentices and technicians in specialist skills.  There seems to be a certain impasse at present and I should like to know the Minister's mind on this matter.  I hope the Minister will give a more elaborate reply on the developing roles of the IDA, the ICC and Fóir Teoranta.  These three bodies are closely linked and in order to have an orderly and fully understood development of our industrial policy a clear way forward should be established.</P>
    <P>The attitude of the EEC towards our industrial policy needs to be clarified. The Minister should elaborate on our stand in relation to regional development and the development of Dublin.  We need a clear undertaking, on which there will be no surrender, that we will be allowed to continue our industrial expansion programmes; that we will not be deprived of funds from Brussels; that we will be given support from the Regional Fund and from the institutions of the EEC. Even though the Minister spoke on this matter some time ago, he should now make a statement which would clarify our future position.  This is a matter of vital importance and it is not right that there should be a question mark over our policy.  Because of any decision which might be taken against us in Brussels, our position must be clarified and clearly understood here and in Brussels.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on his appointment and wish him well.  He can be sure of our support of any positive measures he takes in relation to industrial policy.</P>
    <P>The past four years have been sad ones for all of us.  It is somewhat shattering to see young school leavers without employment and to see married men and women unable to support their families.  We were criticised for our social welfare policy.  At one stage we were accused of giving too much but nothing could be further from the truth.  Many of the unemployed are skilled craftsmen.  It is sad that they are unable to find employment. We must use all the means at our disposal to create more employment. If we do not do this, we <Col N="37" /> could have a breakdown in our society.</P>
    <P>The trade union movement and employers have the responsibility of ensuring that the way forward will be smooth.  Three years ago, when I was Mayor of Waterford, I was involved as a mediator in two unofficial strikes in which the Labour Court would not become involved.  The initial reaction to the strikes was that they were caused by a few hotheads.  When I inquired into the disputes I discovered that the strikes had been caused by bad management. The men on strike were the innocent victims of grossly bad management.  We cannot afford bad management nor can we afford irresponsible trade unionists.  I believe the ICTU is a responsible body.  I hope the future will be smooth for our industries.  If it is not, we will not be able to attract foreign investment or to create employment.  If that happens, our democracy may be challenged by anarchists and communists who have no attachment to our way of life.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>We all know that the main problem facing our society is unemployment. When we talk of industrial development we are referring to the creation of employment.  We have reached the turning point in our industrial history.  Until the late fifties we were mainly an agricultural society. Since then, we have succeeded in attracting foreign industries and some of our entrepreneurs have established industries.  Our people now expect that industrial development will continue and that jobs will be provided for them.  Most people expect to improve their standard of living year by year.  The duty of the Government is to encourage industry in order to provide more employment.  We all know that businesses are not established for the love of the people.  Industrialists, whether they be foreign or Irish, establish businesses to make profits for themselves and their shareholders. The main word is profit.  They are not going to set up an industry here <Col N="38" /> unless they are satisfied they can get an adequate return on the money they invest.  That is a well-understood idea from speeches I heard over the years. Politicians on occasions forget that industrialists, Irish or foreign, do not set up an industry for the love of our people.  We must be able to provide an adequate return for industrialists if they are to be attracted here.</P>
    <P>Environmental considerations should not be the only guidelines, that we say, leave well enough alone and do not destroy the beautiful countryside and so on.  Nobody has yet found it possible to live on a diet of fresh air and scenery.  No matter what the aesthetic value is the nutritional value is nil.  The reason we require industry is to have employment for our people. All politicians want to see the maximum number of people employed here.  We all have our own ideas as to how this can be achieved.  Some subscribe to different ideas as to how this will be achieved.  Some believe in the principle of free enterprise&mdash;ful capitalism&mdash;while others believe in a mixture of State and free enterprise and others in complete socialism. Irrespective of what we believe in we are all united in wanting to see ful employment and a rewarding and fulfilling life for our people.</P>
    <P>An industry will commence in either of three ways.  First, we can encourage a foreign industrialist to set up here and, secondly, a native concern might decide to commence an industry. Thirdly, the State might become directly involved in industrial activity. I wish to examine those starting points. Our growth over the past 20 years has been primarily by foreign industrialists starting here.  The primary ingredients for starting any industry are finance and an entrepreneurial spirit.  Ireland, having had no industrial development up to the fifties did not have either of those two basic ingredients and, consequently, in order to prime the pump it was necessary to encourage foreign industrialists to set up here.  We did not have the people with the expertise, the initiative or sufficient finance to start industrial development.  In order to attract them we gave tax concessions, grant aids and so on.  The IDA <Col N="39" /> played a prominent part in attracting them.  We are in the market with limited resources and we must ask ourselves: why should a foreigner come here to start a business when he would be welcome in any other country?</P>
    <P>Foreigners come here to start a business because of the plentiful supply of labour and, perhaps, the cheapness of it.  If we are to continue to attract foreign capital our drive in the eighties must be based on a different premise to that of the sixties.  We now have a highly unionised labour force and labour is by no means cheap here. Consequently, foreign industrialists will be looking at the total world scene.  In that context bad industrial relations will not entice them here.  Above all else foreign investors wish to see stability.  Industrial relations here leave a lot to be desired and unofficial industrial actions, which neither unions nor managements condone, give us a bad name.  It can have the effect of discouraging foreign investors from coming here.  Foreign industrialists like to see stable institutions.</P>
    <P>A major part in our industrial growth and in attracting foreigners was the export sales relief concession.  For some time that only applied to firms set up by foreigners but it has been extended so that most firms get the benefit of it.  That incentive will end in the next ten years.  If we are to continue to encourage foreign industrialists to come here we must compete with the incentives other countries are offering.  For that reason it will be necessary to have another look at the incentives we can offer to attract firms here in the eighties.  Our growth in the eighties will have to be shared between foreign and home-based firms.  I am glad that the IDA for a number of years have been encouraging, through their small industries programme, the setting up of home-produced industries. Having had industrial growth for a number of years we now have a number of individuals with business flair and talent awaiting the opportunity to branch out into manufacturing and other fields.  Finance is usually a major obstacle to the initiating of many worth while projects.  Under this <Col N="40" /> Bill it will be possible for the IDA to encourage individual enterprise.  Apart from the normal fixed assets grants which the IDA have been giving for a number of years they will now be in a position to guarantee loans for working capital.</P>
    <P>It must be remembered that grants are only of assistance once the idea has been sold to a bank or a finance house.  Those institutions are in business for profit.  Their shareholders cannot put their money into every speculative adventure.  Some bank managers are very conservative and growth in business in many areas here has been stunted by their attitude.  On the other hand, I can give numerous examples of businesses set up on the chance a bank manager took in his client.  A number of businesses now giving a lot of employment would not have started were it not for a bank manager putting his trust in an individual and giving him a loan.  The colossal growth of the banking institutions here now makes it more difficult for that type of initiative to commence. There are increasing areas of bureaucracy in banking.  It is not always left to the local manager to make a decision.  It is a pity that a person with flair who is anxious to start a business is stymied in that regard.</P>
    <P>It takes time for a small business to grow and if we are to provide employment rapidly we must look to the existing firms and the individuals with the wealth who are in a position to start industries.  In this regard the legislation on wealth tax introduced by the National Coalition was a disastrous mistake.  If wealth tax legislation was to be introduced it should have been done in a period of economic prosperity and not when we were trying to encourage people to come here and those living here to put more money into business concerns. I can see no justification for the introduction of the wealth tax. The effect it had on industry is still being felt.  The reason given for introducing it was to redistribute wealth and there is no evidence that that had had any basis in fact.</P>
    <P>I have no hesitation in saying that I am opposed in principle to wealth <Col N="41" /> taxation no matter what Government introduce it.  I want to encourage people to create wealth and jobs.  I believe in an equitable form of taxation for all sections of the community but I have never seen any good reasons for a wealth tax.  The effect of wealth taxation on the job creation situation can be highlighted by a small example.  In a recent IDA news report their estimation of the amount of money they have to put in to create a job is £3,650.  On that basis a person with £1.1 million could create approximately 350 jobs.  Supposing the average annual income is £2,500 earned in that industry, with 350 jobs it would mean that the wages in workers' pockets per annum would be £875,000.  Since there would be a multiplier effect in the community, and if we take the multiplier as three, the indirect money that that would create would be a little over £2.6 million.  Therefore, the annual loss, were that industry not set up, would be £3.5 million.  The total wealth tax collectible from a man with £1.1 million wealth would be approximately £10,000, apart from the loss of PAYE and social welfare revenue that could be going into the State coffers in order to create other worthwhile projects and give social welfare relief to people who need it.  I know of instances where people with money to invest did not do so on account of the wealth tax legislation. If that is the creation of wealth and the re-distribution of wealth, then there is something very wrong here. I would earnestly hope that that iniquitous tax would be removed.</P>
    <P>Regarding the role of the State in enterprise, I am not dogmatic all the time about private enterprise, or that that is the only way in which jobs will be created.  We must accept that perhaps the time will come, or has come when the State must play a more active role in the creation of jobs. Whereas an ordinary firm has a profit element as its guideline, the State has not got that criterion.  Therefore, it would be very difficult to arrive at a compromise where there would be State involvement in the commercial field.  It is the function of the State to create the environment and infrastructure <Col N="42" /> to encourage private enterprise to create jobs.  If the time comes when private enterprise does not seem to be able to match that, the State will have to help in the creation of jobs. The question must be asked whether it is better for the State to pay out large amounts in unemployment benefit each year, or whether it would be better that the State use that money to set up an industry absorbing some portion of the 100,000 persons presently unemployed.  Apart from whether or not there was a very small profit made in that industry, the spinoff in that area would be immense.</P>
    <P>The question must be asked by politicians on all sides of the House whether it is better to pay people merely to sit at home unable to get a job or rather to devote that amount of money into the setting up of an industry to employ them.  Perhaps the IDA would help in this regard with the backing of the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy.  Primarily it is a matter for the Government, for the Minister for Finance and the new Minister for Economic Planning and Development.  We must face up to that reality.</P>
    <P>We are all agreed on the tremendous need for job creation.  During the election campaign politicians from all sides disputed the number of jobs needed.  My party forcefully pointed out that if the Government were unable to hold the fort over the past four years what chances had we in the next ten with upward of 30,000 new jobs to be created per annum.  Now we are in power and people will be asking us &ldquo;What are you going to do in the next four of five years you are in office?&rdquo;  If, at the end of those four or five years they see nothing, then many of us on this side of the House will not be returned to Dáil Éireann.</P>
    <P>The figures referred to have been mainly those of Dr. Brendan Walsh in the NESC Report.  The NESC commissioned him recently to update his projections.  In those latest projections he comes up with the forecast that between 23,000 and 28.000 nett new jobs per annum will have to be created between now and 1986 if we are to get unemployment down to a level of 5 per cent.  That level of 5 per cent <Col N="43" /> is referred to as an acceptable one. I should like to go on public record here as saying that politicians and institutions of the State should accept no level of unemployment but rather should be going for a target of 100 per cent employment.</P>
    <P>When full employment was spoken about in 1968 2 per cent was regarded as the acceptable level of unemployment. That has now gone up to 4 per cent or 5 per cent.  Part of the reason advanced in that NESC Report was that anticipated levels had fallen.  If we analyse what that phrase means, it means that there are people now in our society who are unemployed, who will never be employed because they do not want to be.  Perhaps that is a reflection on Irish society, that we now accept that there will be a percentage of the population that does not want to be employed. Part of the reason given in the NESC Report was that earnings of people not employed now were such that the differential was insufficient to encourage them back to work.  I have never said that unemployment benefits were too high.  What I do say is that the differential between what a person can earn at work in industry and what he can obtain when he is not working is not sufficient to encourage him to work that little bit harder, or to go to work at all.  We all know of instances where the average wage is £50 per week.  PAYE and a social welfare stamp are deducted and the employee goes home with perhaps £40 net per week.  If that employee has a sore head on a Monday morning after a hard weekend's drinking and he knows he can get £30 for not going to work, the differential of £10 in many cases will not be sufficient to get him to go to work.</P>
    <P>Apart from that we must face up to the fact that many people have been doing nixers, getting tax-free money and that there is a growing number of people who will not return to work. During the election campaign no party was courageous enough to highlight that.  If there was any one thing that put out the last Government it was that working people are not prepared to be paying a social welfare stamp, <Col N="44" /> between employer and employees of £7 per week, high taxation, then going home and seeing people who never went to work doing twice as well.  The Government will have to face up to this fact and encourage people to work.</P>
    <P>The ending of emigration since approximately 1971 has meant&mdash;allied with the fact that under the free education system we are now encouraging our children to remain longer at school, making them highly articulate, more educated than were their fathers and mothers&mdash;that higher demands are being made on the State.  They do not look to the emigrant ship.  They expect that the Government and the State will provide employment for them and that prospects will improve for them each year.  Above all they expect to get a fulfilling job in their own country.</P>
    <P>Our population is growing at a rate of 17 per cent per annum, a faster rate than any other European country. Our children are continuing their education to a greater extent than previously and if we do not create the number of jobs referred to in the NESC report we will have a dangerous problem in the next seven or ten years. If we do not create up to 28,000 jobs each year there will be 300,000 people unemployed in 1986.  They will be articulate young people aged between 18 and 25 years.  They will ask what have society, the politicians or the institutions of the State done for them and I am afraid the answer will be nothing. They will dispose of us.  There will be no need for politicians then.  Some commentators have said that Fianna Fáil may be in power for many years but if the situation that I have described arises it might be that neither Fine Gael, Labour nor Fianna Fáil will be here to share the spoils of victory or to suffer defeat.  Those are the problems that the Government must tackle.</P>
    <P>The IDA will be our major arm in providing employment.  The major impetus will be in the creation of manufacturing employment because for every one additional job created in manufacturing industry there will be one additional job in other sectors, in transport and other spheres.  In the Economic and Social Research Institute <Col N="45" /> Report it is estimated that employment in manufacturing industry is growing faster than at any time since 1958. There will be 10,000 more people employed in manufacturing industry than was the case at the end of last year. However, at the end of this year there will still be 4,300 fewer people employed in the industry than was the case at the end of the first quarter of 1974.  In that year there were 206,700 people employed in manufacturing industry and even though we are coming out of the recession there are still considerably fewer people employed in that sector.  It will be some time before we catch up with the job losses experienced between 1974 and 1977.</P>
    <P>There is a time lag between recovery in output and growth in employment. I suggest the reason is that in the recent recession which started biting early in 1974 rather than letting go workers firms kept them on.  However, as the recession deepened and when it looked as though the world markets were not going to pick up, firms started to let people go.  Now the world recession is easing and economic activity is starting again but firms are very slow to take back those people who were let go.  If we experience a growth rate next year of 6 per cent, as has been predicted, only then will we start to see an increase in employment fairly comparable to 6 per cent. At the moment we have a recovery in output but we are not experiencing the same recovery in employment.  All the economic indicators are that next year we will have a substantial increase in GNP.  At the end of next year and in the following two years it will be necessary to add to the capital stock in industry.  During the recession obsolete machinery was not replaced but in the next two years it will be necessary for industry to invest in new machinery and equipment.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Walsh in his comments on the new industrial consortium, that the Minister and Secretary of the Department of Agriculture should play an important part in that body.  It was suggested in a report recently that if there was a growth rate in agriculture of 4 per cent we would be able to create 77,000 jobs.  Half of <Col N="46" /> those jobs would be created in outside industries related to agriculture, in the food-processing industry and so on, 35,000 or 36,000 would be created on farms with the rest coming from outside the farm.  Agriculture is our greatest natural resource and the Minister for Agriculture and other officials in his Department should be brought into the industrial consortium suggested.  In the drive to create new jobs they will have a leading role.</P>
    <P>If that number of jobs can be created through expansion of agriculture it is essential that we do nothing to discourage farmers from increasing their output.  The employment potential is there.  That is what we must remember when considering the question of farmer taxation.  If we hurt production by having too steep a system of taxation we are putting the cart before the horse.  That is the reason farmers will not expand and create employment and extra output will not come from the farms to go to the meat processing plants.  Farmer taxation must be considered in the Irish context and I would ask the Minister to ensure that nothing damaging is done to harm agricultural production through too severe a system of farm taxation.</P>
    <P>If agricultural output could be increased, extra jobs to the extent of 40 per cent could be created in the sheep trade.  I read recently that if Irish firms did more in the matter of meat processing, packaging and so on, if they sought new markets, there would be double the added value and 40 per cent more people would be employed in factories.</P>
    <P>Any drive to create new jobs must look at this.  We in my constituency are lucky because we have three large industries&mdash;Premier Meat Packers in Sallins and Irish Meat Packers in Leixlip and Kildare Chilling Company Limited.  The Minister and the IDA should be in close liaison with the Minister for the Environment.  I am sure if any of those factories were to apply for planning permission now, they would be refused.  If we are to create jobs we must choose which we want&mdash;healthy air or more people at work.  I opt for more people at work. I ask the Minister and the IDA to <Col N="47" /> ensure that not too stringent regulations are laid down for planning permission for food-processing industries. We should do nothing to discourage them.</P>
    <P>We want labour intensive industries. We must ask ourselves why industrialists are replacing men by machines? There are two answers; the first is productivity and the second is that people's attitudes towards strikes do not lend themselves to forward planning and so on.  As I said, we should try to attract industries with a high labour content.  That is why we should encourage the meat-processing industries. It is a national disgrace that we export such large numbers of cattle. The IDA should encourage meat factories to set up further processing plants, because the job creation potential there is immense.</P>
    <P>I welcome this Bill.  Its aims are to encourage individual enterprise, to have sectoral restructuring; it gives power to the IDA to take shareholdings in the new companies, and it empowers the IDA to give technical assistance to developing companies and research grants.  I have spoken about individual enterprise.  Section 2 says that amalgamations are to be encouraged to restructure industry. The IDA should lay down guidelines as to what criteria they should use when restructuring industry.  I would not like to think that various industries would be able to get grants to keep down their costs with resultant loss of jobs.  Restructuring in industry often means that part of a factory is closed down and jobs are lost.  I cannot see that these subsidies will help to create jobs.  I agree industries need to be restructured but I am not sure how the Minister will be able to encourage industries to restructure.</P>
    <P>In the sixties we had CIO reports which told industry &ldquo;if you do not adapt yourself for free trade and make economies, you will go out of business in the seventies when we join the EEC&rdquo;.  Very few industries did anything about this and the consequences over the last five years are only too plain to see.  Many of those industries, if they had taken the advice of the CIO reports, would have made <Col N="48" /> adequate provisions for new markets, phased down their work and done many other things, but very little was done.  That was not the fault of the CIO reports but of the individual industries which did not bother to read and take note of those reports.</P>
    <P>Under section 2 the IDA will encourage industry to restructure.  In various firms that may mean amalgamations. Individual firms will have to make decisions.  I would like to see the IDA being able to advise firms to amalgamate in order to meet free trade constraints.  How will the Minister put pressure on firms to do that?  Grants will be given to firms for restructuring. What will happen to the firms that should be doing this?  Has the Minister power to compel them to do it?  He might deal with this in his reply.</P>
    <P>Section 3 deals with enterprise development grants.  This is a very worthwhile section.  The IDA will continue to fix those grants but now they can guarantee working capital loans and so on to firms or individuals who were not previously involved in an industrial undertaking.  I suggest that not too rigid a standard be set in that respect. I appreciate it would be very difficult to be able to find out if a firm or a person was involved in such an activity before.  Will an entrepreneur who, for a variety of reasons, went broke be unable to avail of these grants, interest subsidies and so on for working capital?  We do not want to give State money to every dog, devil or chancer, but the IDA should look at each case on its merits.</P>
    <P>Section 9 gives power to the IDA to take shares and to participate in companies. If a shareholding greater than £1 million is contemplated, Government approval is necessary.  This could create problems if the IDA take a 20 per cent shareholding in any industrial undertaking.  If at a future date, the business is taken over by another firm I can see problems arising.  The Minister of the day will be looking at the prospects of another company and the Government will have to make up their minds whether to stay on, sell out or advise that the company be taken over.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="49" /> If the State are to be involved in industrial undertakings, new avenues will be open to us.  Individuals who work for State-owned firms seem to think that they need not make too much effort, and that they may put in any type of unjust wage demands.  The management feel that they can get away with anything because their jobs are guaranteed.  Nobody worries about money.  Everyone knows that they will be paid at the end of the week because the State has a say in the business. We must accept that.  Some State-sponsored bodies have been very successful but others have not.  If the State take over any enterprise people who work for that organisation seem to feel that they will be getting paid, that they can do as little as they like for as long as they like and that it will take an Act of Parliament to get rid of them.  The ordinary workers and management in State-sponsored bodies seem to have that attitude.  If we are to take part in industrial undertakings how can we guarantee that the workers will not have that attitude?  I would not like to say that the IDA are not a great organisation but I believe we may have to look to greater participation if we are to create the jobs we need.</P>
    <P>We have been very lucky in my constituency of Kildare through the encouragement of industries in the county by the IDA.  Major towns have grown at an enormous rate during the past few years.  Newbridge, for example, has grown at an unprecedented rate since about 1960. There is a need to encourage further industry to come there.  In Newbridge 50 per cent of the population are now under the age of 20.  The population is now approximately 9,000 and approximately 4,500 of them are under 20 years of age.</P>
    <P>There are a number of reasons for this.  We had backbone industries for a number of years before the IDA came.  Irish Ropes were established in that town many years ago.  Other industries came into the town and have done very well and given employment. People in other regions have been encouraged to live in the town because there are many industries there.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="50" /> Emigrants who went to England have been encouraged to return home.  It has also encouraged people to get married younger.  The children of those marriages are now part of the under-20 population.  They will be getting married and there will be a further increase in the population.  It is necessary in any region like that to encourage more factories to come in. The IDA, having done a good job in Newbridge and in Kildare, which has contributed to the population explosion, must continue to encourage industries to come into those areas because all those young people are looking for jobs in their own area and their children will also need jobs. If industrial growth is contemplated in a particular area we must continue to attract industry there.  I ask the IDA to continue to look on the town of Newbridge as a growth area.</P>
    <P>There will be a problem for the IDA and the Government in my constituency in regard to the number of people who will inevitably be unemployed as a result of Bord na Móna phasing out their operations.  There is no industry in a large area of Kildare. The towns of Newbridge, Naas, Kildare and Athy have attracted industry but in the Allenwood, Prosperous, Kilmead, Timahoe, Rathangan and Carbury areas there is a large hinterland where people are either employed in Bord na Móna or the power stations.  When Bord na Móna phase out their operations there will be a large work force there without any jobs.  The IDA should develop a regional policy for that area.  Part of Offaly and Laois should be brought into this development.  There will be many people unemployed in that area in the next ten to 15 years if we do not have plans to deal with the matter. The IDA should give special attention to that area.  Large infrastructural development must take place in that area because it has always been a bog area.  The Minister should press the European Community to give special regional aid to the midland area in order to develop water schemes, to make better roads and so forth, because industry will have to be provided in the midland region and in the Allen area of Kildare where the bogs, <Col N="51" /> which are now being used, will be exhausted before long.</P>
    <P>It is very important to attract new industry to County Kildare because of our growing young population.  We have an industrial estate in Naas which gives wonderful employment. There are firms like Donnelly Mirrors and Concrete Pipes and in Kildare we have the Black and Decker firm and a wallpaper firm.  In Athy we also have many industries.  I do not wish to be greedy and say that we want all the industry for Kildare because there are many parts of the country, particularly in the west, without an industry of any type.  It must be realised that if we are successful in designating an area for industrial development we must continue attracting industry as otherwise we will create problems.</P>
    <P>In this Bill we are giving incentives to the individual entrepreneur to commence business, but we must see where we can find those people.  I read an article recently which said that people who start business in Ireland seem either to copy the business their parents were in or, if they were working for another person, to copy his business. We have people who are willing to go into business, but I am not quite certain if they are going into businesses that will create extra jobs.  The Government must, through their various policies and grant aids, encourage entrepreneurs and should not put obstacles in their way.  We will have to depend for many years on foreign industries coming here, showing us the way to do things, our people seeing what they do successfully and then copying them.</P>
    <P>I welcome in the Bill the assistance it is intended to give poor countries. It is important that developments in the Third World should concentrate on showing people how to do things, create wealth and jobs in factories for themselves rather than just give them handouts.  It is better to give a man a spade showing him how to dig a hole in the ground rather than do the job for him.  That is a very simple example.  Moneys devoted to Third World countries should be given with that broad framework in mind.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="52" /> Gorta is doing excellent work in the Third World by sending out experts to assist the people to produce crops and so on.  That is how our programme should be developed.</P>
    <P>There has been some talk of the importance of the west as against Dublin from the point of view of industrial development.  Part of the problem in Dublin stems from the fact that no positive step has ever been taken from the point of view of decentralisation. Dublin has grown at an enormous rate.  Governments have paid lip-service to decentralisation.  Back in the 1930s there was a report on decentralisation. There was another report in 1948. Nothing has been done.  In Dublin now there is need for an enormous number of new jobs for young people.</P>
    <P>We should not be arguing here the merits of having industry in Dublin as against the west, Kildare, Cork and so on.  We should look at the situation in the total context of planning. We should look at the whole State to see if we are actually creating a problem.  If industries were better spread that would encourage people out of the centres of major population into rural areas and that would be good from both the economic and the social point of view.  The problem for the IDA will be whether they should concentrate on encouraging multinational corporations or small home-based industries.  If there could be a compromise with a certain percentage of both that would be a good thing.</P>
    <P>There is a great deal to be said for the small domestic industry.  First of all, a national has probably put all his savings into his business and he is committed to remaining here.  The multinational, on the other hand, can get out without any loss.  In my opinion the small domestic industry is better able to withstand depression and it is less subject to industrial disputes.  In the big industry, employing 2,000 workers, production has to be kept at a certain peak and, if that peak is not being reached, there is a cut-back.  The IDA should have a look at its role to see whether it should concentrate more on the national or the multinational firm.  I hope they will find a suitable compromise.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="53" /> I hope the industrial consortium will provide the necessary impetus to create more jobs.  This is a very wide field and every aspect must be examined. Nothing must be thrown out.  All ideas must be studied.  I wish the IDA continued success in the establishment of industries and the creation of more jobs.  When the next Bill is introduced in four or five years' time we will then be able to say that between 1977 and that date we dealt seriously and successfully with the problem of unemployment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBermingham" hpid="Mr. Bermingham Mr. Bermingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bermingham</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill so far as it goes.  The IDA have done excellent work in my constituency. I suppose we were lucky to get so much industry in towns like Kildare, Newbridge, Athy and Naas.  However, some of the industries suffered in some degree from a lack of management. In Newbridge there was one industry which partially closed and is now partially opened.  This is a big loss to the town.  I was glad recently to hear the Minister state that the IDA are working hard to either replace or renew that industry.  This should help to solve the unemployment in the town.</P>
      <P>The smaller towns in my constituency are isolated and have no means of providing employment.  I speak of places like Castledermot, to a lesser extent Ballitor, Rathangan and other areas.  These small towns are entitled to some recognition.  In Castledermot there is a site available for industry. It has been provided by the local authority. It has been brought to the attention of the IDA and we have made several efforts to get an industry established there.  The IDA seem to pass over it.  One is told the industrialist has the right to say where he will establish his industry.  I can understand that but I think he is often nudged in a certain direction and industries which would suit the areas I have mentioned are not directed into those areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my opinion the Bill does not go far enough.  The IDA, I am proud to say, was set up by my predecessor as Labour representative for Kildare when he was Minister for Industry and Commerce, <Col N="54" /> the late Deputy Norton.  It was opposed by Fianna Fáil but it has proved to be one of the best steps ever taken from the point of view of industrial development.  Having said that, I want to offer what I hope are constructive suggestions as to what should happen in the industrial sphere.</P>
    <P>I do not accept, and it has been proved during the years, that private enterprise will ever solve our unemployment problem.  That cancer can be cured only by us as a society and not by private enterprise.  It has been tolerated by various administrations since the foundation of the State.  Unemployment has not come upon us in the past four years.  I agree it increased during that period but not by the rate some of the Fianna Fáil speakers have told us about.  I am glad that at last they have come to face the problem, that at last they realise there was a world recession in the past four years. They turned a blind eye on the recession during the general election campaign and I am glad that at last they have come to understand the position. During the election campaign anybody listening to them would have thought unemployment was the sole responsibility of the Government.</P>
    <P>We were being told there will be a 6 per cent growth increase in the next year.  That is good, but I am doubtful if it will bring about any increase in employment.  We know that to have full employment by 1986 between 25,000 and 30,000 new jobs must be provided each year.  I do not believe that the present system will achieve that or anything near it.  I do not believe the IDA's efforts to bring in foreign private firms will even help to achieve it, although I congratulate them on their efforts.  Last year they took a 30 per cent share in the reorganisation of a foundry in my town. A German firm took 51 per cent and the local firm held 9 per cent of the shares.  That was a good thing but I would have preferred to have seen the IDA taking 51 per cent of the shares and control being kept in Irish hands.</P>
    <P>It is about time we realised that in our time or in our children's time private enterprise will not solve unemployment. <Col N="55" /> It has not done so in 50 years: it has not even faced up to the problem.  We have had firms making huge profits in six months while branches of the same firms lost money and closed down.  That would not have happened if there had been proper Government involvement and supervision.</P>
    <P>There is massive potential in the meat-processing industry and it is a disgrace to our Governments and to our people that we continue to export cattle on the hoof.  If we are to expand our meat-processing industry and thus create the level of employment we need&mdash;I welcome the part of the Fianna Fáil manifesto which promised to do this&mdash;we must proceed to set up many new processing factories and extend existing ones.  It will be done only by Government participation at all levels.  It will be necessary to give the kind of money to the IDA that will enable them to set up many new industries in all parts of the country. If we do not do this we will be entering a very dangerous period because there is a crisis for our young people who do not accept a situation of gross unemployment.  Not any longer are they satisfied to emigrate.  I warned the Government that our young people will no longer tolerate the conditions on which our society is based.</P>
    <P>We have heard a lot about the &ldquo;swinging sixties&rdquo;.  That was the time when private enterprise was flying but did not produce the level of permanent employment that our people needed. Consequently, at the end of the decade there were fewer people in employment: in 1959 more people were employed than in 1969.  So much for the &ldquo;swinging sixties&rdquo; which produced so much profit for so few and unemployment for many.</P>
    <P>Our population is growing at an alarming rate and if we do not provide employment we will be in a dangerous crisis situation.  As I have said, our young people will no longer tolerate the kind of society we have and we must create the kind of Ireland that our young people will tolerate.</P>
    <P>A consortium is to be set up for job creation and I suggest that agriculture <Col N="56" /> should participate in it in a big way.  Not only should we be processing our meat but our vegetables as well.  This brings me to the Irish Sugar Company.  People employed in State industries will tell you that they cannot be sacked, that they have their wages at the end of the week and that they will do as little as they can.  I do not accept such a situation.  Those who work in and manage the sugar industry have proved they are capable of running an industry against all kinds of competition from private enterprise. In my constituency many people are employed in Bord na Móna and they, too, have proved that they are efficient and are not just waiting to draw their wages at the end of the week.  That is not the attitude of the workers in State companies. Such allegations have been made about the workers in CIE.  This company were asked to take over an outfit which had been broken down by private enterprise.  I would point out that this kind of service is not making money in any part of the world. The ESB was set up shortly after the foundation of the State and by the provision of current they have made industry possible throughout the country. Their workers deserve better than to have it said of them that they do not care about the service they provide and are interested only in collecting their wages.  These State bodies have proved that they are efficient and capable. They have undertaken tasks which were refused by private enterprise and which private enterprise would not be capable of carrying out.  If we are to solve the problem of unemployment we must give to a body such as the IDA the power to set up industries in areas that have been neglected by private enterprise.</P>
    <P>It has been said that State bodies should not be allowed to compete with private enterprise, yet we pour money into inefficient firms who made no preparation for the advent of free trade and who are incapable of getting out of the rut.  Should not public enterprise be allowed to compete with such firms?  I hope that the appointment of the Minister for Economic Planning and Development is an indication that the Government <Col N="57" /> are determined to tackle this problem. If they examine the record of the past 50 years they must admit that private enterprise has not provided adequate job opportunities for our young people.  Today these young people are refusing to emigrate and they want to be provided with work at home.</P>
    <P>Deputy McCreevy said that there is a doubt in the minds of people about the differential in the money received by those who do not work and those who do.  He explained that industries were attracted to this country in earlier times because of our low level of wages.  We are now highly unionised and industrialists will not come here for that reason.  I presume the Deputy meant that we are now well paid. While he said he had no wish to criticise the level of social welfare payments, he did say that the differential was not enough to encourage a man to work.  There are two ways in which the differential can be increased, either by reducing the social welfare payments or by substantially increasing the wages of workers.  There are difficulties involved in either of these solutions.  An increase of 5 per cent is being advocated by the Government and surely the unfortunate people in receipt of social welfare payments must be compensated for increases in the cost of living.  The Deputy's argument does not stand up.  I do not believe that people deliberately stay at home in order to benefit from social welfare and do a few nixers.  A man wants to work if work is available.  If we offer people gainful employment they will have to work.  We have not yet been able to face people with that kind of choice&mdash;either work in the job we can provide or do not receive social welfare benefits.  The extent to which people can manipulate the system to benefit from both social welfare payments and nixers is grossly exaggerated.  It is represented as a widespread practice, but in fact it is very limited indeed and there are not many men and women who would want such insecurity if full-time jobs were available.</P>
    <P>There are quite a number of unions operating here and I do not think it makes any difference to the progress <Col N="58" /> of industry which union workers choose to join.  There is a feeling in certain trade union circles that bargains are made with foreign firms about which will be the exclusive union in an industry and that representatives of certain unions accompany the IDA in discussions with these firms before they set up operations here.  I hope this is not true, but there is a feeling abroad that it is so.  If trade unionism means anything it means the right of the worker in a specific industry to choose the kind of union to which he wishes to belong.  This right should not be taken away during private negotiations before a firm arrives in this country.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that State companies have been successful.  We Irish are good knockers when we say State employment is no good.  An employee of the Forestry Division told me that they should invest in the timber trade, and I agree with him.  There is a factory in my town which manufactures wallboard and its raw material is supplied by the Forestry Division.  As well as supplying timber to this factory, the Forestry Division should be involved in the processing of the timber.</P>
    <P>I am not criticising good private enterprise but there are many businesses in which the State could become involved.  It has been proved that private enterprise has failed to provide job opportunities.  The IDA or some other State agency should be allowed to set up industries in needy areas. Before the IDA look for foreign manufacturers to set up businesses here they investigate the market and will not encourage an industry that will not do well.  When they fail to attract the right type of industry they should be given the authority to establish such an industry.</P>
    <P>In the sixties we increased production without increasing employment. The number of people employed at the end of the &ldquo;Swinging Sixties&rdquo; was the same as at the beginning of that decade.  While the improvement in production during the sixties was good for the country, it was not the answer to the problem.  We need labour-intensive industry.  Without such industry we cannot survive as a democracy.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="59" /> In one town in my constituency 50 per cent of the people are under 20 years of age, and this is true of many other towns throughout the country. The time has come for us to realise that we have had an unemployment problem for 50 years.  Unemployment has been tolerated here, but it would not be tolerated in other societies.  For a long time emigration was a safety valve, but that will not happen again. If we do not reduce the level of unemployment within a short time we will have only ourselves to blame.  The young people will not tolerate our society if they are not given the chance to earn a living for themselves.  That is all they want and they should be given that chance.  We talk about crimes of violence and so on, but have we ever offered these people an opportunity of becoming involved in society? I have had the experience of being unemployed and know how demoralising a dole queue can be.</P>
    <P>We are facing the most critical time in our history.  We have reached the limit of the people's patience.  If private enterprise cannot provide employment, the Government should make an effort to do so through the IDA or some other State agency.  I welcome the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="VincentBrady" hpid="Mr. V. Brady Mr. V. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. V. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, welcome the Bill.  I congratulate the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary on their appointments and for the manner in which they have given priority to job creation because unemployment is a serious problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to pay tribute to the IDA for their achievements. The main purpose of the Bill is to enhance their efforts to increase job opportunities through industrial development.  Foreign investment has been important to us for many years but never more so than it is today. Apart from the beneficial effects of industrial development on the economy, the main benefit will be the creation of employment.  The Government have already set in motion a number of measures to create jobs and meet their jobs target.  It pleases me to hear the Minister express confidence that this job target programme <Col N="60" /> will be a success.  One of the measures consists of the establishing of an action team on youth unemployment.  In this regard I was disappointed to hear the principle spokesman of the Opposition dismissing completely the team set up to create jobs for our youth. They did not give the team a chance to prove their worth.  All Members should wish the action team well.  We must be patient because the task they have been given is extremely difficult. Its success or otherwise will have far-reaching consequences for our community, and, in particular, for the young people seeking employment. Those people should be given priority.</P>
    <P>The Government's emphasis is on providing jobs for young people, to give them a start in life, an opportunity to work and find a secure future for themselves in their own country. Parents of teenagers who have been seeking work here without success will tell anybody that the situation the children find themselves in is the most shattering in any normal life.  There is disappointment when they do not receive replies to their letters in answers to advertisements in the newspapers, disappointment at the interviews that come to nought and the training courses that have nothing to offer at the end of the line.  Those experiences make young people feel bitter with the Government and society. The Government will not let our young people down.  They cannot afford to do so because the terrible unemployment sore we have today was allowed to fester for too long.  It is gratifying to hear Opposition speakers talking about the seriousness of this problem because I did not hear too much about the problem in the last four years. I do not recall any great effort being made to solve it.</P>
    <P>A factor that must cause great concern to all is the exceptionally high rate of the not-so-young, those in their forties and fifties, who are made redundant. In many cases that happens after the person concerned has given years of faithful service and loyalty to the one firm.  In such cases those involved have little or no experience of alternative work.  Retraining for other suitable and alternative work should be <Col N="61" /> provided urgently but such retraining will be useless if there is no job prospects available after the period of retraining is concluded.  It must be recognised that as far as jobs are concerned emergency measures must be taken to create employment.  A lot can be done in the building and construction trade, many roads are in need of improvement, housing is in a serious position and there is also a great shortage of hospitals and homes for the care of the aged and infirm.</P>
    <P>To achieve a satisfactory level of re-employment quickly we must all share the load in some way.  Employers and those in secure employment should be willing to give a little and be satisfied with less themselves. That would help in some way to alleviate in some way the severe problem of unemployment.  Some speakers mentioned the man who holds down two jobs, the husband and wife who are both employed and in many cases bring home between £9,000 and £10,000 per annum.  That is not fair. I have nothing at all against married women working but we must face the fact that we have a serious problem. It is not fair to have almost £10,000 going into one home where there are no children while the man with five or six children does not have a job or any prospect of one.</P>
    <P>The Government should make it clear that unless this problem is resolved nobody will escape the scars in the future.  It should be accepted as a national challenge and a full commitment by everybody is necessary.  In creating jobs we must also concern ourselves with the type of jobs we offer.  They must be meaningful for the individual.  It is not good enough to push a person into any type of job, into one that would be unsuitable and soul destroying.  Work is one of man's most important means of self-fulfilment and it must give him dignity. Above all he must retain his self respect.</P>
    <P>Since the IDA were set up they have done an excellent job in bringing international investment and helping industry.  It is good to note the commitment on the part of the Minister and the Government to increase the <Col N="62" /> resources available to promote local Irish enterprise.  It is often claimed, rightly or wrongly, that it is virtually impossible for a native to obtain assistance by way of finance from the IDA or any other Government-sponsored body.  We have all come across this type of grievance.  I am not in a position to say if the claim is valid or not but I expect that Irish men and women with initiative and enterprise who are prepared to invest at home obtain every help and consideration.</P>
    <P>It is now recognised that Dublin must receive special consideration and urgent attention as far as the siting of new industry is concerned.  The population explosion in the city has created many problems in job availability, and the closure of a large number of old-established industries has worsened the position.  During the last four years it is accepted that approximately 28,000 jobs were lost in the Dublin area alone.  According to the latest statistics released by the IDA it is the only region where job losses far exceeded gains.  In my constituency, Dublin North Central, the unemployment rate is higher than the national average.  We all know that there are many serious problems, social and otherwise, in the inner city areas.  Unemployment and the absence of job opportunities is a major contributory factor.  Quite a number of old factory buildings and sites in my constituency have been idle for some time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The figures for 1976 are slightly complicated because the public service would not have been fully included in the PAYE figures.  They are not strictly comparable.  But it is true, I think, that the PAYE contributors are paying a bigger share than are others.  But the share may not be quite so much out of line perhaps as is generally thought.  As I have indicated in those figures, which are for the first nine months of 1977, the proportion of PAYE tax received was 86.3 per cent.  For 1976 the proportion of national income available to people in receipt of wages, salaries and pensions was nearly 70 per cent so while it is out of line it may not be as much out of line as people think.</P>

    <P>(i)  Each amount in column (a) is the amount collected in the relevant period, irrespective of the valuation date to which the tax was referable.  For example, the amount collected in 1976 includes a substantial portion of the tax referable to the valuation date 5th April, 1975.  The figure of £5,555,730 for the first ten months of 1977 is provisional, the final figure not being yet available.  The 1977 budget estimate of receipts from wealth tax for 1977 is £6,500,000.</P>
    <P>(ii)  The figures in column (b) are the most up-to-date estimates of the number of persons who made payments referable to the valuation dates 5th April, 1975, 5th April, 1976 and 5th April, 1977, irrespective of the financial period in which the payments were made. Wealth taxpayers comprise three categories of assessable persons, namely, individuals, discretionary trusts and private non-trading companies.</P>
    <P>(iii)  It would not be feasible to list each payment.  The figure in column (c) is obtained by dividing the sum of the three amounts in column (a) by the sum of the 3 figures in column (b). This method of arriving at the average takes into consideration the factors referred to in notes (i) and (ii).</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that the last such income tax review committee was set up in 1957?  Whilst I accept what the Minister states, that it is intended to provide tax relief, would he not agree that there is a need to review the whole question of income tax, PAYE, and perhaps such a committee could come forward with proper recommendations on this whole question of the restructuring of income tax?  Merely tackling the position with piecemeal arrangements is not the answer.  Perhaps a proper review committee, as was set up in 1957 would be the answer.  Would he consider that?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he will consider alterations in the law or in customs practices to avoid annoyance to tourists and potential damage to the tourist industry occasioned by customs officers requiring foreign tourists on entering the country to pay substantial cash sums as a condition of temporarily importing their own sports equipment for use during their vacation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Foreign tourists may import their personal effects, including sports equipment, temporarily without payment of customs charges.  Occasionally visitors may be required to deposit a sum of money with the customs as a security for the duty on valuable articles.  The deposit is refunded to the visitor when the articles are being re-exported.</P>
      <P>This practice which is of long standing has rarely given rise to complaint and no change is contemplated at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have two questions to put to the Minister.  The first one is this: is he aware that tourists coming from, say, the United States to play golf in Ireland while on holiday and bringing their golf equipment with them may, at 7 o'clock in the morning at Shannon Airport be asked to fork out £50 without any previous notice <Col N="71" /> or warning being given?  Would the Minister indicate what are the occasions when the occasional tourist is called upon to pay that charge?  I suspect the Minister would agree with me that it is not unreasonable that a tourist in such circumstances would feel irritated and exasperated, after a long journey, to be asked to fork out money as a deposit.  Is any previous warning given to people that if they come to Ireland they will be required to pay it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure if it is possible to give a previous warning to a visitor who may decide to come at very short notice.  But I am sure the Deputy is aware, from his experience, that this does not happen on a very wide scale.  I accept that it could be irritating for people but the reason is a good one.  There are cases, for instance, where people bring in golf clubs that are totally unused and it is possible for such people to make a handsome profit in disposing of the clubs without paying any duty.  Normally it is only in cases where there are grounds for suspecting that the articles are unused or may be intended for sale here that the demand is made for a deposit.  In justification of that I would mention that in the year ended 30th September 1977, there were 14 cases where the equipment involved was golf clubs and a deposit was sought but in only one of those cases was there a call for the deposit to be refunded.  In other words, the clubs were disposed of in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to assure the Minister that the case brought to my notice was not one where golf clubs were disposed of in the country. May I suggest to the Minister that the Revenue Commissioners might consider operating a system such as that operated by the United States authorities where a visitor is asked to complete a form while he is on the plane. This is surrendered to the customs authorities on arrival and before leaving the country the person has to produce the duplicate to indicate what goods above a certain value were brought into the <Col N="72" /> country.  I suggest this would avoid the annoyance that has been caused to tourists coming here.  Has the Minister any reaction to that suggestion?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall have the suggestion examined but I am not sure it will overcome the difficulty.  A tourist might fill in the form and hand it up to the authorities but if the goods appeared to be unused he might still be asked to pay a deposit.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="73" /> I am satisfied that the Central Bank's powers of licensing and regulating banks are generally adequate.  Experience since the enactment of the 1971 Act, however, has highlighted the desirability of strengthening these powers, particularly in relation to the protection of depositors.  As I previously indicated to the House, proposals for this purpose are being examined in my Department with a view to introducing amending legislation.</P>
    <P>The Central Bank has specific powers under section 23 of the Central Bank Act, 1971, to require banks to maintain prescribed ratios between assets and liabilities.  While it has not found it necessary to formally invoke these powers it has imposed liquidity ratios on all banks for monetary policy purposes.  In addition, it has set out licensing and supervisory criteria which contain a number of other ratios of a prudential nature to which banks are expected to adhere.  These criteria were last revised and published in the Bank's <i>Annual Report for 1975</i> and I am arranging for copies to be placed in the Dáil Library.  They can be made the subject of a condition attached to a licence under section 10 of the Act where this is considered necessary or desirable in the case of any bank or banks.  All ratios are supervised by the examination of regular returns from banks and by bank inspections.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance the total amounts paid out of public funds by State agencies by way of grants and loans to Castleguard Textiles Ltd., Ardee, County Louth and its parent company Seafield Gentex Ltd.; and the measures that have been taken to safeguard public money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The payment of grants to industrial companies is a matter for which the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy is responsible.  As regards loans to these companies out of public funds by State agencies, amounts totalling £1.215 million have been given to Seafield Gentex Ltd., of which £450,000 was intended to be devoted to Castleguard Textiles Ltd. In addition, £100,000 has been loaned direct to the Castleguard company. All these loans were provided on concessionary terms.  As regards security <Col N="76" /> for these loans, the position is that loans totalling £450,000 to Seafield and the £100,000 loan to Castleguard were subject to negative pledges by the companies concerned that further borrowing from other sources would not be incurred without the approval of the lenders.  The remaining £765,000 was issued by way of short-term bills of exchange pending the submission by Seafield of proposals for restructuring the group and its management.  The first measure in this respect has already been taken by the appointment of a new managing director.  Furthermore the lending company propose to exercise their right to representation on the board of Seafield.</P>
      <P>In addition, over the years a number of loans have been provided for these companies on purely commercial terms, some of which have since been repaid.  The Deputy will appreciate that it would not be proper for me to disclose details of commercial transactions between a State agency and individual borrowers.</P>

      <P>In view of the positively whimsical way in which people take money and when it suits them get out&mdash;and the public interest does not appear to have any great control over what they do&mdash;would the Minister not agree that in future he should ask the IDA or the other authorities responsible to take some kind of equity share and appoint their own directors on companies of this kind to try to protect not only the finance involved but also the interests of the workers <Col N="77" /> who will be greatly inconvenienced if this place closes?</P>

The total amount of loans given to Seafield on concessionary terms amounted to £1.215 million and in addition £100,000 was loaned on concessionary terms to Castleguard.

      <P>It depends on whether you are increasing the £5 or the £50. The figure of £5 was there for a very long time, and I was responsible for increasing it to £50.  The Deputy will appreciate that it is not really intended as a measure of compensation. It is a gesture.</P>

      <P>The only information available regarding the distribution of personal incomes of individuals is that which has been collected in the course of the administration of the income tax code.  The latest income distribution statistics published by the Revenue Commissioners relate to the year of assessment 1974-75 and are contained in pages 151 to 156 of their annual report for the year ended 31 December, 1975, copies of which are available in the Library.</P>
      <P>The limitations of these statistics, which are set out in detail in pages 149 and 150 of the annual report, are that income which is not liable for tax is excluded, married couples generally are counted as one unit and employees whose income is not high enough to bring them within the ambit of PAYE are excluded.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LukeBelton" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he is aware that the present hours during which the Income Tax Office, Dublin is open to the public are inconvenient, particularly for the ordinary worker; the steps he proposes to take to redress this situation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Income tax offices are normally open to personal callers continuously from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. on Monday to Friday inclusive.  I understand from the Revenue Commissioners that this arrangement has operated for many years and appears to have been generally satisfactory.</P>
      <P>In the circumstances it is not intended at present to alter the existing arrangements.  If, however, the need for some change becomes evident I would propose to have the matter further examined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LukeBelton" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that from time to time many workers who may not live adjacent to the tax office have been asked to call into the office and they find that it is closed when they cease working and it is also closed at the week-end when they are free to go in?  Does he not feel that there should be some time provided to facilitate those workers who live or work some distance away from the office?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I have information of three experiments that were made in this regard.  The first one was during the introduction of PAYE in 1960 when tax offices throughout the country remained open to the public from 5.30 p.m. to 9 p.m. on Monday to Friday inclusive.  This service was discontinued <Col N="85" /> as soon as the demand abated.  Then, some years later, there were certain arrangements made to provide a service in Liberty Hall on a Saturday morning but the response was very poor.  In 1974 arrangements were made, following representations from trade unions, to have one Dublin PAYE office in O'Connell Street open to the public from 6.30 p.m. to 8.30 p.m. on three consecutive Tuesday nights but the response was very poor and it was discontinued.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LukeBelton" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>While agreeing with the Minister that this may be so would he not consider allowing the office in O'Connell Street to remain open even one evening in the week after normal working hours or, alternatively, open it for an hour or two hours on a Saturday morning?  The people who complained to me were at Dublin Airport. While it is true in some cases that the employer will allow those people off, would the Minister agree that it is not proper that the onus should be on the employer to allow the employees off?  Does he not also agree that this may cause some friction between the workers and the staff if they are asking to get off at awkward hours?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be inclined to agree with the Deputy in theory and to feel that there might be a much bigger demand for this than there appears to be.  I would also point out to him that from the point of view of the Revenue Commissioners it is not as straightforward as it looks because they would have to provide staff who are versed in various technicalities of income tax.  It is not just a question of detailing a few people to serve extra hours.  It is a bit more complicated than that.  I would be quite prepared to contemplate dealing with the difficulties involved if I was satisfied that the demand was there.  I have indicated to the Deputy that the evidence so far suggests that the demand is not there.  If evidence becomes available of an increase in demand I would certainly review the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LukeBelton" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister will agree that the very fact that the office <Col N="86" /> remains open during working hours is an indication that it is there to facilitate workers? I am sure he will also agree that there are many workers who may not be able to get to the office during the lunchtime break. This would necessitate opening for an hour after normal office hours.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have indicated if we get any evidence of any worthwhile demand for this service I will certainly consider providing it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that previous experiments, laudable as they were, failed largely because people did not know about them.  There is no point introducing innovations unless they are widely advertised.  Would the Minister not agree, as Minister for Finance and the Public Service, that there is something very ironic about a public service administration which is closed during times when people are available to use it, and that there is need for a look at this again?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the first part of the Deputy's supplementary I must say that the thought he put forward occurred to me and I intended to examine it.  With regard to the second part of the supplementary I do not agree that there is anything ironic involved in the absence of evidence of demand for this service from the public.  As I said before if there is evidence of such a demand I will certainly reconsider it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if it is proposed to continue in the future the practice of assessing a rateable valuation on new houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The practice of valuing houses by the Valuation Office on an individual basis is at present under active review in the light of the Government's commitment to abolish domestic rates with effect from 1st January next.  I am not in a position at this stage to give a definitive answer to the question but it would seem that satisfactory arrangements for periodic reviews of the total of house valuations in each rating authority area will be necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it from the Minister's reply that no decision has been made in this regard.  Has the Minister considered the problems that will arise after the 1st January in relation to any new houses from the point of view of the valuation differentials which are there for grant purposes and valuation differentials which are there in relation to Circuit Court and District Court jurisdictions and fee payable in the Land Registry?  What will be the position in regard to this after 1st January next?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>As I indicated, these questions are being considered and I cannot give a definitive answer at the moment.  As I said, it would seem that satisfactory arrangements for periodical reviews of the total of house valuations in each rating authority area will be necessary.  In other words, a system will be evolved which will enable any particular house to be classified as being of a certain valuation although the method of arriving at the valuation or dealing with it may be different from the present one.</P>

      <P>May I take it that the categoric statement of the Minister's colleague, the Minister for Economic Planning and Development, yesterday that there would be a <Col N="88" /> register of houses is at variance with the Minister's view on the situation?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he considers it equitable that a person (name supplied) in Dublin should be liable for financial penalties arising out of assets held by his wife, without his knowledge and from which he derives no benefit; and the action the Revenue Commissioners propose to take in the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="89" />
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand from the Revenue Commissioners that the tax affairs of the person concerned are at present under investigation with a view to ascertaining whether there has been understatement of income for past years with consequential underpayment of tax.  Until the investigation is completed it is not possible to say whether, and to what extent, there has been an undercharge to tax.  The inspector's inquiries to date suggest to him that there has been understatement of income and he proposes to raise estimated assessments.  The tax-payer is, of course, entitled to appeal to the appeal commissioner against the assessments and, if he is not satisfied with the appeal commissioner's decision, he may ask for a rehearing of his appeal by the Circuit Court judge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask if the principle underlying the case is supported by the Government?  Is it the case that income accruing to a wife without the knowledge of the husband may, in fact, cause the husband to be liable for penalties?  What obligation is there on the husband to know what his wife possesses?  This particular constituent indicated to me that many men did not know the ages of their wives, not to mind what money they might have inherited or income they might have privately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I doubt if the Deputy would suggest that where a husband claims not to know his wife has an income there should, therefore, be immunity from the payment of tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>By him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Or that he should be free from penalty for failure to return such income.  The law provides that the wife's income will be regarded as part of the husband's unless&mdash;this is open to either the husband or the wife&mdash; other the husband or the wife notify the Revenue Commissioners they want to be treated separately.  In the case to which the Deputy refers, this was done in one year but not in other years.  In the one year in which it was done there was no problem.  The Deputy will understand that, if we did not have a <Col N="90" /> provision of this kind, there would be widespread opportunity for evasion. On the other hand, I am satisfied, and I hope the Deputy would be, that in any case in which it is clearly established that the husband was totally unaware his wife had an income the Revenue Commissioners would deal with that sympathetically, but they cannot allow this to be operated as a vehicle for widespread evasion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept what the Minister says, but would he not agree it would be improper&mdash;indeed, morally wrong&mdash;that a man should be penalised by virtue of genuine ignorance and how is a person to prove this except by his honest statement of fact? Would the Minister also accept that the obvious attempt in the individual case in one year to have the tax separately assessed was an indication of the integrity of the individuals? Obviously they did not follow it up because they presumed that would be the case in subsequent years.</P>

In addition, in the period 1973 to 1976 Fóir Teoranta have provided loans to the company. Further applications for loan assistance in late 1976 and early 1977 had to be refused as the company no longer appeared to have prospects of viability for the future.  In August, 1977, the directors of the company asked Fóir Teoranta to appoint a receiver, and this receiver, with the active co-operation of the IDA, has since been endeavouring to attract a replacement industry into the factory with the object of safeguarding the employment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. O'Kennedy) Michael O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. O'Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to authorise a voluntary contribution of £5,819,705 by the Irish Government to the Fifth Replenishment of the Resources of the International Development Association (IDA).</P>
      <P>The IDA was formed in 1960 as a subsidiary body of the World Bank to provide loans on concessionary terms to the poorest of the developing countries. These terms are interest-free loans for periods of up to 50 years, the only charge being a minimal one to cover administrative expenses.  The association's basic objective is to help raise standards of living in developing countries by channelling resources from the developed world.  Its lending is concentrated on those countries with an annual <i>per capita</i> gross national product of less than £300.</P>
      <P>Day-to-day management of the association is carried out by its secretariat under its president, Robert McNamara, reporting to a board of 20 executive directors elected by its 117 member countries.  Policy matters are decided by the board of governors, consisting of one governor from each member.</P>
      <P>For purposes of financing, the IDA is divided into 21 Part I or donor countries and 96 Part II, mainly developing countries.  Part I countries, which are the industrialised countries, contribute most of the finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The association replenishes its resources at three-yearly intervals, when donor countries agree on the overall amount which is to be provided to IDA over the following three years. There have been four such replenishments to date, the last one providing the association with almost $4.2 billion for the period 1st July, 1974 to 30th June, 1977.  Total resources provided by replenishments to date amount to nearly $11 billion of which over 96 per cent has been provided by Part I countries.  Ireland joined the association on its formation in 1960 as a <Col N="112" /> Part II member and subscribed £1.15 million to the initial capital.  While we did not participate in the first and second replenishments, we did, as a Part II country, agree to make a special contribution of £2½ million to the third replenishment in 1970. Taking account of substantial economic progress made by the country since 1960, and of the fact that Ireland was the only EEC country to have Part II status, Ireland became a Part I member in 1973.  We subsequently contributed £3.1 million to the fourth replenishment.</P>
    <P>After more than a year of discussions, representatives of 26 donor countries agreed in March, 1977, to increase IDA's resources in a Fifth Replenishment of its funds.  In addition to the 21 Part I countries, five Part II countries are making special contributions.  These are the Republic of Korea, Saudi Arabia, Spain, United Arab Emirates and Yugoslavia.  The arrangements are, of course, subject to legislative approval.  The replenishment provides for total commitments of $7,638 million for the three-year period beginning 1st July, 1977.  This represents a nominal increase of 84 per cent over the level provided in the fourth replenishment and is a measure of the commitment of the developed countries to meeting the needs of the poorest developing countries for external assistance on concessionary terms.</P>
    <P>Of the total replenishment of $7,638 million it was agreed that traditional donors would aim at providing $7,200 million.  This meant for these countries an increase of 60 per cent over what they had provided in the fourth replenishment.  For countries whose currencies had devalued against the dollar the increase involved would have been much greater, in Ireland's case a contribution of £7.1 million, representing an increase of 130 per cent.  This was obviously unfair and a final figure of $10 million (£5.8 million) was arrived at after bilateral negotiations.</P>
    <P>I should point out that this does not involve actual payment of this amount over the next three years.  It means that the IDA will receive commitments <Col N="113" /> from Ireland, in the form of non-interest bearing demand notes in that amount, thus permitting the association to make commitments in turn to its borrowing members.  In practice, the £5.8 million will be drawn down over a period of six to nine years, the time-scale depending on the progress of the various projects being financed by the funds and the rate of inflation in the meantime.</P>
    <P>On June 16th of this year, the Board of Governors adopted the resolution authorising the association to accept the increased contributions previously negotiated.  These contributions will become due 30 days after not less than 12 Part I countries with commitments amounting to 80 per cent of the total replenishment have given formal notification that they intend to take up their allotted contribution.  The present position is that 13 Part I countries representing 44 per cent of total commitments have done so.  United States notification is likely to be given shortly.  The Fifth Replenishment will then require notification from just one other major country to become effective.</P>
    <P>This Bill, if enacted, will enable Ireland to participate in the continuing work of the IDA to provide essential resources on highly concessionary terms to those countries who cannot afford to accept loans on the more commercial terms offered by the World Bank.  The association has a proven record in the disbursement of concessional finance on a global scale.  As I have indicated earlier, IDA lending is aimed at helping the poorest developing countries and is a major source of external finance for these countries.  In recent years the IDA management have taken this process a stage further by concentrating to an increasing extent on projects which directly affect the living standards of the poorest sections in those countries.  We support this approach.  The concrete evidence for our support is the fact that the Irish contribution to IDA takes up well over 10 per cent of our total annual spending on official development assistance.  The proposed contribution of nearly £6 million to the association will maintain this level.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="114" /> I recommend the Bill to the House for adoption.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It gives me much pleasure to welcome this Bill.  Last March, as Minister for Finance and Governor for Ireland of the International Development Association, I entered into a commitment on Ireland's behalf to provide this money, so the Minister need not anticipate any opposition to the implementation of our undertaking from this side of the House.</P>
      <P>I might be forgiven for expressing my personal satisfaction at having been the first Irish person elected to hold the chair of the board of the International Development Association which is associated with the World Bank.  IDA is the terminology used in World Bank and IMF circles and it is important that we should use it to distinguish it from our own Industrial Development Authority.</P>
      <P>As far back as September, 1973, at the annual meeting of IDA, I committed Ireland for the first time to accept on a continuing basis an obligation to contribute towards the poorer countries of the world.  At that time I declared our readiness to transfer from Part II membership, which imposed no obligations, to Part I membership, which imposed an obligation to provide the moneys which the members of Part I would decide in future to pay to poorer countries.  It was the first time for us to enter into that unavoidable commitment to provide for the needy people of the impoverished world and I believe we were right to do it.  If we had not done it in the comparative ease of 1973, many people would have argued that, during the difficult years of the recession, we should have held back from making an adequate contribution to the Third World.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For reasons which are not only altruistic but humanitarian, it is in Ireland's interest to contribute even greater sums than we have already committed to the Third World.  One of the reasons which led us to make this commitment in 1973 was the good fortune which we had to become a member of the EEC, from which membership <Col N="115" /> we have enjoyed advantages year in and year out.  As we had been favoured with membership of the EEC, we felt it only right that we should share to some extent the increased opulence which that membership would give us.</P>
    <P>The abject poverty and inhuman degradation in which more than two billion people are condemned to live is almost beyond our comprehension.  We who are fortunate to live among the 700 million people who are comparatively better off may have had difficulty at one time in understanding the depth of human misery and degradation, but modern means of communication have made us all aware of the immense suffering in most of the world.  For more than two billion people, existence is no more than a living death.  Malnutrition, disease and ignorance makes their poverty self-perpetuating.</P>
    <P>The average income of these two billion people, who have between £1 and £2 per week to live on, has increased by no more than 2p per week since 1960.  In the intervening period those of us in the developing world have enjoyed a greater increase in our <i>per capita</i> income than in any equivalent period in the previous history of mankind&mdash;and I mean real increases, not nominal ones.  During that period the wretched people in the developing world have had an average increase of 2p per week, which recalls the price of some crusts which were fed to the birds in a famous musical comedy.  That is the real value of the increase in the incomes of people in the developing world whom this Bill is intended to benefit.  Obviously, no person with the least morsel of human pity could but welcome this Bill and express the hope that we will do better in future.</P>
    <P>With such a pitiful increase in the incomes of these unfortunate people over the last 15 years, it will be seen that their housing, nutrition and health standards have not stood still; they have deteriorated.  They have sunk even lower into the mire of poverty, misery, pain and suffering.  The gap between the rich and the poor is expanding, not narrowing, despite the <Col N="116" /> substantial increases which have been given by Ireland and other countries in the developing world.</P>
    <P>The gap between those who have and those who do not have is greater than it ever was before.  The development needs of the poorest are staggering if no more than minimum needs are to be attended to.  The reality is that all that IDA, the World Bank, UNCTAD, EEC, the Lomé Convention and other agencies are providing is not sufficient to prevent the poorest of the poor in this world sinking lower than the critical state into which they were born.</P>
    <P>I have been dwelling on what I hope would be the humanitarian aspect which would touch even the hardest of hearts, but there is another way we ought to look upon the advisability of giving development aid.  Acceptance of the interdependence of trading nations is a basic principle of a stable international economic order.  The nature of goods that are traded between the better-off world and the developing poorer countries accentuates the interdependence.  The developed world can produce food and products in excess of its own capacity to consume.  It is in the interests of the developed world that the poorer developing world would have a greater capacity to absorb their surplus products. The developed world cannot maintain its own living standards&mdash;it certainly cannot improve them&mdash;and provide a better standard of living for its own peoples including its own poor, except by importing raw materials from the developing world, processing them and, in turn, consuming them or selling them back to the original producers of the raw material.</P>
    <P>Selfishness may lead some people to ignore the Third World or to regard the billions of impoverished people in the world as an awkward liability. However, such a view is not merely selfish, but callous and stupid.  The purpose of improving the international economic order which has been agreed at the UN and elsewhere is not merely the altruistic one of relieving human suffering but is motivated by an understanding that an increase in the capacity <Col N="117" /> of the poorer countries to absorb and consume would help the better off as well as the poorer countries.  It would increase the productive and the consuming capacity of all countries, developed and undeveloped.</P>
    <P>I should like to take this opportunity of referring to a few matters which I believe should be aired.  One of them was referred to this morning during the debate on the Industrial Development Authority legislation.  A number of State agencies and State companies lack the legal and statutory power to be involved in work abroad and quite a number have rightly assumed that the Legislature would not challenge their activities abroad.  In most cases even if the power is not given in the memorandum and articles of association or in the statute a prohibition does not exist either, but there are some cases where the limitations are quite clear.  A number of agencies have rather limited horizons and ambitions. I understand that some have quoted their legal inability to be involved.  One does not want to accuse them of doing that with any relish, but it has happened. I urge upon the Minister and his colleagues to take all steps speedily to ensure that every State agency which can give assistance abroad will give it.  There are two reasons for this: the humanitarian obligation that lies on us all to help the poorest of the poor and, secondly, because immense benefit can flow to us out of involvement in activities abroad.</P>
    <P>With the best will in the world and the most perfect economic plan or the most wonderful national psychology we are not going to be able to absorb in jobs here all the people who will be seeking jobs over the next ten years.  There is nothing shameful in that.  Indeed, it is highly desirable to involve our people in working for Irish agencies and Irish firms in other lands.  By making some of our skilled people available for work in other lands through these State agencies we will be creating vacancies here for other people who otherwise would be idle.  It would be wonderful if the export of Irish skills in future was to take place under Irish supervision and control with profit returning to Ireland rather than that it should resume the form it took for two <Col N="118" /> centuries when our people with their skills went abroad to work for others and never returned.</P>
    <P>Can the Minister tell me the current rate of interest charged by IDA on loans?  At one time it was three-quarters of 1 per cent which was merely sufficient to cover the handling charges.  In itself that amounted to a very real subsidy for poorer countries. I know that IDA have no wish to make profits and do not make profit on the money made available.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1960 when IDA was established the figure which determined a country's eligibility for assistance was an annual income of 300 dollars <i>per capita.</i>  That figure has risen, but I suggest it has not risen to as high a figure as it should be to compensate for world inflation over the last 17 years.  Although there is an immense amount of good will towards the developing world, the developed world has not altered its aid to compensate for inflation which has taken place in the meantime nor has the developed world adjusted itself to take account of the massive increase in the population of the poorer countries of the world over the last 15 years.  It will be appalling if once again the world has to suffer, as a means of curing the problem of over-population, a world holocaust.  That is not the final cure.  The cure is to have a better distribution of the wealth of this world, a distribution which is necessary if we are to have regard to our human obligations.  It is also highly desirable if we want to improve the standard of living not merely of the poor but of ourselves also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Human instinct would incline any person with a morsel of pity to help a fellow man, woman or child seen to be suffering.  Very few people would dream of passing in the streets a person who is obviously suffering seriously from hunger, cold or malnutrition. Unless we give sufficient aid to the developing world we will, in fact, individually and collectively be passing in the street the beggars who are necessarily <Col N="119" /> holding out their hands to us for assistance.  The poorer countries of the world should not have to beg.  They have the same right to have their human dignity respected as we have; and we have an obligation because of the means we have to share what we have with them so that others can enjoy the self-respect and the opportunity to improve their lot which is the good fortune of those of us living in better off countries.  There are severely deprived people struggling to survive in squalid and degrading circumstances.</P>
    <P>Absolute poverty today is a consequence not as it might have been at one time of ignorance but rather of neglect.  Today we cannot plead ignorance. We know there is suffering; we have a clear obligation to relieve it. That is what this Bill is doing and I thank the Minister for its introduction.</P>

      <P>Perhaps it is the impression the Minister has been creating &mdash;he looks like the real professional&mdash; of having been even a greater period in office.  That was by way of saying perhaps that the Minister will, in replying, be in a position to indicate some answers to some of the questions I asked some time ago about the Council for Development, the whole question of how he sees the role of aid, and the co-ordination of the delivery of either Irish skills, money, charity from Trocaire or whatever through the Minister's agencies and the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="120" /> This Bill would be a part of that.  I would follow what Deputy R. Ryan said with regard to our obligation to recognise the reality of global poverty. Unfortunately, appeals to the generosity of mankind do not have a very good track record.  We do not have to go very far outside the country, or this building, to see levels of poverty totally unacceptable today.  A figure of 25 per cent has been used.  Appeals to common humanity or to the morsel of pity to which Deputy Ryan referred have not been successful, with people begging on the streets, not of Marrakesh or Dar es Salaam but on the streets of Dublin who are passed by every day.  Therefore, simply calling on that sentiment alone unfortunately will not have the effect that Deputy Ryan believes it could or should have.</P>
    <P>I should like to point out two things which make it obligatory, in our self-interests as well-fed and wealthy people, that this aid be given and why indeed we should increase it.  There is first the moral one, which is self evident and which nobody would dispute. Secondly there is the point of global instability.  It amazes me that it has not intensified already.  But certainly it will by the end of this century if the growth rates for population and urbanisation continue the way they are.  There are certain small groups of disaffected people who feel they have been totally excluded from any share of the world's wealth, or indeed from any prospect of participating in it. Much of it belongs to them in the first place.  It is not that they are poor; it is just that they do not control their own resources.</P>
    <P>If the current economic system in the Third World, as originally structured by western imperialism, is not changed radically, then groups like the PLO, or people modelling themselves on the PLO, can hold up our entire developed world to total ransom as a result of modern communications and technology.  The real risk to stability of what we would regard as the developing world is that the technology is now existent for very small groups of people to potentially hold to ransom vast sections of our society.  Lest there be any public resistance&mdash;I think we <Col N="121" /> have a consensus within the House among working politicians and particularly among people who have some knowledge either at first hand or from study of the extent of the problem on which Deputy Ryan has given figures&mdash;we have a leadership obligation to explain to our people, to those who perhaps might doubt the necessity for it, that if they do not accept the moral obligation there is one underneath the counter which has far greater force and strength, that is, the old one of self-preservation.</P>
    <P>We cannot continue to live in a world that accumulates butter mountains in Western Europe and stands by apparently powerless while people starve to the extent they do every day. That is the nonsense of the global economic system obtaining.  There are too many people who will defend it on the grounds that you cannot replace it with anything else because you have greater problems.  For the people who are starving, dying, without any control over their own resources, niceties and arguments about the difficulties of working within a mixed economy will fall on very deaf ears but very hungry mouths.  Those people within our society who resent the granting of this money&mdash;on the grounds that we have 25 per cent of our own population poor&mdash;will have to be made aware, through the leadership of working politicians, of the realities of global politics in that context.</P>
    <P>The Minister alone within the Government has primary responsibility in this area.  I look forward not merely to one contribution but to a continuation of contributions from the Minister over the next three to four years on the responsibility of this country to the rest of the world.  I would do it in this context: that as a non-aligned nation &mdash;I am glad to see that the Minister takes a positive interpretation of the word &ldquo;non-aligned&rdquo;&mdash;we are a far more acceptable vehicle of development aid, be it money or more importantly skill, to many Third World countries than others such as Belgium, Holland, France or Britain whose hands are still very dirty with colonialism, whose pockets are still being lined by the benefits of neo-colonialism.  These <Col N="122" /> countries give out aid&mdash;and Mother England is as big an offender as anybody else&mdash;on the explicit understanding that any aid given has to be spent in such a way that the maximum benefit accrues back to these countries. That is some aid&mdash;when one gives something with one hand and one ties up the country in terms of supplies, spare parts, materials and so on with one's own domestic market.</P>
    <P>I would hope that the Minister, in celebrating the fact that we now have Part I status&mdash;and I am glad that that decision was taken because it would have been an insult to the rest of the world to maintain that we did not qualify for Part I status&mdash;would make it his business in coming years to ensure that the capacity of Irish professional skills is properly made available through the International Development Association or the World Bank.  I do not have the figures to hand at present. From my knowledge, which is limited &mdash;although I am reasonably well informed in regard to the area of professional services, particularly in regard to the ACP countries and the Lomé Convention&mdash;of Irish attempts to export professional skills to countries requiring and seeking them, I am not satisfied that as much use has been made of them by these global agencies as could have been made.</P>
    <P>If there is a fault there it is that of successive Governments and also that of the professions here in that they were not prepared to get involved. There seems to be an apparent contradiction that, on the one hand, as a professional architect and planner I can argue for such professionals in Ireland getting a bigger share of work that would originate from an aid fund such as this Bill is contributing to and, on the other hand, calling for a lack of selfishness in the donation of moneys.  But while recognising there is a commercial incentive for either the State or private sector to become involved in such work, there is a political, ideological argument for encouraging Irish professional skills, whether it be in health, social work or in the construction industry, to become involved in the Third World countries through aid programmes such as the <Col N="123" /> International Development Association on the precise grounds that we are not as commercially aligned or integrated as would be professional concerns in other industrial countries.</P>
    <P>Let me give the House an example of what I mean.  As a result of informative conversations I had with some people in the ESB about how they were received in certain Third World countries in specifying electrical projects and so on, they advanced as one of the reasons for their success in getting such contracts the fact that they were able to point out quite clearly that they were not the front-runners for some industrial manufacturing consortium or industry at home, that they would specify machinery and plant from different countries of origin, with different kinds of characteristics, spare part requirements and so on the basis of that machinery being suitable for the system required in the recipient country; whereas in the past the fact was that British and German consultants came to a country, designed an electrical system for an area and specified either total German or British components.  In a delivery system of that kind with a whole range of different machinery no one country will have the best type of generator, the best distribution system and so on. There will be variations.  The unique professional skill that the Irish professions, either semi-State or private, would have is that, because we do not have a commitment to such industrial bases or consortia we are in a much freer position to give unprejudiced and more professional help and skill to developing countries.</P>
    <P>An important point in this regard is that most of us have come of age in a country that is still only developing.  In professional terms people in the ESB, in Bord na Móna or in the private sector have direct experience of building more or less from scratch.  That is an experience in terms of taking a country from an underdeveloped status into a developing role that very few professional designers have in their own countries, whether in Britain, Germany or France.  In personal terms there is a far greater reservoir of real skill in <Col N="124" /> Irish-trained professionals but that reservoir for whatever reason was not adequately recognised by the international agencies until recently.  As a result of this Bill becoming law and the contribution being made, I hope the Minister through CTT&mdash;the relevant agency in this regard&mdash;the DEVCO operation generally and in conjunction with the CII and the boards concerned will make it his business to ensure that much more emphasis and enthusiasm is generated for this area.  It is not just for the obvious commercial reasons.  I believe it will improve our capacity as a country to solve our own problems if we acquire experience overseas.</P>
    <P>In replying to this debate I hope the Minister will be able to indicate what timetable he has with regard to bringing together the various interests involved in the whole question of development aid.  Has he any additional proposals with regard to how participation in development aid can be improved and extended by Irish people?  I do not want to appear too sectional in my concern in this matter but obviously by virtue of my qualifications and professional involvement I have knowledge of a narrow spectrum of the whole area.  There are other groups outside my sphere who have demonstrated competence and commitment to the satisfaction of international agencies and such commitment was totally beyond what people had expected of them.  I am referring in particular to the activities of Concern in Bangladesh which are highly regarded by a number of people who have come into contact with them. Foreigners were surprised at the extent of the skill and professionalism of the Irish aid operation because of its size relative to the Irish economy.  The number of people we have in a voluntary capacity overseas per population is enormous compared with many other countries.  I am referring to traditional religious missionaries, most of whom are essentially involved in secular work of teaching and health in addition to the religious vocation as well as to those who are there in a totally secular sense, who are not members of religious orders.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="125" /> We welcome the Bill.  We hope the Minister will positively undertake in the next year or two the obligation to explain and to advocate increased participation by the Irish people in the process of granting aid to poorer countries. In particular I hope he will expound on the philosophical position of non-alignment by ensuring that whatever aid is given is given in an open-handed sense.  By all means let there be an attempt to ensure maximum benefit for Irish professionals and Irish firms but the aid should be given on the clear understanding that it is not tied or conditional aid in the way it has been conditional aid from some of the traditional industrial countries.</P>
    <P>Quite frankly, the kind of money the World Bank, IDA or UNCTAD are giving is chicken-feed in terms of real need and in terms of the amount spent on arms each year.  The real threat to global stability is increasing rather than decreasing.  The example that horrified me of just what the rate of growth outside the western world was at an international conference I attended four years ago.  Somebody described an illegal squatter township that had grown up outside Mexico City &mdash;from the legal point of view it did not exist&mdash;and it had reached a size in terms of population of 500,000 people, just bigger than Dublin city. Mexico City is the first city that is likely to have a population of 20 million by the end of the century.</P>
    <P>The projections of such figures in terms of impact are so enormous by Irish standards that they are beyond domestic comprehension.  The Minister has a responsibility to ensure public acceptance of aid to those in need. Irrespective of our own poverty problems he must get the acceptance of the people to increase the money we give to the Third World on the lines of unconditional aid as I suggested at the outset.  We support the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ChrisJFox" hpid="Mr. Fox Mr. Fox">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fox</NameTxt>
      <P>In welcoming and supporting the Bill I wish to make the following observations.  The sum this little country is contributing is quite substantial per head of population.  We are making it in the context that we are recently out of the category into <Col N="126" /> which many of the countries whom we are helping will be.  In other words, it is not so long ago that we were looking for development money from many sources; in fact we are still in the situation that we want to take in outside expertise and capital to develop our economy.</P>
      <P>The money we are contributing is hard-earned money.  Quite contrary to the suggestion of the previous speaker, I consider certain suggestions of a conditional nature would be helpful to some of the eventual recipients of this money, not necessarily Irish money but money coming through the IDA.  One of the easiest types of development which will give benefit throughout the whole economy in any developing country is the development of a tourist industry.  We are very fortunate that we have a very highly skilled and well-developed tourist industry with a back-up service around the globe. Some of the developing countries are beginning to recognise this and their tourist industry is starting to be developed. This kind of money channelled into such development can do nothing but good.</P>
      <P>Tragically some of the natural assets of these countries may not be realised for the value which they hold.  I respectfully suggest, if possible that should be said to some of these countries.  For instance, Kenya at the moment is destroying some of her natural assets in the form of her wild life.  If they destroy one thing which is going to bring in and develop a very viable business, there is not much point in us channelling money in that direction when it will not be properly used.  The slaughter of animals in eastern Africa is totally reprehensible and is against the interests of the countries themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am told that it is normal practice in Kenya at the moment for friends of people in high places to flout the laws of that country and to slaughter elephants for their ivory.  This is illegally exported, particularly to Hong Kong and other countries.  I had the privilege of being there a few years ago.  One of the memories I will always have is waking up at <Col N="127" /> 7.30 a.m. and stopping counting elephants at 800.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Sean Browne">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think we should start counting elephants on this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ChrisJFox" hpid="Mr. Fox Mr. Fox">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fox</NameTxt>
      <P>Maybe we should not be counting elephants but we should be counting our pounds before we send them.  If they have no elephants they will have fewer tourists.</P>
      <P>One of the developments which has taken place in the western part of Kenya is sugar plantations.  Again this comes back to our technology and we might be able to ally their small farm technology with industrial farming methods.  Many of these countries are looking for this type of aid.  They have totally undeveloped economies and natural resources and they do not know how to utilise these resources.  It is easy to say &ldquo;Do not count elephants&rdquo; and that sugar cane is grown many miles from here and we have no interest in it.  We are contributing over £1 per head of population in this Bill. Therefore as such I suggest we have responsibility towards our own people and the people who are getting this money to make sure that it is spent to the best advantage.  While it may sound silly to ask: &ldquo;Were you up late the night before?&rdquo; or to say that 800 elephants were on a plain in east Africa, I respectfully suggest that neither was a very sensible thing to say.</P>
      <P>If the tourists from western Europe wish to come to the west of Ireland for the peace and quiet it is renowned for, then the wild life of east Africa is also a heritage which can be destroyed, and if we can bring any small measure of influence to preserve this, not alone for east Africa but for the whole world, then I suggest we do it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have been fortunate in our heritage of education.  We have been able to make use of the opportunities given <Col N="128" /> to us for industrial expansion.  Unfortunately, the developing countries have not had that heritage.  Their background of education has been skimpy, minimal, or non-existent in many cases. More by example and suggestion we have a responsibility in the expenditure of money of this type.</P>
    <P>I seriously suggest to the sponsor of this Bill that certain conditional suggestions to countries which may receive this aid are in order.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. O'Kennedy) Michael O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. O'Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I will deal with the two points raised by Deputy Fox.  He is probably aware that development aid generally cannot be made conditional on terms which would be acceptable to us.  I know that is not what he is suggesting but he did say that we should suggest that this money should be used in the most positive way.  For example, in Kenya they could use it not only to preserve what they have but to develop their natural resources as an attraction for tourism.  That is a very real and practical way of helping many developing countries.</P>
      <P>We will convey his suggestion but not just in this case because it would be wrong of me to say that I would tell the president of the IDA what to convey to the Kenyans.  It is a policy position.  We will always endeavour to suggest to these countries with whom we are co-operating that the best way to promote our common aims is to develop their own natural resources. I hope that meets the case made by Deputy Fox.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Bord Fáilte are very actively involved in this area, mainly thoough the Lomé Convention and other international associations.  This brings me to Deputy Quinn's point.  Ireland has only relatively recently developed.  I do not want to be misunderstood; we have never been in the same category as the people we are discussing although we may have been in the same category during the years of the great Famine.  Nonetheless, we are in a stage of recent development.  Because of that our experience, particularly through the operation of State bodies and our economic development, is <Col N="129" /> relevant to much that is being done in many of these countries.</P>
    <P>Tourism is a major element in that, and Bord Fáilte have a very significant role to play.  I am glad to tell Deputy Fox and the other Deputies who contributed and whose contributions were very welcome, that this is an area I see as having great potential.  It places an immense obligation on us to ensure that our State agencies are given the opportunity to provide the expertise and to co-operate with these countries, with no strings attached, no preconditions and no colonial political reasons for assisting them, whether it be with personnel or by capital resources.</P>
    <P>That brings us to the general question raised by Deputy Quinn, that is, the role of our State agencies within the framework of the council he mentioned some time ago.  I welcome the fact that we have to legislate to enable us to play our part in this international obligation.  This is the second time since we took office that such an occasion has arisen.  I welcome the fact that I will be called to account from time to time&mdash;although it does not look as if I will be called to account too often at Question Time&mdash;for the progress made.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Do not worry; we will get to the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not impatient. Despite the other obligations and activities in which I have been involved, I have not ignored this obligation, namely, the development of a comprehensive development policy.  I have set in train&mdash;it has even gone beyond that &mdash;a consultation procedure.  With my colleagues in Government, I have set out proposals and I hope within the next few weeks to be communicating with the interests concerned, inviting them to come and discuss the outline of the proposals which I hope will give rise to a council of the kind Deputy Quinn has in mind.  These will be preliminary discussions.  I will put my proposals to them and I hope I can be flexible enough to adopt their suggestions because their experience is very relevant and helpful to me.  Perhaps, by the time another Bill of this nature comes to the House, the discussions <Col N="130" /> will not only have taken place but the actual council will be established.</P>
      <P>The one problem we face in this area&mdash;this has been touched on by Deputy Ryan before and by all of the Deputies who spoke today&mdash;is the fact that we have not sufficiently realised yet the potential of our State agencies, particularly in co-operating with those developing countries.  The first reason is that we have not had diplomatic relations with most of those countries. The extension of our diplomatic representation, which I am also considering at the moment, will be determined to a considerable extent by the role which those embassies and our representatives abroad can play in establishing a new understanding with many of those countries.  You have to have the political presence before you make the initial introduction.  If Bord Fáilte, the IDA, CTT or the ESB presented themselves in any of those countries without the political introduction they would have no way of being assured whether or not they were involved in the private sector, what their standing there was or anything of that sort.</P>
      <P>I am anxious to ensure that the closest possible liaison will be established with our diplomatic representations abroad and that the initial political introduction will be made which will guarantee that the representative organisations and the people in the private sector also will be able to make an immediate impact.  The other countries of Europe have had diplomatic representations with most of the countries of Africa and indeed with Latin America where we have not had representations. Those are the areas where the greatest problems arise.  I am glad to say that, allowing for that disability, we have been able, particularly through the Lomé Convention, to project that particular contribution we can make, namely, at the level of personnel and general advice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Shortly before I came to the House today the Minister for Foreign Affairs from Sri Lanka came to discuss the textile quota for their country in the European Community.  He was then travelling to Shannon Airport because <Col N="131" /> he had become aware, through the activities of our State agencies generally, of the concept of the Shannon Free Airport Development Company, how much it contributed not only to the development of that area but also to a national development programme. This Minister for Foreign Affairs and another Minister for Trade with two other representatives were going there to spend some time talking to those people.  This should be not only a source of satisfaction but also of challenge to us because that is where the great contribution can be made by us in the future.  The possibility also of having even an external development corporation at some stage is not something which should be overlooked. The possibility of having an organisation which might co-ordinate much of what we can do at that level should be considered.</P>
    <P>The advantage we have by working through the State agencies, which touches on something mentioned by Deputy Quinn, is that generally in many of the countries we are dealing with, the political situation is very different from ours.  They are not all democracies of the type we know here. Perhaps that is understandable because where there is famine and hunger we will not get what we call political normality, which is a nice, comfortable, western-world term.  If there is no political normality on our basis there will not be democracy on our basis.  As often as not there will be authoritarian regimes one way or another.  They have to be dealt with on a State trading basis.</P>
    <P>The only people who can effectively do that on the basis of this co-operation we are speaking about are State-sponsored companies.  Therefore, the contribution we can make in the private sector is necessarily limited. Sometimes it is non-existent.  We are looking very closely at the possibility of extending the role of our State bodies generally in this area and perhaps enabling them in certain circumstances to sub-contract appropriate professional contracts to the private sector thereby involving both elements of our community.  All of that simply <Col N="132" /> sketches a framework within which we can operate and is certainly implicit in what has been said by Deputies in the House today.</P>
    <P>This will enable us in the furtherance of our development policy generally to activate that awareness Deputy Quinn spoke about at all levels in our community.  I believe it is there, but that is not enough.  We have to follow a very consistent and precise programme in all of this.  If we are to have a national development plan I believe that involves, almost by definition, an international development plan in the sense that we must also have a consistent programme abroad.  I accept the contributions of Deputy Ryan and Deputy Quinn that we must do this not just for altruistic reasons, although it might be so, but purely in terms of our own survival if that were the only basis on which we could approach them.  The western world became a developed part of the world to a very considerable extent because of the manner in which they have been able to exploit the weakness of the undeveloped parts of the world for a number of years.  That will not remain so. There is now an impatience and a determination on the part of many of those countries, the countries of the 77 for instance, in regard to the existing economic order.</P>
    <P>It is fair to say, I believe, that there is a growing awareness among the developed countries, particularly in Europe, of this economic order.  While there is an awareness and a recognition that we must work closely with them (a) because it is a moral obligation and (b) because it is in our own interests to accept the reality of this new economic order, nonetheless one still finds a reluctance, even on the part of the European Community, to face up to the reality on occasions.  At the moment we have such an occasion. We all know that the textile industry is a very sensitive one here, in Britain and in many other countries.  We also know that many of the countries we are talking about here rely to a very considerable extent on the textile industry. We sometimes dismiss them in terms of our multi-lateral trade negotiations as &ldquo;low cost countries&rdquo; as if <Col N="133" /> they were engaged in some kind of international conspiracy to undermine our markets or our industries.  Why are they low cost countries?  The answer comes back all too readily, because the people who are working in those manufacturing industries in those low-cost countries are being paid a mere pittance. They have hardly even a survival rate of pay.</P>
    <P>The European Community, particularly a community that is in fact, by definition, devoted to free trade, must also be consistent and say: &ldquo;If we are going to have free trade within the Community we should begin to accept the consequences of free trade in the world and not penalise the low-cost countries, as they are called, for the effects they are having on our market.&rdquo;  This will inevitably mean, and it is something we will have to face up to, a restructuring of our industry so that we can reorganise.  It is not just we who are in this position because this burden falls on even more developed countries than we are, but we have an alternative to redirect our industrial progress and take account of the problems of various sensitive areas, such as textiles, steel and so on.  These countries have no alternative.  In Sri Lanka they devoted a great deal to the development of the textile industry because they were advised to do so by the World Bank.  Unfortunately that advice was not well-founded from the point of view of the development of the textile industry over the last few years.  Since they followed programmes laid down for them by the World Bank they can hardly be penalised by us now when they produce low cost products which create problems for our markets.  The European Community is becoming more and more aware of this and Commissioner Haferkamp is also aware of it.  It is a long-term matter.  It is not something that can be dealt with overnight.  We will have to look to the areas in which these countries are particularly dependent and ensure in our programmes generally that we allow them the opportunity to compete with us so that they can maintain their development programmes.  This will not mean any special preferences.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="134" /> There is an increasing awareness of the interdependence of nations in this new economic world order, but awareness is not enough.  We must now start through programmes&mdash;I thank Deputy Ryan for the correction, though I doubt if these countries are aware of our Industrial Development Authority&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Possibly, but this is something we have to get used to, terminologies and abbreviations of all kinds.  Through operations like IDA there is an opportunity to make some progress.  This particular programme under the International Development Association is directed mainly at those countries with the most appalling level of poverty.  The qualification is an annual income of less than £300. In most countries being assisted it is less than £150.  The figures quoted by Deputy Ryan and Deputy Quinn underline the appalling reality.  Simply to maintain the difference that existed five years ago between developed and developing countries we would have to increase significantly the contribution we have been making over the last number of years.</P>
      <P>This particular programme is directed at countries such as India.  Bangladesh and so on where the general level of income is as low as I have mentioned.  Within that, perhaps 66 per cent of the programme of the fifth replenishment of the International Development Association will still be concentrated on the areas of the most acute poverty.  We are not talking in terms then of most of it going to people with the equivalent of £3 per week but, within that obvious range, the level of the most appalling poverty. If and whenever they graduate from qualifying under this International Development Association they then come within the range of activities of the World Bank and so on.  What one does then is bring them along from the lowest level to some semblance of human dignity, if one can call it that, to the point at which they have passed from the alternative of life or death and can fend for themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="135" /> Incidentally, the sixth replenishment negotiations are already under way. They will start next year with a view to establishing the commitments we will have to meet towards this continuing programme over the next number of years.  It is my hope our contribution will increase to the greatest possible extent.  It should be acknowledged here that this is, in fact, giving effect to the commitment into which the former Minister for Finance entered on behalf of the Government last April.</P>

      <P>This is giving legislative effect to that commitment. As a consequence of the latest ratification by the donor countries it will now be possible to get the sixth replenishment fund under way.  I do not think there is anything more I have to say except that it will be necessary, as speakers have pointed out, to re-enforce the message over and over again.  This is a national obligation. To the extent that the response will be forthcoming, as it always has been, I shall be glad to re-enforce the message and to ensure that this will always be done without any pre-condition but simply in answer to the obligation we have and in the light of the great potential there is for us, something Deputy Quinn underlined, to have really meaningful co-operation with these people in helping them to achieve some degree of human dignity and, hopefully, at some stage the same level of prosperity we enjoy.</P>

      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for giving me the opportunity to raise this matter of corporal punishment in the schools.  I should like to thank Deputy Keating, whose question on yesterday's Order Paper first brought this aspect of the problem to the attention of the House.

    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am bringing up this subject not as an individual or on my own behalf; I not only have the support of the Labour Party but I am raising the matter at the express wish of the Labour Party.  The policy of my party has always been fair and unambiguous.  It is based on the creation of a humane and co-operative school environment in which any form of discipline which involves the infliction of pain by one human being on another is necessarily excluded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to emphasise that in bringing up the question at this time I am not in any way opposed to any individual teacher or teaching organisation. It is my personal experience that the huge majority of the people who do a difficult job in teaching in our schools, often under severe handicaps of large class sizes and so on, <Col N="140" /> also consider the infliction of physical pain on children as something which is abhorrent to them and which they never practise in their personal teaching.</P>
    <P>To me it is a matter of regret that despite the intermittent debate on this area which has been taking place for many years, no previous holder of the Education portfolio has to my knowledge ever expressed even a personal opinion in favour of the abolition of corporal punishment in schools.  Not only that, some Members of this House and some previous holders of that portfolio have gone on record as supporting it in certain instances.  The penultimate Minister for Education did so and yesterday in the House the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education spoke in very similar terms.  I believe that in this respect our politicians are very much behind the times.  They are not as abreast as they might be of public opinion generally and opinion within the teaching profession.  I find it sad that this issue has not been adequately faced.</P>
    <P>The main area referred to in yesterday's question related to a school which is effectively under the general oversight of the Department of Education, as are all national schools.  It is about national schools that I should like to speak first.  The administration of discipline in national schools is governed by the rules and regulations for the conduct of national schools issued from time to time by the Department.  The most recent set of such rules and regulations were issued in 1965 and were signed shortly before he left office by the then Minister for Education, Dr. Hillery, now Uachtarán na hÉireann.  Those regulations provide for a number of possible situations. They are drafted with the obvious intention of giving the whole area and problem a sympathetic and sensitive treatment.</P>
    <P>Paragraph No. 130 (1) states:</P>
    <P>Teachers should have a lively regard for the improvement and general welfare of their pupils, treat them with kindness combined with firmness and should aim at governing them through their affections <Col N="141" /> and reason and not by harshness and severity.  Ridicule, sarcasm or remarks likely to undermine a pupil's self-confidence should be avoided.</P>
    <P>I do not believe any Member of this House would quarrel with that statement.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 130 (2) states:</P>
    <P>Corporal punishment should be administered only in cases of serious misbehaviour and should not be administered for mere failure at lessons.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 130 (3) states:</P>
    <P>Corporal punishment should be administered only by the principal teacher or other member of the school staff authorised by the manager for the purpose.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 130 (4) states:</P>
    <P>Any teacher who inflicts improper or excessive punishment will be regarded as guilty of conduct unbefitting a teacher and will be subject to severe disciplinary action.</P>
    <P>It is instructive to compare these with the previous regulations which were in force between 1946 and 1965. Two of the 1946 regulations have disappeared. One of them forbids teachers to carry about a cane or other instrument of punishment; another provides that the boxing of children's ears, the pulling of their hair or similar ill-treatment is absolutely forbidden and will be visited with severe penalties.  In some respects the 1965 regulations were an improvement on earlier ones but the dropping of these provisions may have been a disimprovement.</P>
    <P>One of the great difficulties in discussing corporal punishment in primary schools is that we literally do not know what the practice is.  It was the practice in the early years of this century for all schools to keep punishment books in which physical punishments had to be recorded.  This practice is still maintained in the sister island across the water.  Punishment books are not now kept and the argument about the advisability or otherwise of corporal punishment and the extent to which it is practised is impoverished by <Col N="142" /> a serious lack of information about what is going on.</P>
    <P>I was intrigued yesterday to hear the Parliamentary Secretary tell the House that he actually had direct knowledge of the number of occasions on which corporal punishment was used in the institution which was the subject of yesterday's question.  I would be very interested to know if the Department, in respect of this or any other institution, have required the managers and organisers to record the administration of physical punishment. I am not in favour of physical punishment, but if it is to be administered then at the very minimum there should be a record of when it is administered, who administers it and the reasons for administering it.  It is a poor substitute for an enlightened policy but even that is better than the present situation which involves people arguing on the impressions of general belief, very often with a considerable lack of supporting evidence.</P>
    <P>The situation in secondary schools is not governed by any regulations of the Department and this is also a pity.  A survey carried out some time ago by the Irish Union of School Students, whose total reliability might be called in question but nevertheless it gives us some kind of picture of the situation. In well over three quarters of the schools surveyed physical punishment was carried out and this was so in almost nine-tenths of the boys' schools.  In 60 per cent of the schools such physical punishment was confined to pupils at or below intermediate or group certificate level.  The obvious inference of that is not that the pupils get better as they get older but that the physical risk of retaliation to the person administering the assault is considerably greater.  I fail to see any other reason why what is apparently commonplace for a child of eight should be less commonplace for a child of 18.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>Another interesting fact in the survey, on which the Minister will also have the opportunity to comment, is that apparently no corporal punishment of any kind took place in co-educational schools and in my view this is yet another argument in favour of such schools.  In vocational schools, which are under the direct control of the Minister, physical punishment is outlawed.  If it happens, it is not sanctioned by the Minister and I imagine he would be very disappointed to hear of any such punishment taking place illegally in any such schools.</P>
      <P>It is true to say that we are virtually an anomaly in western Europe in regard to corporal punishment.  The United Kingdom and Ireland are the only Common Market countries that still allow it.  Even in Britain, in primary schools under the control of the Inner London Education Authority, they have banned it for some time.  We are the only country in Europe with a substantial Catholic population that still allows it.  In the godless country of Sweden it has been forbidden since 1966.  In the equally secular country of Finland it has been forbidden since before the turn of the century.  We should examine the insights and, if necessary, the legislation of some of these other countries to see if we can learn something from them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1600 I might have had a problem in being a politician who was arguing for the abolition of corporal punishment in schools.  In 1600, society was generally more violent than it is today, and violence was an accepted fact of life.  But violence is not now an accepted fact of life.  Unfortunately, it may be a fact of many aspects of contemporary living, but it is not an accepted one.  It is reprehended, it is condemned, and it is visited with all sorts of legal sanctions. <Col N="144" /> The idea of violence is increasingly in conflict with current practice in families and with current practice in the rest of the civilised world.  We do have a particular problem in Ireland where we have a long history of violence.  That problem is that for many years now we have, quite rightly, set our faces against the legitimacy of violence as a method of achieving public and political objectives. Why, then, should it be any more acceptable in the pursuit of private and personal aims?  We are in danger of creating a kind of schizophrenic society because, while it is commonplace that the social problems of tomorow are bred in the homes and schools of today, we refuse to draw the obvious conclusions.</P>
    <P>I believe very strongly that violence of such a personal kind is, or should be, an anachronism.  That is because we are more conscious nowadays of the dignity of the individual.  We are also more conscious of the dangers to the person who administers and to the person who receives such physical punishment.  The danger resides chiefly in this: that as the use of violence becomes more and more of an anachronism, the circumstances in which it is administered will become more and more imbued with guilt. The more the sense of guilt the more the psychological damage.</P>
    <P>In the brief time at my disposal I hope I have made a case for a totally different approach to the question of physical punishment in schools.  I should like to end by making some concrete suggestions to the Minister for Education.  First of all, I should like him to see what he can do to remedy what seems to be a general lack of awareness of parental rights in this matter.  If I am correct, it is open to any individual parent to insist that his child should not be subjected to corporal punishment at school.  I believe it is also open to the parents whose children attend a national school to jointly decide that corporal punishment should not form part of the regime at that school.  If I am correct, perhaps the Minister could take it upon himself to circularise management boards and inform them of this option that exists for them.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="145" /> Secondly, I would ask the Minister to find out through his inspectors, or whatever means he wants to employ, exactly what the current situation is with regard to the frequency and type of corporal punishment that may be administered in all our schools.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, I understand that the rules for primary schools are currently being redrafted.  I would urge the Minister to seriously consider using this opportunity, which has not arisen for more than ten years, to put an end to the practice which makes us unique in western Europe.  I suspect that Government policy in regard to corporal punishment has lagged behind public opinion for some time, and now is the time for the Government to give a lead.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Deputy Horgan's comprehensive and well structured appeal.  It is not my intention to assign blame in regard to this matter because I have no doubt that the Minister will consider the appeal on its merits.</P>
      <P>My view is that it is a shameful thing for a nation at this stage of its evolution to be in the position where the State appears to support the infliction of pain on children, allegedly for educational and rehabilitation purposes, without any monitoring process or any system of inspection.  That is wrong because it is educationally unsound and there is no evidence available to show that it has proved successful in reforming these alleged errant boys.  The infliction of pain <i>per se</i> does no more than diminish the dignity of the individual, whether it be an adult, or a man in prison, about which, quite rightly, there would be an outcry, or a child who is in effect orphaned.</P>
      <P>I would ask the Minister to consider Deputy Horgan's suggestions.  I am particularly interested in the involvement of parents in the process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Minister for Education (Mr. Wilson) John P. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. Wilson)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have this opportunity to speak on the subject.  Deputy Horgan referred in grateful tones to the fact that Deputy Keating had a special question on this matter for the Parliamentary Secretary to answer. Deputy Horgan must have also seen <Col N="146" /> that Deputy Noel Browne has a Private Members' Motion on the Order Paper, and he might have given him some credit.  Deputy Noel Browne has also got a question down to me on this matter.  We can give Deputy Browne a little credit for the matter being under discussion.</P>
      <P>Deputy Horgan said it was the express wish of the Labour Party to have a clear and unambiguous policy on this matter and for this I recommend them.  They managed to keep it in deep freeze for four-and-a-quarter years when they had the power to make it effective.  I am not apportioning any of the blame for that to Deputy Horgan who was not here to see to it that the Labour Deputies refused to support a Government which did not put what was the clear and unambiguous policy of the Labour Party into effect.  I should like to pay tribute to Deputy Horgan in that his treatment of the subject matter was not emotional.  Sometimes this subject causes a great deal of emotion and reason does not surface at all.  The Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy Tunney, gave a clear and humane answer to the question put down to him and I do not want anybody to try to hang any kind of violence around the neck of the Parliamentary Secretary.</P>
      <P>Deputy Horgan may have gone a little off when he started indulging himself as an amateur psychologist at the end of what was a good speech. He broadened the debate and attributed violence in after life to the alleged violence in our schools.  I do not think he or a professional psychologist would be able to prove that one comes from the other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The time available to me to reply to this debate is not adequate for the purpose of dealing in any satisfactory way with a subject as broad as this question of corporal punishment in our schools.  I would have preferred to have had a debate on it and had we waited for Deputy Noel Browne's Private Members' Motion to be reached we would have had a clear debate on it and that might have been preferable.  If a debate of this nature is to take place I would prefer that <Col N="147" /> it should be in circumstances where it can be comprehensively dealt with and the various aspects of the matter fully discussed.</P>
    <P>This is not an issue where the Minister for Education can say he is for or against corporal punishment. It is not a simplistic issue like that. Any Minister for Education in modern times would prefer to be in a position where there was no necessity to speak on the subject and where in practice corporal punishment did not have any place in the day to day work of the schools.  However, I am not prepared to allow myself be placed in the category of people who would wish to denigrate our teachers&mdash;Deputy Horgan did not do that openly or overtly &mdash;our school management boards and all connected with the administration of our schools through mischievous and unfair allegations in relation to what takes place in those schools. We are talking about a systematic society where corporal punishment is gradually phased out.  This reflects developing attitudes of communities and parents in general, and in the context of education it reflects an increased professionalism among teachers as well as increased co-operation between parents and teachers.</P>
    <P>The new curriculum for the primary schools, with all its inbuilt motivation for discovery in learning and with its boundless opportunities for creativity and self-expression, ensures the voluntary co-operation of the pupils. Children with educational difficulties <Col N="148" /> and problems are no longer seen&mdash; thank God this is so&mdash;as recalcitrant children or unco-operative children but rather as individuals who need extra care and attention and who may need the extra services provided by remedial teachers and school psychologists to make life more satisfying for them. The vast majority of teachers neither desire nor use corporal punishment. In the main they would regard resorting to corporal punishment as a failure of the exercise of their professional skills.  Teachers nowadays are better trained in understanding the psychology of the young people in their care and have available to them a range of methodologies and content which can cater for the vast majority of teaching situations.

    <P>It is not a simplistic issue that we can deal with in ten minutes on a Thursday evening after a week's parliamentary work.  I would like to have discussions with the various teaching and managerial bodies on this topic and I intend to have such discussions. A consensus may, hopefully, be achieved.</P>

      <P>Particulars of the capital structure of Bord na <Col N="109" /> Móna are given in the capital account of each year's annual accounts.  The annual accounts, as published, are in a form which complies with statutory requirements and accords with modern accounting practice.  I consider that I would not be justified in requiring Bord na Móna to furnish for publication accounts additional to those in the form approved in 1976 by the then Minister for Transport and Power after consultation with the Minister for Finance.</P>

      <P>Allocation of a grant in this case has been delayed because the applicant has stated that he is obtaining a water supply from a group scheme but my Department has no record of his being a member of any such scheme.

      <P>Shankill is a rapidly developing area and my Department has approved the provision of a 1,000 pupil co-educational school.  At present the normal procedures for the acquisition of a site are in hands in my Department.</P>
      <P>Provision of second level places in the Ballybrack area is being kept under review in the light of the further housing development and the amount of accommodation available or likely to be available in the existing schools in the area.  Some pupils from Ballybrack would most likely enrol in the new Shankill School.</P>
