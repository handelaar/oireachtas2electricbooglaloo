    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell  Mr. Mitchell Mr. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>and <b>Mr. O'Donnell</b> asked the Taoiseach if he or any of his Minister has received a request for a meeting with the management of Ferenka Limited, or its parent company, to discuss the present dispute and its implications; if so, when the request was received; if it was agreed to; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>A request for a meeting was received on Tuesday, 1st November, 1977, by the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy from a member of the board of Ferenka's parent company, the ENKA Group. The meeting took place on Friday, 4th November, between the Minister and representatives of the group.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Labour had also, at his request, met representatives of Ferenka Limited, on Thursday, 27th October.</P>
      <P>Each Minister stressed the concern of the Government that management and worker representatives should, in their own interest, bring about a settlement. They indicated the dangers to employment and the other possible consequences of the stoppage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the negotiation of a settlement in industrial disputes is primarily matter for the parties involved, officers <Col N="336" /> of the Labour Court have been available in Limerick or Dublin since 12th October.  The Minister for Labour, when the prospects of a settlement being reached by the parties themselves appeared poor, put forward proposals for a settlement on two occasions.  These were not accepted by the parties concerned, who alone can settle the dispute and must look to the consequences of their actions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. Mitchell Mr. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Taoiseach say whether he still considers the position to be that there is no appearance of any solution to the problem, that a solution is as unlikely now as it was a week ago and, if so, whether the Government have any plans for following up the Minister for Labour's intervention of about two weeks ago?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I can only say in reply to the Deputy that there is a possibility of further initiative under our industrial relations legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. Mitchell Mr. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not clear from that as to what is the position.  I understood the suggestion of the Minister for Labour, a suggestion that I welcomed, to be sufficiently flexible to allow for modification to some extent in the event of one or other of the parties finding any part of the suggestion unsatisfactory.  This was the case.  Have the Government and the Taoiseach any further plans for pursuing an early settlement to this dispute? Also, can the Taoiseach say whether he considers the dispute to be of a very serious nature?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no doubt as to how serious I consider the dispute to be.  The same applies to my colleagues in Government.  However, it is a well-established practice that if there is a possibility of further industrial relations negotiations, matters of this nature are not discussed in the House.  I suggest that this is such an occasion and that, perhaps, further question and answer of this nature might not be helpful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasGODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>While acknowledging the complexity of the situation and acknowledging also the intervention and the efforts of the Minister for <Col N="337" /> Labour, would the Taoiseach not agree that in view of the extreme gravity of the situation and of the disastrous implications of the possible closure of the plant, it should be possible for the Government through the machinery available to the Department of Labour and to the Labour Court, to formulate some initiative that would be a follow-up to the intervention of the Minister for Labour?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Regarding what the Deputy is driving at, I have given an indication of such possibility but it is not helpful to be pursuing it here.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnJRyan" hpid="Mr. J. Ryan Mr. J. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am anxious to clarify the situation.  Is the Taoiseach aware of the Pontius Pilate statement made by the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy during the weekend when he wiped his hands of the whole affair and said that the Government would have no part of any responsibility in the matter.</P>

      <P>When newspapers attribute statements to a Minister it does not mean that the Minister concerned has made the statement in question.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Ryan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall not argue the pros and cons of that.  The Deputy knows how delicate is the situation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnJRyan" hpid="Mr. J. Ryan Mr. J. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that but surely the occasion was most inopportune for the Minister to have made such a statement.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach (a) the level of industrial output and employment during the first quarter of 1972 and during the first quarter of 1977 and (b) the estimated total amount of new investment in Irish industry from all sources during this five-year period.</P>

      <P>The available information relates to transportable goods industries.</P>
      <P>The volume index in transportable goods industries, to base 1953 = 100, was 239.1 in the first quarter of 1972 and 301.3 in the first quarter of 1977.</P>
      <P>The number of persons engaged in these industries was 204,400 in the first quarter of 1972 and the figure for the first quarter of 1977 was the same.</P>
      <P>The data for 1977 are provisional and are subject to revision.</P>
      <P>The estimated figures for gross fixed capital formation in industry in the four years up to 1975 is £597 million. Corresponding information for 1976 is not yet available.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Should we take it, then, that all the activities of all the employment creating agencies, including the IDA, have given but a nil increase in jobs since 1972?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. P. Lalor Mr. P. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Lalor</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment if he intends to establish a Dublin transportation authority as outlined by the three local authorities in the Dublin region.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume that the Deputy is referring to the proposals submitted by Dublin Corporation on 8th March, 1976 to the Departments of Local Government and of Transport and Power, recommending the establishment of a transportation authority for the Dublin area.  I would refer the Deputy to the reply given to him on this subject by the Minister for Tourism and Transport on 18th October.  I would remind him that the issue of responsibility for public transport does not come within the functions of my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards functions with which my Department are concerned, my predecessor indicated in his reply to the corporation on 19th August 1976, his willingness to have certain traffic and <Col N="340" /> parking functions under the Road Traffic Acts transferred by order under those Acts to the local authorities concerned, which they could operate jointly or separately, at a date convenient to them.  It is open to these authorities to pursue that matter with my Department.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that as a result of there being split responsibility for transport between the Department of Tourism and Transport and the Department of the Environment, the sufferer in the ultimate is the commuter in the Dublin region and would he not consider that action must be taken immediately to establish some form of transport authority?  Could he clarify what is meant in the Fianna Fáil manifesto which states that they will establish a transport authority?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>That question should be put down to the Minister for Tourism and Transport as he is responsible for that section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Could I ask if the present Minister for the Environment is in agreement with his predecessor regarding the offer made to transfer certain powers under the roads Acts and so on to the local authority and would be be prepared to specify the extent of those powers and the timetable under which they might be transferred?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said in my reply, the content of the question is not my responsibility.  It is the responsibility of another Minister.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of clarification, the Minister stated that the previous incumbent of the Customs House did offer to transfer certain powers under the roads Acts.  What is the position of the present Government and would the Minister go farther than what was offered in the reply of Minister Tully?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister accept, in the context of the newly-named Department of the Environment with presumably concern about environmental matters, that transport has a part to play in that?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume the Deputy is referring to part of the motorway system recommended in the Dublin Transportation Study.

      <P>The proposals of the Dublin County Council referred to by the Deputy were received in my Department on 13th September, 1977.  These proposals are related to the major road recommendations contained in the Dublin Transportation Study, a general review of which was requested of the City and County Manager.  It would not be appropriate to take a decision on a particular element in the transportation study recommendations pending completion and examination of the City and County Manager's review of the whole matter.</P>

The latest official figures available show that the number of road accident fatalities in this country for the nine months ended 30th September, 1977 was 386.

      <P>It is a matter for each local authority to determine the provision to be made to enable them to discharge their fire-fighting responsibilities and it is for the manager to ensure that a satisfactory level of efficiency is maintained.  In accordance with the recommendation of the Working Party on the Fire Service a comprehensive examination of the strength and adequacy of the service is currently being carried out in each area. These services are being conducted by the local authorities on lines proposed by the Department and will cover all aspects of the fire service.

    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>The main problems in regard to pollution arising from the disposal of local authority sewage effluents occur in older systems which, while they were adequate when installed, have become overloaded due to the housing and industrial expansion of recent years.</P>
      <P>The normal ongoing sanitary services programmes include works necessary for the elimination of pollution or its prevention where there is a danger it might occur.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All new local authority sewerage schemes are designed to ensure that the effluent is disposed of without <Col N="356" /> causing pollution in receiving waters. The pace at which inadequate sewage disposal systems can be updated depends, however, on the amount of capital that can be made available for the sanitary services programmes as a whole and the competing needs within these programmes for urgent drainage and water supply facilities for new housing and industrial developments. Thirty-one sewerage schemes incorporating satisfactory disposal arrangements have been provided recently or are under construction.  The cost of these schemes is in the region of £23 million.  Work is expected to commence shortly on a further 15 such schemes costing about £5 million and a further 12 major schemes are at advanced planning stages.</P>

      <P>The superannuation arrangements generally, as put forward by the working party, are new and complex, particularly in so far as servants are concerned, and involve the preparation of detailed instructions as well as a scheme and an explanatory memorandum to be made available to each pensionable employee to assist him in understanding the effects of the scheme and in deciding whether or not to have it applied to him.  The Deputies can be assured that I am taking all practicable steps to have the relevant instructions and so on for local authorities and other bodies issued at the earliest possible date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to (a) in Question No. 29, the principal changes recommended in respect of pensions and gratuities affecting servants' widows are that the Local Authorities Widows' and Orphans' Pension Scheme, as applicable to officers, should be extended to servants; that the widows of servants who retired or died before the operative date of the recommendations contained in the report (27th May, <Col N="359" /> 1977) should be granted <i>ex gratia</i> pensions; and that there should be cover for death gratuity for all pensionable servants irrespective of the length of their service.</P>
    <P>The reservation referred to at (b) in Question No. 29 related to short service gratuities and marriage gratuities and indicated that the representative of the Department of the Public Service on the working party considered that these matters should be examined further by the working party with a view to bringing the arrangements in the local authority service into line in each case with those which apply to comparable categories of State employees.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment if he will make a full statement on the provision of fully-serviced housing sites at approximately half the current market price in the Leixlip area, County Kildare, to speculative builders; and the criterion involved in assessing to whom such sites could be sold; and the names and addresses of buyers of these subsidised sites.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Under section 88 of the Housing Act, 1966, local authorities may sell, lease or exchange land acquired by them for the purposes of the Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In accordance with the Housing Authorities (Borrowing and Management) <Col N="362" /> Regulations, 1974, building sites sold, leased or exchanged under section 88 of the Act must be disposed of at a price not less than the cost to the local authority of acquiring and developing the sites, including administrative costs, less the equivalent of any site subsidy.</P>
    <P>I understand from Kildare County Council that, in the case of the serviced sites in the Leixlip area provided by them, the sale price per site is in accordance with these regulations and that, as far as the local authority is aware, no sites have been sold to speculative builders.  One site only has been allocated to each applicant on condition that the applicant would erect thereon a house for his own occupation.  I also understand that no applications have been received from any applicants to sell their interests in the sites allocated to them.  In addition, the local authority has indicated that no applications have yet been received from persons in respect of whom subsidy would be payable. Subsidy has not been paid by my Department in respect of any of the sites.  The question of supplying the names and addresses of buyers of subsidised sites does not, therefore. arise.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister confirm for me that the sale price of these sites is, without doubt and without equivocation, not less than the cost to the State and to the local county council?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">

    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment if it is the policy of local authorities to exclude disability and compensation payments from income for the purposes of assessing differential rent for disabled persons; and, if not, if he will consider proposals introducing such a scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>The assessment of income for differential rent purposes is generally made by local authorities in accordance with the 1976 national differential rent scheme.  This scheme provides that income from disabled persons' maintenance allowances under section 69 of the Health Act, 1970, is disregarded for rent purposes.  Income from disability benefit in the case of tenants in receipt of this benefit on 17th September, 1976, and continually after that date, is assessed at 50 per cent, whereas income from disability benefit in respect of new claims for benefit received after 17th September, 1976, is assessed in full for rent purposes. While the rent scheme does not refer specifically to lump sum payments received by tenants as compensation, it is understood that local authorities generally do not take such payments into account for rent purposes.</P>
      <P>A review of the terms of the national differential rent scheme is at present being carried out and I hope to be in a position shortly to notify local authorities of the outcome of the review.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is aware of the considerable difficulty caused by some of his colleagues over the last one because the scheme was not notified to some local authorities until long after it had been put into operation elsewhere. That caused considerable trouble in the Department.</P>

      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): In view of the Minister's statement that local authorities generally did not take these payments into account in assessing means, would I be correct in assuming there does not appear to be a uniform policy operated by all local authorities and, if that is so, would the Minister agree it is highly undesirable?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy may have in mind, however, the position of the revenue-financed <Col N="369" /> programme in the light of the deferment of the estimates process of rating authorities requested by my Department's circular of 17th August, 1977.

    <Title>Industrial Development Bill, 1977: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>When we adjourned last Wednesday I had spoken for about 20 minutes.  I had explained to the House that if the Minister's speech had contained nothing except the description of the contents of the Bill I would not have spoken for even 20 minutes because the Bill itself is plainly desirable and overdue.  Not only had it been drafted under the Minister's predecessor but it had been introduced and had gone some distance through Second Stage.  There would be no necessity, therefore, to hold up the House in regard to the Bill had the Minister not taken the opportunity to speak, in a somewhat larger perspective, about industrial development generally and in particular about the Industrial Development Consortium of which, for the first time, he gave the House and the country details last Wednesday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I asked the Taoiseach the following morning not to order this item for last Thursday because I wanted to think about this consortium and talk to others about it.  I emphasised that that was my only reason and I could not understand why I was ruled out of order in making that request because I understood that representation to the Taoiseach in regard to the Order of Business is properly made on the Order of Business, if not at any other time.  However, the point did not arise because the other business on Thursday <Col N="396" /> occupied the day.  The Bill is now back here and I want to speak for some time about the consortium.</P>
    <P>It has been mentioned by Government speakers on a couple of occasions since the election&mdash;by Deputy O'Donoghue, as Minister for Economic Planning and Development on 4th October and by the Minister's Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn in reply to a question from Deputy Desmond two weeks ago.  But we did not get details of it until now. In order to put it in a political setting I must recall to the House some of the more conspicuous items in the Fianna Fáil election manifesto.  Under the heading &ldquo;Industry and Commerce&rdquo; in the first part of the manifesto and under the aspect of the pending disastrous unemployment situation unless stern and drastic action were taken the party made the following undertaking:</P>
    <P>State Agencies set up to help the various industrial activities will be given a new direction and sense of purpose by&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>I am quoting absolutely literally:</P>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;a Séan Lemass type Industrial Development Consortium.</P>
    <P>I hope I am not so petty as to begrudge the late Séan Lemass the credit he is entitled to for his achievements as Minister.  He does not require any eulogy from me; his devotion and, above all, his practical approach to problems, are well known.  At the same time, even the late Séan Lemass was not above making mistakes, and now that his name has been invoked in the context of the consortium I may remind the House that in 1950 he led the opposition of the entire Fianna Fáil Party to the first Industrial Development Authority Bill.  He described the Bill which set up this authority, to which Ireland owes the fact that we are not a potato Republic, as &ldquo;a typical product of the Fine Gael mind&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>If it was that, I am proud to repeat those words today, because if there was one development in the last generation which ensured that the decline in agricultural employment, <Col N="397" /> which was steeper here, perhaps, than in other parts of Western Europe, would to some extent at least be taken up by native industry.  The Industrial Development Authority ensured that. If there was one thing more than another which ensured that that would be so, it was the IDA, which sprang from the heart and brain of the party to which I belong and which was bitterly opposed by the Deputies opposite who trooped into the lobby against it in July, 1950, led by Éamon de Valera, seconded by Seán Lemass, who called it a product of the Fine Gael mind, and damned it up and down the country for as long and as hard as they could.  I am glad and proud that &ldquo;typical product of the Fine Gael mind&rdquo; has survived for 27 years the sneers and gibes of men who were not in their first youth when they said these things.</P>
    <P>Mr. Séan Lemass was no beardless fledgling when he damned the IDA, but was 50 years of age with 16 years of experience as a Minister behind him.  His view was that all that line of country was well looked after by the Department of Industry and Commerce, and that all that was necessary for Irish industrial development would take place in Kildare Street.  I do not take away from his achievements, but his performance on that occasion and in this context disqualifies him from being ranked as a standard, beyond dispute or argument, of excellence and wisdom.</P>
    <P>Having set the record straight in regard to the IDA, where it sprang from, who were its friends and enemies over the years, let me say in fairness to the memory of the late Taoiseach, I do not believe that he would have been seen dead with the twopenny-halfpenny outfit which this consortium threatens to be.  Although I do not dispute that this consortium may do some good, to dignify it, in the context of a revolutionary and radical weapon to combat unemployment, with the appending of the late Séan Lemass's name, is an insult to him which no one on this side of the House has been guilty of.  There is an element of sham and pretence about it which the late Séan Lemass would <Col N="398" /> have despised.  It is not a consortium at all.</P>
    <P>In case anybody in or outside the House does not know it, a consortium, in the ordinary usage of the English language, is a commercial venture in which several persons take part, share risks and pool resources.  There is not one iota of that element in the consortium being proposed.  The only reason it is being given this title of &ldquo;consortium&rdquo; is to make up in weight of words what it otherwise lacks in order to be put in the balance beside the National Development Corporation, which the Labour Party advocated, in and out of Government, and any similar enterprise of a large scale in which the people involved would actively create employment.</P>
    <P>From reading the Minister's speech and from the other clues that emerged in the party's manifesto and in other references since the election, one will see that this consortium is really a committee.  Committees have their use, but the public have learned that a committee is a way of giving an appearance of being preoccupied with something when nothing is being done. If the Minister is hoping that by christening this thing a &ldquo;consortium&rdquo; he will avoid that criticism, I can promise him that as long as I am here he is very much mistaken.  This is not a commercial consortium.  There is no contribution of moneys or anything else except time from the persons involved. They are not directly going into business; they are not directly empowered to spend money; they have no statutory basis; and, if I understand the Parliamentary Secretary correctly, they will have no authority basis.  The consortium has no power apart from whatever prestige its members may give it, which may be considerable.  I am not saying that it will have no utility.  It ought to have some utility if it is properly operated.  I do not damn it in the way that the late Séan Lemass damned the IDA before it got off the ground.  But if, as it appears, this is being held out to the people as a major weapon to combat unemployment, it is a sham and a fraud, like so much more of the manifesto.</P>
    <P>We can contrast this with the <Col N="399" /> National Development Corporation which Members of the Labour Party advocated during the course of the last Dáil and which was taken up by the party in general during the last election and with which my party in some degree at least agreed.  I have no ideological objection one way or the other to a National Development Corporation. I expressed views a couple of times about it which were intended to place a question mark over it, because unless I know what a corporation of this kind will do I cannot judge it.  To talk in grand terms about a National Development Corporation is fine, but are there genuine wealth producing economic activities still left undone here?  If the answer to that is &ldquo;yes&rdquo;, then why have they been left undone? Why has private enterprise not grappled with these major economic tasks?  If the answer is that these tasks are of such a dimension that they are too big for the private sector, that private capital, although considerable in some instances, is just not big enough to cope with the investment which work of that kind would require, then I freely concede the necessity for a National Development Corporation.</P>
    <P>But I have every objection to such a corporation if it will only make paper jobs, or go into unfair competition with private enterprise.  There is no doubt that a National Development Corporation run along the right lines, having identified tasks which are beyond private enterprise, and going about those tasks in the right way, as the ESB did in regard to the generation of electricity, as Bord na Móna did in the development of our bogs, would be an asset.  It is quite possible that in the offshore area in the future there may be jobs which are beyond private enterprise of a kind that can be mobilised here and it may be that a body such as a National Development Corporation would be the ideal body to deal with the exploitation of the wealth beneath the sea bed.  Such a development corporation would be producing visible jobs in a way of which the private sector would have been incapable.  To that extent it would be deserving of support.  But <Col N="400" /> this consortium does not and cannot create jobs.</P>
    <P>What it can do is co-ordinate activity, and to that extent I support it and will watch its progress sympathetically. As one person I consulted put it, it can avoid the unnecessary wrangling that sometimes goes on, it can short-circuit conflicts, it can cut a corner off a triangle, it can make sure that two conflicting strategies are not being applied simultaneously by two different bodies.  If it does that, it will justify its existence.  It will not be possible to quantify its success in that field in terms of jobs created.  The Government, to their credit, are not trying to pretend that unemployment is not a problem&mdash;it has been a big issue here over the last few years&mdash;but they are not doing much to solve it.  Perhaps it is beyond solution by a Government; but to the extent that this is admitted on all sides to be a problem, it is fair to say that whatever chance this consortium may have of easing relations between semi-State bodies involved in the direct creation of employment and in the indirect creation of employment it should have some effect.  I hope it will be successful and will justify its having been started.</P>
    <P>A Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy&mdash;although no doubt with a lot of other things on his mind&mdash;should be able to do that co-ordination himself.  When he foresees or hears of a conflict coming, or when he sees a knot being tangled up between two or three different agencies, he ought to be able by a few telephone calls to disentangle it.  Although I dislike the fraudulent name of this consortium&mdash;for the reasons I have given&mdash; I do not despair of their being able to do that job in so far as it smoothes industrial development and the problems arising, and in so far as it facilitates relationships between the IDA on the one side and Córas Tráchtála or the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards on the other.  Probably they will do a useful job in that respect.</P>
    <P>The Minister's words about it went somewhat further than mere co-ordination. If I may quote from <Col N="401" /> column 155 of the Official Report of 2nd November, 1977, he said:</P>
    <P>The remit of the consortium will include the following: (a) setting job creation targets and monitoring and reviewing industrial progress in general, with particular reference to job creation and job maintenance; (b) identification of obstacles to growth and suggesting solutions, and (c) co-ordination of activities of existing State agencies to maximise the contribution of these agencies to industrial development.</P>
    <P>I must tell the House that any views I have heard on this consortium have not been hostile ones at all.  Nevertheless they have all tended spontaneously to the view that the only worthwhile operation that can be expected of this consortium is one of a co-ordinating type.  The business of setting job targets and identifying obstacles can be undertaken by the Minister himself.  The obstacles to job creation or to industrial growth are known by several bodies here and do not require a committee to put them into some different form of words.</P>
    <P>Over and above that there is a certain degree of overlap here.  I do not mention this as a criticism of the consortium. But there does appear to be a certain degree of overlap between the first two of these three objectives and some of the duties of the National Economic and Social Council.  Incidentally, I note that a couple of the bodies which the Minister envisages for representation on this consortium are at present on the NESC.  This may be no harm, but it takes somewhat from what might appear to be the originality of the tasks set for this consortium.</P>
    <P>When the Minister comes to reply I daresay I will be asked why I did not make more specific observations on this consortium instead of merely putting it in a perspective unflattering to the Government party.  I make one specific criticism of it&mdash;I do not mean this in a particularly hostile way but I feel it is apt&mdash;it has one serious failing. I do not overlook the fact that it is described specifically as industrial. <Col N="402" /> Of course, it is being sold to the Dáil and to the people as the substitute for or the Fianna Fáil answer to the National Development Corporation which had achieved a certain amount of publicity and attracted a certain amount of attention when promulgated by the Labour Party.  There is one very conspicuous difference&mdash;apart even from the ones I have mentioned&mdash;between what might be a National Development Corporation on the one hand and, in the narrow sense, a purely industrial consortium.  It is this: that the former, obviously or potentially, includes agricultural and allied operations and the latter excludes them.  Any interpretation of words which would exclude agriculture from industry, except where the context necessitates it, would be idiotic.  But that the exclusion of agriculture is intended here is plain from the fact that no agricultural body is envisaged as being represented on this consortium.</P>
    <P>If the Minister has in mind that what we need is more and more industrial jobs, in the narrow sense, the production of transportable goods and so on, that is all right; I do not quarrel with it.  But what he has in mind is something which is supposed to be an answer to a larger plan of an all-embracing kind.  Then I say it has this evident effect: there is no representation, as far as the Minister's speech goes, from agriculture or any sector surrounding agriculture anywhere on it.</P>
    <P>The agricultural sector is one the job potential of which is constantly being pressed not only by the farmers themselves but by the Minister for Agriculture.  Every week I take up a paper and find that a farmer leader, an IFA leader, the Minister for Agriculture, somebody from the ICMSA or somebody from the general agricultural world is appealing to people not to think of job creation purely in terms of the service sector, or of transportable goods but rather to see the possibility for their creation in agriculture.  I know that is not the Minister's remit.  If he has been given this baby he will not want to be <Col N="403" /> bothered about agricultural operations.</P>
    <P>I have never set myself up as an expert on this, and I hope I do not show my ignorance too blatantly by embarking on the topic.  But the degree to which there are job opportunities there or openings, if the thing is properly organised, is evident virtually every week and most recently in an article in <i>The Irish Times</i> of 25th October from which it emerged&mdash;if the statements in it are true, which I assume them to be; they were made by the Chairman of the Sugar Company&mdash;that over half of the sugar beet processed in the Tuam factory comes from east of the Shannon, although of course beet produced west of the Shannon that much more may reduce the demand for it in the south.  The west is an area everyone regards as requiring special treatment; that is agreed on all sides of the House, though I am not exactly sure why. Therefore it is felt that money must be invested there at a higher level, incentives given at a higher level or of a kind that do not exist elsewhere in order to support the west.  Yet we find that the Tuam beet factory cannot supply its requirements of sugar beet from the western counties.</P>
    <P>Two weeks previously I read, from the leader of the IFA, that in the counties of Galway and Mayo alone there are ten million underdeveloped acres.  It seemed to me to be beyond belief, unless there was a misprint involved. Assuming that I am correct, or that he was correct and it was not a misprint, that is a figure which ought to stare any Minister of a Government anxious to tackle unemployment straight in the eye-ball.  The fact that the Tuam beet factory cannot get enough beet from the area around it and that therefore its costs increase and the possibilities of offering a good price for the product go down&mdash;this is necessitated by their having to haul their supplies from west Cork&mdash;and the fact that the two counties which surround the town of Tuam, Mayo just a few miles to the north of it, and Galway, contain ten million under-developed acres, those two factors must <Col N="404" /> stare a Government in the eye-ball if they are serious about combating unemployment; not only being serious about it but willing, as the Tánaiste and the Minister for Economic Planning and Development appeared to be warning us, to take dramatic action of a kind never experienced in the country before in order to put an end to it.</P>
    <P>I am waiting with a certain amount of excitement the budget in January until we see what drastic action of a kind never taken before will be offered this House.  Any Minister who says that is perfectly right.  I agree with the Tánaiste when he says that conventional methods of solving job problems and the conventional drib here and drab there, one little scheme this year and another little scheme next year, will not suffice.  He is perfectly right.  Even operations of a kind far more wide-ranging, ambitious, startling, experimental and possibly even doomed to failure will be necessary if we are to solve this problem permanently.</P>
    <P>When talking to the Stock Exchange on the 13th October the Tánaiste made a speech which I am sure he would not mind my calling remarkable in every other respect&mdash;much what one might expect to be given at a professional dinner&mdash;but he did have a couple of paragraphs I think were his own.  They deserved more attention than they got. He said:</P>
    <P>The success of the Government's programme is vital to the nation's future.  Indeed the next four years could well determine the kind of nation we are going to be for generations ahead.  Our approach to the economic challenges immediately ahead will determine whether Ireland becomes a thriving and progressive European state or a peripheral backwater relying on emigration and handouts from Brussels to solve its chronic social problems.</P>
    <P>He went on to say:</P>
    <P>The scope and objectives of past economic programmes would be quite inadequate today.</P>
    <P>In other words, the kind of operation we have been getting along with&mdash;and <Col N="405" /> great credit is due to those involved, such as the Industrial Development Authority&mdash;will not do anymore by itself.  He said:</P>
    <P>Policies aimed simply at &ldquo;keeping the show on the road&rdquo;, settling perhaps for minor improvements every year are no longer good enough.  What is needed is a radical assault on our economic shortcomings.</P>
    <P>It is in the context of that kind of cry of alarm&mdash;I do not think it is at all contemptible because it is called for and the Minister was right to utter it&mdash; I say that the facts relating to agriculture which I have just quoted must stare the Government in the eyeball and must call for an interference in our way of conducting the economy that goes beyond anything we have been able to absorb in the past.  Perhaps it goes beyond what people may conventionally think of as their private rights in regard to the management of their own affairs.</P>
    <P>I hope no one will accuse me of being a doctrinaire socialist&mdash;I am not &mdash;but I think any solution within the four corners of justice, humanity and fair play to the problems which all sides of the House agree are greater than they have been for 57 years should be tried.  Perhaps it should not be done nationally.  Let us experiment in one place for a limited time. Although I know it will not accord with the job expectations of many people, I would not be against an attempt to provide jobs in agriculture in the direct employment of the State by way of a massive land reclamation project of the kind James Dillon launched in 1948, but going far beyond that.  I cannot see why we should make schemes for tarmacadaming playgrounds, for fiddling around doing small jobs that end in a few months and that leave young people more depressed at the end of them. Why should we fiddle around with these jobs when the Shannon is there to be drained?</P>
    <P>We are not in a situation that is comparable to the other EEC countries.  The Belgians have an unemployment rate that is our league&mdash; perhaps not quite as bad&mdash;somewhere <Col N="406" /> around 8.7 per cent or 8.8 per cent. It is no use telling the Belgians to embark on a large-scale reclamation of their land&mdash;their chief natural resource&mdash;because every yard is already in use.  They have no real work to fall back on, because they are going their hardest as it is.  We are in a quite different situation, one that is unique in the EEC, in that we have tens of millions of acres in each of the provinces that are absolutely under-used. Even a &ldquo;jackeen&rdquo; who does not know one end of a spade from the other, but who travels from Dublin to Galway can see that.</P>
    <P>That will not be acceptable to those people who expected that a vote for Fianna Fáil meant a white collar job for their children.  It will not interest them or excite them, but if this Government are serious they will have to look at economic development in the way I have outlined.  They will have to look at the jobs that need to be done and at the available labour and they must match those two things.  If the Government are afraid to do that, if they are afraid to offend the parents of those who are looking for jobs by giving them anything except a white collar job, they will fail.  They will leave the next Government of whatever party with a job that is ten times harder, with a population that is ten times more restive and spoiled than was inherited by this Government.</P>
    <P>I have one more suggestion that I hope the Minister will not treat with scorn.  I am encouraged to make it because the Taoiseach and the Minister for Economic Planning and Development separately in the past six weeks have picked up a theme that I have often played on myself, namely, enlisting the active support of the people in groups that are small enough to preserve their sense of identity and neighbourliness and of mobilising the groups in some way in pursuit of the programme of ending unemployment and of giving ourselves at last a stable and prosperous country.</P>
    <P>On several occasions the Taoiseach and the Minister for Economic Planning and Development have been talking about co-operation and co-operatives. I have a suggestion for them.  I <Col N="407" /> put it forward as an experiment that may fail but if that happens we will know not to try it again.  I suggest they might identify some parts of the country where socially the ground might seem promising and then set up total co-operatives in these areas that might have an optimum population of 10,000 to 15,000 people.  They should feed into the co-operatives not money, because people are conditioned to look for money for everything, but rather they should give them advice.  They should send pioneer teams recruited from the semi-State agencies to the areas concerned and leave them there for a few years.  We could then see if the town or parish in question could be made after three or four years into a show place, with no emigration or unemployment, with no derelict buildings or under-developed land and where every natural resource is exploited to the full.</P>
    <P>We should try this experiment on a small scale; if it cannot be done on such a scale there is no use in talking about it on a large scale.  I emphasise that they should be total co-operatives, not just restricted to agriculture or to the conventional sectors where co-operatives have operated in the past. Alternatively, let the Government invite the people in a town or district to set up their own total co-operatives.  I realise that I may be stepping on a political minefield here, but the Government should free such co-operatives from all liability for stamp duty or taxation in the process of making them into companies.  In other words, the Government should clear the red tape and expense out of the way for that purpose.  I do not want this argument confused with the argument about the taxation of co-operatives.  When a co-operative becomes an enormous business with a turnover of many millions of pounds it is not in the same situation as the original co-operative, which represents the efforts of a small community trying to lift itself up by its boot straps.  Such a co-operative should be free of taxation.</P>
    <P>The Government should invite people to see if they can control their destinies and provide jobs for themselves within a community of 10,000 <Col N="408" /> or 15,000 people.  What I have suggested may be impracticable; but when I hear the Minister for Finance talking about radical means, about using methods that were never used before, I want to put forward my suggestion.  If the experiment fails I will not say anymore about it.  The help of the people should be enlisted.  In countries such as ours the political parties recklessly compete in issuing promises, all of them tending in the same direction, namely, to remove from the individual the burden that human life represents for everyone in some measure.  That is the big defect in a parliamentary democracy, though one that is far outweighed by its virtues&mdash;I have no misgivings in that regard.</P>
    <P>I am sorry, but I must accuse the party on the far side of this House of being by far the greatest sinners in this regard.  When Kevin O'Higgins lay dying he said of that party that they would &ldquo;play down to the people's weaknesses&rdquo;.  Not a word of reproach escaped him for his own death, or for anything else that happened.</P>
    <P>They have played down to the people's weaknesses.  That is what they have done non-stop for 50 years.  I am afraid that the consequences will be that the people will not be in a condition to help themselves and that the Government are not able to do so. Surely the Minister is not under the illusion that he and the Minister for Economic Planning and Development and other Ministers with economic remits are going to succeed in a country like this when countries with enormous accumulations of wealth, experience and legislative power of a kind which we have not got have failed, countries with deeper rooted industrial traditions. The best of luck to them&mdash;I do not believe in having a grovelling respect for the foreigner because we do too much of that&mdash;but surely it cannot be supposed that by virtue of supporting one party more than another we are going to get a result which the Belgians, Dutch and Germans have not been able to get.  The Germans are horrified at their unemployment figures and their inflation rate.  They have an inflation mania although their inflation rate is so low that it is something we have not had since the fifties.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="409" /> The defect in our democratic system is that the people are led to expect that more and more burdens will be taken from them, and that they will become less fit to help themselves. The problem we are talking about cannot be solved by governments.  I do not blame Fianna Fáil for not being able to solve the unemployment problem; but I do blame them for defrauding the people into believing that they can solve it.  The problem is beyond the wit of a Government, unless supported by strong self-reliant structures among the people.  That is something for which the Fianna Fáil Party are mainly responsible.  Down the years they have done their best to destroy such structures.  Whenever they have seen a man carrying a burden for himself they rushed in and said &ldquo;We will let you off that.  Vote for us and you will not have to pay car tax and rates.  Naturally, we will still provide the road for you to drive your car on and the services for which the rates formerly paid.&rdquo;  That is tomorrow's problem and will be dealt with in the manner in which the Minister for the Environment is dealing with problems &mdash;he thinks about them and hopes for a report that will see him through. That attitude is the chief enemy of economic development and everything else.  I believe that the Government have only one hope of solving the problem and that is by getting the people behind them, not politically, but to do it for themselves within the minimum framework in which such a thing is possible.</P>
    <P>If you look at the kinds of communities which the Taoiseach and the Minister for Economic Planning and Development had in mind and the kinds of things that go on in these communities, you will be amazed at the degree to which self-reliance and voluntary effort already exist.  During the summer I did a study to establish the degree to which localities differed in this regard.  I made a survey of some areas based on the existence of certain forms of co-operative initiative.  I opened a census of population at random today and noted the following towns.  The town of Athy in County Kildare has a credit union, a Macra <Col N="410" /> na Tuaithe guild, an Irish Country Women's Association guild, a local development association, and it has been a competitor for many years in the Tidy Towns Competition.  The town of Callan has all these things plus a co-operative society.  The towns of Birr, Ballinasloe, Athenry and Loughrea have all these things.  In addition to these six criteria of my own, which were arbitrarily chosen, there are innumerable ways in which people voluntarily co-operate.  I am only scratching the surface by mentioning these things.  There is Civil Defence, the Red Cross, St. John's Ambulance Brigade and the St. Vincent de Paul Society.  In every Irish town a great number of people are already engaged in trying to better their conditions.</P>
    <P>A Government intent on taking drastic action, or making a drastic experiment, ought to extend that experiment into seeing whether the same can be done on the economic plane as well.  I will not accuse Fianna Fáil of shedding their responsibilities if they attempt to do that.  If they make an honest attempt to enlist the people in manageable sized communities to form themselves into mechanisms of economic effort they may get somewhere. It may be a failure but I believe it would be worth while to attempt it.</P>
    <P>The Bill is one which this party welcomes. The Minister explained the Bill in his speech.  I am sorry I told the Minister that he had not mentioned the developing countries in his speech. He had referred to the developing countries but I missed his reference to them.  The important sections, apart from that one and the operation of section 5 which brings the functions of the authority under existing financial umbrellas, are 2 and 3.  The former is intended to provide capital for mergers and amalgamations of a kind which, had they taken place with this facility in the past, might have avoided some closures and redundancies.  A worthwhile provision in section 3 relates to the provision of capital for somebody who is not a businessman but has experience of a kind which makes his success a strong possibility, somebody who has <Col N="411" /> been an executive or an engineer in an existing business and who wants to start off on his own.  That is a positive move.  Generally, the Bill is overdue but welcome; and this party support it wholeheartedly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The Labour Party welcome the Bill.  It was circulated to us during the period of the last Dáil and we discussed it on several occasions with the previous Minister for Industry and Commerce.  I have some observations on the workings of the Bill as envisaged by the Minister.  If it is felt that the future operations of the IDA, as envisaged in the Bill, or the consortium announced by the Minister, will lead to full employment and economic recovery, that will be far from the case.</P>
      <P>I keep returning to a period when I think that serious political consideration was given to unemployment, that is in the mid-sixties, which was a period of economic growth.  During that period a report was issued on employment which was signed by many eminent persons in industry and trade unions.  They recorded at the end&mdash;and it is particularly apt to the operations of this House and the operations of our political parties in coming to grips with the question of unemployment&mdash; as follows:</P>
      <P>To harden the will and arouse the conscience of the community will require dynamic leadership and sustained backing from political and religious leaders, from trade unions, from employers' associations, and from all the other organisations and institutions which influence and form public opinion and public attitudes.  Without such leadership, particularly in the political field, the policies which will raise living standards and expand employment will not be chosen and implemented.</P>
      <P>That was said on the 1st January, 1967.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my ten years in this House I regret to say that I have not seen many instances where the kind of political leadership that is required <Col N="412" /> and the kind of sustained backing from national institutions and organisations have been forthcoming nor have I seen very much in terms of policies.  The IDA have done excellent work in the field of promotion in the past ten years, particularly in overseas promotion because they have been almost exclusively preoccupied in bringing overseas development here. Despite that work we still have a great deal of leeway to make up and I am not sure that this Government have much of an idea how to emerge successfully from the current economic recession.</P>
    <P>There is no indication as yet that the Government are using the economic recovery to create conditions of full employment.  I think the reverse has been proved, particularly in relation to the general election.  I do not see any planned approach by the Government.  I see a great deal of confusion.  I do not want to be unduly carping in the presence of one of the three top Ministers in the last Government, Deputy Tom O'Donnell, but there was a great deal of confusion in the last Government and there is even more in this Government.  After four months what have we got?</P>
    <P>Last week we got a consortium.  We got a Kevin Heffernan employment action team six or eight weeks ago. We also got a statement that there was to be an economic sub-committee of the Cabinet composed of the economic Ministers and presided over by the Tánaiste and we have a new Department of State, the Department of Economic Planning and Development, and a few other incidental committees have been established.</P>
    <P>That is very reminiscent of the panic stations which faced the last Government in mid-1974 when many of us said &ldquo;What do we do about the growing level of unemployment?  Do we proceed to set up a number of committees and do we bring forward a series of economic plans?&rdquo;  All we have had so far is that kind of <i>ad hoc</i> approach from this administration.</P>
    <P>Trying to look at the past four months as dispassionately as one possibly can.  I regret to say that there has not been so far any firm indication that <Col N="413" /> the <i>ad hoc</i> series of ineffectual measures introduced by the Fianna Fáil Party on the employment front are having any real long-term effects on employment or on the overall level of employment. We still have 106,000 unemployed.  I make that point strenuously to the Minister because he flogged it around the country earlier this year.</P>
    <P>We have the exercise where the Minister proposes to preside over a committee which will be composed of the permanent secretaries of two or three Departments, two or three Ministers and the chief executives of the four or five key State-sponsored bodies. They will bring forward the monitoring exercise, to use this glorious phrase.  The Tánaiste will preside over a subcommittee of the Cabinet.  We have the Taoiseach in splendid isolation. He has managed to maintain that almost charismatic atmosphere around him&mdash;he is above it all.  This aspect of his political culture has proved to be remarkably successful.  It has been accepted by the Irish people and if that is what they want, that is what they have.</P>
    <P>Now and again we have rather odd statements emanating from Ministers. For example only this week the Minister for Economic Planning and Development at a Chamber of Commerce dinner in Roscrea, threw in the towel by indicating that:</P>
    <P>It is the Government's aim, once an initial impetus is given to the growth process by increased public spending and our competitive edge on foreign markets is maintained or indeed, improved, that the private sector will once again take over as the primary agent of growth.</P>
    <P>That Minister has finally decided where his level of priority lies.  There we have the confusion.  We have one Minister dashing in at Ferenka.  He is suddenly withdrawn and in comes Deputy O'Malley, another Minister, because it is no longer appropriate that a Minister should say anything more since he was not very successful.</P>
    <P>I firmly believe that at a very critical period, when our scarce resources should be exclusively used to promote full economic recovery after the worst recession in Europe since the <Col N="414" /> thirties, money which should be used for industrial development is being squandered on alleviating rates, car tax, income tax and so on.  The unemployed are the customers in the supermarkets with no money to pay at the checkouts. As a ratepayer I have benefited to the tune of about £280.  I have had relief to the extent of about £90 on my car. I presume that as a married person with four children I will have substantial income tax reliefs next January and, as an employed person I am in receipt of a State allowance. I will gain from the largesse distributed and promised by the Fianna Fáil Party to the electorate last June.  What will the unemployed person gain?  There are still 106,000 people unemployed.</P>
    <P>As a person with a conscience in such matters, I would prefer if that money, which is so urgently needed for economic development, job maintenance and job creation, had been used for the maintenance and creation of full employment.  Now we are told by the Minister that already 5,000 new jobs have been created by the Fianna Fáil Party.  It never ceases to amaze me how we, politicians, can pick figures out of the air like that.  No such creation has taken place.  An extra 2,000 people are being taken on in the health service in 1977 and that is job creation.  That has being going on since mid-February, 1977, and the process was completed by mid-September, 1977.  We are told that an extra 400 are being taken on in the teaching profession.  Recently I asked the Minister for Education how many of those persons had been registered as unemployed and how many of them did not have employment prior to their taking up their jobs as teachers.  The Minister told me he did not know and that the people concerned had not been asked if they had ever registered at an employment exchange or if they had been unemployed.  That is the kind of situation that has developed.</P>
    <P>I have not much faith in the statement made by the Minister that 5,000 new jobs have been created.  I can see a situation in Irish industry in 1977 where there was, and still is, 15 to 20 per cent under capacity in many of our industrial plants.  The additional <Col N="415" /> buoyancy of the economy has meant that that under-capacity has been taken up but has not necessarily resulted in a substantial increase in general employment. The data available in relation to employment in the different sectors conclusively bears out that fact.  One must treat with a great deal of jaundice the statement made by the Minister that as a result of measures introduced by the Government 5,000 extra jobs will be created this year and something in the region of 20,000 extra jobs will be created next year.  Frankly, much as I would wish to believe it, I see no evidence of that situation coming about and I see no evidence that this is available to the country as a whole.</P>
    <P>I should like now to deal with the proposition put forward by the Minister in relation to the industrial consortium. I will then deal with other aspects of the Bill, particularly those aspects needing Government approval in relation to certain expenditure.  I was concerned at the announcement by the Minister of his summary dismissal of the proposal of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions that there should be a national development corporation established.  I would have thought that a restructuring proposal put forward by any responsible organisation deserved a little more detailed consideration. If the Minister, or any of his Cabinet colleagues, were so unconvinced about the merits of this proposition I would have thought that the normal consultative process would have been that they would have asked the ICTU to spell out how they envisaged such a corporation functioning.  I would have thought that the congress, the Opposition and those advocating such a corporation, would have been asked to define with some greater precision the precise functions of such a body, and they would have been asked how, for example, it would relate to the IDA.  I would have thought that the Minister would have asked the ICTU how precisely the corporation might generate new industrial employment.</P>
    <P>Those are questions any Minister would ask an organisation, particularly <Col N="416" /> when meeting representatives of it for the first time, but he did not do so.  I have an open mind as to the merits or demerits of this concept of a national development corporation.  I can see a certain role for that type of organisation but the Minister rather precipitously closed his mind on the issue simply because two or three people when drafting the Fianna Fáil manifesto said: &ldquo;Look, the other crowd are advocating a national development corporation and we had better have something instead of that, so we will have a national consortium.&rdquo; Who thought up the word I do not know or from what depths of think-tankism it came from I am not sure but, in any event, the word &ldquo;consor-tium&rdquo; emerged.  Of course, if one looks at the precise format and functions laid down by the Minister it is no more than a political contortion rather than a serious effort at implementing an election promise.  One can dismiss the announcement by observing that if this is an example of the dynamism which was contained in the Fianna Fáil manifesto one can view the future of industrial development here with some foreboding.</P>
    <P>I am amazed that the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy, a man I regard as being hard-headed, levelheaded, likely to fly off the handle now and again like us all, and a sensible Limerick man&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>He hates being praised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Praised or otherwise he is one of the hard-nosed members of the Cabinet and there is nothing wishy-washy about his approach.  He certainly briefs himself well but, as he knows, a normal part of his day-to-day function as a Minister is to keep in close touch with the heads of the various State-sponsored bodies.  He will be in touch regularly with the chief executives of the IDA, the IIRS, CTT and others.  I am sure he is in daily contact on occasions with a body such as Fóir Teo.  However, he now proposes that all these executives be put into a consortium, together with the permanent secretaries of a number of Departments and the economic Ministers, to comprise <Col N="417" /> the great new leap forward.  Frankly, the files of his Department would illustrate that there is regular contact with the State-sponsored bodies about the prospects and the direct promotion of industrial development and there is no need to elevate it overnight into something which is meaningless and has no reality in terms of creating new employment.</P>
      <P>It is obvious that when the Minister inserted this piece of window dressing he had no flesh and bones to put on the consortium for the electorate.  We must ask if the Fianna Fáil Party are serious about the proposed work.  After the first meeting of the permanent heads of the Departments, the Ministers involved and the chief executives of the State-sponsored bodies a photograph will appear in the newspapers and we will be told that the new consortium had met but about three months later the Tánaiste will say: &ldquo;I am not going to go along and disclose my confidential viewpoints on economic recovery to half a dozen permanent secretaries of other Departments nor am I going to be there, with another Minister in the chair, to be cross-examined by them. I am having nothing of this.&rdquo;  The Ministers would fade away and the Minister would be left in splendid isolation in the chair.  About six months later Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn will be in the chair and the Minister will have gone.  The secretary of the Department of Industry, Commerce and Energy will be presiding six months after that.  We know the way the system works and we need a consortium with executive functions in the role of job creation.  According to the Minister's nebulous phraseology this body will monitor and review the extent of job creation and attempt to co-ordinate.  That is all that is envisaged.  They will have nothing to do in the field of job creation.  On that basis I do not see the point in it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another complication in that the chief executives of State-sponsored bodies are normally obliged to keep the chairmen of their boards fully informed of their day-to-day work.  The Minister would have been better advised to have the chairmen <Col N="418" /> and the chief executives on this body so that he could consult with them. We have a situation where the Minister will consult with the chief executives, who, in turn, will consult with the chairmen of their boards and it is rather foolish to hold out a serious prospect of success for such a consortium. This exercise will not make a significant contribution towards industrial promotion and development.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect of the Bill which has to be taken very seriously by the House.  Sanction will be required from the Government in relation to a number of matters.  The Minister has said that under the terms of the Bill it will be necessary for the authority to seek his prior approval before taking a majority shareholding in any company.  That is the first point.  There is a limit of £1 million on the amount which the authority may expend without prior approval on the purchase or taking of shares in any particular body corporate.  That is the second constraint.  All the authority's financial incentives are subject to a maximum limit for each individual case which can be exceeded by Government approval.  These are the broad constraints.  I begin to wonder as to the desirability of that kind of approval.</P>
    <P>Let us suppose the IDA propose to spend £1.3 million in a particular industrial undertaking.  What happens? They write to the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy informing him that they propose to give a loan or a grant or take out a shareholding to the extent of £1.3 million. This amount being in excess of the limit, it must go before the Minister for approval.  Any of us who has had close contact with Government knows the process from there on.  We know that major issues of this nature inevitably become political issues and while there is nothing wrong with that very often the prospect of investment can suffer dramatically.  A political assessment has to be made and Cabinet criteria often depend on the muscle power of individual Ministers.  If the Minister is rather dubious about the merits of the investment he may be advised and may decide to bring the <Col N="419" /> matter before the Government.  Political and regional criteria and muscle power within the Cabinet will influence the decision and this is not the best way of deciding major State investment.</P>
    <P>It is not an attempt to usurp the executive powers of the Cabinet to suggest that there might be another tier removing such matters from formal Cabinet involvement.  Cabinets are political and may not judge an investment according to strict commercial criteria and I believe there is a need for a second tier to take an objective look at possible investments and assess them properly.  At this level one might see a national development corporation, measuring in an objective way investment of that magnitude. There is undoubtedly a case to be made.  If I were a senior executive in the IDA and I wanted to put £4 million into a plant in Limerick, I would be very worried to find that there was another plant in Drogheda looking for the same amount of money.  I would be worried about approaching the Cabinet because I doubt that strict commercial criteria would apply in the assessment of expenditure of that nature.  That is undesirable and could be inherently detrimental to the future prospects of industrial development.  The Minister should look at that kind of structure because it is a feature which in the long term will give rise to more and more trouble as industrial development proceeds.</P>
    <P>I strongly welcome the section authorising the IDA to commit themselves to the establishment of new overseas projects in the years ahead. That level of investment is to be welcomed and it is fair to say that many of our State-sponsored bodies have competed quite successfully throughout the world in seeking contracts on a strict commercial basis.  They have sent abroad a large number of Irish people to create employment and money for the State-sponsored bodies. Aer Lingus and the ESB are well-known examples and I have no doubt that other State-sponsored bodies, such as the IIRS and the IDA, will in time extend their involvement in overseas <Col N="420" /> projects.  This is to be welcomed and I am glad that the section gives this authorisation.  It also knocks on the head the continuous social attitude that we must perpetually look to the private enterprise sector if we are to have major growth in employment.  I am convinced that many of the semi-State bodies, if given full leeway in terms of commercial development, could create major segments of employment within their organisation and thus could make a great contribution to the employment position as a whole.</P>
    <P>I shall deal with a few other aspects of the Bill.  There is only one positive element in the Minister's contribution to the debate in terms of new thinking. and I feel sure that this is but a development of some previous thinking by his predecessor.  The Minister apparently sees the possibility of a restructuring which might entail the transfer of shareholdings acquired by the IDA and other bodies to a new entity.  I have held strongly that there is a need here, in view of the very substantial investment by the IDA and the Government of taxpayers' money in a wide range of industrial undertakings, to have that investment properly monitored and controlled on a centralised basis.  There is, therefore, a case to be made for the setting up of what one might call a State holding company for the different investments, ranging from £500,000 in some cases to £4 million.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to deal in any difficult way with individual companys, but we have enormous investment in Ferenka, in Asahi, in Cement Roadstone and others, all running into £4 million or £5 million apiece, and I do not think it is within the capacity of the IDA themselves to invest substantial sums of money and then to spend the next five or ten years monitoring that investment, ensuring that there is a full commercial return from those investments.  That is why I welcome the statement by the Minister that he is having a look at the role of Fóir Teoranta.  I think this sort of thinking will result in a more positive role for Fóir Teoranta.  It will mean that they could be transformed so that they could perform a better role in our economic development rather than <Col N="421" /> being perpetually associated with bankruptcy and impending disaster in individual companies.</P>
    <P>There are other major investments in addition to those I have mentioned. For instance, there is the major IDA investment in Semperit and in Cork there is a major investment in the chemical undertaking.  There are about eight or nine major companies in which there is State investment aggregating between £30 million and £40 million. It would be sensible to block these together and have a holding company in operation to ensure that the State will get a full commercial return from the money invested on behalf of the taxpayers.</P>
    <P>The Minister has indicated his hope that if the economic situation remains as buoyant as it is and if we do not have another bout of excessive inflation, there will be a substantial upturn in employment in the next 12 months. I am afraid that his statements and those of other Ministers are in dire need of co-ordination because I am worried at the contradictions which are becoming apparent even after four months.  I do not think it is possible to reconcile the job creation programme of the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy with the wage control programme of the Minister for Economic Planning and Development. Deputy O'Donoghue has been running around the country shouting his head off about a 5 per cent wage freeze, not a very good incentive in 1978 terms for Irish industrial workers from the point of view of growth.</P>
    <P>I suggest the Government should sober up and make up their minds about what they want next year from the point of view of inflation and wages, both elements being crucial to the work of the IDA and of industrial development generally.  I do not think there is a hope in hell of a 5 per cent wage increase being accepted in 1978. We had Deputy O'Donoghue telling us that there has been an increase in national output of something like 5 per cent this year.  Manufactured exports for the first nine months of this year have increased by 50 per cent in value terms, something we all welcome.  It is largely due to companies introduced here by the IDA. <Col N="422" /> We also have a situation where this year we will have an inflation rate of 14 per cent&mdash;at the very best we can hope it will be 12 per cent, possibly levelling off at 13½ per cent.</P>
    <P>Given these figures of a 5 per cent growth in output, a 13½ per cent increase in inflation, a very substantial increase in exports, renewed improvement in company profits in the second half of the year, with banking institutions reporting phenomenal increases in profits, I am worried that I do not see a great deal of that money going into industrial development.  I wish it did.  In that type of situation, unless there is remarkable restraint on the part of everybody I do not foresee the advocacy of a 5 per cent wage increase under a prospective national pay agreement being accepted.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister for Economic Planning and Development is the only member of the Government who has come out with this.  The Tánaiste has wisely kept quiet and so has the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy.  I hope the Minister for Labour, now that he has had his fingers burned in Ferenka, will be a little more astute when it comes to the pay agreement.  I hope he will not start flogging a 5 per cent national wage agreement.  It portrays an alarming degree of political naïvety on the part of the Government to tell the IDA to go to America and elsewhere and say to everyone there that there will be a 5 per cent national pay agreement here in 1978.  It would draw a horse laugh from every multi-national economist in America, having regard to what has happened to pay agreements here in recent years.</P>
    <P>More particularly I would make the point in regard to Fianna Fáil that, having created deliberately such massive expectations in the eyes of the electorate in order to gain power&mdash;telling them that they would have no more rates to pay, that there would be income tax relief to the extent of £180 million, that the cost of the social welfare stamp would be reduced by £1 and that there would be no more car tax to pay&mdash;there is no point in saying now: &ldquo;We are sorry, but all <Col N="423" /> you can be given by way of a national pay agreement is 5 per cent.&rdquo;  That is simply not on in terms of the strategy of Fianna Fáil for 1978.  It portrays, particularly on the part of the Minister for Economic Planning and Development, a degree of political naïvety which even surprises this Deputy from Dún Laoghaire.</P>
    <P>The Minister expressed concern about overseas investment here in the past two or three years.  He told us that the IDA estimate that in the four-year period 1977-80 overseas investment must provide about half of the new job approvals needed.  I welcome the strenuous efforts being made by the IDA in this regard.  During &ldquo;The Politics Programme&rdquo; on Friday last, Mr. Michael Killeen who is one of the finest chief executives we have in our State-sponsored bodies, forecast that at best their estimates are for about 12,500 jobs in 1978 and for the same number in 1979, provided that management keep their present job creation programme in full swing.  I find it difficult to believe at this moment that next year there will be created 6,000 or 7,000 jobs by way of overseas development here.  The current disputes, particularly the Ferenka dispute, have done enormous damage. The Ferenka dispute is continuing to do enormous damage in terms of the reaction of foreign companies to current inquiries and to current interest in the Irish scene.  We must have a fresh look at some of the happenings in that regard.</P>
    <P>Unwittingly we have allowed a situation to develop where we do not understand fully the system of industrial relations being imported by foreign companies, particularly the multinationals. We do not understand their supervisory systems in many instances. Neither do we understand their management control systems.  On the other hand many such companies do not understand the social tensions in Ireland or our tradition of industrial relations.  They have little concept of the way in which Irish people respond to strike situations.  Putting it in a broad sense, they have difficulty in assessing what we would regard as the <Col N="424" /> aspects or characteristics of Irish culture.  Therefore, there is a great need for the Minister, for the Government, for the IDA and also for the trade unions to attempt to bridge this gap. The present situation whereby there can be an outbreak overnight of internecine warfare in major industrial companies will not do anything for us in terms of future industrial development. That is why we must have a critical look at the situation.  This is a task particularly for the Department of Industry, Commerce and Energy in consultation with the IDA but bringing in also the trade unions.</P>
    <P>In this regard&mdash;and here I would be as critical of one of my predecessors as I would be of the current situation&mdash;I draw attention to the fact that there is no trade union representative on the board of the IDA.  That is not the responsibility of the previous Minister for the Gaeltacht who had definite views on how people should participate in these bodies.  I doubt if anybody put so much into consultations right down along the line as did Deputy O'Donnell.  But I am concerned that since the restructuring of the IDA there has not been a trade union representative on the board.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps not particularly but I shall leave it at that. It is germane, though, to the workings of that board that it be based as broadly as possible.  It is not satisfactory to have a State-sponsored body operating simply with three or four business people, two or three civil servants and a chief executive in the chair.  Something broader than that is required.  Perhaps some of the difficulties that have arisen out of the IDA operations, particularly in the industrial relations sphere, have arisen from the situation of there not being any representative of the ICTU on the board.  I shall leave it at that rather than to risk you, Sir, regarding me as being out of order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The final point I would make relates to the overall impact of the Bill. It is a Bill that will go a small part of the way in ensuring that the current <Col N="425" /> IDA programme is maintained.  I doubt, though, if all that good work will be sufficient to meet the need for providing full employment.  There is a need for between 23,000 and 28,000 jobs every year but we still have the problem of there being a substantial element of spare capacity in Irish industries ranging from 15 to 20 per cent.  The IDA target for the next four years is for the creation of 12,500 jobs each year.  After strenuous efforts by the IDA in 1976 employment increased by 5 per cent.  This year again, after strenuous efforts by the authority, employment is estimated to increase by 10,000 jobs.  This has required a heroic effort on the part of the IDA.</P>
    <P>We have raised employment by about 10,000 this year but that is a long way short of avoiding the explosive situation where in the next three or four years unless we produce the 23,000 to 28,000 jobs per annum we are going to run into the most serious political, social and economic difficulties.  Unless very radical new plans are prepared now our economy will not be able to absorb that social tension of continuing unemployment. We need the IDA to the power of two and not just a current programme of continuing to produce 12,500 jobs.</P>
    <P>In that regard we have to look further than the IDA, to the food producing industry for example.  I am appalled at the extent to which beef on the hoof still leaves this country because here there is great potential for employment. On the natural resources side there is great room for increased employment and we have not got to grips with starting employment in that area. Unless we have major increases in employment those who are now unemployed will suffer long-term unemployment. Only last weekend I met two young persons from my constituency. They are young men, twins, 21 years of age.  They live in Dún Laoghaire with their father and mother and two other children.  They have been unemployed for the past three years and they have reached the stage of personal, physical and mental depression.  They have not been able to get any job. They have no wish to emigrate and <Col N="426" /> they are prepared to take employment in any part of this country if they can obtain it.  They each have an honours leaving certificate.  If one were to drive through Dún Laoghaire, the area I represent, one would hardly believe that there are now 2,600 people on the local employment exchange.</P>
    <P>The planning process and the work we have to do has to go away beyond the contribution, substantial as it is, of the IDA if we are to get to grips with the employment situation.  We have to take a serious look at some of the cash-flow problems in our society.  I do not believe that our major banking groups are making the contribution to employment creation which they should be making.  There is a lot of money in this country lying idle at bank deposit level and bank profits level which could and should be channelled into productive capital formation and productive employment.  There is a great scandal in that regard and it is something we have to get to grips with.</P>
    <P>As a country and as a people we are not particularly entrepreneurially-conscious. It is easy for me to talk and if I were handed £150,000 tomorrow I might well be at my wits end to decide how I would invest it.  I excuse some of our more recent entrepreneurs but the question that arises as I look around the House is how many Irish politicians would be investing it in what I call productive employment-creating work?  Many people would proceed to buy a farm on the basis that they would have to pay virtually no tax, they would have a substantial income and solid guaranteed prices and would not have a lot to worry about. Would they put it in a speculative venture operation where they might lose their shirt as well?  Probably not. If you gave £150,000 to the average Irishman he would probably think of putting it into a pub or farm, something solid and definite.  If one gave £150,000 to the average industrial-oriented young person on the Continent he would probably have a sense of creative and innovative entrepreneurial activity whereby he would invest it in a business which would create employment.  There is a lack of business <Col N="427" /> consciousness in the Irish industrial climate.  Our current system of taxation does not provide a great incentive in that direction.  Too many people here if they have money decide to put it into an easy source of revenue and they are satisfied with that.  There is not a great sense of business dynamism to be found here. That is why in many respects we have been so dependent on foreign investment in this country.</P>
    <P>These are the main points I want to make.  I welcome the Bill.  It will be of great assistance to the IDA who have been waiting for the enactment of this legislation for the last 12 months.  In some respects some of the developments that the IDA are interested in have been held up awaiting this enactment.  For example, ever since the setting up of the IDA it has been Labour Party policy that the IDA should have power to take out majority holdings in individual companies. That policy was opposed by the late Deputy Gerry Sweetman.  He thought that this was the soft underbelly of socialism coming in to undermine Irish industry.  It was also opposed by the late Deputy Seán Lemass.  He believed in State investment but only to a certain level. Today the decks are clear and the IDA can invest and have majority shareholdings in companies.  There is a company in Carlow in which the IDA have a majority holding and nobody is worried about it.  We live in a mixed economy of public enterprise and private enterprise.  I am glad that a lot of the &ldquo;old hat&rdquo; ideological attitudes which destroyed a great deal of industrial investment here in the State-sponsored sector have gone and we are now going ahead on a more constructive basis.  For that reason I welcome the Bill and the work of the IDA and I hope that the Minister will quietly bury the consortium, or contortium if one might call it such, and that he will think up a structure which will be more sensible in meeting our needs for industrial development.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I also welcome this Bill and in doing so I congratulate the Minister and his Parliamentary Secretary <Col N="428" /> on their appointments and on the way in which they have gone about their business in giving priority to the task of job creation.  I also want to join with other Deputies in congratulating the IDA on their achievements over the years, particularly in attracting overseas investment in industry to this country and in developing small industries at home, a programme which has been increasing, expanding and developing in relation to our needs in recent years.  It is important to see this Bill in the perspective of our economic development and in relation to the stage we have reached.  Irish industry has been very highly protected for a great number of years and recently has had to face up to competition.  During the sixties it had, with the removal of tariff protection, to face up to competition and, of course, since 1970 with our entry into Europe and the almost total removal of tariff protection, we are seeing a changing scene for the industrialist and one that has become increasingly difficult for him.</P>
      <P>Foreign investment has in the past been of great importance in Ireland and has had a number of major benefits. The main benefit is immediate and substantial job creation.  Large foreign industries can, within a relatively short time, create a considerable number of jobs in this country and can very readily be seen to improve our industrial background.  Foreign industries, by and large, have a low added value.  The value which many of them add to our Irish components is relatively low and they are generally fairly highly dependent on imported raw materials although there are some exceptions to this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Foreign industries also have a low long-term commitment to this country. That is not to say that some of them would not, as individual companies, have a very long-term commitment but, by and large, their commitment to the country as a proportion to their total business is relatively low especially when compared with investments made by Irish nationals.  We find, if we look in contrast at the situation relating to investment by Irish nationals, that with certain exceptions the industries are very much smaller.  On the other hand, <Col N="429" /> the added value, especially where we are concerned with agriculture based industries, is very high.  Consequently, in my view, the net contribution to the economy is considerably higher. There is also with the Irish national investment a high personal commitment. This has not been particularly well quantified in the past.  During the difficult years recently it has been quite obvious that people with such a high personal commitment are very reluctant to let a factory, business or operation close down when the going is really tough.</P>
    <P>The job creation potential in relation to investment by Irish nationals is at this stage higher.  There is a tremendous unexploited job creation potential for Irish nationals at the moment.  It is our task to identify this, difficult and all as it may be, and concentrate on it.  We have identified in recent years our new Irish resources. Our manpower resources are very considerably expanded and improved when compared with ten or 15 years ago.  We have a good supply of new skills and technologies.  Our mineral and energy resources have, at least in part, been identified and recognised over the last decade.  Our agricultural sector, with the stability given by the European Economic Community and our involvement there, has expanded very considerably and now provides the basis for considerable investment in processing and servicing.</P>
    <P>There is need at the moment to reassess our investment strategies for growth in Irish industry.  The Bill before the House brings at least two major industrial incentives.  The first of these, the enterprise development programme is designed to encourage people with entrepreneurial qualities who lack capital.  This is a particularly valuable measure which will provide loan guarantees for working capital and interest subsidies for working capital plus the existing capital grants.</P>
    <P>Those measures could have a major effect on establishing new Irish industry, which is greatly needed at the moment.  Consequently, this is a very wise move on the Minister's and on the Government's part.  The Government want growth and an increased <Col N="430" /> contribution to exports.  Our home based industry can now provide a new impetus in this direction.  When we look at this aspect of the package we find that the package embodies capital grants which were already in existence, loan guarantees for working capital and interest subsidies both of which are new.</P>
    <P>Many of the young technologists very often find they have no equity to start out on the road to the development of a new business or enterprise. They have the skills, the energy and the ideas but they lack the initial equity to put their ideas into action. I suggest that in addition to the measures which the Minister has already taken he might consider setting up a venture capital fund to provide equity as a further aid.  I believe, contrary to what Deputy Desmond said, that the entrepreneurs are there.  I believe the young people have the skills, the energy and the ideas.  The only thing they lack is the equity to get the show on the road.</P>
    <P>I believe the State should set up a venture capital company and should invite the banks to participate in the equity.  I listened to Deputy Desmond saying that the banks are not making a significant contribution.  He said he cannot see the profits of the banks and other large companies going back into the economy.  He also said he does not believe that the banks are making sufficient contribution to the creation of employment.  He had no concrete proposals for such involvement by the banks.</P>
    <P>It is true that the banks recently declared very considerable profits.  The Bank of Ireland recently announced profits for the first six months of this year of £20 million and the Allied Irish Banks £16 million.  If invited, the banks might be interested to make such a contribution or to take such involvement in a venture capital fund. In part, this would be a social contribution by the banks who are and who must be interested in investment, in job creation, in growth in the economy, and in the success and development of our country.  We can hardly expect them to take the initiative in this instance.  The Minister might consider <Col N="431" /> taking such an initiative and inviting participation on their part.</P>
    <P>In thinking about a venture capital fund, I would be thinking of this fund providing all or most of the equity for approved projects.  We have in our institutions at present people who are very capable of deciding on the worth-while nature of different projects.  The element I have seen missing and which I see missing in present circumstances is the initial capital.  The venture capital fund might provide all or most of the equity and it might also allow the entrepreneur to buy back shares after a time, say after five years.</P>
    <P>For example, if 10,000 shares were provided from the venture capital fund, at the end of five years, the entrepreneur would have the right to buy back say, 5,000 of these shares at their par value, and possibly 5,000 at a commercial value.  Some system on this principle might be devised which would allow for the early take-off of people who have ideas.  The State and financial institutions would then generate newer high-risk businesses.  I am talking here about taking a little risk.  I have often been involved with both the Agricultural Credit Corporation and the IDA with small business people mainly or young people who wanted to get a venture under way.</P>
    <P>Generally the risk element is a little above the normal risk level and consequently it is not catered for under the present criteria.  In this way, both the State and the financial institutions would help to generate newer high-risk business.  They would also participate in the profits and automatically enable the fund to grow.  They could opt out once the business was established. They have the expertise to vest the new proposals.  They are well-informed and well-experienced.  This would mean a change in the criteria in relation to the risk which would be regarded as acceptable.</P>
    <P>The measures the Minister is taking are very worth while.  They will help these people.  The guarantees for working capital and the interest subsidies for working capital are both excellent measures.  I suggest a system such as this venture capital fund might be considered <Col N="432" /> as a means of getting many of these businesses off the ground.</P>
    <P>The second point to which I should like to refer is the programme for structural development.  I welcome the measure introduced by the Minister. We will find something of a parallel in the agricultural situation.  The grants for restructuring and amalgamating Irish industries will have a very important function.  I trust these grants will also apply to marketing co-operation and measures which are taken to combine the operations of different companies on a marketing basis.  I see a need for combined marketing in the present open-competitive situation.</P>
    <P>The small and medium sized industries have considerable opportunities overseas but these opportunities will not be realised without the proper marketing back-up.  They may receive advice from Córas Tráchtála.  Córas Tráchtála do an excellent job in this regard but, within the small and medium-sized industries, a marketing arm of their own is needed and this could possibly be achieved under the measures proposed by the Minister.</P>
    <P>I notice the Minister is proposing a development consortium.  The concept here of bringing together the expertise available in the different Departments to ensure that every effort is made to develop the big businesses as well as the small ones is very welcome.  I am very glad to see the Minister is taking this step.  I would suggest that, as part of this consortium approach, the Minister might look at the situation in large businesses generally.  These days some industries are too large and complex in their own technologies and in their capital requirements for our individual businesses.  Therefore, there is the danger that they may go by default.  The size of capital and the complexity of the technologies are too much for one industry on its own.</P>
    <P>In this regard, a consortium of engineering, construction, agricultural and chemical industries, in association with State participation, would be one way of ensuring that our major resources would be tackled and that the expertise which undoubtedly exists in the separate engineering, or construction, or agricultural, or chemical <Col N="433" /> industries, would be applied to the development of our resources.</P>
    <P>For instance, in dealing with oil, it is not possible for Roadstone, or Bord na Móna, or the ESB, or the Sugar Company, to have all the technology necessary and, yet, if we combine these organisations, if they combine in a consortium, with the encouragement and assistance and participation of the State we might have an effective means of developing our resources.  The smelter and the iron and steel foundries are very large undertakings and projects which bring together the technologies which exist in a variety of large-scale businesses. These businesses will have a part to play.  At present, they are too tied to what they call their own downstream activities and they are not in a position to apply themselves individually to the other opportunities which exist.</P>
    <P>The State wants growth.  The State wants access to the information which is available to such large-scale industries. It is our task to exploit these resources and opportunities in the interests of future generations of Irish school leavers.</P>
    <P>Concerning the major urban centres, and Dublin in particular, a feature of the last few years has been the large amount of unemployment in these areas.  The IDA have increased the grants in recent times and applied higher levels of grants to the urban and city areas.  I am particularly familiar with the north side of the city where there is extensive unemployment and where at the same time there are many skilled men and women both unemployed and under-employed, fitters, machinists and joiners; again in Irish industry there would be an increased need for skilled services, machine shops, electrical winding, spare parts, steel fabrication, handcrafts wool skills, metal skills, and even maintenance contracts.</P>
    <P>It is gratifying in this respect to see that the Minister is proposing to extend the small industry cluster concept in a nationwide programme, and I am surprised that Opposition Members have not welcomed this as a very positive measure in encouraging new industry.  It is particularly pleasing, in <Col N="434" /> view of what I was saying about the Dublin city situation, to see that the Minister plans to have a number of advance factories to foster small industries in Dublin city and county. The industrial estates are available in Dublin and there is great need for these advance facilities which can be used by the people who are there and who have the handcraft and machining skills.  Many of the young men and women coming with their technology from AnCO would be very glad to avail of such advance factory facilities.  I am a little disappointed that there is not one of these for the north side.  I am very glad that there are two planned, one in the Liberties and one at Marley Grange.  I would like to see an extension of this concept.  This could be of considerable value in present circumstances, because there are so many people who very often are developing their skills in some small back garden shed, who would be very happy to lease a space in such an advance factory and to develop on that basis.  I would like to see more of these advance factories in the Dublin area and particularly on the north side of the Liffey.</P>
    <P>There is a welcome increase in the grant to companies for research projects. The Minister proposes to increase from £15,000 to £50,000 the maximum grant per project.  At the same time, I am concerned to note that according to recent reports small industries are not using the State infrastructure for science and technology, while large industries are.  I refer to a report by Downey and Brennan of the analysis of small Irish industries relating to the identification of the sources of the initial ideas and technological supports for innovations. This study, which was undertaken in 65 Irish companies, over half, that is 43, of which were in the food sector, confirmed the overwhelming dominance of personal contact in technological transfer.  On page 36 of the report it says:</P>
    <P>The State research institutes are accredited with only 2 per cent of the initial ideas leading to industrial innovation.</P>
    <P>And none of the ideas is considered <Col N="435" /> to be derived from any work in universities.  I would like you to note that the report refers to small Irish industries, and I am talking here particularly about the situation in small Irish industries.  Only three of these industries have more than 250 employees, but I believe that these small Irish industries are the very industries which can make a major contribution to employment creation in the coming years.</P>
    <P>If you contrast this situation with that in agricultural production, and particularly in the dairy processing industry, you will find that the transferred technology and the uptake of ideas from research has been at a very high level, so there would seem to be something missing in the small industry sector which has not as yet been developed, whereas there has been reasonably successful development in the agricultural production sector, even dealing with the small industry sector and also, of course, with the large industry sector. Looking at the agricultural production section in contrast, you find that there is an advisory instructor in every county, that there is a liaison structure with An Foras Talúntais, which is the Agricultural Research Institute, and a liaison structure with the university.</P>
    <P>Because of this situation, I would propose to the Minister that he would set in train a close and urgent examination of the development transfer to small industries.  He might consider setting up liaison officers with the universities and research institutes, on the one hand, and the small business sector, on the other hand.  I recognise that this is not an easy task, but it has been done in the agricultural sector, and I believe we are at the stage when it could be done profitably in the industrial sector.  I would also suggest grants to encourage the secondment of research staff from the universities and institutes to industry, perhaps on an increased salary for the period of secondment. Measures to link more closely marketing information and strategies to the establishment of research priorities should also be considered. <Col N="436" /> A more immediate uptake of research and innovation is needed if the number of jobs is to be increased.</P>
    <P>I would like to add a word of congratulation to the Minister on the point he made in relation to Fóir Teo.  I see that he is considering the possibility of revamping Fóir Teo into a body which would not be associated with an impending bankruptcy.  This would be a very wise and useful measure.  I know of a number of industries which have been in difficulty recently, whose difficulty was short-term and which difficulty Fóir Teo would willingly have put right for them, except that the industries in question did not want it to go around the business sector that they were in discussions with Fóir Teo.  This certainly, in my experience, bears out the wisdom of the proposition the Minister makes here.  This would be very worth while because it would give Fóir Teo a much more positive role.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I should like to take this opportunity to congratulate the Minister on the new measures he is taking further to improve the work of this very valuable Industrial Development Authority.  I trust he will give some consideration to the points I have made.</P>

      <P>One tends to wonder at the extraordinary patience of successive Governments over the years with this particular issue.  It is an issue which has confronted every Government and, as I said, I am astonished at the continuing patience of successive Ministers in the Department of Industry and Commerce, mostly talented people of high intelligence, watching a progression of events which permits of only one interpretation in regard to the main employment-creating institution in the State, namely, the IDA.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was a member of the Government which started the IDA.  It was at that time an advance on simple dependence on the Department of Industry and Commerce.  Now I differ from others where the criteria of success of an institution of this kind are concerned. In its initial stages the concept was a tentative one but, as time went on, the IDA showed so many defects, and <Col N="437" /> continues to show so many defects, and shows also such abject failure in achieving what it was designed to achieve, that I simply cannot understand how speakers on both sides can come in here now and decline to criticise in the most severe terms the total failure of the IDA since 1950.</P>
    <P>The most striking indictment of the IDA was given in reply to a parliamentary question by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach today.  In the first quarter of 1972 the number engaged in industry was 204,400.  In the first quarter of 1977 the figure is the same.  How can any politician concerned with the high unemployment in every constituency, particularly unemployment in the 15 to 25 age group, fail to note the utter lack of achievement by the IDA since it was instituted?  The objective of all of us was full employment and I remember the late Seán Lemass, possibly the finest Minister for Industry and Commerce we ever had, saying they were prepared to be judged on their record in employment and he proposed to provide 100,000 new jobs and so on.</P>
    <P>The most grim aspect of unemployment is unemployment straight out of school on to the dole queue.  That is the most demoralising unemployment. That is a very grave social evil in our society today.  Young men and women see no prospect of being able to marry and rear a family in any kind of enjoyable existence.  This is due to the failure of the IDA.  I do not altogether blame the institution.  I blame successive Governments which condoned the failure down through the years and made no serious attempt to grapple with the unemployment situation.  The pattern has been for Ministers in successive Governments to hope that something will turn up and that the IDA will provide jobs.  Most Ministers who have been defeated at the polls have been defeated on the unemployment issue.  In my last canvass I found unemployment loomed large in the minds of the young people.  It was one of the three important issues which helped to defeat the Fianna Fáil Government in 1973.  It defeated the last Government.  It defeated Governments in the past.</P>
    <P>Today I listened to beautifully <Col N="438" /> phrased speeches, well integrated, but all with a sameness that was so disappointing. The sameness is significant. I was surprised Deputy Kelly did not refer to all this in greater detail because he was one of the people who, prior to the last election and during the campaign, made perceptive speeches about the state of the economy and unemployment.</P>
    <P>There was a perception of which, consciously or unconsciously, various Ministers and Governments have been singularly devoid.  They felt, I think, they could rely on one great escape hatch which would save them.  That was emigration&mdash;16,000, 18,000, 24,000, 40,000; each decennial period the figure went up, one million all told, or one in three having to go.  I do not wish to be bitter about it, but consciously or otherwise, the Ministers were satisfied that would solve the unemployment problem.  We have now reached a point where all that cosy kind of talk will have to end relatively quickly, short of a miracle, because the 16, 18, 24-year-old is a much different young person to the young person of my generation or before that.  He has been better educated in the technological colleges, academic institutions, secondary schools, community schools or wherever.  He has been told to expect much higher aspirations for himself and his prospective family. To use the old Victorian cliché, he has been educated well beyond what he had a right to expect by this kind of society but unless I am very much mistaken he will not go back to the kind of society in which I grew up when the majority were grossly underprivileged, as were our parents.</P>
    <P>When you talk of vandalism, wrecking of schools, kicking in of windows and so on, I believe you are seeing the beginning of what will happen in the next ten or 15 years unless some Government, some Minister, begins to understand that the scenario is all changed: it will not go on in the old way.  I was involved with many unemployed movements on the streets which invariably ended with the first 20 in the group being given jobs and that was the end of the movement. You would get letters from London, <Col N="439" /> the US and Australia saying: &ldquo;Keep up the good work; we had to get out of it with the wife and kids.&rdquo;  That is no longer so.  This is why I referred to Deputy Kelly's speech.  He was one of the first to draw attention to the fact that these youngsters are now imprisoned; they cannot get out; there is nowhere for them to go.  They must stay and they must&mdash;&ldquo;fight&rdquo; is the word I think most appropriate.  Kicking in windows and burning schools is only the beginning of it.  Do not blame them or start lecturing them.  In a society where there is full employment there is no difficulty in getting people to work; it is no good saying they are layabouts and are lazy.  They cannot get work.  They go to the labour exchange and there is no work for them &mdash;106,000 at a minimum.</P>
    <P>The figure given by the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, was over 150,000 or something like that.  The highest constant unemployment figure used be 8 per cent.  The highest new job creation figure is about 800 per year for over 50,000 people needing jobs, leaving the land, leaving school, or wishing to change their jobs with an increase in population.  Controlling the population will not even be considered and we are really building up to the greatest, single, social explosion, I should imagine, in the whole of Western Europe because of the completely intractable obstinacy of successive Government to face the reality that they have failed and failed and failed again on virtually every issue of policy including employment because employment is, of course, the great wealth creator; you cannot afford to keep 8 per cent, 11 per cent, 12 per cent, 15 per cent unemployed and have a sound, healthy economy.</P>
    <P>To some extent, the Minister for Health, Deputy Haughey, is correct when he says we cannot afford a proper health service.  You cannot afford properly to educate your children, to build houses, schools, colleges, universities, roads or communications.  None of these things have been done in the 50 years since the State was formed.  They are all grossly lacking; all operate at a much lower level than in the whole <Col N="440" /> of Western Europe with the exception of Spain and Portugal.  This is frightening to some extent but it only frightens me a little because over the years it has been exasperating to see a position building up where the Government would have to do something about it.  Then, the pre-revolutionary conditions for change which would insist on, demand and fight for change and get change were removed by £3 or £4 and the emigrant ship; they got a job in Liverpool and that was the end of it.  The great saviour was, in fact, John Bull.</P>
    <P>What reason has anybody to believe that the IDA will change structurally, become more efficient and more effective in its policies?  I was very interested today in listening to the Taoiseach and his questioners on the Fine Gael side regarding Ferenka. Ferenka can pull out any time they want to do so and take £12.8 million with them; Pfizers can take £7.2 million; Snia can take £6.6 million; Semperit, £4.4 million, altogether about £30 to £40 million invested in these enormous multinational companies, some Japanese, some British, some American.  Can anybody explain why a tiny, allegedly poverty-stricken country like this goes on handing out enormous sums to these people and consider that sound economic policy?  No wonder the taxation we have here is one of the highest in Western Europe with these enormously wealthy multi-national companies getting money from us while we continue to claim that we are a very poor country.  In the heel of the hunt we have this extraordinary figure which we got here today that the employment in the first quarter of 1972, five years ago, was the same as in the first quarter of this year.</P>
    <P>We are not even marking time.  We are going backwards.  This is the body that is to be entrusted with the greater part of the Government's policy for employment in the next ten extremely difficult years.  It is complete fantasy for the Government to think that they are going to deal with the problem of unemployment.  There are 5 million people unemployed in the EEC, including 2 million people under 25. We are a member of one of the most <Col N="441" /> inefficient, ineffectual and unjust organisations ever seen in the history of the world&mdash;the EEC.  It is solving virtually no problems, particularly problems of living standards, unemployment and prices, yet the leadership of our two main parties claimed all sorts of wonderful things for the EEC.  If this had been done deliberately, it could have been called a gigantic hoax on the part of the leadership of the two main parties because if they understood what it was all about they were being dishonest. It has lead to the present state of the highest level of unemployment we have ever known, Britain has ever known, Italy, France, and West Germany have ever known.  Everyone of these countries is in desperate straits as a result of this miraculous proposal of the EEC.  That is how it was sold to the unfortunate people and how this next mockery of a Parliament, the European Assembly will be sold as well.</P>
    <P>In their dealings with these companies the IDA have poured out enormous sums of money and we have condoned the whole process by our taxation policies.  We are told to spend this money in various ways, particularly in allowing for this idea of free depreciation.  Free depreciation is a very important principle.  It applies not only here but all over Europe and this is a subsidy to the company which replaces men to modernise and mechanise an industry. Of all the extraordinary policies for our society, a tax policy like this, where there is high unemployment figures and high labour reserves, is one of the most outrageous practised by us.  There is a general belief that throughout the whole of western Europe, the recent so-called recession, was used by companies to modernise and re-equip most of their industries because technological advances referred to by the previous Deputy have certainly changed the whole question of mechanisation, automation, and high production without the necessity for employees.  Men are an awful nuisance to the modern capitalist.  They tend to eat, drink, get married and have children and they need wages every week unlike <Col N="442" /> machines where one just presses a button and they work until they fall to pieces.  That is what is happening. A number of companies, Carrolls, Roadstone, Guinness and so on which are only chickenfeed in the whole story, were able to re-equip and displace workers.  They were able to reduce the number of people at work in the factories.  This is the whole process of mechanisation.  In a society where one is concerned only with making profit without being concerned to make wealth for the whole society it is easy for the tiny minority that control the wealth to do that. They do not need many people and these people are laid off.</P>
    <P>The grim truth about unemployment not only here but in western Europe is that it is permanent unemployment. The vast majority will not go back to work.  As things are in western Europe under monopoly capitalism there will never be full employment again in any of these countries because the machines will do the work and there is no arrangement for that sort of situation.  In a socialist society, a society concerned for people rather than profit there would be a seven day, six day, five day, four day, or three day week and a four day recreation period, entertainment and a civilised life.  There is no great virtue in most employment.  Instead of reducing overtime, weekend time, shift work and all that kind of thing, these people make enough in order to maintain their profits and they do not need to re-employ.</P>
    <P>The Minister must know that this is the situation he is facing and for which the IDA are certainly providing no answer.  They are preoccupied with capital intensive industries.  There is something to be said for what the Deputy who spoke before me said about small industries.  I do not agree with the back garden factory and so on.  I do not think that is what the Deputy had in mind.  The labour intensive industry is possibly what the Deputy had in mind and that is quite obviously the kind of industry with which we should concern ourselves. That is not the kind of industry with which the IDA have concerned themselves through the years.  What is the <Col N="443" /> Minister's projection on the question of employment?  The IDA have failed repeatedly in their projections as to the likely number of jobs which they will create.  In 1970-74, 70,000 jobs were approved, 58,000 jobs created, and that gave a shortfall of 12,000 jobs.  In that period there was a loss of 53,000 jobs and the total net increase in jobs for that period was 5,000.  Five thousand jobs were achieved with an outlay of £225 million.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Without that outlay the difference would be a good deal more substantial.  I cannot understand the Deputy attacking the IDA.  The employment problem would be a thousand times worse only for them, as the Deputy very well knows.</P>

      <P>I shall not repeat myself but, very briefly, what I said was: what are the criteria by which one judges success?  I want to look at any aspect of our society.  For instance, if one were to look at the Soviet Union 60th anniversary last evening and if one were to find that there was 10 per cent, 11 per cent or 12 per cent unemployment in that enormous country&mdash;or in any of the advanced socialist countries&mdash;and if there was this social deprivation in so many ways in education, in health, in care of old people, in housing, in access to third-level education&mdash;if all these things were demonstrably there would we not with justification say: &ldquo;This whole socialist idea simply does not work.  It is a flop&rdquo;?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to see there is an attempt being made in this Bill to take more equity.  This has not been the practice of the IDA.  They have simply accepted the general principle that prosperity for a society follows inevitably as a by-product of the pursuit of profit by a few entrepreneurs in any society.  This is demonstrably untrue; the whole of western Europe shows that.  What is the unemployment figure in the doyen of western capitalism, America?  It is something like 8 per cent, with enormous numbers of people living below the poverty level, <Col N="445" /> with terrible destitution, inadequate health services, inadequate educational services and gross privilege.  That is the doyen of western capitalism.  Each of the western capitalist countries faces the same position.  Is there any reason to doubt that if we continue at the present rate of uncontrolled addition to our population, taken with the absence of the escape hatch of employment, in ten years' time we will be at the level of some kind of backward South American Republic with enormous numbers of unemployed people and the State unable even to keep them at subsistence level?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what the Bill proposes to do something about and my case is that it will not do anything about it.  Because of its preoccupation with the IDA, with importing foreign capital&mdash;and this has been one of the strange enigmas of the whole of our political life here in the last 50 years&mdash; so much of the generation who fought to establish a free, independent nation have turned around and, like flies to a fly paper, have enticed all these foreign entrepreneurs from as far away as Japan, America and Sweden.  Of course Britain is back again&mdash;a new kind of imperialism&mdash;and the capitalist within our society has not had sufficient interest in it to invest his own money in his own country.  Is there any reason to believe that the revamped IDA which this claims to be&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an embellishment of the IDA.  I was interested in passing in Deputy Kelly's comments on the co-operative movement.  Indeed, I <Col N="446" /> was saying very flattering things about him while he was not here.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I share his beliefs in the co-operative movement.  However, as he knows, the co-operative movement was tried 50 years ago.  The great opposition to the co-operative movement was the shopkeeper and people with vested interest in seeing that it did not start.  But the broad principle of the co-operative movement surely was that the whole effort would be directed towards the welfare of those involved in it.  Therefore, that would mean a form of primitive socialism in so far as one would not be working to create profit for an individual but rather working to create a better society for a group of people who would get together and agree to do that.  I must give the Deputy full marks for that.  However, unfortunately that does not go far enough.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>That is great, I am delighted to hear it, but I have not seen much of it in the last 50 years when Fine Gael held office on a number of occasions.  The grim truth is that, by 1986, we will need between 370,000 and 420,000 new jobs.  Does anybody seriously suggest that the revamped or re-equipped IDA with their new <Col N="447" /> powers will be likely to provide those new jobs?  The 1973-77 IDA target was 55,000, pathetically inadequate in the circumstances of the needs of our society. The full employment Professor Brendan Walsh had in mind was simply a 4 per cent unemployment level with about 50,000 people unemployed.  We will need to cater for nearly 500,000 people by 1986 when we take the new population into account.  What kind of society will we have ten years hence if serious action is not taken?  I am not talking about this Bill because, obviously, it is not serious in its intent and does not change anything in a significant way.  What will we do?  Deputy Kelly was right when he warned us in his speeches of the kind of society we can expect if there are 250,000 unemployed people or even more?</P>
      <P>The IDA target is less than half what is needed.  Why do we go on professing any kind of faith or belief in an organisation such as the IDA? They are not doing the job they were intended to do, or are they?  They are given grants and they mis-spend most of the money.  What makes anyone think we will get to the requisite figure of employment that is needed? Will successive governments continue to demand from the worker a continuation of the sacrifices made by him in the various wage freezes in the past few years?  These wage freezes, with an increasing level of inflation unrelated to the demands of wage settlements and the rising cost of living, have necessitated a drop in the living standards of workers.  Will this be the process whereby control will be kept over our society, as happens at the moment?  The worker is told that if he takes a cut in his living standards by way of wage freezes&mdash;the latest is the 5 per cent wage freeze&mdash;he will enhance his position and we will have higher levels of employment.  One wage freeze after another in most western European countries, particularly Britain and Ireland, has not led to this situation.  There has been an increasing level of unemployment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The two banking groups, the Bank of Ireland and the AIB, have profits of £30 million for the first six months <Col N="448" /> of this year.  Why should these people be allowed such enormous profits? Why should the worker be asked to take a cut to improve the unemployment position?  A Deputy suggested that the banks might be invited to put this money back into the economy. Why not make the banks put the money towards improving the standard of living of the people who made the money for them?  Why not make them do it.  Why should they be treated differently?  Why should the worker be discriminated against in this way?</P>
    <P>As has been pointed out, the entrepreneurs, one after another, have announced successive increases in profits in the past two or three years. However, there has not been an increase in employment despite the increased profits and the result is that the worker is asked for more sacrifices. Why should one group not be permitted the same incentive, namely, the profit margin or increasing dividends on their outlay?  The worker's outlay is his job, his hands, his technique, his skill, his craft or profession. That is what he lays out.  If this is a private enterprise society&mdash;it is not a socialist society&mdash;why should there be a limit to his private enterprise, to his right to get what he can for the one possession he can sell, his labour? What is the rationale for that?  I have never been able to get it from anybody. Why should the banker be allowed unlimited return on his outlay while the labourer is not allowed the same thing?</P>
    <P>There is no reason whatever to believe that because there have been successive wage freezes we will have the kind of situation where jobs will be created.  As has been seen from the various CIO reports, it is the gross inefficiency of most managements and of most of the machinery and equipment in our private enterprise society that have been responsible for the high cost of goods produced here.  It has nothing to do with the rate of the job. If one man is digging a hill with a shovel and another is using a bulldozer, obviously the latter will do the job in a day or two but the man with the shovel may take all his life to do the job.  What must be questioned is the quality of management, the kind <Col N="449" /> of equipment used, the technology and the drive of management.  It is a gross over-simplification to say that there will be increased employment if we have wage freezes.  I do not know how governments have got away with it for so long with the trade union leadership.</P>
    <P>The IDA are irrelevant.  They are useless so far as any serious improvement or resolution of those problems is concerned.  I am not just talking about unemployment.  I am only interested in employment so far as it gives us the money to do what we want to do in matters relating to health, education, care for the aged, housing and so on.  That has not been done and all of us know it.  All of us have eyes to see.  <i>Si monumentum requiris, circumspice.</i>  There is failure on all sides.  We do not have to keep our eyes to the horizon of our own country; we can look north, south and west.  I will leave it at that.</P>

      <P>I did that a little earlier before the Minister came into the House, carefully because I was attacked very quickly.  We should dismiss the idea that the IDA can do the job on their record.  There should be a new national development corporation with various components and an industrial reorganisation division empowered to intervene directly in industrial companies and sectors, particularly in the two notoriously inefficient industries of textiles and footwear. There should be a State owned and controlled direct enterprise division.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Both sides of the House have been responsible for the <Col N="450" /> creation of magnificent State enterprises. Deputy Kelly mentioned the ESB and there is Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann.  There is a litany of them attributable to the other side such as Aer Lingus, Bord na Móna, Irish Steel Holdings and so on.  There are many examples of magnificent State enterprises that are wonderfully efficient.  For fear of anybody talking about CIE, I want to say that they are a social service and cannot, therefore, operate at a profit.  They must be a charge on the social service fund. I was a Member of the Government which took CIE into public ownership because of the complete failure of the private enterprise GSR company.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I said that as well, Deputy.  The important thing is that they are wonderful enterprises, marvellously run by ordinary citizens, by technicians, clerks and administrators. They are all people who have been turned out by our schools, technical colleges and universities and they run these enterprises extremely well with capital provided by us.  Unfortunately, they are not controlled by us at present.  Why do we turn our back on this marvellous example of what we can do ourselves?  We do not need the Americans or the Japanese to do these things for us.  We have shown that we can do these things for ourselves.  We are spending a large amount of capital through the IDA in getting the Japanese to do this thing very badly. Then Ferenka are threatening to withdraw if the unions do not behave themselves. We have no control over them. Why did we not extend the idea which was restricted by all our Governments to social amenities such as fuel and light and Morrison's famous gas and water socialism.  I did ask what was the criteria for success.  Is not every one of these a successful enterprise which would make any reasonable person say: &ldquo;If we are going to try to increase job opportunities in our society and see that the money we get is used for all the people rather than a minority, we <Col N="451" /> will use enterprises like Aer Lingus, Bord na Móna, the ESB and so on?&rdquo; I have never been able to get an explanation for this.</P>
      <P>A third part of the development corporation would be&mdash;and another great failure of the IDA is their unconcern for mineral resources&mdash;a national resources division which would be charged with the development of our natural resources, such as minerals, oil and gas.  The greatest scandal perpetrated by successive governments is that our great mineral deposits in Meath, Westmeath and Cavan are being shipped abroad.  This is the greatest scandal since the State was founded.  Not since Cecil Rhodes raped and pillaged Africa has anything as monstrous as the pillaging of our mineral resources by the various American and African companies been carried out.</P>

      <P>This is the first opportunity I have had to congratulate my constituency colleague on his appointment as Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy and to wish him well in his very onerous job.  Tá súil agam go n-éireoidh go hanmhaith leis.</P>
      <P>I intervene in this debate not with any desire to unduly prolong the discussion but because I feel this Bill is one which, apart from the specific measures contained in it, has major implications not merely for the Government but for every elected representative.  This Bill has major implications for the most difficult and serious problem confronting the nation, that is, the problem of creating full employment where we have an increasing labour force, an increasing population, a better educated labour force and where emigration has ceased. The magnitude of this problem should not be underestimated and the solution will not be found in academic debate or in petty political acrimonious discussion.</P>
      <P>For the first time in the history of this State we are confronted with the situation where we have to provide employment not just of any kind but of a variety and a range which will satisfy the job aspirations of the growing number of young people leaving our schools and educational institutions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill in its various provisions gives new powers and scope to the IDA to tackle the employment creation problem and to expedite the creation of employment.  I, and most members <Col N="453" /> of this House, irrespective of the party to which we belong, must recognise that since its establishment in the fifties as the major industrial employment creation agency, the IDA have done an excellent job.  From my 16 years' experience as a Member of this House I want to say I believe that the IDA and SFADCo, the agency of the IDA in my constituency, and more particularly in the light of my experience over the past four-and-a-half years as Minister for the Gaeltacht responsible for employment creation in those peripheral maritime regions, have done a good job within the terms of reference assigned to them.</P>
    <P>At this moment and in the immediate future, I believe the IDA have a major role to play in the generation of employment.  I reject the thesis and deplore the tendency of people, inside or outside this House, who very glibly, easily and unfairly attack semi-State bodies, and particularly the IDA.  I want to congratulate that company on the way they faced the challenge under the very difficult circumstances of the international economic recession which hit this country over the last four years.</P>
    <P>I am inclined to deplore the Minister's approach.  In his address he tended to denigrate by implication and, perhaps, through political motivation, the fact that the number of projects secured by the IDA in 1975 and 1976 was not as high in 1972 and 1973.  Very different circumstances existed, circumstances occasioned by the international economic recession which hit not merely this country but every country in the western world.</P>
    <P>If we want to be fair, we must compare the type of projects secured in 1975 and 1976.  In the mid-western region there are Syntex, Analog, Burlington Industries and a number of other high technology capital intensive industries which provide employment opportunities for highly skilled, highly trained personnel and for university graduates.  I compare them with some of the smaller and purely assembly industries established prior to that time and which, at the first adverse wind, went by the board.  In fairness we must analyse all this and not just <Col N="454" /> say there were X projects in 1972 and fewer than that number in 1976.  It is wrong for the Minister, as Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy, to come here playing petty politics with figures of this kind.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">

    <Speaker pid="ThomasGODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am referring to the fact that the Minister in his speech listed a number of projects secured by the IDA in 1975 and 1976 and said they were numerically much fewer than the number of projects secured in 1972.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>He did not make any reference to the kind of projects involved.  How many projects could be compared with Analog, Syntex or Burlington, by way of investment, technology and employment content?  To do a comparative analysis of the projects, one has to take into account the type of projects involved.</P>
      <P>I welcome any new authority, powers or provisions made to give the IDA more scope to accelerate the provision of industrial employment.  This Bill is a step in the right direction.  However, if we look at it against the background of the changed circumstances that have taken place since it was introduced last May by the previous Government, and when we compare it with the Fianna Fáil manifesto and with the simplistic and rather novel ideas put forward by this Minister when he was on this side of the House, one must express amazement at the total lack of new ideas displayed by him and by the Government in relation to assigning additional powers to the IDA.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann, in accordance with established precedents since the entry of Ireland into the European</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="455" /> Communities, approves the nominations of five members of the party or parties comprising the Government and five members of the party or parties comprising the Opposition, to be the delegates to the Assembly of the European Communities, pending the holding of Direct Elections to that body.</P>
    <P>Firstly, as is proper, I should like to thank the Taoiseach for responding to a request made by me last week to let us know the Government's intention with regard to the representation in the European Parliament.  The Taoiseach was courteous enough to inform me by letter that it was the intention of the Fianna Fáil Party, by virtue of their strength in this House, to take six of the ten allocated seats. That is the reason why I have submitted this motion to be debated by the House.  For the purpose of this debate it is desirable to look at the history of our membership of the EEC. The Labour Party were the only party in this House who during the EEC referendum campaign opposed our entry.  In doing so we fulfilled, in my view, an extremely valuable service to the country and to democracy.  In the course of that campaign we pointed out some of the undesirable aspects of entry into the EEC which the Fianna Fáil Party brushed aside but, unfortunately, many of the things we predicted then have come true, particularly with regard to the effect of entry on our industries and on prices.</P>
    <P>However, this party fully accepted the results of the referendum.  Without reservation we accepted the verdict of the people and since that referendum we have played a full and active role in the EEC at various levels.  We have played a constructive and worth-while role as far as Ireland's interests are concerned.  The reason behind the claim by Fianna Fáil to six of the ten seats is based on the fact that they have an overwhelming majority in this House.  There is no doubt that by force of lobby fodder they can claim those six seats.  By virtue of their majority of 20 in this House they can ensure that their <Col N="456" /> wishes are met in this respect but that is not the issue here.  The issue is whether or not it is fair, it is just and in the best interests of Ireland that our representation should be as they insist.  Surely they are the major considerations and the ones that Fianna Fáil should be taking into account, giving more thought to and giving more attention to rather than the Taoiseach, with a large number of hungry back benchers and anxious to give out as many positions as possible, taking six of the ten seats in the European Parliament.</P>
    <P>In his anxiety to meet the pressures on him in this respect the Taoiseach has failed to take into consideration the important points I mentioned in the interests of justice, democracy, fair play and in the interests of the country as a whole.  We find it somewhat strange that the claim to these seats is based on representation in the Oireachtas.  If one looks at the representation over the years since we became a member of the European Community and the percentage of the total representation in the Houses of the Oireachtas one finds a picture that can by no stretch of the imagiantion justify a claim to the six seats by the Taoiseach on behalf of the Fianna Fáil Party.  We entered the EEC in January, 1973, and the seats were allocated on the basis of party representation here.  The percentage representation of the Labour Party at that time was 10 per cent.  In fact, between the Dáil and Seanad, we had 21 members who were members of the Parliamentary Labour Party.  At present 24 Members of the House of the Oireachtas are members of the Parliamentary Labour Party.  Therefore, by some extraordinary attempt at mathematical gerrymandering we find that while we have 24 Members in the Houses of the Oireachtas our representation in the European Parliament is being cut by 50 per cent, from two members to one.  I cannot understand the calculations that led to that situation or how anybody can justify a proposal of that nature.</P>
    <P>To illustrate my point a little more and to point out the fair and equitable way our representation in <Col N="457" /> the European Parliament has been considered by successive Governments I should like to quote a few statistics even though I realise that statistics and percentages are boring and difficult to grasp.  When the first group went to the European Parliament from Ireland in January, 1973, Fianna Fáil, who had 50 per cent of the seats here, were given 50 per cent of the European Parliament representation while Fine Gael, who had 33 per cent of the seats, received 30 per cent representations in Europe.  The Labour Party, with 10 per cent of the seats here, got 20 per cent of the representation in Europe.  The second group from Ireland also went in 1973 because of the general election in February of that year.  There was a change of Government, Fianna Fáil went out and the National Coalition came in.  As a result of the change the percentages were as follows: Fianna Fáil, with 43 per cent of the representation in the Houses of the Oireachtas, were left with 50 per cent of the representation in the European Parliament; Fine Gael, with 39 per cent in the Houses of the Oireachtas, were left with 30 per cent representation in Europe while the Labour Party, who had increased their representation to 14 per cent, were left with 20 per cent of the representation in Europe, two seats.</P>
    <P>Between the election in February, 1973 and the dissolution of this House earlier this year, as a result of by-elections held for both Houses of the Oireachtas Fianna Fáil representation had dropped to 40 per cent and the representation of the Labour Party had risen to 17 per cent.  No one suggested that because there had been this drop of 10 per cent in the representation of Fianna Fáil in this House it would be fair or just or in the best interests of Ireland that a mathematical gerrymander should shift another seat from Fianna Fáil.  The precedent had been established that the Government side, irrespective of who was in Government, whether one party or a combination of parties, would have half of the representation in the European Parliament, pending direct elections, and the other side of the House, whether one or two parties comprised the Opposition, <Col N="458" /> would have half of the representation. That precedent was established and maintained by Fianna Fáil and maintained by the previous Government, despite the very sharp drop in Fianna Fáil representation in the Oireachtas between 1973 and 1977.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil now hold 54 per cent of the seats in both Houses.  Their representation in the Dáil is approximately 51 per cent of the vote.  They have a huge majority because of the way things worked out but their vote in this House is not in accordance with their claim to the European Parliament. If one looks, as they do in the European Parliament, at their percentage in both Houses one sees that it now stands at 54 per cent and they wish to claim six seats, 60 per cent.  If one wants to round up the figures one way or the other, they are a lot nearer 50 per cent than 60 per cent.  To show just how well the principle of the precedent was maintained, when the previous Government went out of office the total representation between Fine Gael and the Labour Party was 56 per cent.  We had 2 per cent more than Fianna Fáil now have and we did not at any time suggest or even discuss taking a seat away from Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <P>This proposal by the Taoiseach on behalf of Fianna Fáil is undoubtedly inspired by only one factor, the pressures upon the Taoiseach to feed the hungry backbenchers.  We have a Bill going through the House which will create Ministers of State.  I have no argument with that; an increase at that level is necessary and desirable in the interests of the country.  It has renewed pressures on the Taoiseach from the hungry backbenchers, that huge majority which he had publicly acknowledged is too big.  It is too big from his point of view because it increases the pressures upon him and the result of those pressures is this totally unfair and unjust attempt to deprive the Labour Party of their proper representation in the European Parliament.</P>
    <P>If one looks from the national point of view at the composition of the European Parliament, one realises that <Col N="459" /> it is composed of various political groupings who, according to their size, exercise influence upon the decisions of that Parliament.  The biggest and most effective political grouping is unquestionably the socialist group.  The Labour Party is the only party which has access to that group and is entitled to be a member and to be heard.  This matter affects not only the Labour Party.  In order to fend off pressures for appointments by some of his backbenchers, the Taoiseach is acting directly against the best interests of Ireland on very serious issues affecting the whole of our society.  We know from our experience at European level that deliberations within the political groupings can be decisive.  Let us face reality.  If we take a seat out of the socialist political grouping, where does it go?  With whom are Fianna Fáil connected at European level and how effective are they as a political grouping within the European Parliament?</P>
    <P>It is not my purpose to make any comment on any political grouping or party outside this nation but I pose that question and there are sufficient knowledgeable, intelligent people in this country to draw the right conclusion as to the effect of the proposed action by the Taoiseach on Ireland's position within the European Parliament. These issues are important from the point of view of Ireland's position within the Parliament and within the EEC in general.  The European Parliament although it has not the power that we would like, still has sufficient influence to enable the Commission and the Council of Ministers to take note of decisions made by the Parliament.</P>
    <P>Undoubtedly the decisions there are largely influenced by what happens within the socialist group.  By deliberate act of the Government, we are now proposing to have Ireland's representation in the most influential political group within the Community, and for what purpose?  It is to satisfy the personal ambition of some members of the Fianna Fáil Parliamentary Party. Dear God, it is a high price to ask Ireland to pay for the personal ambition of a Member of this House irrespective <Col N="460" /> of which party he may belong to.</P>
    <P>When I discussed putting this motion down it was rightly pointed out to me that Fianna Fáil had the numbers, the votes.  When the bell rings, some will go into this lobby and others into that, and by the will of the people, perhaps now regretted, Fianna Fáil will have a majority because the reality is that their majority in the House is bigger than the Labour Party's representation in the House.  In that way they can have six seats in the European Parliament.  They will trip into the lobbies, including the man who has put pressure on the Taoiseach to get them the six places, and they can impose this position not on the Labour Party but on the people.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach last week spoke in King's Inns on parliamentary democracy. He was eloquent, impressive.  I will quote from page 9 of his script, handed out by the GIS.  On the motion &ldquo;That so far Western Democracy has Failed&rdquo; he said this:</P>
    <P>One final word.  It is necessary, I think, to say something of what we do not mean by democracy.  I want to touch on this question now because it affects us all in this country.  Democracy does not mean the imposition of the will of the majority on the minority.</P>
    <P>I wonder how hollow those words sound now against the background of what is being proposed by Fianna Fáil tonight.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The Leader of the Labour Party had a bad brief and nothing he said in his presentation of it improved it from <Col N="461" /> any point of view.  It is rather remarkable that he should come in here after three or four months and hold the threat over the heads of the Fianna Fáil Government that if we are not careful there is sufficient knowledge among the people of the country to change the position.  He was re-echoing something that has been wallowing in his mind during the past four months.  I am sure he is appreciative of what can happen to the type of dictatorship that he endeavours to put across in this House through this motion.</P>
    <P>In his own way, Deputy Cluskey truly pinpointed the position.  He said, rightly or wrongly, but certainly rightly from the point of view of the votes of the people, that the Fianna Fáil majority is bigger than the full Labour Party representation in the House.  Deputy O'Connell threw in the gem that the Unionist Party have it too.  We have had Governments in and out, we have had a perfect working democracy, but now the democratic game has been turned to the extent that it does not suit the Labour Party and they ask us to change the rules.</P>

      <P>I am speaking to the amendment which deals in terms of representation on a proportional basis. We heard Deputy Cluskey claiming that a representation in the Oireachtas of 1.1536 per cent entitles the Labour Party to two seats.  He said that following the 1973 election Fianna Fáil had only 43 per cent but out of the graciousness of the Government's heart at that time they did not take from the five seats which Fianna Fáil had.  An article by Denis Coughlan in today's <i>Irish Times</i> stated that:</P>
      <P>Mr. Cluskey is expected to have the support of the Fine Gael Party when he opposes the proposed change on the grounds of precedent. The Labour leader will argue that because the party was given two seats in 1972, accounting for 20 per cent European Representation with a 10 per cent Oireachtas representation, it is entitled to hold those seats now that it has 12 per cent Oireachtas representation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1972, as Deputy Cluskey has acknowledged, the actual representation was very close to 50 per cent Government, 33 per cent Fine Gael and ten per cent Labour.  These are his figures.  At that time Fianna Fáil representation in both Houses amounted to 107 as against 97 combined Fine Gael and Labour representation.  At that time, too, the Fianna Fáil Government of the day considered that their majority of ten would not in any way justify their taking a 6:4 representation. It was extremely proper at that time with those figures that Fianna Fáil, out of the generosity of <Col N="463" /> their hearts, should present five seats to the Opposition.  The motion in the name of Deputy Cluskey refers to the establishing of precedent.  We have had only one experience of this type of thing before.  It is possible that on the figures available at that time the Fine Gael group might have claimed justifiably four of the five Opposition seats but there was no reason for the Government party of the day endeavouring to dictate to two parties who were extremely busy then getting together to put the Government party out of office.  To that extent they succeeded. It may be said that Fine Gael in an effort to court the Labour Party in regard to the formation of a Coalition parted with one of the seats to which they might have laid claim.</P>
    <P>That is why I am here tonight on behalf of the Minister for Foreign Affairs moving an amendment which does not attempt to spell out how the four remaining seats are to be distributed. In relation to proportion it appears to me justifiable that Fine Gael should have three seats and Labour one seat but we would not express openly any objection to the Opposition agreeing among themselves, as they did before, to share on a 50/50 basis.</P>

      <P>In that regard there will be no doubt as to the choice of the majority of Members of the Oireachtas. However, that is only a side issue.  In relation to the total number of seats we hold our entitlement in the European Parliament is to a 5.528 representation and not 5.4 as claimed by Deputy Cluskey.  On the same basis the Fine Gael representation is 2.932 while the Labour representation is 1.153.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="464" /> Deputy Cluskey has the audacity to come into the House backed up by six people whom he describes, but whom I do not wish to describe, as hungry men looking for another seat. The situation is that Deputy Cluskey realises he has a problem.  There are a number of people on the Labour benches who see no future for themselves in so far as reaching this side of the House is concerned.  Most of them are extremely anxious to try to carpetbag it to Europe.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>So the six people whom Fianna Fáil will be nominating may be regarded as carpetbaggers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. P. Lalor Mr. P. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not said that. Deputy Kavanagh represents the Labour Party in Europe at present. I sympathise fully with the Leader of the Labour Party in relation to the pressures that are on him regarding a replacement and in trying to clear the way and make the course for a number of his colleagues who are anxious to have their names added to the roll for Europe.  In the lambasting that Deputy Cluskey seemed to level at the Taoiseach and in which he was backed up by hungry frustrated backbenchers, all of whom are breathing down the back of his neck in their seeking for these nominations, the Deputy portrayed the problems that he is experiencing in relation to the selection of one man.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Only about two weeks ago Deputy Cluskey asked the Taoiseach when it was proposed to make representations to the House in connection with the European Assembly.  As far as I am concerned, so far as the nation and the Press are concerned, it has been taken for granted since the general election by ordinary average people that the representation in Europe would be as we have outlined.  However, Deputy Cluskey suggests otherwise.  The Taoiseach had indicated to the Deputy already by way of correspondence that it was our intention to take six seats but we saw no reason for tabling an amendment spelling out how the Opposition seats should be distributed. I noticed that the Leader of Fine Gael was very anxious to have this motion discussed this evening and so far as <Col N="465" /> I can see he supports the request for the change as outlined by Deputy Cluskey.</P>
    <P>We do not want to lay down in this House any prior arrangement for the Opposition.  We have no intention of dictating to the Opposition parties whom they should select or in what way they should divide the nominations. We on this side of the House are very satisfied that the five representatives whom we have had in the European Parliament over the last number of years have been extremely effective and successful and have done a great job.  They have never gone to Europe with cap in hand saying that we should lick Socialists or the Christian Democrats.  We have gone on our own&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Deputy Cluskey said that we are not properly represented with the socialist groups in Europe, that we might as well not be there at all and that they are the only hope we have.  That is exactly what the Labour Party spokesman said in June: &ldquo;Give your confidence to us over here, we are the only hope you have.&rdquo;  The people gave their answer.  The people despaired after four-and-a-half years. They were frustrated.  What else could they have done?</P>

      <P>I would like to draw attention to a very important point.  It would be no harm if the Leader of the Labour Party were to appreciate it.  We are going to have 15 seats following the next European election.  On the basis of 15 seats as a proportion of 208, Labour would still not be fully qualified for two seats.  I would give them two seats, but on that basis it would take 13.86 seats to qualify them for one European seat.  That means that they would need a little over 27 seats between both Houses to qualify them for two fully fledged seats in Europe.  Labour still would not measure up, but I have no doubt that the Taoiseach, following his normal run of generosity would play the ball.</P>
      <P>The Leader of the Labour Party criticised what he described as the misuse of the tremendous majority which Fianna Fáil have in this House in so far as we have a capacity to steamroll anything through.  There is something familiar about that.  I remember opposing things from the other side of the House and I talked about steamrolling, but subsequent to that we got this tremendous volume of support from the people.  The Government and the Fianna Fáil Party would be letting the country down if we did not accept the confidence that the people are giving us and send six out of ten representatives to Europe.</P>

      <P>I am talking specifically about our entitlement which is something the people gave us.  The major difference between Fianna Fáil in Government and the Coalition in Government is that we know how to carry our responsibility and we do not misuse it.  Deputy Cluskey asked why Fianna Fáil should get 60 per cent for 54 per cent of the seats.  I will forgive him the little miscalculation.</P>

Let me <Col N="467" /> reply by saying that surely to goodness it is more justifiable to give six seats for 55 plus of the vote than two seats for 1.1 per cent of the vote.  There is no justification at all for the case that has been put tonight by the Leader of the Labour Party.  Perhaps he was rushed and did not expect that the Taoiseach would be so generous in giving him time tonight that he asked for today to put his case.</P>

      <P>We have listened to the case presented by Deputy Cluskey, if case we can call it, for the retention of two seats.  This is a late conversion for the man who said three months before he discovered that there was a semblance of a chance: &ldquo;Maybe we can soft-soap the Taoiseach and ask him if we can have two seats&rdquo;, and has overlooked it until now.  The Fianna Fáil Party in Government are doing the right thing in seeing that the <Col N="468" /> people are properly represented in Europe, and the most proper way our people can be represented in Europe is by sending six Fianna Fáil nominees and four from the collective Opposition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to support the motion introduced by the leader of the Labour Party, Deputy Cluskey.  I do so on behalf of my party because there is a very important principle involved here.  If we had the same speech from the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach at the start of the selection of members of the European Parliament I could see some justification for the speech he has just made but at this stage within six months of direct elections there is no justification for it.</P>
      <P>I want to put the record straight, first of all, in relation to a few points. The Parliamentary Secretary mentioned a vacancy in the European Parliament. I take it that he meant an Irish delegate who lost his seat in the general election.  I want to remind him that that vacancy has not arisen yet because for six months after a member loses his seat he is a fully fledged member of the European Parliament. I do not think therefore that there is any case to be made that the Leader of the Labour Party has not nominated a member to fill a vacancy which has not arisen.</P>
      <P>I also want to refer to the point made by the Leader of the Labour Party about the representation of the Labour members in their political group in Europe.  I have had four years' experience in the European Parliament and have had experience of how all its institutions work.  I have seen the importance of members in a political group, the larger the more important it is to have influence. While we have had two members of the Labour Party members of the Socialist group in the European Parliament it still is important I believe that members there, representing the interests of the people of the country, use their influence with that political group because it is a large group.  I have seen examples of where it was done effectively.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The group of which I with my two <Col N="469" /> Fine Gael colleagues have the honour to belong, the Christian Democrats, was at one stage the largest party. Since the British Labour Party joined the Socialist group in Europe that then became the largest political unit there. It was also important then that the Fine Gael members use their influence with the Christian Democrat group to influence decisions that were ultimately taken in the European Parliament. It is very important that this continues if we are to achieve results. Despite what the Parliamentary Secretary has said there are 17 members in the group to which his party belong in Europe, the Gaullists or National Progressive Democrats.  If they influence the entire group to support any matter which arises in the European Parliament it will not have an overall result because the group is too small.</P>
    <P>I can see a serious situation arising if the amendment is carried and if the Taoiseach appoints six Members of the Fianna Fáil Party to the European Parliament because the representation in the Socialist group will be reduced by half to one member.  That is a very serious situation.  The Taoiseach should decide tonight that it is only six months until direct elections, which we are now preparing for and we have a Bill going through the House which will set the machinery in motion to give the people the opportunity to elect their representatives to the European Parliament.  They will decide ultimately that it would be small mindedness as far as the Fianna Fáil Party are concerned if six months prior to the people selecting their members to the European Parliament they grabbed a seat.</P>
    <P>We have heard the two last speakers accusing one another of having their backbenchers eager for power and breathing down their Leaders' necks for jobs.  As far as I am concerned I have had discussions with the Leader of my party.  I have now been elected Chief Whip of my party and I find it is no longer possible to continue in Europe after being a representative there for four years.  I find that even dual membership of the European Parliament and the National Parliament is just not on.  I appeal to the <Col N="470" /> Taoiseach tonight to say &ldquo;We will not make a change.&rdquo;  We have heard quite a lot of lip service from the Fianna Fáil Party in or out of power about the voice of the minority.  We have heard it loud and clear on many occasions in connection with the minority in another part of this island. The Labour Party are in a minority. The Parliamentary Secretary made the case that the people have spoken and have given their decision and elected Fianna Fáil to a position where they were never so strong.  I believe they are dangerously strong.  The people elected them to that position but the people have not yet elected anybody to the European Parliament.</P>
    <P>It is the European Parliament and representation from this country that we are discussing here tonight in Private Members' Time.  I support the case put forward by the Leader of the Labour Party that no change should take place between now and the direct elections when the people will decide. When one contrasts the Taoiseach's attitude and that of the Fianna Fáil Party tonight in seeking six Members and that of the attitude of the Coalition during their term of office we find the Fianna Fáil Party in the House had 43 per cent and held 50 per cent of the seats.  No Leader of the Government or any of the political parties said: &ldquo;Because we have more members and because we are entitled to more we should grab a seat.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is not the way to work in the European Parliament.  When I spoke on the European Elections Bill I said that it is necessary that the members who go forward from this country to the European Parliament co-operate and co-ordinate their efforts, to seek the maximum benefit for our people. The attitude adopted tonight by the Parliamentary Secretary and the Fianna Fáil Party does not lend itself to that type of joint approach I was talking about.  It is important from the national point of view that no change takes place.  I believe the people will be very concerned at the arrogant attitude of the Leader of the Government. I did not expect that from him. Perhaps there is a difficulty because recently we discussed a Bill in the House to appoint ten new Ministers <Col N="471" /> of State.  There are eager beavers in the backbenchers of the Fianna Fáil Party who are anxious for jobs and for power.  The extra members he had in the European Parliament to replace the people appointed Ministers would not be enough to quell the desires of those backbenchers.  He should be strong enough to say now that there should be no change in the representation from this Parliament to speak on behalf of the people in the Parliament of Europe.</P>

      <P>The Labour Party would be far happier this evening and would be doing far more productive work for the nation if we had the opportunity of debating the motion we had down in Private Members' Time relating to the mentally handicapped. Unfortunately, we had no option this evening but to move the particular motion we were obliged to place on the Order Paper because we have the imminent appointment by the Taoiseach of Members to the European Parliament to replace Deputies Lenihan and Gibbons who are now Ministers.  Since the Taoiseach has intimated this the Labour Party had no option but to respond.</P>
      <P>We expected a little more from the Taoiseach than this approach.  Apparently he does not intend to have the good grace to allow a former member of this House, David Thornley, to see out his term of office to 5th January next.  He proposes to grant that seat to Fianna Fáil also on the basis that that party have an Oireachtas majority.  I regret that.  Deputy Creed, Deputy Lalor and I are the three party Whips and we have excellent relations. I would regret anything which would in any way affect those cordial relations. Irrespective of the vote on this matter, we will have to work with one another for the next four years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach had this famous magnanimous saying that, when you were in power and when you had your majority, you walked softly.  In the past four years, when the National Coalition Government decided to take positions of power, I got into the height of trouble because I objected.  I felt <Col N="472" /> there were many occasions when we were not particularly magnanimous.</P>

      <P>If the Deputy would listen for a moment.  I plead guilty, but there is one area where, to our credit, when we had the opportunity time and time again of putting a motion through the House and taking six seats in the European Parliament, we did not do so.  When Deputy Noel Lemass died&mdash;a respected Member of this House&mdash;Deputy Halligan won the seat and the Coalition's majority increased.  In the Donegal by-election Deputy Keaveney took a seat from Fianna Fáil and Fianna Fáil's membership of the House went down again.  When the Fine Gael Party won the seat in Monaghan, Fianna Fáil's membership of the House dropped again.  We reached the stage where, in the two Houses of the Oireachtas, Fianna Fáil had no more than about 40 per cent of the total representation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>When I had Dáil questions on the Order Paper in <Col N="473" /> 1972 I remember discussing this point with no less a person than the former Minister for Foreign Affairs, Dr. Hillery.  It was suggested that the best way of appointing members of the European Parliament was by mutual consensus and agreement between the leaders of the parties for the duration of the Parliament, pending direct elections.  Even then there was talk about direct elections.  If the former Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Lenihan, were in the House he would agree with me.</P>
      <P>We do not often share confidences, but I understand he is aghast at this proposition.  We know perfectly well that the only reason this is being done is that, as the Taoiseach has said, he has a majority of about ten too many. He said that publicly and he said it privately.  His party must find jobs for 60 back benchers and, therefore, he proposes to give in to the pressure, on him.  On this occasion the Taoiseach is not walking softly.  One would expect something from some politicians and particularly those who claim to be so charismatic that they are above it all.</P>
      <P>We are not sending individuals to the European Parliament to represent the Fianna Fáil Party, the Fine Gael Party, or the Labour Party.  We are sending them to represent the Republic of Ireland.  When we send such persons abroad, it is desirable that, bearing in mind the political differences, they should be a team. They will be ten among several hundreds and they should co-operate on such things as a common fisheries policy.  We have seen Deputy Kavanagh co-operating with Deputy Gibbons and very often assisting the Fianna Fáil Party in the past two or three years.  I did not notice any conspicious and outstanding performance on that occasion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While it is true that the Treaty of Rome says the representation should reflect the relevant strengths of the parties, it is also true that, in many of the Parliaments of Europe, the total aggregate vote of one party is the deciding factor.  The total aggregate vote of the Fianna Fáil Party in the last general election was slightly over <Col N="474" /> 50 per cent and would not warrant taking 60 per cent of the seats.</P>
    <P>It is a matter of regret that the Fianna Fáil Party will not abide by the agreement reached early in 1973. The political fortunes of that party changed substantially during that period and we did not move to take over the majority of our representation in the European Parliament at that time.  It is a matter of some amusement that the Fianna Fáil Party will be sending six Irish people to join that rather weird assortment of European parliamentarians&mdash;and we had better get the name right&mdash;the National Progressive Democrats of Europe for Progress.  I think that is the name they are known under now because they changed their name recently.</P>

      <P>It is a pity we have not got a good cartoonist on our official staff in Dáil Éireann because he could produce some quite good cartoons for a Christmas edition of <i>Dublin Opinion.</i>  The reaction of the other groups in the European Parliament, I am quite certain, will be one of hilarity.  I have never been able to understand why the Fianna Fáil Party aligned themselves in this manner with a group who voted against them on common agricultural policy issues, who have done contortions on fishery issues and who are now proposing to enlarge this group; even if they do enlarge it it will not make any major contribution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There have been continued references by the Fianna Fáil Party to power-sharing in Northern Ireland.  In all the parties, whether it is in Ballymena or in Dáil Éireann, we are hyprocritical <Col N="475" /> when it comes to grabbing the spoils of office.</P>

      <P>I speak for myself. I suffered greatly in my party when I opposed it, and I have no regrets for the opposition I expressed. There were a few occasions when my party acted in an entirely honourable manner in that regard, and in relation to the European Parliament we have acted honourably.  Deputy Cluskey, as the new Leader of the Labour Party, has put forward a coherent point of view.  However, if you want to have power you must be magnanimous enough to share it, and in going into the European Parliament the best way is not just representing the Fianna Fáil manifesto, or the Labour Party policy documents or Fine Gael's <i>Just Society</i> but representing the national interest on a 50-50 basis.  I am surprised that the Taoiseach has not come here tonight to defend his decision.  It is not the decision of the Parliamentary Secretary or of the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  The person who decides the size of the bread basket in the Fianna Fáil Party and which crumb goes to which Deputy is the Taoiseach, and nobody is more powerful.  He should at least have the gumption to come here and defend his own decision.</P>

In conclusion, let me say that in 1977 the Fianna Fáil Party, got 811,000 votes&mdash;it did very well in the election&mdash; and the Labour Party got 191,000 votes.  Now the Fianna Fáil Party get six seats and we get one.  By all the criteria of selection we should be permitted to retain our two seats, and no ill-will should be generated in the initial stages of this Dáil.  This would not have broken the hearts of the members of that party or the pockets of the Deputies who are looking for a few quid between now and the time of the European Parliamentary elections and who want to chase off to Europe.  Some of those who were expressing great interest in Europe would have difficulty in finding the aeroplane to Amsterdam not to mind going to Strasbourg.  The Fianna Fáil Party would be far better off to let things lie until next October when there will be elections.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and the floor show given by the Leader of the Labour Party, Deputy Cluskey.  At one stage I thought he was about to cry and I was going to send him over a box of <Col N="477" /> handkerchiefs.  Obviously, his backbenchers are putting pressure on him and he spends an hour and a half here crying in the wilderness, talking about jobs for the boys, talking about what he feels not to be correct, when we all remember the type of democracy that was operated over the last four years by the National Coalition Government in which he himself took part, in regard to appointments for the highest posts down to the lowest, the last straw being that, after they had been hammered in the general election, the then Taoiseach nominated four or five Senators to the Seanad in order to give them a bigger percentage.  This motion, therefore, is nothing less than a sham and a disgrace.</P>
      <P>There was a very important motion which we all thought was coming before the House this evening, namely, on the mentally handicapped situation. It amazed me that the Opposition should waste the time of the House crying here because the people decided against the National Coalition, and suggesting to us that we are not democratic.  It was the democratic will of the people that Fianna Fáil got 84 seats and that Fianna Fáil are in a majority in the Seanad.  As the Parliamentary Secretary pointed out a few minutes ago, it is also the democratic will of the people that we should have six seats in the European Parliament. The Fianna Fáil Party are as much entitled to belong to the European Progressive Democratic Group as the so-called socialists of the Labour Party in this House are entitled to belong to the extreme reds-under-the-bed group in Europe.</P>
      <P>To say the country is missing out because one or two of the Labour Party are not in Europe is beyond my understanding.  We all know&mdash;it has been acknowledged in the newspapers &mdash;that Fianna Fáil have been sound, solid, loyal and strong and Deputy Desmond underlined that a moment ago when he said Deputy Kavanagh helped them.  That is the way to do things.  To decry them because they are part of a unit that does not wave flags or try to grab power is an unworthy exercise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fianna Fáil have a good national <Col N="478" /> reputation abroad and they will continue to earn that reputation.  I do not understand the argument that because they are not members of some massive European group they should not be there.  To me the Socialists are a peculiar group and I often wonder why Deputy Dan Spring and Deputy &ldquo;Going-up-the-stairs now&rdquo; associate with them.</P>

      <P>In the last election people realised the representatives they had some of those representatives are in the Seanad now and some are nowhere.  One would have thought the Labour Party had learned a lesson in democracy after the election.  It is my belief that Fianna Fáil should have got two more marginal seats in the election.  The Labour Party got four or five too many with the help of Fine Gael.  Let them get together now upstairs come to a decision between themselves and stop wasting valuable time here.  Let them arrange the distribution between them outside the Chamber and let there be an end to the waffle and the waste of time.</P>
      <P>The Labour Party are fighting for something to which they are not entitled, to which they were never entitled and, if they go on as they are, to which they will never be entitled. Let them accept the facts.  They are back to normality now.  This is nothing more than job seeking.  I suppose they got used to the &ldquo;jobs for the boys&rdquo; in the Coalition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is not the kind of motion we should be debating.  We should be discussing a motion of major importance to mentally handicapped children, a motion that was set aside because the Labour Party did not get a couple of jobs they thought they were entitled to, but they must face the bitter reality now.  In the last four years any job from minding a door to some of the <Col N="479" /> highest positions in the land were filled by the National Coalition with their own appointees.  Whether they were socialists, or left, or right I could not tell you.</P>

      <P>All I am saying is that we are wasting time and if the Labour Party had any conscience they would withdraw the motion.  They should have a grasp of political realities. The indication was quite clear three or four months back but they <Col N="480" /> still do not seem to understand what happened.  The audacity of their coming in here this evening wasting the time of the House.  Oddly enough, I think the Parliamentary Secretary was quite correct when he said the Leader of the Labour Party was reflecting the problems he had in deciding which representative to send to Europe.  Now he would solve the problem by sending two and he hoped the Fianna Fáil Government and party would help him to resolve the problem.  My advice to the Labour Party is to get together with the Fine Gael Party and resolve the problem amongst themselves.  Is it that the days of the shotgun wedding are over?</P>

      <P>I have made inquiries from the Eastern Health Board regarding the case referred to by the Deputy.  It does not seem that there was delay in dealing with the case.  The application was made on 14th October, 1977.  Following a report from the community welfare officer as to eligibility on income grounds, arrangements were made for <Col N="371" /> medical examination with a view to confirming eligibility on medical grounds.  This examination took place on 3rd November, 1977.  The report of the examining officer will be made available to the board without delay.  If eligibility for payment of the allowance is confirmed, it will be paid from the date on which the completed application form was received by the board.</P>

      <P>The number of patients in psychiatric hospitals in the country on 31st December, 1976, was 14,473.  Approximately one third of these patients were aged 65 years and over.  The future plans for these hospitals involve the upgrading of suitable sections of the hospitals for the continuing care of long-stay patients and the discarding as soon as the fall in patient numbers permits, of those sections which are considered unsuitable.  A continuing decline in the number of patients in these hospitals is being achieved through the further development of rehabilitation and out-patient services and the transfer to general hospitals of acute treatment facilities.</P>

      <P>There is no accurate figure available as to the number of persons in the State known to be suffering from asthma or allied allergies.  About 7,500 persons are admitted to hospital each year with asthma, bronchitis and emphysema.  These would in general be the more acute cases and the total number suffering from these conditions in varying degrees of severity is probably much greater than this.</P>

      <P>The promotion of sergeants in the normal course is a matter for the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána and I am not involved.  The Garda Síochána (Promotion) Regulations, however, provide that a sergeant in the Detective Branch who, by reason of his not having passed the promotion examinations, is not eligible for promotion in the ordinary way may nevertheless be promoted subject to the approval of the Minister for Justice if the Commissioner is satisfied that he has given consistently meritorious service in the Detective Branch and has shown special zeal and ability in the performance of his duties.  This procedure was intended to cater for very exceptional cases. The Commissioner has sought my approval for the promotion of a number of sergeants pursuant to the provision in the regulations I have referred to and I am considering the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. G. Fitzgerald)</NameTxt>
      <P>The conditions to be met before an organisation qualifies for a trade union negotiation licence are set out in the Trade Union Act, 1941, as amended by the Trade Union Act, 1971.</P>
      <P>The original conditions governing the granting of a trade union negotiation licence are set out in section 7 (1) of the Trade Union Act, 1941.  This section provides that&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;No body of persons shall be granted or hold a negotiation licence unless it is a body (in this Act referred to as an authorised trade union) which fulfils the following conditions, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(a)  that either it is registered under the Trade Union Acts, 1871 to 1935, or, if not so registered, it is a trade union under the law of another country and its headquarters control is situated in the country, and</P>
      <P>(b)  that it has deposited and, subject to the provisions of this Act keeps deposited with the High Court the appropriate sum&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The &ldquo;appropriate sum&rdquo;, is set out in the Schedule to the Act.  The minimum deposit required was £1,000.</P>
      <P>The Trade Union Act, 1971, imposed more stringent conditions for the granting of a negotiation licence.  Section 2 (1) of the 1971 Act provides that, unless it already holds a licence under the 1941 Act, a trade union shall not be granted a negotiation licence unless, in addition to meeting the condition of section 7 (1) (a) of the 1941 Act, it also fulfils the following conditions:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(a)  that, not less than eighteen months before the date of the application for the negotiation licence it&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i)  notifies the Minister, the Congress and any trade union, of which any members of the body are members, of its intention to make the application,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="387" /> (ii)  causes to be published in at least one daily newspaper published in the State in the prescribed form (within the meaning of the Act of 1941) of its intention to make the application, and</P>
    <P>(iii)  deposited and kept deposited with the High Court the appropriate sum, and</P>
    <P>(b)  that it shows to the satisfaction of the Minister that, both at a date not less than eighteen months before the date of the application for the negotiation licence and at the date of that application, it had not less than 500 members resident in the State.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The &ldquo;appropriate sum&rdquo;, referred to above is set out in the Schedule to the Act.  The minimum deposit is now £5,000.</P>
    <P>Section 3 of the Trade Union Act, 1971, provides that a registered trade <Col N="388" /> union, which has deposited and keeps deposited with the High Court the appropriate sum but otherwise does not fulfil a condition specified in section 2 of the Act, may apply to the High Court for a declaration that the granting of a negotiation licence to it would not be against the public interest.  In the event of the High Court making such a declaration, the Minister for Labour must grant the licence.</P>
    <P>Section 2 (2) provides that the conditions governing the granting of a negotiation licence do not apply in the case of a trade union which is formed mainly out of an amalgamation of existing trade unions who were licence holders.</P>
    <P>The membership indicated for each trade union relates to the year in respect of which the last triennial return of membership, required of licence holders under section 15 (1) of the Trade Union Act of 1941 was furnished.</P>
