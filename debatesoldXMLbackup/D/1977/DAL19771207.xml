I am asking for documentation which would allow the House to have a more full and informed discussion on the whole affair to be made available to Deputies.  It was announced last evening by the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy that a written offer was given to him, as a Member of the Government, by the parent firm of Ferenka on 23rd November last.  If the full text&mdash;parts of which were quoted by the Minister in the discussion last evening&mdash;was made available to the House it would allow the House to have a more informed and beneficial discussion for the remainder of the debate.</P>

    <Title>Agricultural Credit Bill, 1977: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Broadly speaking, I have nothing but welcome for this Bill in that it is a consolidating measure, bringing all the law on the subject together in one statute and simultaneously bringing it up-to-date.  It is welcome also in that it facilitates the operations of the Agricultural Credit Corporation, which has been a very successful body and has contributed magnificently to Irish agriculture, the expansion of which has been most remarkable in recent years.  A particularly important aspect of the corporation's operations has been the very substantial amount of money they have been able to obtain on deposit from ordinary Irish investors placing their confidence in Irish agriculture by investing in the Agricultural Credit Corporation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a few points on which I should like the Minister to comment in his reply.  First of all, there is the question of the control of the chief officer's salary; the possibility that while it is controlled by statute the salary of other officers of the corporation <Col N="841" /> are not so controlled, that a difficulty could arise in that subordinate officers&mdash;as a result of the provisions of section 19&mdash;could find themselves being paid more than their chief which obviously would be undesirable.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to comment on the possibility of introducing, in addition to the credit facilities which are made available, a guarantee in some cases by the Government on loans taken out by farmers.  I understand that approximately 10 per cent of loans available to farmers in Holland from agricultural credit banks are guaranteed by the Government. That is to make up for the fact that 10 per cent of the farmers in that country do not have sufficient collateral to act as security for loans, loans which would otherwise be desirable on all other grounds.  In this country, with the high level of owner-occupancy of land, that problem is not as acute.  But we are trying to encourage here the development of long-term leasing of land in which the farmer would not necessarily own the land he was working but would have a viable and substantial farming operation as the lessor of those lands.  Therefore, he could not offer the land, which is owned by somebody else, as security for a loan.  Indeed, he may not have very substantial numbers of chattels which he could mortgage either.  If we are anxious to develop long-term leasing of land&mdash; and this is something that has been canvassed strongly in an inter-departmental committee report on land policy published in July&mdash;there may be a case for giving some form of guarantee on loans taken out by such farmers where it would appear that the security they can themselves offer would not be sufficient to meet the requirements of banking institutions for the extension of loans to them.</P>
    <P>There is another point to which the Minister might give some attention.  I refer to the provisions of the Agricultural Co-operatives Debenture Act, 1934.  That Act provides that a floating charge cannot be imposed by a bank on a co-op without the consent of, I think, the Minister for Finance. That can, however, be done in the case of a loan granted to the co-op by <Col N="842" /> the ACC.  In other words, co-ops giving floating charges as security for loans obtained can only obtain such loans from the ACC unless they wish to seek the consent of the Minister.  It is a difficult thing to obtain from an administrative point of view but not, perhaps, from a policy point of view. I would ask the Minister to take a look at the provisions of the 1934 Act in this respect.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Colley) George Colley">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Colley)</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Deputy mean to remove the restriction in regard to grants or to remove the consent?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>That would be the appropriate thing to do but naturally I would not wish to be dogmatic about it because there may be other reasons why this restriction is necessary.  I am sure the Minister will agree that the situation of co-ops has changed considerably since 1934.  Many of them are now very large institutions and one could afford to allow them to take greater risks in the matter of the liabilities they might undertake.  In 1934 the movement was in its infancy and the confidence of farmers in respect of co-ops was much harder to obtain and therefore a greater degree of conservatism in the type of financial operation co-ops would be allowed to undertake would have been more appropriate then than it is today.</P>
      <P>There is one very minor point in respect of the wording of the Bill.  In section 3 there is a list of the matters covered within the compass of the term &ldquo;agriculture&rdquo;.  Cereal production or tillage in general do not seem to be specifically included.  I am sure that has not caused a problem so far. If it did we would have heard about it.  However, for the sake of clarity there is, perhaps, need to include these.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The rates of interest charged by the ACC are slightly higher, between 1½ and 2 per cent, than the rates charged by the commercial banks.  It is well recognised the ACC has more favourable terms to offer to farmers in certain respects and it is well recognised by farmers that the ACC, with offices throughout the country and specialist <Col N="843" /> knowledge to offer, is very sympathetic in its approach, but rates of interest are rates of interest and repayments are repayments and there are possibly grounds for seeking to bring interest rates down.  This may lie behind the case made so very ably yesterday by Deputy D'Arcy for allowing the ACC to get into a full banking operation. Quite clearly the ACC could possibly make profits from that point of view on their operations and those profits would enable them to charge lower interest rates to their long-term borrowers equivalent to the rates being given by the banks.  There may be other factors involved.  I just comment on the position.</P>
    <P>I understand it is considered by some that the provisions in relation to chattel mortgages are too severe and I would ask the Minister to have another look at these between now and Committee Stage to see if all the provisions in their full stringency are necessary or if we are, perhaps, playing extra safe, safer than is necessary.</P>
    <P>With regard to the general availability of credit to farmers, the commercial banks have adopted a system of seeking to get farmers on to term loans where all liabilities have to be cleared by a particular day before a new loan will be issued.  Now that is not appropriate to agriculture.  Farming is a continuing operation, certainly livestock farming and milk production, and farmers are not likely to be in a position to extinguish long-term loans on a particular date each year or every three years.  Liquidity will always be required and that liquidity calls for capital over a period, a longer period than the period offered for term loans. I understand the operation of this term loan system is causing considerable problems for certain farmers and I think overdrafts rather than term loans are more appropriate to farming.  That is the system adopted by the banks in Britain.  Why, I wonder, do our banks place such faith in the term loan system? Is it possible they hope farmers will stick to their repayments on the term loan rather than extinguish it if they are in credit thereby finding themselves with possible outstanding <Col N="844" /> payments to be made on the term loan from the point of view of interest rates while, at the same time, they may be in surplus in their deposit accounts and the banks are therefore making a tidy profit from the farmer's unwillingness or his uncertainty resulting in his failure to extinguish the money due on the term loan? There may be a number of other reasons, possibly very worthy ones, the banks would advance for this system but I think this is something the Minister should look at in his overall responsibility for credit generally and his responsibility for the Central Bank.  Is this practice of encouraging term loans desirable?</P>
    <P>Generally speaking, I welcome the Bill.  Any Bill which makes the expansion of agriculture through borrowing easier is very welcome.  The long-term opportunities for agriculture are very considerable.  We are a low cost producer of most commodities because of the temperate nature of our climate and in a competitive situation we can beat Europe.  Credit is obviously necessary to do this and so the Bill and the operations of the ACC are to be commended.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): Like previous speakers, I welcome this Bill.  It is a consolidation Bill with the amendments set out in the Long Title introduced to update legislation which has been on the Statute Book for more than 50 years. Since this session of the Dáil began, this is the third occasion on which we have had legislation amending Bills introduced in the late twenties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill deals with the Agricultural Credit Corporation Bill, 1927. Earlier we had the Minister for Justice introducing a Bill to modernise Garda Síochána regulations introduced in legislative form in the late twenties. The Minister for Health introduced a Bill in this session to modernise the machinery for dealing with the medical profession, and it is not so long ago since we had a Bill extending the capital of the ESB.  This series of Bills and other legislation always remind me of the trojan work done by the young Government that took over the running of the country more than 50 years ago, and on an occasion like this <Col N="845" /> it would be ungracious of us, in 1977, when consolidating legislation introduced in 1927, if we did not place on record our appreciation of the work done in those days by that Government.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that the ACC have rendered great service to the agricultural community.  Fortunately we are now living in an atmosphere when the farmer is welcome in any credit house, in any bank.  I have put it on the records of the House already that it is not so long since he was not so welcome, when before approaching a bank he was filled with fear and anxiety.  In those days he usually stopped 50 yards from the bank, took off his cap, rolled it up and put it in his pocket and still feared he would not be admitted or that his business would not be accepted.  Those days have gone and it is a good job that it is so.  The farmer is now welcome in all lending houses.</P>
    <P>However, we should not forget that the ACC in their own way provided a lending service for the agricultural community when it was not really available to them elsewhere.  I am glad to see from the Minister's opening speech that the business of the ACC has expanded by leaps and bounds since the beginning of the decade.  We find in the speech that the ACC lendings amounted to only £5 million in 1965 and that by 1972 they had increased to £25 million.  Last year they had reached £85 million and it is estimated that this year the corporation will lend £105 million.</P>
    <P>By any standard that is very sizeable business, and inflation and the rest of it notwithstanding, it shows that since 1972 the activities of the corporation have quadrupled.  It indicates substantial real progress.  That substantial expansion is no more than a reflection of the confidence the farmer has in agriculture.  It is evidence of the improvement our entry to Europe has brought about for our farming community and also of the trojan work done by the Minister for Agriculture in the last Government.  It is significant that during the term of office of Deputy Clinton the lendings of the ACC, the investment by Irish farmers in agriculture, <Col N="846" /> increased from £25 million to roughly £100 million, a most encouraging sign.</P>
    <P>It is good to see farmers having so much confidence in their industry that they are prepared to borrow money to invest in it.  We had a motion in the House last night, and it will be debated again tonight, dealing with a large industry introduced here by a foreign company.  Though it would be wrong of me to seek to debate it now, and you will be glad, Sir, to hear I do not propose to do so, the fate of Ferenka shows how vulnerable large companies can be, how unstable they can be, and it emphasises the necessity to expand more and more industries based on our own raw materials.  The Irish farmer is second to none in the world and, given the necessary technical advice and a capital, he can be relied on advantageously to use the land of Ireland which is more suitable for agriculture of the type practised here than any in the world.</P>
    <P>It is good, therefore, to see that the farmer has confidence in his industry and that he is investing money in it. I should like particularly to salute the younger generation of farmers because they have more courage than their forefathers.  The older generation of farmers were frightened of borrowing. They believed that it was not safe to buy something unless one could pay for it or had a substantial amount of the capital already saved.  Young farmers are looking to the future with confidence.  They see that they can earn money and repay loans which they secure and get a good living for themselves and their families.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Deputy will agree that today's farmer has better prospects than his forefathers had.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): Of course I do, but he has a different outlook as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>There may be a correlation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): I was about to say that <Col N="847" /> perhaps the better outlook is generating more courage.  The farmer in the past had to doff his cap and proceed to the bank with great caution.  He knew he was regarded as a doubtful risk.  That has changed and it is good that it is so.  Deputy Barry said yesterday that most Irish people still had the cow dung on their boots.  I am glad to be able to say that I am one who takes a great pride from being close to agriculture and one who has just left it&mdash;if, indeed, I have left it.</P>
      <P>I was dealing briefly with the stability of industry and employment based on agriculture as compared with industry based on multi-national corporations who may come and go. Agriculture is the base, I believe, for great employment-giving industries if it continues to expand as I hope it will.</P>
      <P>The Minister said that the aim of the ACC must now be &ldquo;to consolidate their position following a period of very rapid expansion while continuing to provide a first class service to Irish agriculture&rdquo;.  I do not believe, and I hope the Minister does not believe, that the ACC should remain static.  They should continue to expand as long as expansion can be profitable and as long as the money which they lend can be put to the good use to which the young farmers are putting it at the moment.  I hope that the Minister did not mean exactly what he suggested in this part of his speech if we take it literally.  There has been great expansion and in my opinion there is ground for further expansion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a fact that while some land is being used profitably and to the fullest extent there is a lot of good land which is not yet being used to even a quarter of the extent that is possible.  Until all our land is fully utilised we should not talk about consolidation but about further expansion and about spending money to put the land to work.  If one drives through the country one will easily see the land that is well looked after, the green fields that are thriving and carrying a substantial stock of cattle and so on but, alas, there are far too many grey fields.  There are too many fields which do not become <Col N="848" /> green until May or June, while farms that are well looked after will start to become green, as will the lawns, in the next month or so.  It is sad to have to say that we must wait until the young farmers move in and turn the grey fields into green fields.  I should not like to think that we have reached the stage where we have become complacent. One does not have to do a soil analysis or to have degrees in agricultural science or to be a practical farmer to see that a lot of the land is working far below full production.</P>
    <P>As long as that state of affairs exists there will be plenty of work for the ACC.  While farmers are very welcome in the head office of the corporation, ACC House, a fine new building, and at the sub-offices throughout the country, I am convinced that the ACC can be relied upon not to throw out money foolishly but to advance it for sound productive purposes.  I want to flog the point as hard as I can that if all our land was in full production it would create innumerable jobs in the processing of agricultural produce so that it could be exported as the finished product ready for use.  That type of employment will be near to the hearts of the people, a type of employment which is not foreign to them and which they are more likely to fit into.  In that sort of employment we would not have the industrial unrest generated in other types of employment.</P>
    <P>Although this is a consolidating Bill we should go through it with a fine comb.  We recently debated the European Assembly Elections Bill which was put through the House to facilitate the holding of these elections.  It was largely a Bill taken from other electoral Bills governing presidential, Dáil and local government elections. On going through the huge Schedule to that Bill, from practical experience it was possible to find loopholes and shortcomings.  We did find some of them and we improved some of them. Only it was necessary to get the Bill through within the next month or so we could have done more work on it.</P>
    <P>Although this Bill is a consolidation Bill and incorporates all the Agricultural Credit Acts since 1927, I believe we should go through each section in <Col N="849" /> the light of our experience to see if it can be improved.  I heard Deputy D'Arcy complaining yesterday about delays in getting loans through the corporation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought the Deputy was paying some attention to that all right.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): I gathered that Deputy D'Arcy was placing some of the blame on solicitors' offices throughout the country.  Blame can be attributed here and there for faults and it would be foolish of me to say that solicitors' offices are blameless.  Some of the legal machinery at the disposal of the profession, which must be implemented by the ACC's solicitor, leads to delays. I want to go on record as saying that the first law of nature is self preservation&mdash;man mind thyself&mdash;and it is the business of the solicitor for the corporation to comply with the law and to ensure that there are no loopholes through which borrowers can escape. If he did not ensure that the mortgages complied with the law, he would be blamed.</P>
      <P>I believe we should look at the sections to see if some of the procedures can be simplified.  Perhaps we could expedite the granting of loans without undue risk to the corporation by amending the law.  Deputy D'Arcy complained that some borrowers had to avail of bridging loans for a considerable time and bridging loans cost more than ordinary loans.  There have also been cases of borrowers' loans being delayed by the corporation for such a long time that the interest rates had increased in the meantime and they had to pay the increased rate for the duration of the loan, which is a more serious matter.  The interest chargeable at the date of sanction of a loan should be the prevailing rate and not the rate chargeable when the loan has been paid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are technical sections in the Bill on which I may comment later. In a general way, I notice that section 17 provides that when a person is nominated to the Seanad, that is, when he is one of the Taoiseach's nominees, he ceases to be a member of the board of the corporation.  It <Col N="850" /> also goes on to say that when a person is nominated for election either to the Dáil or Seanad, he is disqualified.  I think that is going too far.  It suggests that the thinking behind it is that once a person becomes an active politician he should not be a member of the board.  Let us call a spade a spade. We know that over the years the board has been&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Deputy will have an opportunity to comment on Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): I think it is in order to comment in a general way, Sir.  Well-known politicians of all parties have been members of the board and they have done a good job.  It is going too far to disqualify a person from membership of the board because he stands for election.  He is not more political on the day he stands for election than he was on the day before he stood for election.  He may be the county secretary or the constituency secretary of a political organisation and remain a member of the board, but he is disqualified under this section when he stands for election.  He is as political, perhaps more political, as a county secretary or a constituency secretary as he is when he offers himself for election.  I suppose only one in three of those who stand are elected.</P>
      <P>There seems to be a difference between the part of the section which deals with members of the board and the part which deals with employees. If an employee of the corporation stands for election and is elected, he will not be paid by the corporation but will be seconded to the Oireachtas.  If he is still alive after his term in the Oireachtas, he can take up his job with the corporation.  That is a fair summary of section 17.  It is putting the full-time employees of the corporation in a more favourable position than the temporary members of the board.  On Committee Stage, the Minister should introduce an amendment to delete section 17 (1).  Sub-section (2) is wide enough.  It reads:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A person who is for the time being entitled under the Standing Orders of either House of the Oireachtas to sit in that House shall, while so <Col N="851" /> entitled, be disqualified from becoming a director of the Corporation.</P>
    <P>That means he is disqualified on election, whatever the method of election. I want to emphasise the distinction between the treatment of a member of the board and an employee.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to go through the Bill section by section because I am sure that would be trespassing on the patience of the Chair.  I welcome the policy of the ACC to establish offices in every sizeable provincial town.  That is decentralisation in a practical way and it is bringing the officers of the corporation, and the corporation, into closer touch with the people it serves. That was not so some years ago when there was just a head office in Dublin and one or two offices elsewhere. Nothing could have been more inappropriate for the ACC which serves the agricultural community than to be housed in an office in Dublin without offices in big towns.  It is good to see the ACC establishing prestige offices in provincial towns.  In this regard I was pleased to see the ACC purchase the Bank of Ireland premises in Cavan when they became available after the amalgamation of a number of banks. The premises were not put up for public auction and I do not think that was necessary but I feel sure the bank were satisfied with the price paid to them by the ACC.  The ACC were fortunate in getting prestige offices located in the centre of town.  It pleases me also to know that those offices are well staffed and that applications for loans can be processed quickly.  If there is an acute urgency about a matter, such as a forthcoming auction, the district officers of the corporation facilitate applicants, their solicitors and the auctioneer.</P>
    <P>I should like to pay a compliment to the members of the various boards of the corporation and the permanent staff.  Any delays that take place, and delays occur on occasions, are due to the necessity for the professional and administrative staff to comply with the law which we hand down to them.  If we want this red tape eliminated <Col N="852" /> where it can be with safety&mdash;I believe there are many areas where the red tape can be cut out&mdash;then it is our duty to simplify the procedures.  It is my intention to examine the Bill closely between now and Committee Stage in the hope of finding ways of simplifying the procedure so that the business of the corporation can be expedited.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to make a few brief points in connection with this Bill.  I welcome the Bill and any measure which will lead to the development of Irish agriculture.  I should like to see the greater percentage of the money available for farmers being used for development purposes rather than land purchase only.  I do not see any great point in farmers going to the ACC to borrow money so that they can bid against other farmers for a local farm.  Unfortunately, the farmers with the greatest assets are in a position to borrow money.  We have a situation where land is being sold for prices in excess of what the average farmer can pay for it.  For that reason I feel the majority of the money being made available by the ACC should go for development purposes.  We have ten million acres of land which can be developed.  Over the last few years there has been a significant increase in the price of agricultural produce but our development has not accelerated as it should.  Our milk yields are half what they should be and the increase in price has not proved enough of an incentive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Applications for money for development purposes should be accompanied by a detailed development programme and the ACC should not give money without being given a plan for every investment.  Significant improvements were made by those who took advantage of the recent World Bank loan. Mr. Peadar MacCanna, who supervised that World Bank loan, in the course of a paper which detailed the success of that loan, pointed out that the average income of 600 farmers questioned&mdash; 2,000 farmers were involved in all&mdash; had increased by 47 per cent.  The stocking rate on those farms was reduced from 1.9 acres per livestock unit to 1.3 acres per livestock unit at the end of the development plan.  The <Col N="853" /> number of farmers with milking parlours at the commencement of the plan was 9 per cent but at the end of the plan 84 per cent had installed such parlours.  The number of farmers making silage rose from 29 per cent to 82 per cent.  In other words, the development plan required by the World Bank influenced farmers to improve the technology on their holdings. Although we have ten million acres of land which can be developed we only produce about 700 million gallons of milk.  We are capable of producing 700 gallons of milk per acre and, therefore, technically we can produce the milk we are producing from one million acres of land.  The scope for development is enormous.  That is why I would like to see the ACC insisting on getting a development plan before giving out money.</P>
    <P>The reason the World Bank scheme was successful was because detailed programmes were drawn up with advisory officers and the loans were conditional upon the farmers keeping to the targets required.  The average farmer does not have a fixed plan or fixed targets and the constraints on him are significant.  The ACC should employ additional agricultural advisers to ensure that development plans are implemented and that the ordinary farmer is helped.  Money should not be given to farmers to do what they like with it.  By insisting on getting a plan we can develop our most important resource.  I agree that it is good to see the ACC setting up offices in rural areas.  An office has been set up in Skibbereen which is deep into the heart of the disadvantaged area of west Cork.  It is giving a service to local small farmers.  They have contributed significantly where there were financial constraints on development.</P>
    <P>Those are the main points I wanted to make.  I do not want to delay the House.  The first point is that a higher percentage should go for development rather than land purchase and, secondly, the money made available should be conditional on firm plans for development.  I commend the Bill to the House.  I compliment the ACC on the way they have helped in developing agriculture.  I hope that, before <Col N="854" /> very long, they will be a major contributor to the development of our agriculture.  At present they are not the major contributor.  Some of the commercial banks actually give more money than the ACC for development purposes.  The ACC should be the premier development body.  I should certainly like to see that happening. The staff are composed of farmers and agricultural advisers.  The minimum red tape is involved.  They can contribute significantly to the development of our greatest natural resource.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Colley)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very gratifying that every Deputy who spoke in this debate welcomed the Bill and was warm in his praise for the Agricultural Credit Corporation, their activities and their staff. If all the State and semi-State bodies produced that kind of reaction in this House, we would be in a very happy situation.</P>
      <P>I want to deal briefly with the main points raised.  I say briefly because, as has been pointed out by a number of speakers, this is primarily a Committee Stage Bill.  No doubt we will deal in considerable detail with the various aspects of the Bill on Committee Stage. The first point I want to deal with is one made by Deputy Barry and at least one other Deputy, that is, a complaint that no explanatory memorandum was issued with the Bill.  I am not sure if that is a legitimate complaint.</P>
      <P>Ideally we would have an explanatory memorandum with it but the fact is that largely this is a consolidating Bill and, therefore, it is repeating provisions which already exist.  There are marginal notes in the Bill which draw attention to the existing provisions.  In so far as it contains changes, in my introductory speech I outlined the major changes and drew attention to them so that between now and Committee Stage Deputies who are interested, particularly in the changed aspects of the law, can concentrate on them.  Having regard to the fact that the changes are rather technical and suitable for Committee Stage, I feel there are no great grounds for complaint in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Barry also queried whether there was any change in the position in <Col N="855" /> regard to the appointment of directors as provided in this Bill.  I can assure him there is no change.  Deputy Callanan was not very happy about the processing industry.  I think he was speaking from the producers' point of view when he said he was not very happy with it because it was not paying competitive prices.  I understand and sympathise with what he was saying.</P>
    <P>I just want to refer briefly in this context to something said by Deputy Fitzpatrick about Ferenka.  Of course, everybody would subscribe to the view that we would be better off to have industry based on native raw materials, and preferably native-run industries based on native raw materials.  In the wake of the Ferenka affair, it may be becoming a little fashionable to talk in this way, as though that would solve all our problems.  We must not lose sight of reality.</P>
    <P>Leaving aside the whole question of whether we can provide sufficient jobs in this way, there is the practical difficulty that we have industries based on native raw materials and some of them are not very encouraging.  Indeed, some co-ops which are very large businesses have given great cause for concern in recent years.  So, let us not fool ourselves into thinking the answer to our problem is to have industries, co-ops or otherwise, based on the processing of native raw materials.</P>
    <P>Much more than that is needed in any industry, whether it is based on foreign or native materials.  It is quite clear from the record that that is so. I am not in the least decrying the objective of trying to have as much of our industry as possible based on native raw materials.  What I am saying is that that by itself is not the answer to our problem.  It needs efficiency.  It needs co-operation.  It needs good industrial relations.  It needs attention to marketing, to technological processes and various other things.  All of these are necessary, whether the raw materials are native or foreign.</P>
    <P>Deputy D'Arcy raised a point on section 27.  I doubt very much that <Col N="856" /> his contention in that regard is justified but I will certainly look into it.  At the moment I have not got available the answer to a question which was asked in regard to the overall liability or the contingent liability of the State on foot of guarantees for all State or semi-State bodies.  In the context of the reference made to the foreign borrowing ratio, the fact is that the foreign borrowing ratio in this regard has increased substantially in recent years.  I would hope it would not increase at the same rate certainly in the coming years.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barry expressed some doubt as to whether the role envisaged for the ACC in this Bill might be in conflict with the private sector.  I do not think there is any such conflict.  We are extending the aggregate facilities available and there is a very good working relationship between the ACC and the banks.  About 15 per cent of the total outstanding bank advances are advances to agriculture.  There is plenty of room for the banks to increase their advances to agriculture if they wish to do so.</P>
    <P>One of the reasons for the setting up of the ACC, one of the reasons why they must continue, is that the ACC are devoted specifically to agriculture. On occasions the banks tend to be more enamoured of agriculture than other occasions.  I do not think agriculture can afford to be subjected to the kind of changes brought about by extraneous factors in the activities of the banks.</P>
    <P>I was somewhat intrigued by Deputy Barry's apprehension as to the possible conflict with the private sector when contrasted with Deputy D'Arcy's forthright and repeated demands that the ACC should be engaged in providing what really amounts to a full banking service throughout the country.  There seems to me to be a contradiction in the approach of the two Fine Gael Deputies in this regard, one which I am sure they will sort out between them in due course.</P>

      <P>Deputy Bermingham spoke of the need for loans for small farmers.  The ACC are sympathetic to small farmers as the record shows because 75 per cent of ACC loans are for amounts under £5,000.  In suitable cases they give unsecured loans up to £2,000 where the repayment period is five years or less.  In any financial institution or lending agency there are always customers who are dissatisfied and this will be true of the ACC also. It is necessary to stress that the record shows that the ACC exercise practical sympathy in regard to small farmers.</P>
      <P>Deputy Crinion was concerned lest there might be an undue use of resources of the ACC in loans to big firms.  Figures show that only £15 million out of the £105 million lending for 1977 will go to firms in the processing industry.  The ACC are joint financiers with the banks of some quite big co-ops.  I think these are fairly well known.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="858" /> I was asked to comment on the section dealing with the control of the remuneration of the chief officer of the ACC.  The provision is this regard is the standard provision which has been introduced as soon as the opportunity offers in relation to all State-sponsored bodies when the legislation comes before the House.  Experience over a number of years has shown that any attempt at some kind of uniform approach to incomes policy can be totally defeated within the ranks of semi-State bodies unless some sort of overall control is exercised.  That is why these sections are introduced in such Bills as they come forward.  In the absence of that, there is, and has been for some years now, a form of non-statuatory control or persuasion exercised by sucessive Governments in this regard.</P>
    <P>I am aware of the kind of problem that can arise.  There may even have been one case in existence where the second in command was being paid more than the chief officer.  I think this was what Deputy Bruton referred to.  As Minister for Finance I am not prepared under any circumstances to tolerate a situation in which some board of a State body uses this lever in order to breach the overall control being exercised by the Government in regard to incomes in the public sector to ensure that some official who is not subject to this kind of control is paid more than his chief executive in order to force the Government to give way. If such a thing happened my reaction would be that the members of that board by their action are raising very serious doubts as to their competence and ability to fill the positions in which they are.  I want to make it quite clear that would be my personal reaction.  I was asked to comment and I am commenting.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, there is the situation to which I think Deputy Bruton also referred which could arise, but in very rare circumstances, in which it would be necessary for a particular body to recruit somebody with unusually scarce skills and in order to attract him he would have to be paid remuneration in excess of that of the chief executive.  That happens only <Col N="859" /> very, very rarely.  If it should happen that such a procedure is necessary the position could be discussed with the Minister responsible for the body concerned in consultation with the Minister for the Public Service and I am sure a solution could be worked out. We need not worry unduly about that; it is not the kind of problem with which we are normally faced; we are much more likely to be faced with the kind of thing to which I adverted a moment ago.</P>
    <P>Deputy Callanan also referred to the necessity for the ACC to assess the man rather than the amount of land he had to offer as security in dealing with loan applications.  I would agree with him.  This is one of the reasons why in this Bill we are extending the definition of &ldquo;permanent improvement purposes&rdquo; in section 37. By doing so, we enable the ACC to assess a prospective borrower in terms of his personal enterprise and his farm plan and not purely in terms of what, in another context, is reffered to as bricks and mortar and, in this case, the extent of his holding.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bruton referred to the possible need for a Government guarantee to the ACC for loans to certain farmers.  That is what I took him to mean; perhaps he meant it in a wider context and meant a guarantee to the banks.  I doubt if it is necessary or desirable but I shall examine the idea. I should like to make clear that at this stage, on the face of it, it does not seem necessary or desirable.</P>
    <P>Deputy D'Arcy urged that depositors should be issued with pass books because he felt this would assist the ACC in getting more deposits, particularly from smaller depositors.  The ACC are in fact organising this at present with the full support and consent of the Department of Finance.</P>
    <P>Deputy D'Arcy repeated plea for the making available of current account facilities by the ACC in their various offices through the country raises a number of issues.  The matter is not as straightforward as it might appear.  I do not think it necessary to go into all the issues here, but one that <Col N="860" /> should not be overlooked is the possibility of additional cost.  Another Deputy referring to Deputy D'Arcy's plea said that this was a way in which the ACC could perhaps make more money and thereby help to reduce interest rates.  If the ACC were to porvide this facility they would be depending on the banks to provide clearing facilities and they would have to pay the banks for this service.  They might have to pay a very considerable sum for this.  This is just one of the aspects of the matter which has to be taken into account.</P>
    <P>I will look into the queries in regard to chattel mortagages, raised mainly by Deputy D'Arcy.  The provisions on floating chattel mortgages seem to be very flexible.  In this connection I refer the Deputy to section 30 (1) paragraphs (a) to (c) in the Bill.  I will look into the points he raised.  I think he may be under a misapprehension about it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bruton raised the question of the statutory restricitions on a floating charge being placed on the assets of a co-operative.  I will have a look at that point.  I noted that, while Deputy Bruton raised the issue, he was very careful not to specify which particular way he wanted it dealt with.</P>
    <P>Interest rates in the ACC were recently reduced.  There are other terms available on loans from the ACC which are quite attractive and are not, as far as I know, available from any other leading source.  This is reflected in the enormously increasing demand for loans from the ACC, Deputy Bruton also raised the question of term loans and their unsuitability for agriculture. He was referring specifically in this case to the banks.  That, of course, does not come within the purview of this Bill.  I will inquire into that matter in relation to the operation of the banks and the application of term loans to agriculture.</P>
    <P>A point was raised by Deputy Burton in regard to section 3, the definition of &ldquo;agriculture&rdquo;.  That definition is not intended to be all-embracing and merely refers to agriculture as including certain items which are specified.  I am sure it is felt <Col N="861" /> that tillge is so obviously agricultural that it does not need to be included. Nevertheless, I believe Deputy Bruton may have a point considering dairying is included.  It could, perhaps, be argued that, if it is, it is so obviosuly agricultural that it does not need to be.  However, I will have that point examined.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick raised the question of section 17 relating to membership of the Oireachtas or nomination for election or nomination to the Seanad and the effect of that on board members and employees.  This section is a standard section which has been incorporated in numerous Bills in the past.  Precisely the same form is used on each occasion.  I do not want at this stage to get into a detailed argument on the merits or demerits of the provisions in it.  If Deputy Fitzpartick, on consideration, wants to pursue this matter no doubt he will do so on the Committee Stage on that section.  The difference in treatment between a board member on the one hand and an employee on the other is justified since, in the case of an employee, if he goes forward or if he is elected and subsequently loses his seat his livelihood is gone.  That is not true of a board member, so in that sense that difference of approach is justified.  In regard to the other question of mere nomination causing a director to have to resign&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>We can, if necessary, argue this on Committee Stage.  This is an approach which has been argued out a long time ago and rightly or wrongly, the decision having been come to, the precise same terms have been applied to numerous State bodies over the years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Depeuty Joe Walsh made a very brief speech but a very important one. First of all, he wanted to urge that more of the money advanced by the <Col N="862" /> ACC should be used for development and not for land purchase.  I know this is a very sore point but again, because of controversy which arises in this regard, it may be thought that more of the resources are used for land purchase than are actually used. I understand that about £10 million per annum is made available for land purchase.  There is a strong argument for saying that none of the resources of the ACC should be made available for land purchase.  I am not too sure if that argument is vaild but I know one can make a strong argument for it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Walsh gave some figures arising out of the World Bank project which are extremely interesting.  As far as i am concerned the approach Deputy Walsh was advocating is the right approach.  It is true, as I have indicated, that the ACC will be enabled under one of the new provisions in this Bill to take account of farm plans.  Deputy Walsh urged that we go even further and that loans be made conditional on the operation of a plan.  Some people might not agree with that approach.  As a man with a non-agricultural background I would agree with it.  I know Deputy Walsh has a very sound agricultural background and I am heartened to hear him take that approach.  I feel it is vitally important that the money we invest in agriculture should, as far as possible, be related to an actual plan for development and should be used in that way.  In the brief account givan by Deputy Walsh of the results of the World Bank project he showed very clearly the very substantial gains that can be made as a result of this approach.  I favour an approach on this lone.  One has to have regard to the practical realities facing the ACC but, subject to that, I strongly encourage the ACC to follow this line of approach.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fizpatrick, not perhaps unreasonably, had a look at what I said at the end of my speech about consoildation. I accept that what I said could be open to the interpretation to which he pointed. He did not put that interpretation on it but he pointed out that <Col N="863" /> it was open to the interpretation that I was saying that, after this period of rapid expansion, the ACC should go slow.  I am not saying that.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann approves the following Order in Draft</P>
      <P>Housing Act, 1969 (Continuance) Order, 1977,</P>
      <P>a copy of which Order in draft from was laid before Dáil Éireann on the 25th day of October, 1977.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the Housing Act, 1969, is to reduce the loss of habitable houses by enabling housing authorities to control the demolition or change of use of such houses.  It was enacted because the housing shortage at the time was being aggravated by the uncontrolled demolition and change of use of habitable houses, particularly in Dublin city.  The Act is a temporary measure with provision within it for its extension by Ministerial Order.  It was due to expire on 31st December 1972, but was continued in force by the Housing Act, 1969 (Continuance) Orders, 1972 and 1974.  It will expire on 31st December, 1977, unless continued by an Order madae by me each its approval by resolution by each House of the Oireachtas.  Approval was given to the Order by resolution of Seanad Éireann on 10th November, 1977.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Act provides that a habitable house may not be demolished or used for any purpose other than housing accommodation without the permission of the appropriate housing authority. In determining applications for permission under the Act, the housing authority must have regard to the state of repair of the house to which each application relates and the adequacy of the supply of housing in their functional area.  Where permission for proposed works is also required under the Local Government (Planning and Development) Acts, 1963 and 1976, the planning application will not be decided until a determination has been made under the 1969 Act.  The housing authority can refuse permission, or grant permission with or without conditions. In imposing conditions the authority may require the provision of <Col N="865" /> alternative housing accommodation or a contribution towards the cost of providing it.</P>
    <P>Activity under the Act which came into force in July, 1969, has been confined almost entirely to the Dublin and Cork areas.  Returns received from the housing authorities in these areas indicate that it has been reasonably effective in reducing the loss of habitable houses to the housing stock.  The number of applications for permission made to Dublin Corporation up to 30th September, 1977, was 1,710.  Of these, 979 were granted with conditions and 731 were refused.</P>
    <P>In the same period 214 applications were received by Cork Corporation and, of these, 137 were granted and 55 were refused.  In my view, however, the effectiveness of the Act cannot be judged by these returns alone because its very existence and the procedures it requires must provide a deterrent against unjustifiable and unwarranted losses of the housing stock.</P>
    <P>There is a right of appeal to me against the decision of the local authority where permission either is refused, or is granted subject to conditions. Up to the end of September this year 595 such appeals were received. Of these, 30 were invalid because they were not received within the statutory period, 79 were withdrawn, 425 were determined and 61 were under consideration at 30th September last.  Of the 425 appeals determined, 94 were allowed, 159 were allowed subject to conditions, and 172 were refused.</P>
    <P>While housing output in recent years has been considerable, it has not been sufficient to meet all needs, particularly in the Dublin area.  The circumstances which gave rise to the need for the controls in the Act still exist, and are likely to continue in some areas.  Accordingly, it is considered necessary that with some amendments, there should be permanent provisions for the type of control in the 1969 Act.  The drafting of such provisions is at an advanced stage and I hope to include them in a forthcoming Housing Bill.  In the meantime, I consider it essential that the exisiting controls should not lapse <Col N="866" /> at the end of 1977.  The object of the draft Order now before the House is to contiune the 1969 Act in force for a further period of two years up to 31st December, 1979, by which time I am confident permanent legislation will have been encated.</P>
    <P>I commend the motion to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): It might be opportune at this time to have a brief look at the Housing Act, 1969.  In 1963 the Planning Act of that year was enacted.  It set out to regulate the planning of houses, buildings and structures of all sorts as well as the use of land.  To that end it succeeded.  The legislation was enacted after many years of trying because we had two previous Planning Acts in the thirties&mdash;one in 1934 and one in 1939 which, as I said on a previous occasion, never got off the ground.  It was highly desirable that measures be taken to ensure orderly planning.  Without the Planning Act of 1963 there would be many eyesores throughout the country.</P>
      <P>Section 4 of the 1963 Act provided for certain exempted development. Paragraphs (a), (b), (c), (d), (e), (f), (g), (h) and (i) of subsection (1) dealt mainly with agricultural activities or with activities engaged in by local authorities or semi-State bodies, or one type of exempted development or another to which serious objections could not be found.  Section 4 (2) of the Planning Act, 1963, conferred on the Minister the right to declare by regulation that further activities should be exempted activities.  The subsection reads as follows:</P>
      <P>The Minister may by regulations provide for any class of development being exempted development for the purposes of this Act and such provision may be either without conditions or subject to conditions and either general or confined to a particular area or place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What do we find?  The day after the Planning Act, 1963, was passed, the then Minister for Local Government published regulations which he had prepared when the Bill was going <Col N="867" /> through the House.  Those regulations provided for exempted development. There were a number of classes in those regulations which were categorised as exempted developments.  We are dealing here with Class VII, which reads:</P>
    <P>...an alteration consisting of plastering or painting of any external part of a building, or the demolitions of the building, save where the preservation of such building is the objective of a development plan or during the period prior to the making of the development plan is declared by resolution of a planning authority to be an objective which they propose to include in the development plan.</P>
    <P>We are dealing with this matter today because in 1963 the then Minister for Local Government, who was given authority in the Planning Act, 1963, to declare that certain activities should be exempted development, bundled the demolition of a house into the same category as the painting or decoration of a house and declared the whole operation an exempted development.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see from the Minister's speech today that he proposes to replace these orders by permanent legislation. The fact is that the demolition of a house should never have been an exempted activity because you could not have orderly development or ordinary planning if a person were at liberty to knock down a series of house and make no provision to put something in their place.</P>
    <P>In 1963 this matter was debated at great length.  Deputy Denis Jones did trojan work in opposition on the Planning Act, 1963.  I am sure that neither he nor any other Member thought that the day after the planning Act became law the demolition of a house would not be covered by it because the Minister had declared it to be an exempted activity.  That in a nutshell is the history of the order we are dealing with now and the reason why this order is necessary.  Soon after that Act became law and after the regulations declaring the demolition of a house to be exempted activity were <Col N="868" /> published the following day, the wise guys and smart operators saw the loophole and proceeded to knock down houses wholesale.  They bought houses which were suitable, and badly needed, for human habitation and converted them into office blocks.  These people were within the law in doing that because the Minister had declared it to be an exempted activity.</P>
    <P>I did not research fully what I am about to say but there must have been a shortcoming in the 1963 Act.  While the Minister was obviously given authority to declare something to be an exempted activity, he was not given authority to amend the regulations to bring some sort of activity back into the net and make it subject to control. If he had had that authority presumable he would have operated it and the 1969 Act would not have been necessary.  Between 1963 and 1969 there was something in the nature of a scandal&mdash;I will not call it a major or a mini scandal&mdash;because of the demolition of houses fit for human habitation, which led to another undesirable practice. Certain type of landlords brought pressure to bear on tenants to leave their houses which could then be sold fir development knocked down and office erected in their place.  The Housing Act, 1969, was introduced to provide that habitable houses should not be knocked down.</P>
    <P>Legislation is being considered to make this provision permanent.  Is it sufficent to deal with habitable houses?  I suppose it is, but there could be a case where it would be desirable to preserve as a historic building a house that might not be habitable.  If that was so, I suppose it would come under another Act and there would be machinery available to preserve it.</P>
    <P>I believe this law should be made permanent for two reasons: first, because there is still a shortage of habitable houses and, second, because we have not yet provided houses for all the people who need them.  We have gone some considerable way towards providing houses for everbody who needs them but there are still many people who want houses, young people who wish to get married and rear <Col N="869" /> families.  So long as there is a shortage of habitable houses, it would be an outrage to demolish them. In order to preserve proper planning it might also be necessary to prevent the demolition of sound houses.  Apart altogether from the question of housing accommodation being required, violence could be done to sound planning policy by the demolition of houses. There could be gaps here and there and people could knock down houses and decide not to build in their place for several years.  There could be eyesores throughout the country.  I do not propose to mount a discussion on the housing situation.  I accept this Bill as being necessary.</P>
    <P>Perhaps it was the discussion in the Seanad that encouraged the Minister to decide to make this permanent legislation. This is not an innovation; it is really implementing the intention of the Housing Act, 1963.  It is making good a mistake that the Minister of the day made when drafting the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963 Exempted Development Regulations, 1964.  Including the demolition of houses in these regulations was a mistake.  The demolition was lumped in with something as simple and innocuous as the plastering or painting of any external part of a building.  It says that one can paint the doors or windows or plaster the house or that one can knock it down.</P>
    <P>It is a mistake to operate an Act too extensively through regulations because this sort of thing keeps creeping into it.  If the Minister for Local Government of 1963 or 1964 had not the power by regulation to extend exempted development, the Act of 1969 would probably not have been necessary; nor would the extended orders, including this.  To practical politicians, the power to knock down a habitable building would have stood out like a sore thumb and an amendment would have been put down.  A Bill would never have got through the House with that provision in it.</P>
    <P>Regulations are always laid before the House, but not many people go through them with a fine comb as they go through a Bill coming before the House.  Perhaps they should. There is a committee to deal with <Col N="870" /> statutory regulations and it is a pity that they did not discover this flaw. Regulations should be avoided where possible and should only be provided to deal with trivial matters or things that are not matters of principle.</P>
    <P>I do not oppose this order because it is necessary.  I am glad that before 1979 the Minister intends to introduce a measure which will make the demolition of habitable houses a planning matter.  That Bill, when introdeced, will give us an opportunity to have a full discussion on the whole subject.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry if my comments will add a note of discord to what would otherwise be a fairly quiet and harmonious discussion.  I am very disappointed that the Minister saw fit to reintroduce through his Department for the second or third time an extension of what is a piece of temporary legislation.  In the area of non-political, non-controversial legislation, this is probably one of the lousiest pieces of legislation we have had for a long time. If the language is unparliamentary, the phrase came from the city manager. Why should such a piece of legislation which in its opening sections appears to be designed to do the right thing earn such an adjective?  I fully agree with the description, and I say that as a politician, as a professional architect and as a former member of a local authority intimately concerned with housing policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This legislation was designed to protect the interests of people who for economic reasons were subject to the mercies of a market economy, who could not afford to house themselves properly and who were living in what could otherwise be described as cheap accommodation.  It manifestly has failed to protect the interests of those people.  The Act effectively concerns the Cork city and Dublin city areas. It simply points out that the authority in both cases must have regard for housing within their functional areas, when in both cases we are talking about inner city and outer city housing needs.  The replacement of housing stock within the functional areas of the two housing authorities for whom this Act is a reality, has resulted in housing <Col N="871" /> in essential parts of the cities being totally destroyed for the people who wish to live there.  The absurdity of this legislation is demonstrated in Baggot Street, where a semi-State body is occupying a building there, in which three flats were built on the roof as a result of this legislation, and they are not let.</P>
    <P>The reality is that, even with the best intentions, this legislation is really a cod.  We would be better off scrapping it, asking the major local authorities concerned to draw up a proper housing policy for their functional areas which has regard to the nature of their functional areas, and providing ourselves with an amendment of the Planning Act incorporating the only worth-while safeguard in this legislation which is the protection of the housing stock in both towns.  The Act has failed to protect the interests of people who wish to remain housed despite what the figures might say.  The replacement of three luxury flats on the top of the AnCO building in Baggot Street was little comfort of the people who had to be moved in the first place.  They are not living in them; they are living where perhaps they did not wish to live.  They have been housed by the local authority as people who were already housed, and perhaps they did not want to move. The cost to the local authority is something in the region of at least £13,000 each.</P>
    <P>The flats which were provided by the developers, and were subsequently paid for with the taxpayers' money, are lying vacant.  Flats are lying vacant in many areas where the requirement to provide flats with office block developments has been implemented. The housing stock is protected, if it is just thought of in terms of stock, but not when related to human need.  I do not decry the intentions of anybody involved in trying to get this Act on to the Statute Book. I remember the situation very well.  I was one of the people who walked the streets during the Dublin Housing Action Committee campaign but in this legislation the major loophole, to which the Minister has not seen fit to <Col N="872" /> draw attention in his speech, is that there is no obligation on people who provide alternative accommodation, and so meet the conditions in this Act, to let the accommodation.  The absurdity is that in some cases it works well, if you have a large enough site and you can put a commercial unit on one side and a residential unit on the other and you have two different kinds of entrances.  We will even get to the stage where there will be two different types of finance companies who will provide finance for the two sorts of activities.  In a confined site where a lot of our redevelopment occurs you are talking about putting one kind of accommodation physically on top of the other.  That has all kinds of implications of a building costs nature.  There is separate access for lifts and stairs, double entrances and so on.  You are in effect putting a cost charge on the development which does not help the economy and which fails from a professional design standpoint to provide adequate accommodation. It is easy for people who possess a building like this simply not to let the flats and to accept this as another charge.</P>
    <P>On a point which perhaps should be raised in the city council chamber rather than in this House, it is my regret that the local authorities have not seen fit to extract a realistic contribution towards the housing fund rather than simply seek a rebate.</P>
    <P>The Minister talked about the number of appeals that were decided by his Department.  This is in no way intended to be a personal criticism of him or of anybody because personal criticism will not get us very far.  But we have a two months' time slot on planning applications and many planning appeals are conditional on housing appeals being processed.  Recently, in the last two years anyway, we have had very efficient processing of planning appeals.  We have an inordinate delay by comparison with housing application appeals, and that is unjustified. What are the implications of that? It is not simply a question of, &ldquo;Ah, well, you just have to wait a couple of months and that is the gestation period and you cannot do anything <Col N="873" /> about it.&rdquo; There is a cost for every day that is lost in terms of interest, overcharges, lack of activity in the industrial sector and in the construction industry.  Ultimately it ends up with the likes of AnCO, in other words ourselves, paying the bill because that cost is transferred into the rent that has to be derived back from the person who rents the office development.</P>
    <P>This Act in essence serves no useful function in the extent to which it has effectively protected the housing stock. In terms of the political climate generated in the 1968-69 period which provoked the Minister of the day, then Deputy Boland, to come into this House and produce the legislation, the protests and marches were not about protecting housing.  They were about enabling people to live in a part of the city where they wanted to live, people who found they were moved out to areas where they did not want to go or where they could not afford to go because the transport implications and so on were enormous, and these have got worse rather than better.  Therefore what is the purpose of extending this Act, which is temporary legislation, for yet another period on the promise that the Minister will bring legislation of a more permanent kind by 1979?  I do not think he is going to protect the housing stock all that much more.</P>
    <P>The Sandymount branch of the Labour party two years ago did a survey of, effectively, the Dublin 4 area, and the loss in real terms to that community, which has a large number of people coming in and out in terms of transport, was enormously high because houses were standing vacant which were not capable of being taken in under the direction or control of the local authority of the day because of the inadequacies of the legislation that existed then, and still do exist.  If we did not pass this motion&mdash;and I am not inclined to think that we should&mdash;the legal powers that the local authority would lose would have damn little effect in real terms on the people who are in need of housing.  That may seem a harsh thing to say and it may be an apparent contradiction of a lot that has been said and of action that has been taken in the past, but I am speaking <Col N="874" /> from very direct experience of what has happened in the Dublin area.  The Minister should not waste the time of his Department, his own time or that of this House in extending this legislation.</P>
    <P>We are talking about only two local authorities for whom this legislation has reality, and I say that they should come up with a proper housing programme for their areas that would take account not merely of their functional areas&mdash;a legalistic phrase which does not address itself to the problem &mdash;but of the nature of housing within their functional legal areas.  We would ask them to come up with a housing redevelopment programme which would be aimed at conserving the residential content and social structure of an area if it is agreed by the local politicians that that social structure should be preserved.  A lot of legitimate construction and development has been unnecessarily delayed, a lot of civil service time has been occupied in processing this legislation and the cost of that loss of time has been transferred ultimately to the consumer.  Regrettably in this instance, and of direct concern to this House, the consumer of the majority of office accommodation has been the state sector, either Government Department or semi-State bodies.</P>
    <P>The history of this legislation in legal terms has already been gone into by my colleague, Deputy Fitzpatrick. He rightly points to what can only be described as a mistake by the Minister of the time.  I said in an interjection earlier that it was not the first mistake he had made.  On this occasion I was very much out of turn because I have a high regard for the actions of the Minister of that time.  Deputy Blaney, with regard to his role in introducing planning legislation to this country. He should take full credit for the political decision to introduce the legislation and for his ability to get it through. It was a major erosion of property rights in a highly conservative country. If he made a mistake in drafting the regulations I would be prepared to allow him that.  We all make mistakes.</P>
    <P>There have been a number of criticisms about the split between the function of the housing authority and that <Col N="875" /> of the planning authority in this respect.  The 1969 Act did not resolve that dichotomy.  I may appear to be wandering into a technical area, but let me explain what I am concerned with. the political pressure that resulted from that loophole which emerged from the drafting of the regulations was as much concerned with preserving residential content in an area or locality of the city as it was with individual housing units.  I was actively involved in that political pressure which in my view had a planning dimension.  It was concerned with a planning approach to an area of a city or cities.  I am speaking only from my Dublin experence.  This Act is concerned with the housing authority and addresses itself to the housing authority. The administration in effect ties the two authorities together and if you make an application to interfere with a habitable dwelling in any shape or form first of all it has to be processed by the housing section and then it is released to the planning department.  The criteria that the local authority, wearing their hat as the housing authority, will apply to any application will be totally different from those which would be applied by the planning officer for the area.</P>
    <P>This is where my argument rests in the main.  I would commend to the Minister and his advisers what is perhaps the definitive document on the Act.  It was a thesis done by Mr. Micheal Swanton and the reference number is 57 in the UCD library.  I believe Mr. Swanton is now an employee of Dublin County Council.  He did the paper as his town planning thesis on the functioning of the 1969 Housing Act.  It is a very useful document in that it has collated a number of facts and figures and he makes some assessments.  However, let me exempt Mr. Swanton of any responsibility for my remarks now.</P>
    <P>Among other things the figures that emerged from that thesis show there was a significant drop in the number of permissions granted from 1970 to 1973.  From what I have ascertained, 90 per cent of the applications for demolition or change of use were <Col N="876" /> granted in 1970 and that figure dropped to 70 per cent in 1973.  I know the background.  There was an absolute blanket decision taken by the housing co-ordinator of the day which said that every application to the local authority in Dublin city was automatically refused because of the Minister of the day, and there was the question of a housing emergency and the drive towards inner city housing. The decision was taken and it was announced to the Housing Committee that if the Minister wanted them to boost housing ley him make his own decisions about housing applications and appeals.  Subsequently many of the appeals were determined.</P>
    <P>To return to my point about the dichotomy between the housing authority and the planning authority having a role in this Act, the housing authority, having regard to the needs for housing in their functional area, are locked into a numbers' game where a developer will say he is knocking down three houses with ten residential units in them and he is proposing to build on the site an office block and 15 residential units.  On paper that is a net gain of five units to the housing stock and there is no way the housing authority can refuse permission on those grounds because the application meets every aspect of the Act and is increasing the housing stock rather than diminishing it.</P>
    <P>What is the reality on the ground? The planners could argue that if you alter the type of housing accommodation provided in those units&mdash;in the main it is usually low-cost housing accommodation, albeit low standard as well&mdash;you will reduce the real residential content of the area and that will have a damaging effect on the overall functioning of the area.  I am not talking about something academic or something that comes lightly out of the mouth of an architect who is concerned with Dublin.  I am talking as a practising politician who is responding, as everyone in this House who has any connection with Dublin is responding, to the real, legitimate out-cry about the increase of vandalism and deprivation of one kind or another in the city centre.  Study after study, whether of a formal academic <Col N="877" /> nature or simple pub wisdom, comes up with the same correlation that the more people you take out of the city the more you turn it into some kind of desert where all kinds of things can happen after the office workers have gone home.</P>
    <P>I regard that as a major defect in this legislation.  It is concerned with notional numbers, not about the nature of the housing stock, not about its specific location and not about the kind of people who qualify for housing. Frequently the people who lose out are those who in the past had no hope of getting housed by Dublin Corporation or by Cork Corporation. They were small families, single people or perhaps a household consisting of a mother and adult daughter.  The latter could not get accommodation unless the mother was old enough to be housed as an aged person.  The new points system introduced by the city council attempted to redress that situation in some small measure but only in a small measure.</P>
    <P>If there is any category who are discriminated against with regard to housing it is single women between the ages of 25 and 65 years who have no hope of getting housed as compared with other categories.  For historical reasons they are badly paid, they find it impossible to get credit and they are very vulnerable.  They alone, with other single people have to provide private rented accommodation for themselves, have to house themselves without any form of economic subsidy. They are the only category who receive no housing subsidy, whether it is local authority subsidy in the form of differential rents or mortgage subsidy in the form of income tax relief on interest. This category have suffered more than anybody else.  Every time it is pointed out that the redevelopment of aspects of the Dublin area are biting into the flat dwelling part of the housing stock, figures are produced by the Minister. We are told that the bulk of the applications have been refused, that the applications let through have in most cases proposed to increase the housing stock rather than reduce it.</P>
    <P>On paper a housing authority playing dominoes can make those figures <Col N="878" /> real and make sense and nobody can criticise them but I would gladly take the Minister on a tour of Dublin&mdash;I am sure the same could be done in respect of Cork&mdash;and show him that although the dominoes stand up on the file, where it is shown that there will be 24 units on the site, the reality is that the vacant sites are partially demolished and are vandalised.</P>
    <P>Let me give the Minister one example.  If one drives from this building, past Aras de Valera, around by the &ldquo;Pepperpot&rdquo; church and over the bridge, one comes out at Haddington Road church.  Speaking from memory, there was a substantial number of residential units in the half-dozen houses that existed on the Haddington Road side of that site. They were all granted permission for demolition, subject to appeal.  There was no way the Minister could legitimately grant the appeal because the developer was proposing to increase the total housing stock.  They were demolished in approximately May, 1974. It is a vacant site today.  Many single people lived in those flats, nurses and the like, and I was at more than one party in some of the flats.  Where are they living now?  We know from the only piece of census information and subsequent research of the Register of Births and so on that the migration into the Dublin city area is enormously high.  We have a figure for that migration of 10,000 people per annum and of that figure 75 per cent of the people were between 15 years and 29 years and they were single.</P>
    <P>They were exactly the kind of people who would be looking for accommodation of this kind.  If one thinks in terms of location of flats in the city of Dublin, it can be confined to a number of specific areas, very tight and compact &mdash;Dublin 6, Dublin 4; I am talking about the Ranelagh, Rathmines, Balls-bridge areas on the south side and the Phibsboro', Drumcondra Road areas on the north side.  If one overlays on such a map colour showing the incidence of flats and high occupation by single people migrating into the city at this time and the location of office or commercial development, there is a virtual 1:1 correlation in certain areas.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="879" /> I am saying, perhaps in a long way &mdash;and it is not my intention to delay the House because I fully appreciate that legislative time is all too bloody precious and scarce in this country&mdash; this Bill really is not worth a damn and that, by leaving it on the Statute Book, we are codding ourselves that we have some protection for the housing stocks.  It protects nothing; in real terms it does not protect housing need.  Its implementation and administration may appear to do so and the officials and local authorities who wave it at one may feel they are doing a useful job.  I can say without contradiction that the number of people who have been seriously protected by this legislation is very small.  I can say also without contradiction that areas of the city, which have a very serious housing need for a category of the population who depend totally on market resources for their housing and who depend also totally on their own private means for their housing&mdash;because they receive absolutely no subsidy&mdash; must depend absolutely on the kind of accommodation this Bill purports to protect.  They have not been protected by this Bill, not one bit.</P>
    <P>I have talked all the time about demolition and redevelopment of sites.  Let me turn now to the question of change of use.  I am subject to correction on this&mdash;I am sure the Department and the Minister's officials have more up-to-date figures than mine&mdash; but the figure I collected from a thesis was that 45 per cent of the housing authority applications in the Dublin area in the period 1970 to 1975 were for change of use.  An argument can be made somewhat for change of use applications, for retaining the legislative powers contained in this Bill, for monitoring the change of use. Again, let us look at what happens on the ground as distinct from what is in the files or what happens in the legal world in which we sometimes pretend to live.  The incidence of unofficial or unauthorised change of use is exceptionally high.</P>
    <P>I would refer the Minister, if he does not already have it on file to the number of very active residents' associations <Col N="880" /> who write to me in the Dublin 4 area, the Dublin South-East constituency, area number 9 of the electoral areas, where there was on the last count, something in the region of 40 residents' associations, at least five or six of whom would be extremely active, well briefed and who would provide the eyes and ears of an army of people.  They write to me frequently that such-and-such a place has gone into offices, has been converted or that such-and-such a place has been changed.  I check with the local authority and find there is no question of this change having been applied for.  There was a famous case in Leeson Park of a change of use that went on for a long time.  I am not here referring to a former Member of this House.  I refer to a legal company, a member of Deputy Fitzpatrick's renowned and noble profession, who used every legal trick in the trade to maintain their illegal occupation of an area, in planning our housing authority terms, for a very long time, by using all the subterfuges of delay this Act left itself open to, in conjunction with the planning legislation that then existed. People who change the use of houses for conversion from residential to office frequently do so without reference to anybody.  The capacity of local authorities to monitor these changes let alone respond to them is difficult, exceptionally limited and quite ineffective.</P>
    <P>The other side of the coin to which this Bill refers is the monitoring of the registration by landlords of more than two units of accommodation other than their own home, as required under the bye-laws introduced by Dublin Corporation some two or three years ago for private rented accommodation. The actual ground staff available to local authorities in this instance is very small; they cannot do that job, which has a far more pressing political priority among councillors than the kind of monitoring of unauthorised change of use.</P>
    <P>Legislation alone&mdash;assuming that it was good legislation, which this is not &mdash;does not protect that kind of activity. Policing or monitoring of a different <Col N="881" /> kind&mdash;I do not like the over-tones of the word &ldquo;policing&rdquo; in that context&mdash; is what is required.  With the best legislation in the world, unless one specifically changes the staffing levels of Dublin Corporation and Dublin County Council and their capacity in the city or county to review the situation it will not have an appreciable effect on the people for whom this legislation was hurried into this House in 1968-69.  Where does all that leave us?  It leaves us with a lousy Bill.  Is that unparliamentary language?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>It leaves us with the worst kind of legislation which fails to protect the housing needs of our community.  It fails to protect the urban-social mix of certain parts of the two major cities for whom the Bill is a reality, and it is largely theoretical for most other local authorities.  It fails to direct our attention towards developing a nationally and fiscally proper housing policy to cater for the needs of people who depend on this kind of accommodation which is, in the main, affected by the activities of redevelopment.  It fails also to make us continually aware of the need to do something about the housing situation. We tend to hide behind the existence of this Act pretending that it is, in some way or another, adequate and suitable for our needs.  A number of officials&mdash;not, I should say, those of the Department but of local authorities &mdash;with whom I have had talks felt there should be some form of control and that this was better than none. Nevertheless it was considered to be a very unacceptable Bill.</P>
      <P>The Minister is wasting his time and that of the House seeking another extension of this Bill.  Were one, by a fairly simple legal device, to make this permanent one would be merely compounding a bad situation.  Unless I did not hear it when I went outside to make a telephone call, there was no commitment given in this House about making the legislation permanent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Then I withdraw that remark.  The Minister will readily agree that the commitment is of a very vague nature.  While I do not for one second doubt his sincerity or his competence, a commitment of a vague nature remains precisely that.  I am speaking of a situation in which the realities of migration to the Dublin area are enormous, where, from my vantage point, as someone who has had direct experience in the field both professionally and politically, the housing stock is being reduced.  In short, the Act does nothing to protect the housing needs of the people.  It does everything to extend bureaucracy unnecessarily and add unnecessarily to the construction process costs which are not absorbed by the developer but are transferred to the consumer&mdash;and the consumer in most cases of office development has been the State sector, be it the public service or State agencies.</P>
      <P>The absurdity is that you have now in Baggot Street a situation where a State body occupies a building built as a result of this legislation on the condition, imposed by the local authority, that flats were to be provided. These three flats are still vacant.  That is the absurdity of the situation.  Why then waste time continuing this legislation? I do not accept that the Department, which was aware of the inadequacies of the legislation because it has been renewed on two separate occasions, does not have alternative proposals and I do not accept that there has not been a great deal of work of some kind done in the Department because the officials, for whom I have a great deal of respect&mdash;I do not say this to flatter them&mdash;certainly know the situation.  They are expert at monitoring how legislation functions. Some of the viewpoints I have put forward have possibly been expressed already because the experience of the Housing Act is not peculiar to me and does not stem from a particular vantage point of the Labour Party.  It is known across the board in all its administrative defects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For these reasons I am opposed to this motion.  It does nothing to protect <Col N="883" /> the interests of those in need and it does everything to increase unnecessarily the work of the Department and of the local authorities.</P>

      <P>In my opening statement I said that legislation of a permanent nature would be brought in in the near future.  Even though we are looking for a two-year extension it is not anticipated that we will require that extension. It is our intention to introduce the legislation next year and make it effective next year.  We decided to look for two years to be absolutely safe lest anything might delay the legislation.</P>
      <P>The arguments advanced by Deputy Quinn give support to the point of view that there should be no restrictions at all and no conditions, that the Act should be allowed to lapse.  I do not subscribe to that view.  The returns received over the years have proved that the Act has been reasonably effective.  Before we tabled this motion we had consultations with local authorities.  I was assured by the local authorities, particularly in the major areas of population, such as Dublin Corporation, that the controls had proved valuable in conserving existing housing stocks and I was pressed to continue the controls.  This is what I am now doing.  The experience of local authorities is not in accord with the views expressed by Deputy Quinn who was, until recently, a member of a local authority.</P>
      <P>The controls have been reasonably effective.  We will have ample opportunity for a full discussion on all aspects of housing when the proposed new Bill comes before the House and so I do not propose to dwell on the matter at this stage.  We are merely extending the Act.  We are not amending it.  Any amendments required will be incorporated in the new Bill.  We hope to have that Bill passed next year.  We cannot control the exact timing but we are hopeful that it will be passed next year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick referred to exemption from planning control in regard to demolition.  He was speaking about the 1963 Planning Act and both <Col N="884" /> he and Deputy Quinn maintained there was a serious error in that Act.  A Planning Act is different from a Housing Act.  Even if permission for demolition of a habitable house were required, the very fact of the house being sound or there being a shortage of housing would not really be a valid planning consideration under the Planning Act.  We can only effectively control demolition or a change of use under the Housing Act of 1969.  I would not agree, therefore, that there was an error in the 1963 Act.</P>

      <P>It was not necessary to get planning permission for that.  The Housing Act deals with matters like this and we hope that any deficiencies in the 1969 Act will be corrected in the proposed new Bill.  As I said, the reports from local authorities give us to believe very firmly that the Act has been effective.  Deputy Quinn described it as a &ldquo;lousy&rdquo; Act.  It was not all that lousy.  It has been effective and, until such time as we bring in the new Bill, I trust it will continue to function effectively.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism and Transport (Mr. Faulkner)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dail Éireann hereby confirms the Córas Iompair Éireann (Additional Powers) Order, 1977.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this order is to enable CIE to set up a special superannuation scheme and fund for Irish members of the British based Railway Clearing System Superannuation (RCSS) Fund Corporation which is in the process of being wound up.  The RCSS Fund Corporation were set up in Britain in 1873 to provide for the payment of superannuation benefits to the salaried officers and clerks of such British or Irish railway companies as joined the fund.</P>
      <P>When the Great Southern Railways Company were established under the Railways Act 1924 as the main rail company in this country, all eligible clerical and salaried employees of the company were members of the RCSS Fund.  When the RCSS Fund was being reorganised in 1941 the Great Southern Railway Co. (GSR) decided to withdraw from the fund and set up their own superannuation scheme and fund.  The Great Southern Railway Company (Superannuation Scheme) Act, 1947, was passed for this purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the establishment of CIE in 1945 and with the passing of the GSR <Col N="886" /> (Superannuation Scheme) Act, 1947, the only RCSS Fund members who were left in the country were employees of the Great Northern Railway Board, the County Donegal Railways Joint Committee, and the Irish Clearing House.</P>
    <P>Under Acts passed in 1958 and 1971 the undertakings and staff of the Great Northern Railway Board in the State and the County Donegal Railways Joint Committee, respectively, were taken over by CIE.  However, as CIE were not authorised to subscribe to the Railway Clearing System Superannuation Fund those staff who were members of that fund were only seconded to CIE, and the Great Northern Railway Board and the County Donegal Railways Joint Committee have been maintained in nominal existence pending the making of permanent arrangements for the preservation of the superannuation rights of such persons.</P>
    <P>The Irish Railway Clearing House discontinued business in 1971, and those staff who were not retired on pension with compensation were seconded to CIE pending legislation to enable them to become employees of CIE and become members of the appropriate superannuation scheme. This legislation is in course of preparation.</P>
    <P>The urgency attaching to this order stems from the decision of the British Railways Board, who were the largest member of the RCSS Fund, to leave the fund and to set up independent superannuation arrangements.  This left the RCSS Fund with few contributing members and accordingly the Railway Clearing System Superannuation Fund Act, 1976, was passed in Britain to dissolve the corporation and the fund and CIE are therefore required to make independent superannuation arrangements for the Irish members of the fund, whether as existing contributors or superannuated members.  If such arrangements are not made by 1st January, 1978, in accordance with the terms of the Railway Clearing System Superannuation Fund Act, 1976, the powers, functions, rights and obligations of the RCSS Corporation will be vested in CIE.</P>
    <P>As Deputies will appreciate, I am <Col N="887" /> anxious therefore that CIE be empowered as soon as possible to make special superannuation arrangements on behalf of the Irish members in advance of the date of the winding up arrangements of the RCSS.  This order will so empower CIE and in addition the GNR and County Donegal Railways Joint Committee can be wound up.</P>
    <P>I commend this resolution to the House.</P>

Two colleagues of mine in the House I am glad to say, who have given a great part of their lives to the service of transport, in particular CIE, are being given an opportunity to make contributions based on their experience.</P>

On behalf of my party I support the order fully in the knowledge that these members are in an invidious position because of the winding up of the fund in England and it has become imperative that CIE as soon as possible be enabled to create a fund to protect these members who gave service to the railways in Donegal and elsewhere.  I hope this order will be sufficient to enable CIE to act immediately.  For some time this has been a matter of grave concern to my union.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 3 and 4 together. About 1 per cent of herdowners, covering 3 per cent of cows, participate in the milk recording scheme.  This percentage is low by comparison with other countries and with a view to securing an improvement I recently set up a study group on milk recording to advise on the introduction of a more flexible recording system which would encourage increased participation by herdowners.</P>
      <P>The fees payable for milk recording have been increased recently from £3 per herd and £1 per cow to £10 and £2 respectively.  These increases were necessary because the receipts from fees represented less than 10 per cent of the overall cost of the scheme. There had been no change in the fees since the scheme was introduced on 1st February, 1972.</P>

      <P>That is not my impression. My impression is that the farming organisations are most concerned that there should be no long hiatus in the period between the enactment of the NAA Act and its amendment by this Government.  I have given my assurance that this period will be as short as I can make it.  I do not accept that there is a general clamour from the farming organisations for the retention of the existing NAA, involving as it does the abolition of an Foras Talúntais.  On the contrary, several scientific examinations of this subject undertaken by Jones Davis, by Devlin and by the OECD have come down on the side of the retention of the research element as a separate entity.</P>

The surreptitious establishment of the council after the former Government had lost the confidence of the people and lost the people's mandate was a very reprehensible action in my opinion.  If there is a delay it can be traced back to that reprehensible conduct of a former Government in the dying days of their guardianship.</P>

We are using every method available to us to correct illegal importation.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I informed representatives of the dairy industry at a meeting on 2nd November, that, in my view, the terms of Protocol 18 to the Treaty of Accession specify clearly that the special concessions for imports of New Zealand cheese into the United Kingdom terminate at the end of this year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a subtle difference here.  The Minister is quoted as having given an assurance that no further exports of New Zealand cheese will take place.  Can I take it that what he says is equivalent in full to an assurance that no New Zealand imports will take place?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. Gibbons Mr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Deputy realises that imports of this nature are not made under the auspices of the <Col N="901" /> Irish Government but rather under the European Commission who are bound by Community law just as we are.  The Community law says that the importation of New Zealand cheese will cease on 31st December.  We will abide by that holding and we will resist any attempt made by any member of the European Community to change it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no quantitative control on the importation of onions and an import licence is not, therefore, required.  Under our plant health legislation, imported onions, in common with the general range of vegetables and plants, are required to be free of diseases and pests.  A licence is necessary from my Department for this purpose but only to ensure that the produce is free of diseases and pests and not to control the level of imports.  The extent of imports is a matter for the trade interests involved.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnJRyan" hpid="Mr. J. Ryan Mr. J. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am asking whether the Minister would agree that, since my question is being grouped with a number of national questions, this attitude is no more constructive than that of the former Minister and is very far removed from the present Minister's guarantee to the people of the Slieve Felim area when he visited them before the general election?  Is not this recommendation a very much watered down version of the proposals that emanated from Fianna Fáil before that election?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Slieve Felim area has all the criteria laid down by Brussels for designation as a disadvantaged area&mdash;an area of low income farming, a depopulating area and one in which the soil is poor&mdash;can the Parliamentary Secretary give a guarantee to the House that the area will be included in the Government's submission to Brussels?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>I assure both Deputies Ryan and Smith that the Slieve Felim area will be considered in this context. Indeed, it is one of the areas being considered presently.  Representations have been made by various bodies to have it included in the disadvantaged areas scheme.  I assure the Deputies that it will be submitted to Brussels by the Department and, as the Deputies are aware, the final decision rests with Brussels.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Chair, I wish to ask another question.  I have asked the Minister for Agriculture whether, in view of the personal visit he made to the area on behalf of his party, he will admit that what is happening in respect of this area constitutes nothing better and is perhaps weaker than what the former Minister promised?  We may have made promises but we did not attempt to con the people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): I am not objecting to the Minister answering the question, but may I take it that this is a form of oral question which may now be put to the Minister, if he happens to be within the House, without prior notice?  That is how the situation appears to me. The question that was put to the Minister for Agriculture by Deputy Ryan is a question separate and distinct from but of the same nature as this question, which is not a written question. I understood that, if a Deputy wished to have a reply to an oral question, he had to give special notice of the question and receive special permission from the Chair.  I am anxious to know, in the interest of guidance for the future, whether that situation is being changed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Ryan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): Does the Parliamentary Secretary agree that there are parts of both Cavan and Monaghan which are not included in the handicapped area although they are every bit as severely handicapped as other areas which are included?

    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that there are areas both in Cavan and Monaghan that possibly should be included and when the review is carried out I am hopeful that if they comply with the criteria laid down under the directive, some of the areas at least will be included. In relation to the five areas that have been mentioned in the questions put down by the Deputies, the position was carefully examined during the previous review and despite repeated meetings of local interests including county committees of agriculture it was not found possible to alter the areas at that time.  As I said in my supplementary reply to Deputy Ryan, the areas are being reviewed at present.  Various organisations have made submissions which will be considered by the officials in my Department and the areas recommended for inclusion will be examined.  We will then forward our proposals to Brussels, and hopefully some of them will be included.</P>

      <P>So far there has been no confirmation that there are uranium deposits worthy of commercial production in Ireland and any decision, at this stage, on the possible uses of any uranium deposit discovered would be premature.

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Following my initial visit to Brussels to discuss this matter I made a detailed public statement on 21st September last and copies of that statement were made available to Deputies.  Since then discussions have continued with the European Commission concerning the establishment of new arrangements to co-ordinate the regional aids of all member states, including Ireland.  I paid a further visit to the commissioner concerned on 17th November.  A document has now been drafted by the Commission and will be finalised following consultations with the member states beginning in mid-January, 1978.  This document enunciates general principles only and I understand that the manner in which these principles will be applied to individual member states will be settled in bilateral discussions with the Commission.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is no doubt aware, export sales relief as an aid is generally considered to be incompatible with the spirit of the Treaty of Rome.  We have always accepted that at some stage it might be necessary to change the system. However, it was recognised in the declarations associated with Protocol 30 to the Accession Treaty that if the system had to be changed it would be replaced by one which would be equally effective as an incentive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government have decided that the time has now come when we must look for a new system.  Apart from any other consideration, export sales relief may in the coming years begin to lose its full attractiveness as an incentive for new industry because of the expiry date of 1990.  A number of possible alternatives are being examined but a final decision has not been taken and in any event a change will not be made for some years.  In the meantime those enterprises which have qualified for export sales relief, <Col N="918" /> or which may qualify before the changeover to the new system, will continue to benefit up to the expiry date of 1990.  It is our intention that those who qualify under the new system will be in a position at least as satisfactory as that provided by our present system.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government are seriously concerned at the problems being created for Irish manufacturing industry, particularly certain labour intensive sectors, by the continued operation of the British temporary employment subsidy.  I have already made known this concern to the appropriate EEC Commissioners.</P>
      <P>The question of the compatibility of state aids being provided by each member state is at present under intensive examination in Brussels.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister obviously shares the concern which the Confederation of Irish Industries and others have expressed on this matter. I do not want to be taken as recommending, but has the Minister considered the possibility of our establishing a comparable scheme until such time as the British one expires?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I have considered that possibility but I am not attracted to it, first of all on the grounds that the British scheme is clearly incompatible with the Treaty of Rome in as much as it distorts competition between members.  Therefore, I believe the best <Col N="919" /> solution to the problems that were created by the British scheme is the abolition of the British scheme, either voluntarily by the British themselves or compulsorily by the Commission in the co-ordination of state aids for 1978 onwards.  Another consideration which would inhibit the introduction of a similar scheme here, however desirable it might appear on the surface, is that the expense factor for us would be a very major one; and if we are to compete with a large and wealthy nation like the British on the same terms, then in the long term we must inevitably put ourselves at a serious disadvantage. The Government have sought to help in regard to these types of industries by their decision to introduce a pay-related form of social welfare contribution.  It was our hope that this could be introduced in April, 1978, but I am now advised that, notwithstanding the best efforts of the Minister for Social Welfare to have it introduced at that time, for administrative reasons it is now going to be possible to introduce it before the beginning of April, 1979.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Not as such.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. O'Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move :</P>
      <P>(1)  That it is expedient that a Joint Committee of both Houses of the Oireachtas (which shall be called the Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the European Communities) be established consisting of&mdash;</P>
      <P>18 members of Dáil Éireann and 8 members of Seanad Éireann (none of whom shall be a delegate to the Assembly of the European Communities)</P>
      <P>to examine&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i)  such programmes and guidelines prepared by the Commission of the European Communities as a basis for possible legislative action and such drafts of regulations, directives, decisions, recommendations and opinions of the Council of Ministers proposed by the Commission,</P>
      <P>(ii)  such acts of the institutions of those Communities,</P>
      <P>(iii)  such regulations under the European Communities Act, 1972 (No. 27 of 1972), and</P>
      <P>(iv)  such other instruments made under statute and necessitated by the obligations of membership of those Communities,</P>
      <P>as the Joint Committee may select and to report thereon to both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(2)  That provision be made for the appointment of substitutes to act for members of the Joint Committee who are unable to attend particular meetings and that members of either House, not being members of the Joint Committee, be allowed to attend meetings and to take part in <Col N="957" /> the proceedings without having a right to vote.</P>
    <P>(3)  That delegates to the Assembly of the European Communities be notified of meetings and be allowed to attend and take part in the proceedings without having a right to vote.</P>
    <P>(4)  That the Joint Committee, previous to the commencement of business, shall elect one of its members to be Chairman, who shall have only one vote;</P>
    <P>(5)  That all questions in the Joint Committee shall be determined by a majority of votes of the members present and voting and in the event of there being an equality of votes the question shall be decided in the negative;</P>
    <P>(6)  That every report which the Joint Committee proposes to make shall on adoption by the Joint Committee be laid before both Houses of the Orieachtas forthwith whereupon the Joint Committee shall be empowered to print and publish such report together with such related documents as it thinks fit; and</P>
    <P>(7)  That five members of the Joint Committee shall form a quorum of whom at least one shall be a member of Dáil Éireann and at least one shall be a member of Seanad Éireann.</P>
    <P>I should first like to say something about the Community's law-making process and the need for scrutiny of Community secondary legislation. When we joined the Communities we adopted a new legal order which takes precedence over our national systems of law-making in the areas covered by the Treaties.  The ability of the Community to enact laws in many areas, affects National Parliaments and this required the setting up of a joint Committee on Secondary Legislation&mdash;the object being to allow the Oireachtas to influence the formulation and implementation of Community legislation in those areas where the Houses would not have exclusive powers and to supervise the implementation of such legislation in Ireland.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="958" /> Once its early difficulties were overcome the Joint Committee, under the last Dáil, did extremely valuable work in examining draft Community legislation, Community Acts and statutory instruments made under the European Communities Act of 1972.  The magnitude of the task is formidable since it has been estimated that the Council of Ministers alone passes on average 300 measures every year, many of them of a highly complex and technical nature.  In preparing their reports the Joint Committee selected for examination those draft acts which they considered to be of particular importance to this country, taking the views of various interest groups into account. They also examined all statutory instruments made to implement Community laws.</P>
    <P>The expediency motion which is before the House today will establish a new Joint Committee which I hope will continue the good work of its predecessor.  In deciding on composition, terms of reference and so on set out in the motion, the Goverment have taken into account the recommendations which the last Joint Committee made in their 55th report published in March, 1977, in which they examined their function and performance and suggested possible changes to improve the workings of their successor.</P>
    <P>The new Joint Committee will consist of 18 Members of Dáil Éireann and eight Members of Seanad Éireann, a total of 26, which is the same number as the last Joint Committee. However, delegates to the European Parliament are no longer to be <i>ex-officio</i> members.  It was originally felt that membership of the Joint Committee would be helpful to delegates to the European Parliament and that the experience gained by these delegates in the European forum would be of assistance to the Joint Committee. In practice the arrangement was not a success as Members of the European Parliament found that they were unable to take a full part in the very considerable amount of work involved in membership of the Joint Committee due to their commitments in Europe.</P>
    <P>The valuable contribution which delegates to the European Parliament <Col N="959" /> have to make to Community business in these Houses will not, however, be completely lost to the Joint Committee. Provision has been made for these delegates to be notified of meetings of the Joint Committee, to be allowed to attend and speak at meetings without, however, having a right to vote.  As suggested by the last Joint Committee in their report of March, 1977, I think it would be useful if formal meetings between the Joint Committee and Members of the European Parliament were held from time to time on particular topics of special importance.  It is intended also that the arrangements whereby the Joint Committee secretariat supplies delegates to the European Parliament with briefs should be continued.</P>
    <P>The last Joint Committee found that, due to the necessary frequency of their meetings, particularly of sub-committees, and other commitments of their members, it was not always possible to secure an adequate attendance. Accordingly, they recommended in their report of March, 1977, that in regard to their successor provision be made for the appointment of substitutes to act for members who are unable to attend particular meetings. Such provision has been incorporated in the motion now before the House. The motion also provides that Members of either House, who are not members of the Joint Committee, will be allowed to attend meetings and take part in proceedings without having a right to vote.  This provision will give an opportunity to Members with a special interest in a subject coming before the Joint Committee to express their views and will thus allow for the widest possible involvement in the process and implications of European legislation.</P>
    <P>While speaking of the composition of the Joint Committee, I would like to say that it is the Government's hope and intention that the independent Senators should be represented on the Joint Committee as heretofore and that the Chairman should come from the Opposition, as heretofore.</P>
    <P>I would like now to turn to the terms of reference of the Joint Committee <Col N="960" /> which, Deputies will have noticed, have been extended as compared with the last Joint Committee to include the power to examine and report on programmes and guidelines prepared by the Commission as a basis for possible legislative action.  I think it is important for the Joint Committee to be able to consider such documents as they provide the broad framework for legislation in the particular areas they deal with.</P>
    <P>As before, the motion gives the Joint Committee authority to examine and report to the Houses of the Oireachtas at three stages in the process of adoption of legislation by the Communities, and of its implementation in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The Joint Committee can first examine draft Community legislation, that is to say proposals by the Commission for legislation to be enacted by the Council and report on what they feel this legislation would mean for Ireland and what our attitude towards it should be during negotiations.  The views of the Joint Committee can then be taken into account by the Government in deciding on their policy.</P>
    <P>In the second stage the Joint Committee can examine Acts of the Community institutions and consider how best any obligations for Ireland might be implemented.</P>
    <P>The third and final stage allows the Joint Committee to examine ministerial regulations made under the European Communities Act, 1972, and instruments made under other statutes in order to implement our Community obligations.  The power of the Joint Committee at this final stage is reinforced by the provisions of the European Communities (Amendment) Act, 1973, under which the Joint Committee can recommend the annulment of any ministerial regulation made under the European Communities Act.  If both Houses subsequently pass a resolution annulling the regulation in question, it will cease to have statutory effect. Thus the Joint Committee can make their views known on Community legislation before it is adopted, can say how it should be implemented in Ireland when it is adopted and can supervise its implementation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="961" /> On the question of debates on the reports of the Joint Committee, it is my intention that these should be held twice yearly at the same time as the debates in each House on the Reports on Developments in the European Communities.  These debates would then provide the House with the opportunity to examine and comment on all aspects of European affairs.  While it is my hope that such debates will be held regularly, this will be subject to the overriding consideration of the ordering of parliamentary business.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is with some degree of pleasure that I welcome the resolution before the House to re-establish the Joint Committee.  During the accession negotiations I remember I placed a number of questions to the then Minister for Foreign Affairs, now President of the country, in relation to this matter and I sought to ensure that Ireland would follow the most advanced practice adopted by the then members of the EEC in establishing committees in relation to EEC legislation. European Community legislation has as much effect on ordinary life in this country as has much of the legislation that we pass amid great controversy and publicity and it can pass into law with very little publicity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is very important that Members of this House who are in close touch with the needs of their constituents have an opportunity of expressing their views clearly to the Government through their representatives in Europe on the implication of this legislation. It is well known that the volume of legislation, in terms of paper, which has to be studied coming from the European Community is far greater than anything we can imagine in this House from our experience in scrutinising national legislation coming before us.  Therefore, quite clearly if the implications of this massive legislation are to be adequately understood as they affect us special measures are necessary to ensure that it is so examined. A special time must be set aside in which Members can engage in its study.  For that reason the setting up of this committee in previous Dáils and this one is a welcome and important step in maintaining democratic <Col N="962" /> responsibility by the EEC.  We must realise that democratic responsibility at present is not given full expression through the European Parliament. That parliament does not have the powers of a parliament such as ours in respect of the matters which come within the competence of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  Therefore there is a need for a democratic check, at national level, on the activities of the European Commission, given that the powers of the European Parliament are not sufficient and are not equal to those of the existing national parliaments of the nine member countries.</P>
    <P>Given the huge task conferred on that committee I would ask the Minister to consider very carefully whether it is given an adequate number of staff and support in terms of research for its numbers.  Where a particular regulation is drawn to the members' attention and they request their staff to seek information on it that information can and will be obtained for them.  But they have a role which is more than that of merely responding to requests from members of the public to investigate particular Bills. Theirs is a watchdog role.  It is their job to scrutinise all legislation coming before them regardless of whether there may be any agitation about it at that time because they may be the only people in a position to express a view on it or who would be taking an interest in it.  Therefore they need to have sufficient staff at least to have some acquaintance with the implications of every single item of legislation coming from the European Community, whether in the form of a directive or regulation.  Again, I would ask the Minister if he is satisfied that sufficient staff is available for that purpose.</P>
    <P>The provision under which the committee can examine draft legislation as well as regulations made by the Minister under existing directives of the Community is a most important one because it is at that stage that an influence can be had by the committee, through the Minister and the Members of the European Parliament, on the final decision.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister <Col N="963" /> also if he is satisfied that the findings of this committee are given sufficient attention in the various Departments of State to which they are directed. My experience&mdash;admittedly I was not perhaps paying as detailed attention as I should to this matter during the time I was in office in various Departments&mdash;was that perhaps sufficient attention is not given either by the office-holders or their civil servants in the various Departments to the findings of this committee.  Perhaps there is need for a special procedure to be adopted through which officers in individual Departments would be specifically charged with bringing to the attention of their Minister, in respect of any issue on which a file is submitted to him, that a view had been expressed by the committee on that particular directive and that that would be specifically noted on the file.  Otherwise, if the Minister is left to inquire of his own accord whether or not the committee have considered this matter, he may not do so and, in his decision, may not take into account the fact that a committee of this House, set up specifically for that purpose, has expressed a view on it. Perhaps the Minister would consider some special procedures in that respect.</P>
    <P>There is a last point I should like to draw to the Minister's attention. All of us who were Members of the last Dáil are aware of the form in which these reports of the committee are circulated.  They are circulated in relation to specific topics on roneod, rolled-off paper.  I wonder whether it would be appropriate to have them published in a bound form, in a way they could be more attractively presented to the public through the Government Publications Sales Office.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Just for clarification, the Deputy is speaking of the actual reports from the committee themselves?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, on individual subjects.  The committee may publish a composite report on thir total activities, but in practical terms what people will refer to and make use of, what individual groups will be interested <Col N="964" /> in is not the overall report of the committee, through which they may have to plough to find one item of direct concern to them, but rather individual reports on individual subjects. That is really what any man in a hurry wanting to reach a decision will want to refer to; he wants the bit of paper dealing with his particular interest and not a larger report he will have to plough through&mdash;of which we get loads every day in the week anyway and which probably most of us do not get round to reading.  I would ask the Minister to consider affording the committee an opportunity of some special form of publication, in an attractive form, of their reports so that every interested group in the community affected and who should know what the committee have done in relation to their matter of interest, should have this available to them.</P>
      <P>Perhaps I may make one last point. It is not one on which I am sure I am right; indeed, maybe the Minister is right and I am wrong.  The Minister is suggesting that there should be an opportunity for debating the reports of the Joint Committee.  He says it is his intention that this debate will be held twice yearly at the same time as the debates in each House of the Oireachtas on the Reports on the Development of the European Communities. That is welcome.  I merely wonder whether, from the point of view of focusing specifically on the work of the committee&mdash;which is a committee of this House&mdash;it would not be better to have a special debate on the report of the committee, separate from that on the general developments in the European Community. That would ensure that the views of a committee of this House, rather than the broad canvas of issues&mdash;which may end up becoming very political, talking about European Summits, integration and other such material&mdash;will be brought into the debate.  The result is that perhaps rather detailed and important matters of specific concern to the committee contained in their report will be lost sight of in this great, broad, general debate.  Perhaps the Minister would consider allowing a debate of a relatively limited time on the specific findings of this committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="965" /> I shall conclude by welcoming the re-introduction of this Committee and the innovative and open approach the Minister has taken on this matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I was a member of this Joint Committee of both Houses during the lifetime of the last Seanad.</P>
      <P>In relation to the remarks the Minister has made, I welcome a number of the changes that have been brought about in the operation of this committee since its inspection.  It is a good idea that it is being increased in size. It is interesting to reflect that, through experience, the delegates to the European Parliament are no longer to be statutory members of the committee. Indeed those who have their eyes set on Europe, following the direct elections, may well ponder over the question of a dual mandate when one remembers that the existing appointees to the European Parliament have found, from experience, they were unable to attend the rather occasional meetings of this Joint Committee. Therefore, it is fair to ask how candidates elected to Europe will manage to fit in the heavy commitments of being Members of this House with their commitments in Europe, when the experience in respect of this committee has shown already that it is not practicable.  This was because, on many occasions, the committee and this House sat on the same days and for the same periods as did their European counterparts.  Be that as it may, I am glad to see that a formal link will be maintained between the European representatives on the committee, that they will have the right of audience and attendance.  I am glad to notice another innovation, that is, that Members of either House who are not formal members of the committee, will now be allowed to attend and give evidence, or express points of view on topics on which they have special knowledge, because from time to time over the past number of years many of us on the committee felt that the benefit of the expertise and experience of Members of either House could have been more than useful to the operation of the committee.  But they were excluded because they were not members of the committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="966" /> It is a very good idea that the entire membership of both Houses will now be given the right of attendance and the right of audience and that the statutory members, if they are unable to attend, will now have the right to appoint a substitute.  This was introduced in relation to the informal committee set up to discuss the appointment of an ombudsman in the lifetime of the last Dáil and it was something that was found extremely useful.</P>
    <P>I listened with interest to the remarks of Deputy Bruton in regard to the appointment of staff.  It is no secret that the committee had initial teething problems in regard to the staff it regarded as essential and the number the Department of the Public Service thought adequate.  That problem was to some extent surmounted but not in an entirely satisfactory way.  It was surmounted because the staff seconded were of such high calibre that their input made up for the lack of numbers. However, I do not think that is good enough.  On a whole range of topics, if it had not been for the extensive nature of the research carried out by the small staff available, the committee would have been at a great loss in discussing many detailed and complex issues.</P>
    <P>One suggestion that might be considered is the appointment of at least one person, a local <i>gauleiter</i> as it were, to act on behalf of the committee. This person should be attached to the Irish Mission in Brussels so that when draft legislation or directives begin to circulate around the murky corridors of the Berlaymont he would be in a position to draw attention to that legislation or directives floting around in whatever the European equivalent of the Think-Tank is before reaching the stage at which it is almost too late for anyone here to do anything about it. An earlier suggestion on those lines never came to anything but it is an idea that might well be considered at a future date.</P>
    <P>Another recommendation is that members of the committee ought to be brought on a regular basis to visit the institutions of the Community and have regular meetings with senior Community officials either in Brussels or here.  From time to time community <Col N="967" /> officials visited here but those visits very often occurred at times that did not suit the members of the committee.</P>
    <P>This was a useful committee.  Being new it had teething troubles.  From time to time there was an air of unreality about the proceedings and the report and recommendations that eventually emerged dealing for the first time with very complex matters were extraordinarily useful despite the unreality that existed.  I compliment the Minister on the change and innovation he has introduced in the new committee.  If the new committee has as much attention given to it as the thought the Minister has obviously put into its inception it will in the course of this Dáil fulfil a very useful purpose.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. O'Kennedy) Michael O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. O'Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the House for its response to the motion.  While I acknowledge the recognition Members opposite have given to me I would like to say that, by and large, I have simply accepted the recommendations of the previous committee and to that extent I hope the changes which are obviously acceptable will make the work of the new committee more effective and the burden on the members a little more tolerable.  I regard this as a very important committee indeed.  It is a committee of this House.  If we are concerned with the supremacy of Parliament, which has prompted all of us to be here, we must be equally concerned that a committee of this nature, representing Parliament, will have every facility and service to undertake and carry out its heavy responsibilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of the committee is to analyse regulations and legislation emanating from the European Community. It is fair to say that legislators generally are committed members of the European Community in a sense but possibly some other countries are not.  That is not to say we overlook the responsibilities of the national Parliament. That is not to say we will take as read regulations without taking into account the special position and problems we have.  For that reason <Col N="968" /> it is essential we should have available to us the service of this committee which will take these things into account and point out to Departments and, through Departments, to the Government changes that should be made thereby making our role in the Community all the more significant.  That is the basis on which my predecessor acted.  That is the basis on which I will approach this committee.  The terms of reference derive from the experience of the last committee.  I was a member of that committee but other responsibilities prevented me from attending as often as I would have wished.  I recognise the burden of work imposed on the committee and the need to have adequate and effective support and services available to the committee.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bruton asked if I were satisfied that adequate staff and research facilities will be available to the incoming committee.  The answer at this stage has to be &ldquo;no&rdquo; because I am not aware of what the position will be or the extent to which I could possibly guarantee that extra staff and facilities will be available.  However, I would refer to the final report of the outgoing committee&mdash;Deputy Boland referred to it.  Far from expressing dissatisfaction with the staff support they were receiving, the committee were at pains to express their indebtedness to the staff for the excellent advisory service they were providing.  Deputy Boland acknowledged this and I join with him and with the outgoing committee in acknowledging on behalf of the Government the wonderful contribution the staff made and their readiness at all times to go to extremes to try to solve complex problems that arose.  They came up with enlightened advice, not always simply related to the direct work of the committee but in regard to associated matters within the Communities.  While we can rely on public servants as informed as they are, committees such as this will not have too much to worry about.  If during the course of the new committee's work there is need for consideration from the point of view of staff, obviously I will look favourably on it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="969" /> Deputy Bruton commented that the Department of the Public Service have an interest in this, and in so far as I can support the effective work of the committee I will do so.  Deputy Bruton asked if the findings of the committee had been brought to the attention of the various Departments and Ministers as quickly as they might have been.  He admitted this was not a query arising from his own experience but it was still a reasonable question to put.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I was referring specifically to the Department of Industry and Commerce, with which I was associated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot talk with experience from the last few years but I hope seriously that the recommendations and views of the committee will be brought to the attention of the Departments.  The report of the committee to which I referred earlier refers specifically to the assistance they got from the officers of the various Departments, who explained the application of the various regulations; and this we hope to be able to continue and, if possible, improve.  There is no point in getting a committee established to do a lot of work and research and then not have machinery available to enable their findings to be brought to the attention of Departments and Ministers.</P>
      <P>The from of the report was mentioned, and I should like to think that we could be guided in the first instance by the committee in this respect.  I am not aware of any suggestions from the outgoing committee as to the from of the report. That is not to say that the Deputies' apprehensions may not be well-founded and we will try to see that the attention of the new committee will be drawn to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of debates in this and the other House, up to recently, in the last three or four years, debates on the progress reports of the European Communities did not take place within a reasonable time of the publication of these reports and, as spokesman for the Opposition, I suggested that it was unsatisfactory sometimes <Col N="970" /> to have to wait almost two years after publication to have a debate on a report. So far I have succeeded in having debates on the reports as soon as possible after publication and I hope to be able to maintain that situation. From my recent experience I know the responsibilities and the obligations resting on the Minister who finds himself away from the Dáil for periods, but it is important to try to guarantee debates at regular intervals soon after publication of the reports.</P>
    <P>It would be desirable that we should debate reports of the committee at the same time.  That is not to say that the reports of the committee should be swallowed up in a broad debate on the general course of European progress or lack of it, but it is not beyond the wit of Deputies to deal with the general reports and then to turn to the reports of the committee.  The two motions could be taken separately, subject to the convenience of the House, and the two debates could occur simultaneously.  The two topics would be related.  However, knowing the pressure of parliamentary business, I cannot guarantee that what was not done in the past can be done in the future.</P>
    <P>Deputy Boland welcomed the provision effectively to increase the size of the committee.  It will be noticed that the membership will be the same but there will be an effective increase in size because EEC delegates who are also Members of the Dáil will not be <i>ex-officio</i> members of the committee. It will be easier, therefore, to get quorums which was not so in regard to the outgoing committee which had some difficulty from time to time because of absence of EEC delegates. Here we are arranging for an increase in the active and available membership. I am glad the House has welcomed the innovation that Members of either House who will not be members of the committee will have the right to attend committee meetings. More publicity should be given to the committee work of this House.  It involves a lot of detailed study and research and much hard work, sometimes unrewarded.  It should be acknowledged that these committees play a very significant role in the <Col N="971" /> effective functioning of this House.  I might mention that some of the most hard working members of the last committee from both sides of the House did not get their just merits at a later stage in the election.  Nevertheless&mdash; and I say this for the benefit of our friends in the Press and the House generally&mdash;some of the most important work is not noticed and taken into account.  I recall that some members of that committee put quite a lot of work and research into it but because it was done quietly and effectively it was not acknowledged.  It is regrettable that this kind of very effective legislative work should somehow not be acknowledged for the important contribution it makes to the workings of this House.  The fact that Members of the House can now attend those meetings should give an extra degree of prominence and I hope that the Press will take note of the importance of this committee and the significance of the work they are doing.</P>
    <P>Regarding the right to appoint a substitute, I intend to leave it to the members of the committee to decide how a substitute will be appointed. They are the best judges of the effective procedures for themselves. Whether they will limit themselves to one substitute for each member is a matter for themselves.  I expect that they will work out a reasonable and acceptable arrangement.</P>
    <P>There are two other points in relation to Brussels.  The first point concerns liaison with the Commission in Brussels.  At any time that the committee feel they need effective and direct contact with our mission in Brussels I should be very glad to promote that kind of liaison as effectively as possible.  This matter was not mentioned in the report of the committee so I could not say that I would anticipate in advance suggestions of this nature.  At the same time, it would be premature to make any suggestions as to how this could be done until such time as the committee get under way.  When they have suggestions to make I hope that I will be able to respond effectively.  Whatever advance information, based not on <Col N="972" /> rumour&mdash;incidentally, Brussels is a fairly fertile source of rumour&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>None more so than Brussels, as far as I can see.  I am not talking about Council meetings but things emanating from documents which are supposed to be coming out and have not, in fact, come out.  We have had some unfortunate evidence of that during the past few months. In so far as there is hard documentary evidence available to our mission about what has emerged or is about to emerge, I would be anxious to have that information conveyed to the committee. For the benefit of Members from the other side who will be serving in the European Assembly, even pending direct elections, I have already instructed our permanent representative in Brussels to make available to all members of the European Parliament such information in relation to the policy of our Government in the Community as they feel is necessary in the discharge of their duties.  Their response to that information is a matter for themselves.  I would hope that in matters of national interest&mdash;there are many such areas&mdash;we could see a degree of co-ordination between our members of the European Parliament which would represent a slight improvement on what we have seen over the past few years.  The facility will be there but the response to it will be a matter for the members concerned.</P>
      <P>The final point concerns regular visits to Brussels.  I thought this was a matter for a motion of the committee itself.  I am not sure.  To the extent that any committee think that the proper discharge of their duties requires or obliges them to maintain effective liaison with the Commission or the European Parliament, I would support that.  If the occasion arises it is essential that we should support the committee of this House in the work they do and the visits they might find it necessary to undertake.</P>
      <P>I should like to thank the House for the response they have given.  I hope that the deliberations of this very important committee will be effective.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to make a few points in relation to section 1, though I have not put down an amendment. I wonder whether the Minister would look at possible loopholes from the point of view of tightening up the Bill. It seems there may be loopholes which could be used to evade the spirit and the intention of this Bill which, as the Minister is aware, is accepted on both sides of this House.</P>
      <P>It was suggested to me that there were some aspects of this Bill which might provide loopholes.  There is no definition of the word &ldquo;lease&rdquo;.  I presume on that basis we go back to the definition of a lease in the 1958 Act, which is reasonably comprehensive, but there are a couple of items which possibly would not come under that definition.  Reference has been made to me regarding fee farm grants.  These are specifically referred to in the 1958 Act but there is a further reference in the 1967 Act which might give rise to some question on the point.  I wonder whether the Minister is totally satisfied that fee farm grants will be covered by this Bill.</P>
      <P>The Minister might also consider the possibility of a lease with a terminable annuity.  This would be an unusual legal animal but I can see unusual documentation being produced in an effort to evade the terms of the Bill. This possibility should be borne in mind, that is, a lease with a terminable annuity which would not be rent. Another possible loophole which should be closed off if the Minister considers it necessary is in regard to a long lease with a large fine payable by instalments.  This would not be a rent or an annuity but in effect it would amount to the same thing. There is also the possibility of a lease with what is known as mesne rates as opposed to a rent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These are a number of points which the Minister might care to consider. I appreciate that the definition in the 1958 Act refers to rent or other return but the Minister might consider on <Col N="974" /> Report Stage a tighter definition of the word &ldquo;lease&rdquo; in order to close off possible loopholes.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to another definition in relation to flats.  As the House is aware &ldquo;dwelling&rdquo; does not include a separate and self-contained flat but there appears to be no definition of &ldquo;flat&rdquo;.  Would the Minister consider it might be necessary?  These are my only points on section 1.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EileenDesmond" hpid="Mrs. Desmond Mrs. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise mainly to support Deputy O'Keeffe in his remarks in regard to flats.  In the definition section dwelling is defined as not including separate and self-contained flats in premises divided into two or more such flats.  I think it was Deputy Fitzpatrick who raised this on the Second Stage and I think the Minister undertook to reconsider it between then and the Committee Stage.  It seems to me that there is some inequity in excluding flats from the provisions of the Bill.  I am not so concerned about what are generally regarded as very exclusive flats but there is a movement towards the sale or buying of flats by retired people for various reasons.  For health reasons they may want the services or amenities provided with such flats.  It seems inequitable not to provide for the inclusion of flats in the Bill.  I should like to hear the Minister on that point.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. G. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputies for their comments on the section.  I am very conscious of the fears they have in regard to loopholes that might interfere with the spirit of the Bill.  That would be undesirable in the extreme.  The Bill has been given very careful consideration and detailed examination to try to block any possible loopholes and prevent any arising.  Irrespective, however, of the examination or the work put into the preparation of legislation experience has shown that loopholes do appear.  Sometimes they are quite serious, unfortunately.  In recent weeks we have had notice in another area of a loophole that is causing much concern and about which we shall hear more shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All possible consideration was given to the preparation of the Bill to prevent <Col N="975" /> loopholes as far as possible.  As regards the definition of dwelling, it is so defined as to provide for the specific exclusion of multiple dwelling buildings from the scope of the proposed prohibition on the creation of future ground rents, the exclusion, that is, of separate and self-contained flats in premises divided into two or more such flats.  In recent years such flats have occasionally been bought and sold by way of leases that in everyday language would be called ground leases, leases where the fine for the grant of the lease effectively represents the purchase price and the lease is granted for a long term at a rent less than the rateable valuation or some other leasing arrangement with substantially the same effect. It is a moot point whether such leases or any of them could carry the right to purchase the fee simple under the 1967 Ground Rents Act, that is to say whether such leases can properly be called ground leases.  Since the proposed prohibition on the creation of future ground rents is being confined to ordinary dwelling houses, it is not intended to interfere with transactions involving such flats.  Whatever the position may be regarding the right to purchase the fee simple where such flats are concerned they are being specifically excluded in this Bill.</P>
    <P>Regarding the definition of the word &ldquo;lease&rdquo; mentioned by Deputy O'Keeffe and Deputy Mrs. Desmond this is very clearly spelt out in the 1958 Act and section 5 of this Bill ties it up and makes it fairly tight.  I am satisfied on the advice available to me that the Bill prohibits the giving of fee farm grants and this is as it should be.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a couple of other matters such as the types of possible loopholes.  Obviously, this would require a little research and I would ask the Minister just to check and see that the items I mentioned are covered by the definition in the 1958 Act or if not, that a new definition be inserted.</P>

Perhaps I could deal with this particular point first as a separate issue.  If I may say so, it is the main issue which I take with this Bill.  I have put down these amendments and I am speaking to them but I am in no way critical of the present Minister because I accept that this Bill as drafted is taken mainly from section 108 of the Landlord and Tenant Bill&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;as produced by the former Government with the addition of four amendments put down to that Bill by the former Minister.  I mention that merely as background. I take issue with the idea as to how the job should be done.  Section 2 provides&mdash;and this is the basic provision &mdash;that a lease of land made after the passing of the Act would be void if the lessee had these rights.  It is the use of the word &ldquo;void&rdquo; and the consequences of this that I worry about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we try to achieve the desired results in the form of the present Bill it seems to me that there is considerable danger that the tenant or the lessee, the house purchaser, is the person who would suffer.  I say this from my practical experience as a lawyer dealing with house purchase over quite a <Col N="977" /> number of years.  The normal procedure is that somebody buying a house enters a contract of purchase whether for lease or fee simple, but very often in the past a contract for a lease, plus a building contract.  This contract usually takes at least six months or longer to complete.</P>
    <P>The purchaser normally obtains sanction for a loan from a building society, county council or corporation. He does not actually get the loan until the house is finished and he gets his title usually by way of lease.  Meantime, he is paying bridging finance. My worry and the reason I put down the amendment is that if we let the subsection stand and we declare that lease to be void, initially at any rate it is the house purchaser, the tenant who would suffer.  It is all very well to say that the house purchaser has the right to acquire the fee simple under subsection (4).  He can acquire the fee simple under the 1967 Act at the expense of the lessor.  As the Minister is aware there is, as things presently stand, a very considerable delay in practice from the time the first notice to acquire under the 1967 Act is served to the day the lessee actually gets freehold title.  My concern is that in the meantime the house purchaser, the tenant, would be paying bridging interest perhaps over a very long period, a year or so.  In the meantime I am quite certain any lending institution would not give him his mortgage because the section actually declares that the title he got is void.  A lending institution would, therefore, be made to give him a mortgage.  It could be taken as a matter of practicality that that would not arise.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that under the terms of this Bill the normal procedures will change and that it would be unusual rather than usual that this situation would arise.  It could arise in the instance of a father who has property transferred to his son.  It probably will not arise in the case of large-scale building developments but it could arise in many isolated cases.  I would like to hear the Minister's views on this.  I am not suggesting this amendment as a procedural point.  I am suggesting it because I feel there is a <Col N="978" /> grave, practical danger that house owners could be seriously inconvenienced and put to very considerable expense if this section stands making void the lease he would get.</P>
    <P>I would be quite happy if the Minister would accept my point in principle and to have the matter go back to his draftsman to tighten it up, because I do not consider myself an expert at drafting.  My proposal is that, instead of making the lease void, the provision in relation to rent would be rendered void.  That would mean that the house purchaser would still get a valid title on which he could complete his purchase and his mortgage and, in addition, could also complete in due time the purchase of the free-hold. He would not be held up with the completion of his purchase and his mortgage in the meantime.</P>
    <P>I have done some investigation into the background of this.  There is a precedent for my suggestion.  In the last century there was a regular procedure for granting leases for life at the end of which in many cases a fine would be reserved on renewal of that lease.  In 1849 the Renewable Leasehold Conversion Act was passed, which was similar to the Bill we are now debating. That Act prohibited the payment of any fine on the conversion of a lease for life on its termination.  The Minister might check the provisions of that Act to see if the precedents that are there might be useful in dealing with this particular problem.  The basic point is the question of the principle as to whether the title the lessee should get would be void.  I feel, as the section now stands, there is a danger of the baby being thrown out with the bath water.  I ask the Minister to consider very carefully the invidious position a house purchaser might find himself in if this section stands as it is drafted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the amendments in the name of Deputy O'Keeffe is to delete the proposal in section 2 that would make void any attempted creation of a new ground lease of a dwelling house and to replace it with a provision that would simply make void the reservation of a ground rent in such a lease.  This would <Col N="979" /> mean that ground leases of dwelling houses could continue to be created as heretofore and ground rents, however, could not.  During the course of the Second Reading of this Bill I made it clear that the purpose of the Bill is to put an end to the leasehold system so far as new houses are concerned and to ensure that in future owner occupiers of such houses will hold the fee simple, that is that they will be the full owners of their property.</P>
      <P>Ground rent is an important component of the leasehold system that is being ended but it is not the only component.  The house purchaser could still be bound by covenants imposed by the lessor and by holding for a term of years rather than forever would still be denied full ownership of his house if ground leases of new houses could continue to be created.  Moreover, the simpler and less expensive system of legal titles to dwelling houses based on ownership in fee simple that the Bill as it stands would help to create would not be brought about.</P>
      <P>I know the spokesman for the Fine Gael Party indicated in his opening remarks that he was speaking on the amendments rather than for them, that he wants to open discussion on the matter to see that we do not create more difficulties by the fact that we have new legislation.  I should point out that those amendments would represent a policy that is at variance with the policy of his party, when in Government up to recently, in regard to the legislation which was then before the House.  In section 108 of the Landlord and Tenant Bill, 1977, which lapsed with the dissolution of the last Dáil, the Government proposed, as my Bill does, to make void any future ground lease of a dwelling house and not merely the rent reserved in any such lease.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I feel, for the sake of putting the record straight, that I should say, arising out of one of the earlier remarks of Deputy O'Keeffe, that the Bill we are now debating is not exactly what his party were doing or what they proposed to do in the Bill which lapsed. There are three basic fundamental differences which, in fairness to all concerned, Deputy O'Keeffe must admit <Col N="980" /> are in existence.  While I am always ready and willing to give credit for achievement to members of any political party for whatever work they might do, I believe that is a two-way thing and the differences which I have in the Bill we are debating show clearly that my Bill&mdash;I am not trying to score any political points whatsoever on it&mdash;is a better Bill because it includes local authority housing.  I am sure Deputy O'Keeffe will readily admit that the Bill which lapsed did not include local authority housing.</P>
    <P>I am sure he will also agree with me that there is another fundamental difference in this Bill which was not in the Bill his party proposed to bring in.  There is an extension in the type of leases which are to be prevented. As well as that, the Deputy will be aware that I have dropped a provision which would have avoided a lease of a non-dwelling which was converted to a dwelling for the simple reason that it would have led to many practical difficulties.  I say that for the sake of the record without any political malice whatsoever, as I am sure Deputy O'Keeffe readily understands.  Every person is allowed now and again to light up one's own candle particularly when there is every good reason why one should.</P>
    <P>For the sake of the record I might mention that during the Second Reading debate practically all speakers from the Opposition benches went to great pains to tell me that I inherited this legislation.  I inherited a good share of it but the Bill before us contains basic fundamental differences which give me a claim on it too.  I am now making that claim as strongly as I can.</P>
    <P>The amendments in the name of Deputy O'Keeffe to this section strike at the basic philosophy of the Bill in which the Government are giving full ownership to people of their dwellings and are not merely removing the financial consequences of the leasehold system.  I am satisfied that this is what is intended.  Perhaps, having heard me now, Deputy O'Keeffe will be prepared to concede and will realise that acceptance of his amendments would amount to a basic fundamental policy difference from that which his party <Col N="981" /> had in mind when they brought what we shall call the mother Bill before the House in February or March last.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>The basic point is in connection with the use of the word &ldquo;void&rdquo;.  The Minister says it is the policy of the Government to try to ensure that house owners are freehold owners of their property.  I subscribe totally to that view but, on the one hand, what is proposed here&mdash;I accept that the Minister's predecessor was the author of the relevant phraseology but presumably he, too, was advised by the people who are advising this Minister&mdash;is that what the householder would be getting is a void lease with a right to acquire freehold.  On the other hand, I am suggesting that the householder would get a valid lease with no entitlement on the landlord to enforce the rent and, in addition, the same right, to acquire the freehold.  In accordance with the section as drafted the householder would be getting a bad title initially but with a statutory right to freehold whereas under the system I am suggesting he would get a good title initially with the additional bonus that he would not have to pay any rent and would have the same entitlement to acquire the freehold at the expense of the lessor.</P>
      <P>If one compares the two systems he will realise that both achieve the same result.  I am suggesting that the house purchaser under the system I propose, by avoiding the use of the word &ldquo;void&rdquo; in relation to title, would be far better off while the fundamental principle of the Bill would not be affected in any way.  The purchaser has the same right under subsection (4) to get the freehold at the expense of the lessor.  That would apply in both cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="982" /> I urge the Minister to give serious consideration to what I am saying in the interest of house purchasers.  I am speaking as a practical lawyer, aware of the difficulties that can exist for someone trying to buy a house and paying for bridging finance for possibly an extended period.  Under the system proposed in the Bill there could be much more serious financial obligations for a house purchaser during the period when he has a bad title and is awaiting freehold.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that there are aspects of leaseholds other than the aspect of ground rent.  There is, for instance, the question of covenants, but here again covenants may attach to a freehold conveyance.  In some cases house owners would probably wish this to be the case because if there are covenants restricting a householder in an estate, for example, from doing something, he will be aware that all the other householders in that estate are restricted similarly and to that extent he will regard himself as being protected.  I have known house purchasers to inquire whether there was some restriction that would prevent, say, a betting shop, from being set up next door.  In other words, people try to ensure that there will be some protection for their investment. However, in a freehold conveyance it is possible to put in covenants.  There are fine differences between what one might call positive covenants and negative covenants.  It is my recollection that in a freehold conveyance, negative covenants were always considered to be enforceable but perhaps that is something the Minister might check.</P>
    <P>I do not consider it correct that covenants would be possible.  There-fore, on both counts I suggest strongly to the Minister that it is more in the interest of a house purchaser to adopt my suggestion.  The same result would be achieved because there is entitlement in subsection (4) to acquire free-hold for nothing.  It is the delay I am concerned with.  On that point, there was a good section in the former Minister's Bill which would have allowed for an easier system of acquisition. This provision is not included here but hopefully, it will be included either in <Col N="983" /> the new Landlord and Tenant Bill or in some other measure.  As of now the procedure for purchasing freehold can be a very long drawn out and complicated affair.  Not only is there the problem of tracing the title owners or of tracing all the intermediate titles but of tracing all the mortgages on those interests.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister strongly, not in any political sense but having regard to the practicalities I have enunciated and in the interest of house purchasers, to consider the system I propose.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>It is difficult to say to someone who is making a case for an amendment which one knows one cannot accept that his arguments are good but that is the situation in this case.  I am saying that very sincerely. The Deputy's arguments are good but in fairness if the amendments were accepted they would have very grave consequences so far as the Bill is concerned.</P>
      <P>If the Deputy is anxious about the effect of a voiding on a tenant who receives a void lease, he might have a look at subsection (4) of section 2 where the person in question is given a right to a fee simple.  I have all the assurances that it is possible to have that in regard to the way I am approaching the problem the tenant is protected fully.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Keeffe's arguments against voiding the lease centre around the problems arising if a person chooses to ignore the law.  Unfortunately his solution to that problem would do severe harm to the Bill and would probably destroy the Bill.  My solution is to give the tenant rights to safeguard his position under section 2 (4). I readily admit that there will be conveyancing difficulties, but all those involved in this type of work should as quickly as possible take whatever practical steps are necessary, to avoid giving leases which are void.  The Deputy will probably agree with me, when I am not prepared to sacrifice the principles of the Bill by accepting his amendment.</P>

      <P>In page 2, subsection (4), line 37, after &ldquo;lease&rdquo; to add &ldquo;but such right to acquire shall not apply where permanent buildings have been erected in breach of covenant&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is an addition that I am proposing. It is purely a procedural point that I am not unduly worried about.  It occurred to me that a problem could arise in relation to subsection (4).  It is merely not giving the lessee the right to acquire the freehold at the expense of the lessor, where he puts up permanent buildings in breach of a covenant.  I can envisage a situation where a lease could be given for a specific purpose, maybe for an industrial purpose, and there could be a provision that a dwelling-house would not be erected at all.  It would seem to be wrong that if the dwelling-house in question is put up in breach of covenant, that the provisions of section 4 should apply to the title in that case.</P>

      <P>The part of this Bill that we are talking about is extremely complicated.  It could be regarded as one of the most complex pieces of legislation that could come before the House in any Bill.  I am afraid this amendment is unacceptable for valid reasons.  The first reason relates to the case where the building lease has been given before this Bill <Col N="985" /> has become law and that lease contains a covenant against the erection of any further buildings on the land. The lessee under the building lease in breach of that covenant erects a further dwelling-house&mdash;for instance, on the land&mdash;and after the Bill has become law he sells that new house and site by way of a sublease.  Section 2 (4) of the Bill is designed to protect the purchaser of that new house.  If this amendment were accepted the purchaser of that house in the case described would be deprived of that protection.</P>
      <P>The case that the amendment appears to be designed to cater for is the case where a lease of vacant land is made and the lessee in breach of a covenant in the lease erects a dwelling-house on the land.  This case is catered for by section 2 (3) of the Bill which, quite properly, gives no relief to the lessee in such a case.  It is very easy to misread this section but perhaps the Deputy would agree that the case he is trying to cater for is already catered for in subsection (3). I believe that Deputy O'Keeffe's amendment would leave a gap where a genuine tenant would be unprotected although the buildings were put up in breach of covenant not by him but by an intermediate landlord. The reasons why the amendment is unacceptable are weighty in that we would be creating extra difficulties.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 6:</P>
      <P>In page 3, to delete subsection (5), lines 1 to 12, and to substitute:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(5) (a) Where, immediately before the passing of this Act&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i) a person holds land under a lease for a term of not less than ninety-nine years, of which at least fifty years are unexpired, and</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="986" /> (ii) permission exists under Part IV of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963 (including permission granted on an outline application under regulations made under section 25 of that Act) for the development of the land, wholly or mainly by the construction of dwellings,</P>
    <P>that person shall, during the period of one year after such passing, have the right to acquire under the Act of 1967 the fee simple in the land and any intermediate interests therein, except in a case in which he has entered into an enforceable agreement with another person for the assignment to that person of his interest under the lease or for the grant of a lease for a term of not less than ninety-nine years, in which case the latter person shall during that period of one year have such right.</P>
    <P>(b) Section 18 (1) (b) of the Act of 1967 (which refers to the maximum purchase price) shall not apply in any such case.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This amendment involves a substitution of a new subsection for the present subsection.  The requirement in the present provision to hold under a lease for a 99-year term is being modified to provide that the lease must have at least 50 years to run.  In addition to a developer or builder who holds land under a lease benefiting from the provision, such a person will also benefit if he has an enforceable agreement for a lease without actually having obtained the lease itself at the time the Bill becomes law.  The sub-section in the form proposed in this amendment makes it clear that the required planning permission must exist at the time the Bill becomes law. The subsection in the new form proposed makes it clear that outline planning permission will satisfy the planning permission requirement.</P>
    <P>As regards the modification of the requirement to hold under a lease for a 99-year term to provide that that lease must have at least 50 years to run, the Parliamentary Committee of the Incorporated Law Society have argued that, while a leasehold term for <Col N="987" /> a full 99 years may not be necessary to secure finance for private housing, a term of at least 50 years is necessary. It follows that the relief that the sub-section proposes for house builders and developers should be confined to cases where the relevant lease has at least 50 years to run, and that the right to acquire the fee simple should not be given in cases where there is no reasonable possibility that the dwelling-houses could be built on the lands.  The Parliamentary Committee of the Incorporated Law Society also argued that such a developer or builder up to the present has quite often proceeded with his development on the basis of an agreement for a lease before he has obtained the lease of the lands.  To deny the right to acquire the fee simple in such a case would be as unfair, and could have the same dislocating effect, as to deny that right to a developer who has already been granted a lease at the date on which the Bill becomes law.</P>
    <P>A change of a minor nature is that the subsection as proposed to be amended now makes it clearer than does the subsection in the Bill as intiated that the planning permission that is required must exist at the time the Bill becomes law, that is that this requirement would not be satisfied if planning permission were obtained only during the period of one year after the Bill has become law.  A further change of a minor nature proposed is to allay certain doubts that have been expressed.  The subsection now makes it clear that the requirement to have obtained planning permission will be satisfied if outline planning permission has been obtained.</P>
    <P>It is only right that the Parliamentary Committee of the Incorporated Law Society should be thanked for their careful examination of the Bill at such short notice.  It is again only right and fair that it should be said that a practical outcome of discussions with them has resulted in this amendment being put down by me.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the amendment by the Minister, which is <Col N="988" /> rightly the substitution of a new sub-section, I accept entirely that it is a tighter and better subsection as amended by the Minister, and I accept it in principle.  I would like to deal with a few points in relation to it.</P>
      <P>Under amendment No. 7 I want to add the words &ldquo;or housing authority&rdquo; after the word &ldquo;person&rdquo;.  It may be that this situation is covered under the Interpretation Act.  I do not know whether the word &ldquo;person&rdquo; would cover a housing authority under that Act.  If it does not, I suggest that the power under this subsection should be extended to the housing authority.  We have two situations that would have to be faced by the housing authority. The first is that they are being given power under this Bill&mdash;in fact they will be obliged in future&mdash;when making a transfer order to convey a free-hold title as opposed to a leasehold title, and a possibility might be that they would not have the freehold title. I want to be sure that the housing authority would be in the same situation as a private individual.</P>
      <P>The second and more important matter is the sale of serviced sites by housing authorities.  Here again, I want to ensure that the housing authority would have the same power as a private individual.  The Minister is aware that it is common practice nowadays for a housing authority or local authority to acquire land, lay on services and sell those serviced sites at reasonable cost.  This is a very worthy type of development, but there might be complications in relation to the filling of a freehold title by that local authority or housing authority because under the 1967 Act the right to acquire the fee simple does not arise until the property is built on.  This may be a groundless fear on my part because the housing authority would probably have certain compulsory powers under other sections, but I raise this matter so that the Minister can have a look into it to ensure that the local authority would first of all be able to give free-hold title on sale to tenants; and secondly, and more importantly, would be able to give freehold title in the sale of serviced sites.  That point relates to amendments Nos. 7 and 8.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="989" /> The only other point on subsection (5) which concerns me is the right given during one year to acquire under the 1967 Act.  I am not concerned so much with the right, with which I totally agree, as with defining exactly when that right would expire in effect. If during the term of one year after the passing of the Act the leasehold owner serves a notice of intention to acquire the fee simple as opposed to going through the whole procedure of acquiring fee simple, will he come within the terms of this subsection? It is to clarify that point that I put down this amendment because, as I mentioned when discussing an earlier subsection, the procedure for acquisition under the 1967 Act is cumbersome and slow.  If this subsection were interpreted as meaning that all that procedure had to be gone through and the conveyance completed within that year, then this subsection would be worthless.  Apart from anything else, these procedures can be slowed up and delayed in many cases.  In many cases there are searches for people, notices have to be served, some cases have to go to arbitration, and so on.  I would like to be sure that the right given would be fully satisfied if the person took the first step only during the year, that is served the notice of intention to acquire.  If that is the case possibly some slight change should be made to cover that point.</P>
    <P>Going back to definitions, what would be the situation if the person in question held the property under a fee farm grant?  Would this qualify as being a lease of not less than 99 years? It should but I am wondering whether it should be made clearer.</P>
    <P>Another question that occurs to me is this.  What would happen in the future at the expiry of this year? Suppose somebody has development plans in respect of which he has a leasehold title and he has not got planning permission at this stage.  He may have applied for it or he may not apply for it until some time in the future.  If he gets his planning permission, would the Minister give some consideration as to how he could be helped?  Under the 1967 Act if in the future he got planning permission he <Col N="990" /> would not have the entitlement to acquire until the houses were built.  On the other hand, he could not give leases to prospective purchasers because such leases would be void.  In addition he could not give the freehold because he would not have it.  It is a vicious circle.</P>
    <P>This is an aspect that should be considered.  As I see it, the danger is that a certain amount of land that might be available for future development could, in a sense, be sterilised, that it could not be sold.  Perhaps the Minister would bear those points in mind before the matter is considered on Report Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the inclusion of subsection (5).  The new section tightens up considerably on the existing one.  The insistence on planning permission being in existence at the time of the passing of the legislation is a good one.  I welcome also the provision in relation to outline planning permission.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 9 refers to the serving of notice within one year.  This Bill is a highly technical one and those of us who have no legal training may find it difficult to comprehend fully. Public representatives know of the many difficulties that come to light when trying to trace ground rent landlords. ACRA are very concerned about this matter and have put forward a solution.  It is that, where the whereabouts of the ground rent landlord are not known and where the matter cannot be proceeded with, it should be sufficient to put a public notice in the newspapers stating that the tenant has the intention of buying the ground rent and that any owner or any person having title should make a claim within a period of a year.  Perhaps the Minister would have some comment on that?  In view of the difficulty that exists in tracing landlords and also taking account of the long and protracted legal proceedings, it should be sufficient to serve notice of intention to purchase.  I would ask the Minister to accept amendment No.9.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of queries have been raised on amendments Nos. 7 and 8 and I shall try <Col N="991" /> to answer them.  With regard to the amendments themselves, I am satisfied they are not necessary.  It is only in very exceptional circumstances that local authorities acquire or hold land on a leasehold basis.  In that event, if the authority want to do so and if it is necessary, they can acquire the fee simple by means of a compulsory purchase order.  Deputy O'Keeffe made this point.</P>
      <P>The Minister for the Environment and officials in his Department are quite happy with the safeguards available under existing legislation.  Also I am advised that the definition of &ldquo;person&rdquo; includes &ldquo;housing authority&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>With regard to the sale of housing sites by local authorities sold under section 38 of the Housing Act, I understand there is no problem in giving the fee simple.  With regard to fee farm grants coming under section 2 (5), if the land is built on the grantee has the right to purchase the fee simple under the 1967 Act.  If it is not built on, he is covered by section 2 (5). Such a lease is defined as including a fee farm grant in the 1958 Act.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Keeffe spoke about a vicious circle being created and we are still trying to unravel that one.  I gather it is catered for in the 1967 Act&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>

      <P>It would be if the planning permission and the 50 years were there at the time of the passing of this legislation.  My question referred to a situation where the planning permission is not in existence on the passing of this legislation.  The Minister may not be getting the point.  What about a case of somebody who had not planning permission at this stage but who got it in the future?  If he wanted to develop the property he would not have the right to acquire <Col N="992" /> under the 1967 Act because it was not built on, and he would not have the right to acquire under section 2 (5) because planning permission did not exist at the time of passing of the legislation.  The property could not be developed.  The person had only a lease to give but under this legislation he could not give a lease and would not be able to get the freehold.</P>

      <P>Of course we want to avoid the creation of further ground rents, but surely the Minister is not suggesting that we want to take from potential development land the possibility of development?  Surely he is not suggesting we should sterilise it from a legal point of view?  Surely the Minister will agree that if such land gets planning permission&mdash;for instance, for building houses&mdash;that it should not be taken out of circulation?  This point might be considered.  I do not see a ready answer.  The only answer in the future may be to extend the right to the acquisition of the freehold.</P>

      <P>The last point on this subsection relates to my amendment No. 9.  It is a question of the words &ldquo;the right to acquire&rdquo;.  I make the point that this could give rise to doubt in the future.  Is a person entitled to exercise this right by serving the purchase notice under the 1967 Act, or would he have to go through all the formalities and get his conveyance within the year?  If that were the situation this subsection would end up being worthless.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Under amendment No. 9 Deputy Desmond raised this point also.  The amendment, if accepted, could be misleading.  It is a question of statutory interpretation here.  The amendment is unnecessary because it is already the case that, under the proposal as it stands in section 2 (5) (a) &mdash;a proposal that will not be affected by the amendments of section 2 (5) (a) I am moving&mdash;the period of one year after the Bill becomes law, a person seeking to acquire the fee simple under the 1967 Act serves notice under section 4 of that Act of his intention to do so.  Clearly the actual conveyance of the fee simple might not be completed within the period of one year; but there are ample precedents, even under the Landlord and Tenant Acts themselves, where such a time limit requires not that the proceedings should be completed within the time limit but that they should formally have commenced within the time limit &mdash;not necessarily be completed but have commenced.  There is the example of section 9 of the Landlord and Tenant (Amendment) Act of 1971 and section 3 (6) of the 1967 Ground Rents Act itself.  One might also say section 41 of the Landlord and Tenant Bill of 1977, as proposed by my predecessor, that lapsed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from being unnecessary, the <Col N="994" /> amendment could be misleading, since by distinguishing the service of notice of the intention to acquire the fee simple from the acquisition itself, it would if accepted imply that not only would a person have to serve that notice within the period of one year but would also have to complete the acquisition within the year.  Apart from being impractical this is not what is intended.</P>
    <P>Again this was a point raised by the Parliamentary Committee of the Incorporated Law Society who discussed the matter, and I am satisfied that the law as it stands caters for the position the Deputy is trying to bring about.</P>

      <P>My only purpose in putting down this amendment was to put this in explicit terms.  My amendment was to ensure that it included &ldquo;provided he had served notice of intention to purchase the fee simple under the Act of 1967 within the said period&rdquo;.

    <P>(a) a sublease of any portion of the land shall not be terminated thereby, if the buildings referred to in subsection (3) are not constructed, either wholly or in part, on that portion,</P>
    <P>(b) the person who would, but for this subsection become entitled by virtue of the voidance to the possession of the land comprised in the sublease shall become entitled to the reversion on the sublease and to the benefit of the rent reserved by and the covenants and conditions contained in the sublease, and</P>
    <P>(c) the sublessee shall, from the date of the voidance, hold the land demised to him at whichever of the following rents is the greater&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i) the rent reserved by the sublease, or</P>
    <P>(ii) such portion of the rent reserved by the avoided lease as is fairly attributable to the land comprised in the sublease.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This amendment is designed to cater for a situation the possibility of which was raised in the course of considering observations on the Bill, again furnished by the Parliamentary Committee of the Incorporated Law Society.  It could happen that a long-term lease of land is made after this Bill has become law and that a sublease is made of part of the land held under that lease.  After the land held under the sublease has been developed &mdash;say, by the construction thereon of industrial premises&mdash;the lessee under the original lease construct houses on the remainder of the Under section 2 (1) of the Bill this could render the entire lease void.</P>
    <P>Sections 20 and 21 of the Landlord and Tenant (Reversionary Leases) Act of 1958 contain provisions to protect any sublessee whose lease is a building or proprietary lease in a case where his lessor's lease is terminated for non-payment <Col N="996" /> of rent, breach of covenant and so on.  In such a case these provisions of the 1958 Act have the effect of making the building lessee or proprietary lessee, as the case may be, a direct lessee, of the lessor who gave the terminated lease.  The amendment now proposed would give the same protection to an innocent sublessee in a case where a lease was rendered void under section 2 (1) of this Bill.</P>

      <P>There was one point about which I was concerned and which did not arise in the course of discussion on amendments.  It was section 2 (3).  The Minister in his Second Reading speech referred to this section and said that if a long lease of land is made in the future, if that land has a house built on it subsequently, and the total area of the land is such that all of the land is subsidiary and ancillary to the house, then that lease will be rendered void by section 2 (3).</P>

Moreover, apart from the question of attempted evasion, genuine doubt might be entertained as to the effect of the prohibition in subsection (1) in the case of land held under a lease made after the Bill becomes law where the erection of a dwelling-house was contemplated. Accordingly, both for the removal of doubts and to prevent evasions, subsection (3) makes it clear that the proposed prohibition does indeed extend to such cases.

As a practising lawyer I am concerned about the possibility of house purchasers getting into serious difficulty over this and I understood the Minister was prepared to consider the suggestions I made.

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Ba mhaith liom i dtosach mo bhuíochas a ghabháil leis na Teachtaí a ghlac leis an Bhille seo gan mórán ama acu é a scrúdú.  Bhí gá géar leis an Bhille agus sin é an fá a bhí orainn é a thabhairt isteach inniu.  Is é cuspóir an Bhille ná an uasteorainn a dhúbailt ó £25 mhilliún go £50 milliún do na hairleacain as an bPríomh-Chiste chuig Gaeltarra Éireann&mdash;caipiteal neamhvótáilte mar a thugtar air.  Uasteorainn £½ mhilliún a leagadh síos sa bhliain 1957&mdash;faoin gcéad Acht um Thionscail na Gaeltachta a bhunaigh Gaeltarra mar bhord reachtúil&mdash;agus ardaíodh í don chéad uair sa bhliain 1965 nuair a tugadh cumhachtaí breise do Ghaeltarra chun an tionsclaíocht a fhorbairt ar fud na Gaeltachta.</P>
      <P>Is faoi na cumhachtaí bhreise sin is mó atá Gaeltarra ag gníomhú riamh ó shin agus, ar ndóigh, bíonn an caiteachas ag dul i méid i gcónaí.  I dtús na bliana seo socraíodh go mbeadh airleacan £4.8 milliún ar fáil do Ghaeltarra don bhliain ach táimse tar éis an soláthar sin a mhéadú go £7 milliún agus tá £6.4 milliún de eisithe go dtí seo.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I mí Iúil, 1975, a glacadh le huasteorainn £25 milliún do na hairleacain agus, ós rud é go sroichfear go luath <Col N="1000" /> í, is mithid í a ardú arís anois.  Tá fonn ormsa an méadú is mó dá ndearnadh riamh a dhéanamh agus dá réir sin tá £25 mhilliún eile á chur léi sa Bhille seo.</P>
    <P>Ní miste a lua nach mbaineann an Bille le caipiteal vótáilte Ghaeltarra, is é sin, an caipiteal a chuirtear ar fáil trí Vóta Roinne na Gaeltachta gach bliain chun na deontais a íocann Gaeltarra le tionscail a ghlanadh.</P>
    <P>Tá cur síos ar an gcaiteachas ar mhaithe le tionscail Ghaeltachta go dtí deireadh na blina seo caite le fáil i dTuarascáil agus Chuntais Ghaeltarra don bhliain 1976 atá leagtha faoi bhráid na Dála.  Ó thaobh na n-airleacan i rith na bliana sin luaitear sa tuarascáil</P>
    <P>&mdash;gur eisíodh £5.6 milliún chuig Gaeltarra,</P>
    <P>&mdash;gur caitheadh £2.6 milliún ar scaireanna i gcuideachtaí éagsúla, agus</P>
    <P>&mdash;gur caitheadh £2.9 milliún ar mhonarchanna lena ligean ar cíos.</P>
    <P>I ndeireadh na bliana 1976 bhí scaireanna ag Gaeltarra i 72 chuideachta ar a n-áirítear</P>
    <P>&mdash;fochuideachtaí (16) ina raibh na scaireanna uile ag Gaeltarra, agus tionscail a bhíodh á reachtáil go díreach ag Gaeltarra féin cheana ina measc, agus</P>
    <P>&mdash;comhchuideachtaí (56) nach raibh ach cuid de na scaireanna ag Gaeltarra iontu.</P>
    <P>D'íoc Gaeltarra deontais chaipitil agus oiliúna dar luach £1.7 milliún le roinnt de na cuideachtaí sin sa bhliain 1976. Chomh maith leis sin, d'íoc Gaeltarra beagnach £½ mhilliún ar mhaithe le miontionscadail gan scaireanna a ghlacadh iontu: anuas go dtí deireadh na bliana 1976 tugadh deontais do 350 miontionscadal den saghas sin.</P>
    <P>De réir na tuarascála céanna bhí 3,502 dhuine ag obair go lánaimseartha ar 31 Nollaig, 1976, sna tionscail uile a fuair cúnamh ó Ghaeltarra.  Cé nach beag an dul chun cinn atá déanta ó tugadh na cumhachtaí breise do Ghaeltarra sa bhliain, 1965, ní miste a lua gur leagadh síos sprioc sa bhliain <Col N="1001" /> 1971: is é sin, lánfhostaíocht sna seachtóidí do na cainteoirí Gaeilge sa Ghaeltacht.  Ní dóigh liom gur tháinig méadú tapaidh go leor ar an bhfostaíocht go dtí seo chun an sprioc sin a bhaint amach taobh istigh de chúpla bliain eile.  Tuigim, ar ndóigh, go raibh deacrachtaí ann le roinnt blianta anuas ach beidh mé ag súil le plean chun an lánfhostaíocht sa Ghaeltacht a bhaint amach a luaithe is féidir sna hochtóidí.</P>
    <P>Beidh Údarás na Gaeltachta le bunú an bhliain seo chugainn agus beidh deis againn an scéal ar fad a phlé go luath nuair a bheidh Bille chun na críche sin os comhair na Dála.  Idir an dá linn, táim cinnte nach miste bheith ag brath ar Ghaeltarra brú ar aghaidh go tréan leis an obair agus is mar chabhair chuige sin atáim ag iarraidh ar an Dáil glacadh leis an Bhille gairid seo.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBegley" hpid="Mr. Begley Mr. Begley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Begley</NameTxt>
      <P>Tá áthas orm fáilte a chur roimh an Bhille.  Ar dtús ba mhaith liom comhghairdeas a dhéanamh leis an Aire toisc gur cheapadh é mar Aire na Gaeltachta, agus cuireann sé áthas orm leis gur cheap an Taoiseach Aire i gcomhair na Gaeltachta, mar go dtí seo nuair a bhí Fianna Fáil i gceannas ní raibh acu ach Rúnaí Parlaiminte.</P>
      <P>Léiríonn an Bille seo do mhuintir na hÉireann an dea-obair a dhein an Teachta O'Donnell fad agus bhí sé in a Aire.  Mar a dúirt an tAire in a ráiteas, seo an tríú Bille i gceann cúpla bliain.  D'árdaigh an chéad Bille an méid ó £6 mhilliún go £10 milliún, agus ansin go dtí £25 mhilliún, agus anois go £50 milliún, sin i gceann cúpla mí tar éis an Comhrialtas dul as oifig.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ní aontaím leis an Aire nuair a deireann sé nach bhfuil sé sásta le Gaeltarra Éireann agus an obair atá á dhéanamh acu, mar measaim go léiríonn an Bille seo go bhfuil Gaeltarra Éireann ag dul an tslí cheart.  An taon rud atá ag cur isteach orm ná an deifir mhór atá ar an Aire an Bille seo a thabhairt isteach, nó, mar a deirtear as Béarla, &ldquo;indecent haste&rdquo;.  Níl a fhios agam cén fáth mar ar an 10 Samhain chuir me ceist air an raibh sé beartaithe aige reachtaíocht a <Col N="1002" /> thabhairt isteach chun iasacht chaipitiúil Ghaeltarra Éireann a mhéadú, agus sé an freagra a thug sé ná:</P>
    <P>Glacaim agam gurb iad na hairleacain a eisítear as an bPríomh-Chiste chuig Gaeltarra Éireann atá i gceist ag an Teachta.  Tá teorainn reachtúil leis na hairleacain sin agus, má bhím sásta gur gá an teorainn a árdú, tabharfaidh mé reachtaíocht isteach chun é sin a dhéanamh.</P>
    <P>Anois, i gceann trí seachtaine, tá an Bille os ár gcomhair.  Níl a fhios agam cén fáth nach raibh an tAire ábalta freagra níos cruinne a thabhairt dom an t-am sin.  An raibh fhios ag an Aire go raibh an Bille seo ag teacht?  Muna raibh fhios aige go raibh sé ag teacht, bhfuil gach rud ceart idir Roinn na Gaeltachta agus Gaeltarra Éireann? Bhfuil siad ag troid in aghaidh a chéile?</P>
    <P>Sé mhí ó shin nuair a bhí an Comhrialtas i gceannas na tíre bhí monarcha le cur suas in iarthar Chiarraí agus bhí ar Ghaeltarra Éireann dul go dtí Roinn na Gaeltachta chun deontas níos mó a fháil.  Measaim gur £20,000 a bhí i gceist&mdash;nílim ro-chinnte faoi an fhigiúr anois.  Dúradh leo i Roinn na Gaeltachta go gcaithfeadh siad dul go dtí an Roinn Airgeadais.  Chuaigh mise go dtí an Teachta Ó Riain nuair a bhí sé ina Aire Airgeadais; chuir mé mo chás os a chomhair, agus i gceann cúpla uair a chloig bhí gach rud réidh, bhí an cead faighte againn.  Ach idir an dá linn, tháinig an IDA isteach agus sciob an IDA an mhonarcha agus chuir siad é in áit eile sa tír. D'fhéadfaimís go léir rud éigean a fhoghlaim ón scéal sin.</P>
    <P>Measaim féin gur ceart a dhóthain cumhachta a bheith ag Aire na Gaeltachta, suas go dtí £½ mhilliún, gan dul go dtí an Roinn Airgeadais chun cead a fháil uathu.  Mar sin, cuirim an cheist seo ó mo chroí ar an Aire: an bhfuil easaontas idir Ghaeltarra Éireann agus an IDA?  Caithfidh an tAire bheith an-chúramach ar fad faoi sin.  Thug Bille a bhí os ár gcomhair le déanaí breis cumhachtaí don IDA, agus tá siad ag lorg sin, agus gheobhaidh siad iad.  Ach sé an cúram atá acu anois ná na monarchana beaga, <Col N="1003" /> agus ó thárla go bhfuil fear ón IDA ar bhord Ghaeltarra Éireann, an mbeidh an troid i dtaobh monarchana i bhfad níos oscailte anois?  B'fhéidir nach raibh fhios ag an Aire faoin scéal ach tá na rudaí sin ag cur isteach orm go mór.</P>
    <P>Tá a fhios ag cách go bhfuil job andheacair ag Gaeltarra Éireann cheana féin, agus má leanann an difríocht&mdash; b'fhéidir nach bhfuil aon difríocht ann &mdash;caithfidh an tAire Bille eile a thabhairt ós comhair na Dála, agus sa Bhille sin beidh orainn i bhfad níos mó cumhachtaí a thabhairt don Aire féin sa chéad áit, agus ar ndóigh do Ghaeltarra Éireann ionas go mbeidh Gaeltarra ábalta cothrom na Féinne a fháil.</P>
    <P>Nuair a tháinig an Teachta O'Donnell isteach mar Aire na Gaeltachta bhí 1,800 daoine i lán-fhostaíocht ag Gaeltarra, tar éis 50 bliain dár Rialtas féin.  I gceann ceithre bliana, mar a deir an tAire anseo anocht, bhí ós cionn 3,000 ann.  Bhí sé beagnach dúbalta.  Tá fhios ag an Aire go bhfuil an imirce beagnach críochnaithe, go bhfuil deireadh leis an imirce ón nGaeltacht.  Go deimhin, tá daoine ag teacht ar ais ó Shasana go dtí a ndúiche féin, agus rud an-shuimiúl é sin.  Cuid de na daoine atá ag filleadh tá sort céard acu a fuaireadar i mBirmingham nó i nGlascú nó in áit éigean eile sa Bhreatain.</P>
    <P>Tá an-áthas orm go ndúirt an tAire go bhfuil sé beartaithe aige lán-fhostaíocht a chur sa Ghaeltacht, mar tá fhios ag gach éinne nach mórán maitheas an Ghaeilge a bheith ann gan daoine ann chun í a chaint.  Caithfimid cuimhne go rabhaimid ábalta breis is 1,800 postanna a chur ar fáil sna ceithre bliana nuair a bhí eacnamaíocht an domhain i gcoinne fostaíochta ar bith.  Is mór an trua nár thug an tAire dúinn an méid postanna atá beartaithe aige a chur ar fáil i 1978 agus 1979.  Tá i bhfad níos mó dóchas ag muintir na Gaeltachta anois ná a bhí acu riamh, agus táim cinnte, gan na trioblóidi ann a dhein mé trácht futhu, go mbeadh Gaeltarra Éireann agus an tAire ábalta, má leanann siad ar aghaidh sa chaoí a bhfuil siad ag dul, <Col N="1004" /> lán-fhostaíocht a chur ar fáil sa Ghaeltacht faoi 1982.</P>
    <P>Ach tá seanfhocal ann: &ldquo;Ní mar a síltear a bítear&rdquo;.  Measaim féin nach mbeidh an seanfhocal sin fíor an t-am seo.  Ta daoine anseo agus ansúd ar fud na tíre i gcónaí ag cáiniu Roinn na Gaeltachta, Gaeltarra Éireann nó Aire na Gaeltachta.  Ceapaim nach aon díobháil a rá go mba cheart do mhuintir na hÉireann ar fad bheith faoi chomaoin mhór ag muintir na Gaeltachta toisc gur choimeád siad an teanga beo, gur choimeád siad an Ghaeltacht beo.  Tá sé soiléir do cách anois chomh tábhachtach is atá an Ghaeltacht anois toisc go bhfuilimid sa Chomhmhargadh.</P>
    <P>Tá an-leathnú ag teacht ar úsáid na Gaeilge ar fud na tíre, go mór mhór na páistí scoile, toisc nach bhfuil aon scannradh orthu anois go gcaillfidís scrúdúchán.  Iarraim anois ar an Aire an sprid nua sin a neartú san slí ina bhfuil sé ábalta, agus má bhíonn tacaíocht á lorg aige, beidh mé laistiar de.  Ag caint dom i dtaobh an sprid nua sin, tá scríbhneoirí nua ag teacht isteach anois, agus tá an sprid nua seo á scaipeadh ar fud na tíre.  Tá dualgas ar an Aire é sin a choimead agus a leathnú.</P>
    <P>Ba cheart do Ghaeltarra Éireann níos mó cabhair a thabhairt don chultúr, mar tá an cultúr agus an fostaíocht an-chóngarach le chéile.  Tá's agam gur thug Gaeltarra agus go mór mhór Roinn na Gaeltachta cabhair do &ldquo;Siamsa Tíre&rdquo;.  Ba cheart do Ghaeltarra bheith páirteach i slí éigean leis an rud iontach san.</P>
    <P>Tá clú agus cáil ar &ldquo;Siamsa Tíre&rdquo; ar fud na hEorpa, sna Stáit Aontaithe agus go mór mhór ar fud na hÉireann. Ba cheart do Ghaeltarra sort public relations exercise a dhéanamh lámh le chéile le Siamsa.  Níl a fhios agam anois an mbeadh an tAire nó Gaeltarra in ann é sin a dhéanamh ach iarraim ar an Aire go ndéanfaí iarracht faoi sin.</P>
    <P>An t-aon rud amháin atá ag cur isteach orm i dtaobh Gaeltarra&mdash;agus anois tá mé ag caint ar mó dhúiche féin, Ciarraí&mdash;ná cén fáth nach bhfuil na monarchana atá tógtha ag Gaeltarra <Col N="1005" /> i gCiarraí Thiar faoi lán tseol? Cheap mé bliain ó shin go raibh daoine fostaithe chun na monarchana sin a chur ag obair, breis is 50 i gceann amháin agus 15 sa cheann eile.  Chuir sé imní orm a chlos timpeall sé seachtain ó shin gur dúnadh ceann amháin acu in a raibh breis is 20 ban ag obair ann.  Níl aon obair anois ag na mná sin, agus chuala mé an rud a bhíodh á dhéanamh acu go raibh sé ar fheabhas ar fad.  Má tá aon eolas ag an Aire faoi dhúnadh na monarchana sin b'fhéidir go n-innseodh sé dom é.</P>
    <P>Cuirim ceist eile ar Ghaeltarra. Cathain a dhéanfaidh siad aon rud i gcomhair An Daingean?  Chuir siad monarcha suas ach cén fáth nach bhfuil aon advance factory ansin?  Cén fáth nach bhfuil Gaeltarra ag déanamh próiseál éisc san áit sin?  Tá na tithe agus na hoibrithe san Daingean.</P>
    <P>Rud eile a chuireann isteach orm ná go bhfuil cúpla ostán i gCiarrai ag Gaeltarra agus cuireann sé ionadh orm i gcónaí cén fáth nach bhfuil buachaillí agus cáilíní ón Ghaeltacht ag obair ins na hóstáin sin.  Níl sé ceart daoine eile a thabhairt isteach as Chúige Laighean agus buachaillí agus cailíní ón a ndúiche féin agus fonn orthu an obair seo a dhéanamh má fhaghann siad an chaoi.  B'fhéidir go bhféachfadh an tAire isteach san scéal sin.</P>
    <P>Níl ach cúpla rud eile le rá agam. Bhéinn lán sásta dá gcuirfeadh Gaeltarra Éireann i bhfad níos mó scoláireachtaí ar fáil do chailíní agus buachaillí sa Ghaeltacht.  Tá fhios agam go bhfuil cúpla scoláireachtaí i gcomhair an choláiste réigiúnaigh agus measaim féin go mba cheart i bhfad níos mó scoláireachtaí a bheith ar fáil.  An cailín óg agus an buachaill óg atá sa Ghaeltacht, nó muna bhfanann siad sa bhaile ar an dtalamh nó muna dtéann siad chun na hiascaireachta nó ar an ollscoil nó muna bhfaigheann siad post sa Stát Sheirbhís, téann siad go Tráighlí nó Luimneach.  B'fhéidir go bhfuil deacrachtaí ann, ach más féidir leis an Aire, bheadh muintir na Gaeltachta an-sásta dá gcuirfeadh sé scoláireachtaí ar fáil&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Anois an t-am le dul isteach agus, mar a deirtear as Béarla, &ldquo;get a good skelp&rdquo; den Ciste Réigiúnach ón Rialtas.  Nuair a bhí an tAire thall anseo bhí sé i gcónaí ag caint mar gheall ar an gCiste Réigiúnach.  Tá an seans aige anois, ba cheart é a thógaint ina láimh agus mar a dúirt mé nuair a thosnaigh mé, déanaim comhghairdeas leis agus táim cinnte, má bhíonn an béal oscailte aige nuair a bhíonn an Rialtas ag cruinniú go bhfhaighidh sé a dhóthain mar tá dóchas ag muintir na Gaeltachta anois Tá muinín acu go ndéanfaidh an tAire an dóchas sin a neartú agus é a choimead.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liomsa, cosúil leis an Teachta Begley ar an gcéad dul síos comhghairdeas a ghabháil leis an Aire nua.  Is mór agus is tábhachtach an obair atá le déanamh aige.  Beimíd go léir ag breathnú air go cruinn sna blianta romhainn.  Ba mhaith liom freisin fáilte a chur roimh an Bhille seo.  Mar a dúirt an tAire inné, níl aon deacracht ann.  Ní hé sin le rá nach bhfuil tábhachtacht ag baint leis.  Tá sé an-tábhachtach.  Tá eolas maith ag an Aire ar na Gaeltachtaí agus ar na rudaí atá ag teastáil sna Gaeltachtaí.  Bíonn airgead ag teastáil i gcónaí sna Gaeltachtaí, neart airgid chun tionscail nua a chur ar bun agus forbairt eacnamaíoch a dhéanamh.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1007" /> I have already referred to the problems of industry in the Gaeltacht which is what this Bill is about.  I do not propose to go into them in any detail except to make a couple of points which I believe are relevant.  The first is that there is a wide and serious gap between the career expectations of Gaeltacht children and the type of career opportunities that are open to them.  We will have to look again, perhaps during the period of the Government, at the type of industry which this sort of capital will be funding in the Gaeltacht.</P>
    <P>I believe we will also have to try to examine the question of whether the industries that were put into the Gaeltacht, not just to increase the standard of living of the people of the Gaeltacht but to safeguard the language of the Gaeltacht, are not now in fact in danger of contributing to the language shift in the Gaeltacht areas as a whole. I hope to examine this whole topic at more length when the Estimate for the Minister's Department comes before us.  I do not propose to do so now.  I welcome this Bill.  It obviously will provide more funds for more investment and I hope it will be wise investment. We will do anything we can in the House to facilitate wise and productive investment in the Gaeltacht.</P>
    <P>Mar focal scoir, tá súil agam go mbeidh níos mó suim ag muintir na hÉireann ar fad i ndeacrachtaí na Gaeltachta ná mar a bhí roimhe seo. Mar a deireann an manifesto cáiliúil úd&mdash;ceapaim go mbeidh sé i bhfad níos cáiliúla i gceann ceithre bliana&mdash; is tobar ár ndúchas an Ghaeltacht.  Is fíor é sin.  Níor rugadh sa Ghaeltacht mé ach is Ciarríach mise agus is Ciarríach an Teachta Begley.  Dá bhrí sin tá foireann an-chumhachtach ar an dtaobh seo den Teach.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1008" /> Maidir le cúpla pointe a bhí ag an Teachta Begley sílim go raibh sé ag íarraidh a chur in iúl go raibh easaontas idir Roinn na Gaeltachta agus Gaeltarra Éireann.  Níl fírinne ar bith ins an méid sin, ná ní bheadh buntáiste ar bith in obair Ghaeltarra Éireann nó Roinn na Gaeltachta féin dá mbeadh easaontas ar bith idir an rannóg Stáit agus Gaeltarra Éireann.  Ar ndóigh, tharla sé anois agus arís go mbeadh smaointí éagsúla ag daoine maidir leis an chaoi is fearr le rud a chur chun chinn ach níl difríocht de chineál ar bith idir Gaeltarra Éireann agus Roinn na Gaeltachta.</P>
    <P>Bhíodh ball den Roinn ar Bhord Ghaeltarra Éireann i gcaoi nach mbeadh easaontas eatarthu san am atá caite.  Táimid ag súil go mbeidh an socrú sin ann aris, go mbeidh duine éigean ón Roinn féin mar bhall de Ghaeltarra Éireann leis an chomhoibriú ceart a bheith idir an Roinn agus Gaeltarra Éireann.</P>
    <P>An bhfuil gá leis an teorainn a ardú agus leis an mBille seo?  Tá gá leis.  Sin an fáth gur tugadh os comhair na Dála é.  An bhfuil easaontas idir an IDA agus Gaeltarra Éireann maidir le fostaíocht? Níl aon easaontas ach tá coimhlint, mar tá an IDA ag iarraidh postanna a chur ar fáil ar fúd na tíre agus dá bhrí sin tá sé iontuigthe go mbeadh coimhlint idir an IDA agus Gaeltarra Éireann i dtaobh postanna. Tá coimhlint idir rannóga an IDA féin, cur i gcás.  Beidh na daoine atá ag plé leis an iarthar ag iarraidh na monarchana agus na postanna a thabhairt go dti an t-iarthar agus beidh na daoine atáag obair don IDA ar an taobh thoir den tír ag iarraidh na postanna a fháil don taobh sin den tír.  Ar an gcaoi sin is dócha gur féidir a rá go mbeidh coimhlint idir an IDA agus Gaeltarra Éireann nuair atá siad ag iarraidh postanna a chur ar bun.</P>
    <P>Labhair an Teachta Begley faoi easaontas.  Tá ball den IDA ar bhord Ghaeltarra Éireann i gcaoi gur féidir comhoibriú a bheith idir an dá fhoireann.</P>
    <P>Thug an Teachta moladh don iarAire. Rinne sé a dhícheall mar Aire. Bhí smaointe maithe aige ach caithimid an scéal a scrúdú mar is ceart.</P>

      <Col N="1009" /> Sul a dtig linn monarcha a chur ar bun in áit ar bith tá cuid mhaith rud ag teastáil&mdash;rudaí mar leictreachas, uisce, bóthair agus a leithéid sin.  Sna háiteacha iargúlta sna Gaeltachtaí níl sé rófhada ó cuireadh cuid mhaith de na seirbhisí sin ar bun.  Ní fhéadfaí morán tionscail a bhailiú isteach muna mbeadh an bunsraith sin ann.  Rud eile, na comharchumainn agus na daoine eile atá ag gníomhú ar son na Gaeltachta le bfhéidir naoi nó deich mbliana anois, fuair siad cuidiú ó Roinn na Gaeltachta, fuair siad na deontaisí bainistíochta agus gach cuidiú le gníomhú ar son mhuintir na Gaeltachta.  Maidir leis na rudaí sin ar fad, is iad Fianna Fáil a thug isteach na dlithe agus an reachtaíocht le tús a chur leis na rudaí sin.  Ní h-eol domsa gur thug an t-iar-Aire Acht ar bith os comhair na Dála leis na ceithre bliana go leith a bhí sé sa Roinn ach amháin ceann cosúil leis an cheann atá molta anseo agamsa anocht.

An fhad is a bhaineann sé liom féin, beidh mé sásta gach cabhair is féidir a thabhairt.</P>
    <P>Luaigh sé scoláireachtaí do mhuintir na Gaeltachta.  Ní raibh a fhios agam i gceart céard a bhí i gceist ag an Teachta anseo; scoláireachtai chuig na coláistí reígiúnacha sílim a luaigh sé.  Le blianta beaga anuas tá aitheantas faoi leith á thabhairt do mhuintir na Gaeltachta maidir le oideachas.  Cuirimíd i gcás daoine atá ag dul isteach sna coláistí traenála, tá 10 faoin gcéad de na háiteacha fágtha le haghaidh daoine ón Ghaeltacht agus ní dóigh liom go bhfuil aon scéim faoi leith maidir le scoláireachtai do na coláistí réigiúnacha, ach ó thárla an prionsabal a bheith ann, bhféidir gur féidir an rud sin a scrúdú sa mhéid is gur thig linn teacht i gcabhair ar dhaoine a bhéas ag dul ón Ghaeltacht chuig na coláisti réigiúnacha.</P>
    <P>Maidir leis an gCiste Réigiúnach bhuel, ní gá dom a rá go mbeimíd ag súil go mbeidh cuid dó ag teacht chuig an Iarthar féin, agus arís tá súil agam go mbeimíd in ann i bhfad níos mó a thabhairt siar ná mar a d'éirigh leis an Rialtas deiridh nuair a bhí siad ag plé leis an gciste seo.  Is beag dó a tháinig go dtí an réigiún thiar ná go dtí na Gaeltachtaí agus ní bheidh mórán le déanamh agamsa le feabhas a chur ar obair an Rialtais atá caite maidir le cuid den airgead sin a thabhairt siar.</P>
    <P>Maidir leis an méid adúirt an Teachta Horgan, aontaím leis go bhfuil deacracht ag Gaeltarra Éireann maidir le tionscail a chur sna Gaeltachtaí sa mhéid seo, go gcuireann siad tionscail isteach; tá siad ag iarraidh obair a chur ar fáil do na daoine agus ar ndóigh tá an dainséar ann i gcuid de na tionscail sin go mbeidh Béarla á labhairt ó tharla an bhainistíocht a bheith ina mBéarlóirí.  Sin deacracht nach bhfuil sé ró fhurasta a shárú.  Ar thaobh amháin tá siad ag iarraidh fostaíocht a chur ar fáil do mhuintir na Gaeltachta agus ar an dtaobh eile <Col N="1011" /> tá an dainséar ann in amannaí go mbeidh siad ag déanamh dochar don Ghaeilge féin, don teanga féin.  An t-aon leigheas atá ar sin, sílim, ná go mbeadh daoine ón Ghaeltacht oilte le dul i gcionn monarchan mar sin, go mbeadh an léann agus an fhoghlaim agus an cleachta acu le tabhairt faoi obair bhainistíochta sna monarchana sin i gcaoi go bhféachfaí leis an Ghaeilge a choinneáil slán agus beo sna ceantair Ghaeltachta ina bhfuil tionscail den chineál sin iontu.</P>
    <P>Sílim go bhfuil, go ginearálta, suim ag muintir na hÉireann uilig i gcúrsaí na Gaeltachta agus beimid uilig ag súil go rachaidh sé sin chun nirt sna blianta atá romhainn agus go dtuigeann siad nach dtig leis an Ghaeltacht seasamh gan an chuid eile den tír a theacht i gcabhair uirthi.  Tá an tuiscint sin sílim ag an Rialtas, agus beimíd ag súil go mbeidh siad ag plé go fial le muintir na Gaeltachta agus le Gaeltarra sna blianta atá romhainn.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Looking back over the Bill it just struck me that the Minister <Col N="1012" /> might have another look at section 2 between now and the Seanad.  Naturally we support the Bill entirely.  This section was part of the Bill which I moved here on Second Stage in March. Looking at it recently, it struck me that supposing an industrial undertaking proposes to amalgamate for its own purposes and to improve its industrial operations with another undertaking which might not on the ordinary understanding of the expression be described as industrial such as an insurance company, an advertising agency, a commercial farm, a marketing agency or distribution network, or a transport undertaking of some kind.  I only put this forward as a drafting point.  Of course these are all, in a sense, industrial operations, but I thought I might as well mention it in case the Minister's advisers think it advisable to make it clear between here and the Seanad that a restructuring here would attract the benefit of the section even if one of the concerns involved was not industrial in the narrow sense.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>The authority's remit extends only to manufacturing industry and in certain instances to certain specified services like architecture for export purposes. The sort of things mentioned by the Deputy could not be dealt with by the authority.  The range of them, is way outside the scope of an authority which is set up to deal with industrial development and in particular with manufacturing industry.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to make any great point about this, but it is a matter that occurred to me only at a very late stage.  I only mention it so that the Minister might look at the thing and ask the IDA whether they ever foresaw the possibility of an industrial undertaking for its own purposes, to improve its performance, proposing an amalgamation with another undertaking which might not be capable of description as industrial.  I appreciate that the IDA is not there to assist marketing organisations and so on, but an industrial undertaking might find it advantageous to acquire an insurance company, an advertising agency, a commercial farm, a distribution network <Col N="1013" /> or a transport undertaking.  The Minister should ask the IDA if they might see some advantage in allowing the benefit of this section to be extended to an arrangement of this kind. This section as it stands envisages two industrial undertakings, both of them in sectors in which there is an economic advantage in mutual diversification. Might there not be an advantage in looking at this section from this perspective so that the benefit of the section could be extended to an industrial undertaking which wishes to amalgamate or take over another undertaking for industrial purposes although that undertaking might not be industrial in the narrow sense?  I would be glad if the Minister would look at the matter between now and the Seanad.</P>

    <Title>Private Members' Business: Ferenka Factory Closure: Motion (Resumed).</Title>

      <Col N="1015" /> The following motion was moved by Deputy Kelly on Tuesday, 6th December 1977:</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann deplores the negligence on the part of the Government in the developments that led to the closure of the Ferenka factory, with its disastrous consequences for the workforce and for general industrial development.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Last evening I described the closure of Ferenka as a national disgrace.  I deliberately used the word &ldquo;national&rdquo; because Irish workers in an Irish plant established under the auspices of the IDA, Irish trade unions and an Irish Government are directly involved.</P>
      <P>Whatever degree of responsibility for the closure lies with the ENKA board&mdash;and it has been substantial&mdash; in my opinion we failed to control and to contain the situation to prevent the loss of 1,400 jobs, of £9 million of taxpayers' money and of damage to our future prospects of industrial development. We are deluding ourselves at all levels if we do not learn bitter lessons from this dispute.  Therefore, the truth must be told if we are to learn.</P>
      <P>We should keep an objective sense of perspective about the causes and responsibilities for the actual dispute which provided the parent company with a golden opportunity to pull out. We know that unfortunately and tragically some workers in this plant allowed themselves on occassions to be led out on official stoppages.  We know that recognised channels to deal with day-to-day disputes, including the recent suspension of six employees, broke down.  We know that some individuals persistently favoured unofficial action in dealing with such issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1016" /> Tragically and unfortunately so far as these men allowed themselves to be used, they too have sowed a bitter harvest, and they and thier families must live with the consequences of their action for the rest of their lives. The truth must be told about this.  As a rank and file trade unionist and as a member of one of the unions concerned&mdash;the ITGWU&mdash;and as a former full-time official in that union and with the ICTU, it would be utterly dishonest on my part if I did not make that criticism.</P>
    <P>I am also convinced that the plant need not have closed.  It is true that the firm was managed from afar with growing and mounting insolvency and with an evident insensitivity in terms of its management.  There was also a small group of workers who believed they could do whatever they wished at local level.  It is true that in relation to my union the local branch had the greatest of difficulty in obtaining what one would regard as the traditional loyalty of workers in Limerick to a particular union.  That is a fact of life; it is the truth.</P>
    <P>The Marine Port Union attempted to come into a difficult and ugly situation in what can only be described as a questionable seeking of expansion of membership.  As a Labour Party member and as a trade unionist I must be utterly honest about this matter.  No matter how one may attempt to justify the strength of feeling on the part of members, in my opinion there is no justification for one union&mdash;no matter who it may be &mdash;moving in on an unofficial strike situation, enrolling members and attempting to represent them in that situation.</P>
    <P>All that is past history but the truth must be told.  This Government by their indecision and their reluctance during the period of the dispute to spell out the options as they unfolded contributed as much to the closure of the plant.  This motion correctly deals with the contributory negligence of the Government in the closure.  It pinpoints the incompetence of the Minister for Labour and the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy in their handling of the situation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1017" /> There is one reason why the Government&mdash;not merely the two Ministers concerned&mdash;stand indicted. The Government have a collective responsibility to advise, direct and encourage individual Minister on the policy line to be adopted in major disputes. The Taoiseach presides over the Cabinet, but it is evident that the Government did not discharge that responsibility at Cabinet level.  The policy and hope was one of nervous expectation that if we did nothing everything would work out all right and everyone would ultimately go back to work.</P>
    <P>I regret to say that the Minister for Labour must stand indicted.  I say this with regret because he is a personal friend of mine.  His settlement proposals of 24th and 25th October&mdash; issued well after the dispute commenced&mdash;were rejected out of hand by the ITGWU and by the Congress, and the FUE did not regard them as remotely contributing towards the prospect of a settlement.  We had the understatement of the year when Deputy Mitchell regarded them as being &ldquo;unusual&rdquo;.  Most observers were taken aback by the sheer impracticability of the Minister's so-called flexibility in relation to the proposals. I can excuse the Minister his inexperience, but I cannot excuse a Cabinet that authorised these proposals. I believe that, tragically, they gave hope to those who would fragment trade union organisation inside the job and would disrupt the Congress procedures.</P>
    <P>The second reason for the failure of the Minister was his failure to consult with the Industrial Relations Committee of the ICTU in relation to the issues involved.  I found it incredible&mdash; and I have carried out the most diligent research and discussions with the parties involved&mdash;that no consultation took place between the Minister and Congress at formal official level.  There may have been a mild unofficial approach at one stage, but there was no actual consultation between the Minister and Congress in relation to this dispute.  Needless to remark, there was no consultation prior to the initial terms of settlement.  Further comment is unnecessary.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1018" /> I find it incredible that the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy should come into the Dáil last evening and state:</P>
    <P>The proposals on which the two unions recommended their members to return were in substance the same as those put before the unions five weeks earlier by the Minister for Labour.</P>
    <P>Why in God's name could they not have been accepted when first put before them?  I would ask the Minister if he is not aware that the initial proposals of the Minister for Labour recommended that over a five-month period after resumption of work an officer of the Labour Court would arrange as an interim measure the election of production workers to represent and negotiate with management. Quite incredibly the Minister for Labour also proposed on that occasion that trade union dues should cease to be deducted during the five-month period and that no trade union meetings would be held on the premises or during company time.</P>
    <P>These proposals were rejected by the ITGWU and the Congress, and they were regarded by the Limerick Council of Trade Unions as not being conducive to any settlement.</P>
    <P>I must confess I was shocked at this analysis of the situation from the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy, because the proposals which the Congress finally put forward and which were ultimately accepted by the workers bore no relation whatever to the proposals originally put forward by the Minister for Labour.  If I may say so, I would not contrast even in the Cork sense&mdash;the Minister for Labour, myself and Deputy M. O'Leary, his predecessor all come from the one city &mdash;the manner of the Minister for Labour's intervention in this dispute with the care and attention given by the Minister's predecessor in his interventions in many equally difficult disputes over the past four years.  There have been very many substantial criticisms of the former Minister.  But I know of no major industrial dispute where he did not bring about successful settlements, even in the most difficult <Col N="1019" /> of disputes, because he intervened with care, he consulted unceasingly with the trade unions and with the employers. Indeed I do not know from where the proposals of the Minister emanated, whether it was some recess of the think-tank or manifesto but, if they are any indication of the future industrial relations policy of the Government, God help those of us who may be called on to settle future industrial disputes.</P>
    <P>Now we come to the meeting of 4th November between the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy and the two board members of ENKA.  At that meeting the second total lack of initiative on the part of the Government was utterly unveiled.  The Minister has revealed only under great pressure in this House and under the prompting and disclosure by the Leader of the Labour Party, Deputy Cluskey, that an offer of extended State involvement was sought by ENKA representatives.  I stress the date: 4th November.  That was long before the closure or the final decision on the part of the company was taken to pack up its bags and get to hell out of Ireland because the Minister for Labour was doing nothing about it.  The Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy blew his top when he met ENKA, became irate, and told them that there was no hope in hell of their proposals being accepted.  He in no way attempted to negotiate with the ENKA representatives when they put their proposals before him; he simply blew his top and sent out his public relations officer from the GIS to tell the powers in this country that there were hard, tough and difficult words between them.  Then he issued a statement saying there would be no further statement from the Government and he said, incredibly, no further statement from ENKA in this regard.</P>
    <P>I think we are correct in surmising from that incident and from reports in the newspapers, that the Minister had worked himself into an impossible situation with the ENKA representatives, so much so that, in my opinion, tragically, these representatives <Col N="1020" /> went back and field yet another negative report before their parent company board saying that they could not make head nor tail of the situation&mdash;the Minister for Labour was not doing anything; the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy did not know the hell what he wanted to do; the Marine Port Union was not likely to do any better than the Transport Union, and the thing was in such a shambles they were finally making a recommendation to their board to pack up and get out.  And they used the phrase to the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy, which was disclosed by the Minister last evening, of adopting a lower profile of, in effect, getting out, and then the Minister knew that situation.</P>
    <P>That pinpoints the clear negligence on the part of the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy.  I have rarely seen such abject abdication of responsibility by a Minister of State.  I would contrast the inaction of this Government in relation to keeping Ferenka in operation with the flush of expenditure, the sudden interest, for example, of expenditure of £2 million of State moneys in payments to mostly absentee shareholders of a bankrupt bank, the Irish Trust Bank.  What a rush Deputy Colley was in to pay out that money to keep a tiny staff already in other employment, to buy off a bankrupt concern in that regard.  We should remember that touching concern of the Minister for Finance about that outfit, when we see the double standard in relation to Ferenka, with nothing in terms of involvement and not a word from him.</P>
    <P>Here is the party which apparently tore up a proposal of ENKA which was a negotiating document.  Those of us who have ever met multinational companies&mdash;and I, as a trade union official, have met many of them over the years&mdash;know that first documents are no more than negotiating ones. There was no effort made by the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy to go back to them and say &ldquo;Look, that is not on.  Meet me again next Monday.  I am sorry, we could not possibly wear that; the IDA could not possibly wear it.  We could not put it <Col N="1021" /> before the Dáil.  We would have a situation which would be, quite frankly, impossible for the Government to accept.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Here is a Government which gaily spent £80 million on rates relief for people who have homes and jobs, but who could not, apparently, find a brass farthing for Ferenka.  Here is a Government who could spend £20 million on motor tax relief for people who have cars and jobs, but who could not even contemplate expenditure of £500,000 to keep a factory going at least until Christmas when we might be in a position to talk turkey to multinationals in the language they know.  They were not impressed by the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy nor, unfortuantely, by the Minister for Labour.</P>
    <P>Therefore we have a situation in which we must strongly challenge the Minister for Labour to lay the proposals he got from ENKA before the House.  The company is no longer in existence, is going out of existence in ten days' time, on the final proceedings in the High Court and so on.  We must now ask for the disclosure of these documents to discover what exactly was the situation.  Confidentiality will no longer be breached because the company is in liquidation.  If the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy is in such a rush to release the internal agreements with Bula, Tara and the devil-knows-what, he should not have much difficulty in releasing the documents in relation to Ferenka.</P>
    <P>What are the future prospects of a solution to the outbreak of similar disputes in this country?  I do not believe that simply because the Government have made an unholy bags of this situation we should lose our nerve in this critical situation.  Damage has been done, but let us not compound it by putting forward bad solutions to avert further disputes of this nature. We should cast from our minds some of the simplistic solutions put forward by some hysterical commentators.  We even had the distinguished parliamentary correspondent of the <i>Irish Independent</i> proposing a system of mandatory affiliation to the Irish Congress of Trade Unions&mdash;God <Col N="1022" /> knows voluntary affiliation is difficult enough to achieve in this democracy. He would even have mandatory cooling-off periods.  The Irish Exporters' Association went half-mad. They proposed a banning and sending off to Mountjoy of those who might, on occasion, lose their nerve, their sense of democracy, their sense of working-class solidarity, their sense of trade union affiliation and who might go out on unofficial strike.  As we know these solutions can work only in a totalitarian system of industrial relations, in a Gulag society where, frankly, mandatory sanctions cannot be applied.  Therefore, I am surprised that those kinds of proposals should be put forward.  In the final analysis we must depend on the innate sense of democracy, of decency and loyalty of fellow workers to one another to avoid these kinds of situations; not to be led by the nose by anybody, no matter how extreme may be the situation, to take their decision on a straight ballot, majority decision basis inside trade unions in the traditional sense of all that is best of trade unionism as we know it in this country.  Since there are two sides in industry, needless to remark bad management, insensitive management, ineffective management must be eliminated if we are to avoid the provocation of such outbreaks.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested by some commentators and apologists for this closure that the factory should never have been set up in the first instance here.  I take that as a slight on the workers of Limerick.  Deputy Lipper and Deputy John Ryan who represent the vast bulk of those workers regard that as arrant nonsense.  I do not believe that the management decision-making structure was so bad that it could not have been remedied ultimately.  It could have been if the factory could have been kept open. Admittedly it was very diffused, it was difficult.  I saw some reports, including consultant reports, in relation to this company, but I am quite convinced it could still have been kept open.</P>
    <P>We hear a lot of nonsense about four-shift systems which were conducive to absenteeism.  There was a serious problem of absenteeism in one <Col N="1023" /> section of this plant, but it was not universal within the whole of the company.  There was no such thing as 25 per cent absenteeism throughout this plant; there was in one particular section where the work processes were very demanding.  While these were difficult problems I in no way accept that they were insurmontable.  I believe they were soluble with patience, goodwill and understanding on the part of all concerned, particularly a Minister for Labour with understanding and appreciation and the capability of going into that plant and ensuring it was put back on the rails.</P>
    <P>There are a number of fundamental questions which must be asked of this Government in regard to the establishment of Ferenka some six years ago when Fianna Fáil were in office.  Was this project&mdash;and this is a serious question&mdash;and its location in that area in the first instance sponsored and favoured by the IDA or was it a decision of the Government to establish the plant in Annacotty?  Were the IDA or SFADCO satisfied that the location and the labour catchment were adequate, or was this decided at a Government meeting at the behest of Deputy O'Malley, Minister for Justice, at the time?  Was the equipment and technology up to date?  Was the equipment modern?  Was it of the most modern design even six years ago?  The answers to these questions will explain to some degree the outcome of the situation.  I would exonerate the IDA in large measure in relation to this dispute.  I believe the nightmare Ferenka became could have been avoided had the original decision to establish the plant been taken only after the most careful consideration and study.</P>
    <P>Finally, there is the question of the future prospects of reopening this plant.  I would wish to see production resume.  Quite frankly, I do not see any prospect of the plant being re-opened as a workers' co-operative. Such is the climate of relations and the whole structure of the technology of this particular product and the marketing problem thereof, that I do not see a realistic prospect of a co-operative. <Col N="1024" /> In normal circumstances I would favour such a concept, particularly in relation to small industries, but, with a highly integrated product like steel cord, with its technology and markets, the proposal does not seem to me to be realistic.  The best proposition at the moment is, before it slides into oblivion in terms of liquidation, that we ask the Government tonight in a positive and constructive sense, that we ask the Minister for Labour and the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy, in conjunction with the IDA to ensure that they at least arrange for this plant to be taken over by another manufacturer, perhaps capable of handling steel cord material, and operate it as quickly as possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I advance that proposition because the Government must take a decision in this matter in the next week or so if there is to be any prospect of a successful reopening. Otherwise, after two months' stoppage and two weeks' closure some 10 to 15 per cent of the labour force in this plant will no longer be available for one reason or another and the plant cannot therefore be reopened on an effective basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are many lessons to be learned from this dispute.  The unions concerned learned lessons, I hope.  I believe the IDA have learned substantial lessons in relation to plants of this nature.  I hope that in the lifetime of this Dáil in the four years ahead, in the lifetime of both Ministers in their portfolios, a sharp and bitter lesson has been learned from this dispute.  As an Opposition, I believe we would have been utterly and flagrantly dishonest had we not put down this motion and said what we have to say directly to the Minister.  Much as we hold individual friends in the parliamentary sense in high esteem, we have to be honest with one another.  We have to be direct and say that the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy, by being too cute by half, by his inaction and by hoping to God that by keeping it all under wraps, if a <Col N="1025" /> thing goes wrong, Fianna Fáil will not be blamed because nobody will know anything about what happened but, if a thing goes right, on the other hand, Deputy O'Malley is able to go careering off to Telefís Éireann saying: &ldquo;I settled the dispute.&rdquo;  Last night he thanked Harold O'Sullivan.  He did not mention the Congress.  He was on radio saying: &ldquo;I was responsible more or less.  What I said landed them back to work.&rdquo;  The Minister cannot have an each way bet in an industrial dispute of this kind.  Tragically it blew up in his face.  Far more tragically it means 1,400 workers are out of work down in Limerick, their jobs gone, no income and their carreer prospects destroyed. Deputy Ryan and Deputy Lipper have to live with this and work in this context. It was no consolation for them to come in here and stand with me in condemning the Government for its inaction in this matter, because in the long run the jobs are gone.  Our job now is to ensure that an alternative industry is rapidly put into that plant and that the plant and equipment are used as effectively as possible, and there will be no recurrence of the unhappy events in Limerick over the past few months in the lifetime of this Dáil.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been dismayed to find speaker after speaker on the opposite side last night and tonight seeing fit to try to make political capital and score political points from the tragedy that is Ferenka.  I would remind them that the points they seek to score are points at the expense of the former workers of Ferenka, their wives and families, who would, I am sure, have expected something more constructive to emerge from this debate.  I have listened to a recitation of criticisms of the Government and its <Col N="1027" /> Ministers for their action or lack of action in regard to the industrial relations aspect of the Ferenka tragedy.  I would point out to them that labour-management relations in this plant were most unsatisfactory right from its establishment in 1972 and continued to be so during the term of office of the previous Government and were well known to the previous Government. Some of those making these criticisms displayed an abysmal lack of knowledge of industrial relations here.  I would remind them that we have here a system of free collective bargaining. I would remind them also that in accordance with that system the primary responsibility for the settlement of disputes rests with the employers and their workers and their representative organisation.  I would also remind them that the Government has provided procedures and institutions for the resolution of disputes in situations where the parties themselves cannot reach agreement.  An outsider listening to this debate could be forgiven for thinking that the function of the Government or, indeed, of the Minister for Labour, is to settle disputes. I want to ask a question.  Who settles disputes?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. Mitchell Mr. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister does not.  What is the answer?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I repeat.  Who settles disputes?  Disputes are settled by the parties involved by their goodwill, co-operation and participation, and any function, any mediation, is only a vehicle to that solution and can only succeed if that goodwill, co-operation and participation are present.  I would ask Deputies opposite whether they want to see greater State involvement in the area of industrial relations through legislation or otherwise.  If I were to seek greater powers in the industrial relations area the Deputies opposite would express reservations about any attempts to increase the degree of State intervention in our system of free collective bargaining.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to put on the record of this House that in the area of industrial relations my main aim during my tenure of office will be to strengthen <Col N="1028" /> and improve where necessary the institutions and procedure governing our system of free collective bargaining. For example, let us consider the Labour Court.  When I took up office a few short months before the unfortunate Ferenka situation developed, there was completely inadequate staffing in the Labour Court.  The proof of this, as I am sure many Members have seen, is that up to recently there was a footnote on Labour Court recommendations explaining that position. Regarding my own role and my functions in relation to dispute situations, I intend to intervene only in those situations where there is a public interest dimension, where there are exceptional circumstances or where it becomes clear that the institutions set up by this House to settle disputes have failed to secure a settlement.  My firm view is that frequent interventions at Ministerial level would only add another rung to the negotiating ladder and would tend to diminish the status and effectiveness of the institutions to which I have referred.</P>
    <P>I intervened in the Ferenka dispute immediately it became clear to me that an impasse had been reached because of the number of jobs involved and also because of the existence of exceptional aggravating circumstances.  It was clear to me on the 21st of October that an impasse had been reached.  It was also reported to me that a particular development, which in my judgment would have caused serious disruption of our general industrial scene, was about to take place.  A third factor in my decision to intervene was my concern for the situation in which 1,400 people would be out of work.</P>
    <P>One is entitled to ask why did not the parties concerned avail of the conciliation services of the Labour Court, which were available at all times.  The Labour Court was ready to offer assistance and expert advice to the parties involved since the commencement of the dispute.  Why did not they see fit to use these services?  I would ask why they did not make contact with the officer of the Labour Court who was made specially available to help them to settle their problems and who spent some considerable time in Limerick <Col N="1029" /> waiting to be approached.  He waited in vain.  One is prompted to ask: Did a desire for a settlement exist at that time?  I should like to stress that the position of the Labour Court and its services in this matter was not merely a passive one.  Several overtures were made over the weeks, but the offers of help were not taken up.  It should be noted that because of the history of Ferenka their industrial relations problems were well known to the Labour Court and the individual officers of the court.  Officers of the court were known personally to the management personnel and to the trade union representatives because of that history.</P>
    <P>I intervened immediately an impasse had been reached and when it became clear to me that the parties were unwilling to use the recognised institutions.  I put forward settlement proposals to the company and to the two trade unions involved on Friday, 21st October.  Criticism has been made of them, and I am not saying that they were the ideal answer to the problem, but I want to make it very clear to this House that an unusual situation had developed, a situation which in my opinion had three basic ingredients. One was a return to work, the second was a truce between the two unions during which the difficulties of representation could be sorted out, and the third was an arrangement to determine the issue of the suspended shop steward.  These were the three basic problems.  These proposals were put forward in no way to fragment the trade union movement.  I have always supported the official trade union movement and I will continue to do so. The proposals were designed to overcome the impasse that had been reached.  They may have been unusual but certainly they were not silly, as has been said by a Member of this House.</P>
    <P>When they were initially rejected I made it known publicly and to the parties concerned that the proposals were flexible and negotiable and that any suggestions or ideas put forward by them in return for the proposals would be considered by me.  I still say that the formula was there to enable progress to be made.  I put forward settlement proposals on the 21st <Col N="1030" /> October when I saw the impasse.  These proposals were based on an immediate resumption of work and provided for interim arrangements under which the industrial relations problems at the plant might be sorted out.  During protracted discussions on these proposals with all parties during the period up to 26th October, I explained that they were flexible and could be amended. Regrettably, these proposals were not acceptable to all the parties.</P>
    <P>As no progress was made arising from my discussions, I intervened again on 27th October when I put forward revised proposals, basically designed to withdraw the more objectionable aspects of the earlier ones.  They were again aimed at securing a resumption of work and also provided for a cooling off period during which I proposed that the Labour Court would examine the causes of discontent in the factory and matters relating to trade union representation.  Again I failed to get acceptance.</P>
    <P>Regarding the question of closure which has been referred to many times, I should like to tell the House that on the occasion of my first meeting with the Limerick management I asked them whether there were any factors other than the stoppage due to the strike which would threaten the future of the factory in Limerick.  They immediately assured me that there were no other factors in the situation, and mentioned that the demand for the company's product was buoyant.</P>

      <P>I think it was the 21st of October, approximately. When, during the discussions with the parties concerned, the possibility of closure was mentioned&mdash;the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy last night quoted a statement which he made in the last weekend in October spelling this out&mdash;the reaction I got was something like this: first, they did not believe it; second, they suggested that there was an element of duress in mentioning it, and thirdly they suggested that if the factory closed it would be for reasons other than industrial relations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1031" /> I want to answer an allegation made by Deputy Kelly here last night and, I understand, repeated on radio today, to the effect that one of the unions involved had made a suggestion to which I did not respond.  This was a detail of the overall settlement which at that time had basically been rejected by other parties, and because of that there was no point in pursuing that aspect further at that time.  I repeat that I then offered to consider any alternative proposals which the parties might wish to put forward, and I offered to provide clarification, if necessary, of any points of doubt in relation to my proposal.  I indicated my willingness, despite many pressing engagements, to remain in my office over the weekend of 29th-30th October for this purpose, and again the offer was not taken up.</P>
    <P>Much play was made by Deputy Kelly last night and even allegations were made that I had resigned or was gone out of the country, and I want to answer that.  This House set up institutions to deal with industrial relations, essentially the Labour Court and its services, and through those functions and institutions a Minister is able to keep in touch with the situation in any dispute.  Because it follows logically on what Deputy Kelly was saying last night, it would appear that in his mind a Minister should always be personlly involved in every dispute. The majority of Members of the House know that is not a sensible practice; they know that the intervention preferable to all parties is that of the responsible institutions of the State that have served industry and workers well.  I repeat that I had made arrangements with those institutions to be kept informed daily of the situation and, in addition, even when I was in my constituency at the weekend.</P>
    <P>When I say that proposals were turned down by the unions I want to make it clear that the unions went through the consultation process with their members and that the actions were endorsed by them.  As I said earlier, in dispute settling there must exist a desire to co-operate, to participate, and a goodwill presence that <Col N="1032" /> will give the opportunity to all concerned to reach a settlement.  Again, I emphasise that I did not, as has been alleged, remove myself from the scene at that stage or at any other time. Deputies will recall that the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy met representatives of the parent company the following week.  We discussed together and at Cabinet level the situation arising from that meeting.  A few days later, in the evening of the date mentioned last night, 8th November, I was informed that efforts were being made to arrange direct talks between some of the parties concerned.  In the circumstances I could not prejudice the outcome of these talks by attempting further intervention at that time nor would intervention be likely to meet with acceptance.  But I may now say that I appreciate and commend the ICTU and the FUE who initiated those talks and those proposals which, as we know, a number of weeks later, ended again in failure, unfortunately.</P>
    <P>During that period when there was hope for a basis for a form of settlement, the institutions of the Department were keeping closely in touch with the progress of those talks.  On the second last weekend of the Ferenka saga, the terms were turned down.</P>
    <P>I have already stated publicly that I do not intend to apportion blame among the parties involved in this protracted dispute at Ferenka, and I do not propose to do so now.  I agree with Deputy Desmond that there are lessons to be learned from all that has happened in this case.  I am satisfied that the company must shoulder some responsibility for some injudicious actions on their side.  Equally, the trade unions by their adoption of inflexible attitudes must also take some share of the blame&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but whether it be institutions of State or whether it be Ministerial intervention, you can take a horse to the water but you cannot make him drink.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is saddening for me that it was only when the closure of the factory <Col N="1033" /> was imminent the message finally got home and that proposals were accepted, proposals which, I repeat, did not differ substantially from those I had put forward many weeks earlier. They covered the same difficult problems: they were aimed at removing difficulties from the scene in an effort to get work resumed, in an effort to get a temporary arrangement to have difficulties ironed out over a period.  It is unfortunate that one has to take so much time countering mischievous and misleading statements or allegations made here about the Government's handling of the situation, but it was necessary to put the records straight.</P>
    <P>Deputy Desmond said that a statement was made to the effect that the factory should never have been set up in that area.  I do not agree with that.  I support what he said, but to my knowledge no member of the Government or of an institution of the State made that statement&mdash;that a factory should never have been set up there.  I am not saying that the Deputy did suggest it was; he did say a statement had been made to that effect, but I do not support that statement because I believe, and I have repeatedly said, that in the Ferenka situation there were serious difficulties.  It did get considerable publicity, but, on the other hand, the vast majority of all Irish workers and Irish industry move smoothly on day by day.  That does not mean that there are not serious lessons for all of us to be learned here, and that arrangements should not be made to avoid any such development in the future.  The Deputy referred to previous Ministerial intervention always being successful.  I do not want to go into details, but that statement is not correct either.  He referred to interventions by my predecessor which I do not want to go into as that is not the purpose of my speaking here tonight.</P>
    <P>One may say, what of the future?  It is important that I should assure the House that without prejudice to any future development within that company or within that complex I immediately in my Department ensured that the various institutions of the Department direct their attention to the <Col N="1034" /> serious situation which developed there temporary, permanent or otherwise. The National Manpower Service have already made special arrangements since early last week for the registration, first of all, of any job seekers from the firm and, furthermore, to assist them to get employment.  The National Manpower Service served Ferenka well during their period in operation and provided about 1,000 placements within the company.</P>
    <P>Allegations were made about other functions of the Department.  I can assure the House that during my time as Minister all relevant legislation, all relevant requirements, will be examined, because there are unusual aspects of this closure which may or may not affect entitlement or otherwise. The protection of employment and the minimum notices were not observed. The papers in the case have been referred to the legal people for interpretation and advice as to what might be the correct approach.  It is important to say that in the House so that the position should be clear.</P>
    <P>In addition to giving the direction to the National Manpower Service I requested AnCO to look at the apprentice situation immediately.  They have done this effectively where apprentices are concerned for the time being.  They arranged last Monday a meeting of those people.  Some of them are already in off the job training courses and will be retained there, and others are being placed by AnCO on continuing courses. Both they and the National Manpower Service will be looking after them. That is without prejudice to the company or the complex.  That is immediate action on a tragic situation which has arisen for the city of Limerick, the surrounding area and the country.  I want to endorse again that as far as the Government are concerned and as far ts the Ministers are concerned every possible step was taken, every sensible step was taken and nothing was concealed from anybody.  Those people who allege such things are deliberately mischievous or deliberately misleading people into believing that a situation is different.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. Mitchell Mr. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>It is with a great deal of sadness that I rise to speak tonight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1035" /> Before I go on to the notes I have prepared I want to raise, arising from the Minister's speech, the allegation that this party and this side of the House are trying to score political points.  The Minister had the good grace, when I questioned him in the House on 9th and 10th November, to thank me for the responsible part I played and for the welcome and constructive comments I made on his proposal. It is very sad that the Minister should try to get away with that when it is on the record of the House.</P>
    <P>I urge, even at this very late stage, that some action be taken by the Government to save those jobs or to replace them.  That was the purpose of the question put down by the Leader of the Opposition, other Deputies and me last Tuesday.  When the Leader of the Opposition suggested the idea of a workers' co-operative the Taoiseach promised instant attention to this matter. No contact was made with the Ferenka company by 5.30 p.m. last Friday.</P>
    <P>I made a statement on 28th November sympathising with the workers and their families who received such a blow.  I want most profoundly to repeat the sympathy of my party and my own sympathy with the families affected this Christmastime.  On the 19th October the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy quoted what he called his prophetic statement.  Before he made any statement I issued a statement on 19th October after I was refused, for most unusual reasons, permission to raise the Ferenka question in the House.  In my statement I pointed out &ldquo;that the Industrial Relations Acts, 1946 and 1969 gave both the Minister and the Labour Court specific power to take the initiatives in disputes of an inflexible nature, even if the disputes are between groups of workers&rdquo;, I said in that statement:</P>
    <P>There are only two possible outcomes to this dispute, either a settlement or, as stated yesterday by the parent company, or closure.  The danger is that a delayed settlement could come too late to prevent closure.  With 1,400 direct jobs and <Col N="1036" /> many more ancillary jobs at stake together with the likely effect on the future of foreign investment it is now imperative that the Minister waive his declared intention of not involving himself in industrial disputes.</P>
    <P>Action followed on that statement, as the Minister has told the House.</P>
    <P>Two days later on 21st October the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy made his first statment about the danger of closure.  That was the date on the paper produced by the Department of Labour which has been called the Minister's intervention.  The details of that intervention, funnily enough, were not reported in the newspapers until Tuesday 25th October, four days later.  I welcomed that intervention. I said:</P>
    <P>The unusual nature of the Minister's suggestions, therefore, should not call them to be ruled out without careful consideration by the parties involved.  I note the Minister's willingness to amend the suggestions if necessary to facilitate agreement.</P>
    <P>The Minister on the following day met the two unions involved separately. He was told that certain parts of the proposals were not acceptable.  Amendments were suggested and he met the two unions again separately on October 28.  It will be noted that the Minister's first intervention was on October 21st and that the date of his last meeting with the unions was, therefore, one week later.  That was the abject extent of the involvement of the Minister for Labour in this dispute.  Of the 30 minutes allotted to him tonight he spent 20 trying to cover up for a situation in which nothing was done by him or by his Department again until November 24th.  That was after Deputy Kelly had raised by way of a special notice question the threatened Ferenka closure.  When pressed the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy said that he understood a request had been made for a conciliation officer.  On being asked when, he replied &ldquo;today&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Yesterday the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy said that proposals <Col N="1037" /> almost similar to those of the Minister for Labour &ldquo;only different wording&rdquo; were put forward by the Vice President of the ICTU and could be accepted four weeks later by the unions, but that was too late.  The similarity of the proposals is no surprise since they emanated from the same source, the FUE, who put the original proposals to the Minister for Labour on October 21 and who asked if he might put them forward as being his own proposals.  This highlights the laziness and the ineptitude of the Minister for Labour and makes it clear that no proposals were drawn up by him.</P>
    <P>If the question were only one of &ldquo;different wording&rdquo;, why could the Minister not have worked on the proposals in order to arrive at the right form of wording and, thereby, to endeavour to initiate direct talks between the unions as I had urged him to do on November 9 and 10?  At least, he should have provided for some form of conciliation.  Is it not astonishing that Mr. Gene Fitzgerald, so virulent and strident in opposition&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The last intervention of the Minister for Labour was on October 28, the Friday of the holiday weekend.  The next working day was Tuesday, November 1st, and on Wednesday, a meeting was announced for the next day between the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy and ENKA directors.  It was at that meeting that the future of the 1,400 workers was settled.  Deputy O'Malley has the honour to represent in this House the constituency of East Limerick.  It is both sad and ironic that 1,400 families in his constituency at this Christmas time have had their future squandered by Mr. O'Malley's abrasive and biting personality.</P>

      <P>The meeting, about which the ENKA representatives maintained a strict silence was, I heard, a blunt and sometimes heated exchange of views in which the ENKA delegates insisted that the factory must close down if the dispute which has halted production is prolonged.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. Mitchell Mr. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I have said it was the day after the meeting.  It was the issue of November 5 and the report was from a Government spokesman. <i>The Cork Examiner</i> of the same date had this to say:&mdash;</P>
      <P>It is understood that yesterday's meeting was tough, with the Minister emphasising that the Ferenka group had certain managerial responsibilities.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. Mitchell Mr. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The report continued:</P>
      <P>No further talks have been arranged between the Government and the ENKA board, though the Government would be willing to resume discussions if necessary.</P>
      <P>The <i>Irish Independent</i> of the same date had this to say:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This was the blunt message from the Minister for Industry, Commerce <Col N="1039" /> and Energy, Mr. O'Malley, when yesterday he met two senior members of the board of the parent ENKA company....</P>
    <P>....  In a tough-talking session, he went back over the Ferenka performance in the last five years...</P>
    <P>Finally, <i>The Irish Times</i> of the same day had the following to say:</P>
    <P>The meeting, held at the request of ENKA, was reported to be &ldquo;tough and blunt&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>However, reliable sources indicated last night that the possibility of Ferenka pulling out of Limerick, with the consequent loss of 1,400 jobs, still loomed large following yesterday's meeting.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The House will recall that on November 8th I raised with the Taoiseach the question of that meeting. The Taoiseach said that in relation to the allegation of Deputy O'Malley's washing his hands of the affair, we should not believe all we read in the newspapers.  The industrial correspondent of <i>The Irish Times</i> had this to say, as reported in the November 15th issue of that paper:</P>
      <P>Now here's mind test for you:</P>
      <P>Where do you think the papers got hold of the information that Dessie O'Malley was playing Big John Wayne with the ENKA management, since no reporters were actually present at the meeting?</P>

      <P>Last week the Taoiseach told the Dáil that within the offer that emerged from this meeting there were certain unacceptable terms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1040" /> However, no attempt was made by the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy to negotiate a modification of these terms or to put forward alternative proposals.  Instead, speaking on a radio programme on November 29th one of the directors, Mr. Hutter, said that the &ldquo;Minister in response to the company's offer excluded this possibility absolutely&rdquo;.  Another director said also in a radio interview on November 24th that &ldquo;the Irish Government had no solution to propose&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I should have liked more time in which to expose the situation at Ferenka.  As I have indicated by way of the consistent newspaper reports the meeting was one at which Deputy O'Malley not only lost his head but lost 1,400 jobs.  The telegram referred to in this House by Deputy Kelly yesterday substantiates these reports. That telegram did not blame industrial relations but the Minister.  So bad were relationships after that meeting that the Minister for Labour may have been compromised regarding any further initiative.  Not only that, but it was thought that the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy and the board of ENKA could never speak together again.  A long cooling off period was required.  It took three weeks.  Three weeks later they met again in very strained circumstances.  The plant was gone and with it 1,400 jobs.  This has been the cost of the mistake made by the Government.  Limerick has been ill-served by its TD.</P>
    <P>It is small consolation to the people of Limerick that at the next election they will have it in their power to wreak retribution.  We are not calling on the Minister for Labour to resign and we are not even calling on the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy to resign&mdash;not yet, that is.  We want an independent public inquiry to ascertain all the facts&mdash;the whole facts and nothing but the facts.  It has been suggested that this will be a case of &ldquo;we will give them a fair trial and then hang them&rdquo;.   They will hang themselves as they have 1,400 families in Limerick this week.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy who has had for 16 years the honour and the privilege to represent the constituency in which this unfortunate disaster has occurred, I regret the sad circumstances which have warranted this debate.  I totally reject the implication by certain spokesmen from the Government over the past 24 hours that this debate was an attempt to play petty party politics with this issue.  I would remind the House that right through this sorry tale over the past two months we on this side of the House and our colleagues in the Labour Party behaved honourably and responsibly.  We acceded to the appeal by the Taoiseach and the Minister for Labour to refrain from making any public comments which might in any way exacerbate what we were assured were delicate negotiations proceeding at that time.  It is only right and proper that a major issue, which could be termed the worst economic disaster and the worst industrial disaster in the history of this House, should be debated in this Parliament objectively, in an endeavour to ascertain what went wrong and why it happened.  We must remember that in a major issue of this kind the buck stops on those benches over there.  This issue has been written about and has been debated in every household throughout the country and has been debated abroad.  It is only right that we should discuss it.  I regret that this major industrial complex is now closed.  Many of the 1,400 are friends, relatives, constituents and supporters of mine.  I am sure that everybody in the Limerick region and everybody throughout the country will endorse my appeal to the Government to get this mess cleaned up and to get these 1,400 people back to work immediately.  This is the challenge now facing the Government.  This is the type of challenge that the Government were elected to deal with.  We want to get this factory re-opened.  With the due deliberation, having carefully considered the events that led up to the closure, I say that this factory can be reopened; a formula can be found and must be found which will ensure that these people will get back to work as quickly as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The debate we have had last evening <Col N="1042" /> and this evening, particularly the contributions by the two Ministers who contributed to the debate on behalf of the Government and the extraordinarly petulant and childish remarks of the Taoiseach at the opening of the Dáil this morning, serve to demonstrate in a very frightening fashion the appallingly inept manner in which the Government have dealt with this serious issue.  The story of Ferenka is probably one of the most tragic episodes in the industrial history of this nation. It is tragic because this great industrial complex is now closed, but it is infinitely more tragic because this closure could have been averted if appropriate and feasible action had been taken in time by the Government.</P>
    <P>In the whole debate on this issue over the recent weeks the important concept of Government responsibility, of Government intervention in national issues of this kind, has been missing.  I have found it amusing, having had the privilege to sit on those benches for over four years, to hear this idea of non-responsibility and non-intervention by a Government, in issues of this kind, being put forward by the two Minister opposite.  If anything characterised the Fianna Fáil period in opposition from 1973 to 1977, if there was one thing more than any other which was to the forefront of their strategy both inside the House and outside, it was the principle of blaming the then Government for every industrial closure and for every industrial problem and of calling for intervention when disputes arose.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy will have to admit that nowhere more than in our constituency and city of Limerick was this so clearly demonstrated. Every problem that arose, every time a factory had redundancies because of the world economic crisis, there were calls from Fianna Fáil Deputies for Government intervention.  They blamed the Government, and they blamed Deputy O'Donnell.  I have taken the trouble to check back the files of the <i>Limerick Leader</i> over those <Col N="1043" /> four years, and week after week, month after month, and I have noted that if a factory closed it was a case of blaming the Government but particularly of blaming Deputy O'Donnell. Therefore the Government now, elected with the largest majority in the history of this State, have in the Cabinet two Ministers with specific responsibility, one in the light of industrial development and the other in the light of industrial relations.  I cannot accept, and nobody is so naive as to accept, that Pontius Pilate attitude of the Government in relation to this issue.</P>

It is crazy and it is not on.  It is normal practice and a responsibility of Government to face up to challenges of this kind. Having established the fact that the Government do intervene, the question now can be asked, when and how could the Government have intervened? The fatal date was 4th November. The writing was clearly on the wall on that day.  That was the day on which the offer was made by the parent company to the Government via the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy, an offer which he rejected absolutely and completely.</P>

      <P>I have only a few minutes left.  That was the fatal day; that was the time the action should have been taken.  I agree with Deputy Barry Desmond in his opening remarks that it is a question of Cabinet responsibility. I do not believe in personal attacks.  This issue was discussed by the Cabinet.  The door was open at that stage for counter-offers, for meaningful negotiations between the Government and the parent company with a view to finding a formula which would ensure that this plant could be re-opened and that we could get on with the job.  All the information available indicates that if the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy and <Col N="1044" /> the Government had pursued these negotiations a meaningful and suitable formula could have been found.</P>

      <P>At that stage the writing was on the wall.  On the 4th November it would have been a case of the Government pulling out all the stops, with the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy, the Minister for Labour or the Taoiseach himself using all the resources at their disposal to secure a formula involving the Government, the parent company and the Ferenka workers which could have ensured that that plant would have remained in production.  This is where the real failure of the Government is clearly demonstrated.  In relation to the reopening of the factory and to the proposal of the Leader of my party, Deputy FitzGerald, when he put forward a concept of a workers' co-operative, I am convinced that there was an exciting challenge and an ideal opportunity presented to the Government on 4th November to devise a unique formula, involving the workers by way of co-operative, the Government and the parent Ferenka company, which would have ensured that production in this plant could have continued.</P>
      <P>I regret to have to say that we are fully justified in tabling this motion. Having listened to the contributions, particularly by the two Ministers, we have no reason in the world, and no reason has been given to us, to exonerate the Government in any way from their part of the blame for the closure of this factory.  There is no use in the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy or the Minister for Labour making passionate appeals here, throwing in red herrings and introducing extraneous issues which have no direct relevance to the major issue, which is the disaster located in Annacotty in the County of Limerick. Finally, I cannot understand why the Government did not more vigorously pursue the possibility of saving this plant on 4th November.  There was reasons why the present Government should have made a very special effort in this case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1045" /> Questions have been asked on a number of occasions in the news media and otherwise about the circumstances under which this plant was located in Annacotty.  I and everybody else in the constituency of East Limerick can tell the House that Ferenka was located in Annacotty as the result of a deliberate decision by the then Government in which the present Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy was Minister for Justice.  They took credit for it, there is no doubt about that.  The size of the industry, the fact that it was an almost exclusively male employment industry, the massive State investment in it, the 1,400 jobs, and the frightening economic and social consequences of the closure, all add up to a case where the Government should have pulled out all the stops. They did not do so, and they stand <Col N="1046" /> condemned and charged with negligence by this House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. G. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>A comprehensive programme of training for prison officers has been in existence for some years.  This programme includes induction courses for newly-recruited officers, an on-the-job training programme for new officers, a special programme of four-week refresher training courses for the staff employed at the open centres at Shanganagh and Loughan House and suitable development courses for all officers above the basic level.  Most of this programme is carried out on a full-time basis by trained officers of the Prison Service, with the part-time assistance of the Department's training officer and other headquarter's officers.  Assistance is got from outside agencies such as the Civil Service Training Centre, the Institute of Public Administration and AnCO in providing places at courses run by them or in participating in internal courses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An estimate of the annual cost of this training based on the salaries of the officers engaged full-time in training and the cost of courses provided by outside agencies is of the order of £23,000.  Other costs which cannot readily be assessed are the proportions of the salaries of the officers involved in the training on a part-time basis and the cost of the service provided <Col N="939" /> by the Civil Service Training Centre for which there is no charge.</P>
    <P>The programme of training is under continuous review and is being and will continue to be expanded and adjusted to meet the needs of the Prison Service.</P>

      <P>The cost in the calendar year 1974 was £50,278, in 1975 it was £54,172, in 1976 it was £76,752 and in the nine months period 1st January to 30th September 1977 it was £165,000.</P>
      <P>These figures, it will be seen, show a marked upward trend, particularly since 1975.  There are various reasons for this&mdash;principally an increase in the number of cases in which legal aid has been granted by the courts and increases in the legal aid fees paid to solicitors and counsel.  The indications are that the cost of legal aid will continue to rise because of increasing recourse to the scheme and because the full effect of recent increases in legal aid, fees will not become apparent for some time.</P>

      <P>Some years ago, a proposal on those line was made by the Incorporated Law Society and it seemed to be generally accepted at the time that this would probably be a good idea as far as mortgages for private house purchase were concerned.  However, recent investigations conducted into the subject on behalf of the National Prices Commission have raised doubts <Col N="940" /> as to whether such an amendment of the law would be in the real interests of borrowers as a whole.  I would refer, for instance, to the NPC Occasional Paper No. 14, of which a copy is available in the Library, and in particular to paragraph 80 of that document.</P>
      <P>I propose to have the whole matter examined in the context of a review of the law relating to the mortgagor/ mortgagee relationship but for practical reasons this must wait until work on more pressing legislation has concluded.</P>

      <P>In reply to a supplementary question arising out of a parliamentary question from the Deputy which was answered by me on 27th October, I said that I accepted the suggestion that the time was ripe for the investigation of the intoxicating liquor laws by a commission. That, of course, was an immediate reaction to the suggestion made by the Deputy.  On reflection, it seems to me that the findings of a commission might be of limited value.  There are a number of conflicting interests involved, some of them within the licensed trade and the findings of a <Col N="941" /> commission would not remove the conflict. I am continuing to receive representations on various aspects of the intoxicating liquor laws and I shall be having discussions with various interested groups.  I shall, in due course, be in a better position to judge whether the Acts ought to be amended or a commission set up or, indeed, whether the law ought to remain as it is.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. G. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to a question last week asking for similar information in relation to robberies in the country as a whole, I said that assembling some of the information sought would involve a search through the records of every Garda station and that I did not consider that the allocation of scarce Garda resources to such a task would be justified. While that is still the position as far as questions of this kind are concerned, there is a further consideration, namely, that the publication in this way of the names and addresses of <Col N="942" /> victims of robberies would mean additional publicity which experience suggests would be regarded by many of those concerned, especially private individuals as distinct from institutions such as banks, as adding gratuitously to the injury already done to them.  I am aware that names and addresses are usually published at the time of the crime and again in connection with court proceedings but even that kind of publicity, necessary though it often is, is regarded by many victims as unfortunate and most unwelcome. I do not think that additional publication at this point would serve any purpose sufficient to outweigh that consideration.</P>
      <P>The number of robberies recorded as having been committed in County Donegal from 1st July to 1st December, 1977 is eight, of which seven were armed robberies.  The amounts reported as taken ranged from £200 to £3,600.</P>

It is estimated that expenditure in 1977 on improvement works will be of the order of £600,000.  These grants were related to specific improvement works, including the construction of two new bridges, on approximately eight miles of roadway.  They do not, of course, include the annual up-keep programmes undertaken by the local authorities concerned.  The planning of further improvement works on this road is a continuing process.  Current planning provides for by-passes for Chapelizod, Lucan and Mullingar and a new alignment between Palmerstown and Ballydowd in County Dublin.

      <P>I am aware of the difficulties which such families can encounter in seeking rehousing on the mainland. The tenancies of all dwellings let by Donegal county council must be allocated in accordance with the approved scheme of letting priorities made to them under section 60 of the Housing Act 1966.  It is open to the council to consider applications for rehousing from the families in accordance with their letting priorities scheme.  It is a matter entirely for the council to make a decision on the rehousing of individual applicants, within the overall resources available to them.  A decision on the amount to be allocated to them for local authority housing in 1978 will be taken by me following the Government's decision on the budget allocation for this purpose in the 1978 Public Capital Programme.</P>

The provision in regard to the reconstruction and so on of the Abbey School has been fulfilled.  A sum of £580 of the income is allocated for the <Col N="952" /> payment of the annual subsidy for instruction in agriculture and £1,720 for scholarships.</P>

      <P>The Educational Research Centre was established to carry out research in education.  Their main function is to provide research findings that may be of use either in the formation of educational policy or in the teaching-learning process.  Their primary function, therefore, is not to provide a service to individual teachers or pupils. However, where the provision of such a service is not incompatible with their research function, the centre have always attempted to provide it.  Thus, for example, it has been normal practice for the centre to provide information to teachers on pupils' performance on ability and attainment tests administered in the course of research projects except when the provision of such information would interfere with the objectives of particular research studies.  Teachers are informed whether or not it will be possible to provide information on individual pupils or classes before the commencement of a project.</P>
