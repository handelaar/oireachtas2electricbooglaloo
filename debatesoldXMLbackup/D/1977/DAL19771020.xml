    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to compliment the Minister on introducing this Bill.  The Medical Registration Council have served the community and the profession very well over the last 50 years and I am sure over the next 50 years the new Medical Council will serve both the community and the profession equally well.</P>
      <P>I would like to make a few brief comments on this Bill.  First, I will comment on the membership of the council.  I am glad to see the Minister has increased the number of elected members from two to ten.  I have slight reservations about how the council will be made up.  On paper it looks very good but in practice I have reservations. One, it may be too academically orientated and insufficient representation from the active practising profession. Two, it may be too Dublin orientated.  We do not have anything against Dublin but in the past some health committees have been very overloaded towards the city, particularly Comhairle na nOspidéal with the result that rural Ireland was not well represented. It is important that in this council rural Ireland should be well represented because the council will have some responsibility for post-graduate education.  In this field particularly there are problems in rural Ireland that do not exist in the city, such as the difficulties of doctors coming together and getting cover to attend courses.</P>
      <P>In relation to the election of members to the council, I would draw attention to section 11 (3) which states:</P>
      <P>(3)  Regulations made by the Minister under subsection (1) of this section may, in particular&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  specify, in relation to any class of persons specified in the regulations, the qualifications to be held by candidates for election to the Council, and</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="883" /> (b)  specify that the chief executive officer of each health board shall act as local returning officer at an election in relation to those persons who are entitled to vote at the election, and are engaged in the practice of medicine within the functional area of such health board.</P>
    <P>The present system of drawing up an electoral roll is that when there is an election for medical officers or other allied professions to the health boards an advertisment is placed in the newspapers inviting members of the profession to apply to get on the electoral roll.  This appears to be a cumbersome procedure because for one reason or another many members may not see the advertisement or they may forget to apply.  It would be better if the health board kept an electoral roll and brought it up to date from time to time.  There is not much movement of members of the profession in each health board within the five-year period, or what-ever length there is between the various elections that may take place, either elections to the health boards or to the General Medical Council.</P>
    <P>In relation to education, the new Medical Council will be responsible for under-graduate education, for examinations and post-graduate education, particularly post-graduate education relating to specialty degrees. They will not have any direct interest in admission to medical schools.  In my opinion the present system might be improved upon, because while it eliminates patronage it does not take account of the aptitude of the student to follow a career in medicine.  This is a disadvantage.</P>
    <P>In relation to post-graduate education, it is clearly stated in the Bill that the council will be responsible for post-graduate education relating to specialty degrees.  Section 36 says:</P>
    <P>The Minister may, by order, assign all or any of the following functions to the Council&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  the promotion and development of post-graduate medical <Col N="884" /> education and training, and the co-ordination of such development,</P>
    <P>I am not clear if the Minister intends that to be on-going post-graduate education for the profession rather than just post-graduate education for specialty degrees.  This would be an important role for the council because at the moment there is no viable post-graduate centre for doctors to keep up to date.  Doctors, like politicians, are in a learning situation all the time. It is essential both for the benefit of the public and the profession that the doctors get an opportunity to keep up to date with what is happening and to keep abreast of medical developments throughout their working careers.</P>
    <P>In relation to fitness to practice, while suggestions have been made that cases of shortfall in the existing medical services might be referred to the Medical Council, I think this would be a mistake.  As the Medical Registration Council have done in the past, this council should deal with serious cases of professional misconduct. There is ample facility within the existing health services for discipline against doctors who are in breach of their contracts.  The chief executive officer of the health board has authority to suspend a doctor in certain circumstances.  Therefore, in my view it would not be in the public interest if all cases of complaint against doctors were referred to the new council.</P>
    <P>In relation to the EEC and free movement of doctors, I am not sure whether the Minister or the council will have a say in who practices where.  I would like the Minister to answer this question.  Will it be necessary to go on the register of another country in order that one might practise in that country?  At present for those who work in Border areas here it is necessary to be on the register of the Medical Registration Council and on the General Medical Council register.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister on this Bill and I congratulate him on the manner in which he is dealing with <Col N="885" /> his Department and on the goodwill he is creating not alone with the medical profession but with the other professions involved in the health care of the people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this necessary Bill but I would like to make some points as a former chairman of the South Western Health Board and as a member of the board. While the Bill has been given wide powers in relation to disciplinary measures for the profession and in relation to the registration of professional graduates, it is not going as far as it might in relation to the working conditions of the medical profession.  Earlier speakers made the point that in the establishment of the Medical Council members elected to the council should be more nationally based rather than centralised in Dublin and I agree.  Members should not have to work, live or practise in this city.  I agree with the suggestions made about ministerial nominees to this council, that consumers should be represented.  My experience with health boards and health committees is that on many occasions the profession welcome the opinions put forward by lay-people who could be called consumer representatives.  The Minister should consider this when nominating members.</P>
      <P>This council will have the power to strike somebody off the register for various reasons thereby depriving an individual of his living.  The council should also involve itself in making recommendations on many aspects of the working conditions of the doctors. From my discussions with doctors I have found that they do not have sufficient protection.  I know we have the medical defence organisation, but they are not involved with the Medical Council.  There should be some contact between both organisations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>New drugs come on the market fairly regularly.  High-powered salesmen go around selling them and quite a lot of publicity is involved in the launching of a new drug.  Because a drug is new doctors will prescribe it even though it costs much more than <Col N="886" /> a similar type drug which will do the job as well.  Because the drug is new, and because of the publicity and sales pressure doctors are led to believe that this is the best product.  The prescribing habits of doctors should be examined and recommendations should be made to the profession by this powerfully representative body.  I am not a medical expert but I have been told by members of the profession that penicillin, for example, is just as good as Penbritten although Penbritten costs twice as much as the other.  Because of the publicity surounding newer drugs there is a tendency for doctors to prescribe them.  There have been enormous increases in the cost of drugs and an increase in the cost of general medical services.  When talking about the increase in the cost of general medical services we must take into account the 50 to 60 per cent of the public who have to buy their own drugs.  How is it that the cost of drugs in Ireland is much greater than that in England?  All these matters should be looked into by the council.  This council can do much more work than has been outlined in the Bill.  The Minister should take these points into consideration when making recommendations to the council in relation to additional functions they might have dealing with working conditions of doctors.</P>
    <P>Section 36 of the Bill was referred to by Deputy O'Hanlon dealing with on-going post-graduate education and training.  Will there be an onus on the graduates to participate in post-graduate education and training?  There should be an onus on somebody on the council to encourage each practising doctor to become involved with the opportunities for post-graduate education and training.</P>
    <P>Provision has been made for the creation of a specialist registrar.  I hope that as soon as the council is set up that provision will be implemented. At present in relation to specialist and consultants.  there are two different methods of appointment.  In the health board hospitals the local appointments commissioner is involved in the appointment of senior consultants and specialists of one kind or another and <Col N="887" /> in the voluntary hospitals such appointments are made privately.  The medical profession will be the first to agree that there should be some type of uniformity in this type of appointment. The Medical Council should use its influence to ensure that appointments made in any hospital and in medical practice generally will follow the same pattern.</P>
    <P>I should like to think that the Medical Council, when formed, would make recommendations to the Minister and the health boards in relation to entry to the GMS for doctors and that some guidelines would be laid down.  A body such as the Medical Council would be an appropriate one to lay down those guidelines in relation to the number of patients, type of area a doctor would serve and the kind of cover he would require.  Somebody has to make these rules somewhere.</P>
    <P>The situation in Europe at present is front page news today&mdash;the spy in the cab in relation to the employment of long-distance truck drivers who must drive for a period of eight hours only without taking some rest.  If that be the case in relation to truck drivers surely a professional man's conditions of work&mdash;having to give seven days a week, 24 hours a day cover to thousands of people&mdash;and the pressures to which he is subjected must be examined.  This Medical Council who will be involved in the education, regulation and control of the profession as a whole sooner or later must be the body to direct themselves to recommending to the unions on the one side, the Department and health boards on the other the kind of guidelines to be laid down in respect of their working conditions.  I shall not go into the detail of how one doctor is capable of making a living in a smaller area with a smaller number of patients, or a consultant in the same position, while another may be in a position to render a similar service with three or four times as many patients.  It is difficult to have something definite done in this respect.  However, I repeat that this Medical Council&mdash;which I am <Col N="888" /> sure will be recognised as the important medical, professional body here &mdash;will be listened to in regard to anything they may say or recommend for the profession or the public at large.  I am sure such suggestions would be taken into account by the people who have to make the decisions eventually about their conditions of work and the service they must render to the public.</P>
    <P>Since the Medical Council have the power to strike somebody off their register or deprive him of his livelihood, for various reasons, they must become involved also in ensuring that that individual has adquate remuneration for his work and is in a position to give maximum cover as a professional service to the public.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is provision in the Bill for its scope to be widened to take account of the points I have made.  As Minister for Health the Minister is involved in all aspects of this.  People may say that a body such as the Medical Council, made up almost entirely of professional medical people, might not be the most appropriate organisation to lay down guidelines in respect of their working conditions lest they be interested only in safeguarding their own positions.  I do not think that is the case.  I believe they are a noble, hard-working group particularly those in the area I represent, the north-west, where people live in scattered areas, where doctors have huge areas to cover and where consultants and all other staffs involved in the functioning of hospitals do so under extreme pressure, perhaps not even with the most modern facilities.  Those people and their representatives on this Medical Council will be concerned, as they have been. about the public interest and therefore should be entrusted with the task of making recommendations on the points I have raised.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on introducing this legislation.  I hope it will achieve the goal intended.  Eventually I hope it will resolve all of the problems in relation to conditions of employment of the medical profession which are of even greater concern to <Col N="889" /> the public at present than are regulations and control.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I endorse what has been said about the introduction of this Bill.  Any Bill that sets out to improve matters in an area as important as health is to be welcomed. One of its most pleasing aspects is the fact that the Minister has intimated that he will repeal the 1927 Act, ending up with another comprehensive one covering all aspects of this important area of life.  At a time when people's lives are becoming more and more complicated, constrained by regulations and so on at national and EEC level, it is heartening to see such an approach being adopted and the production of such a comprehensive Bill containing all the answers.</P>
      <P>As the Minister said, in the 50 years' existence of the previous Act many changes have taken place.  The main ones have been in society's own attitude to medicine, in the approach of the medical profession to medicine and in the approach of the medical profession to their patients.  If society is to be informed about where it is going and what to expect from this kind of service the incorporation of all legislation in one Bill is admirable and a situation which is to be welcomed.</P>
      <P>The Minister's predecessor established a committee with specific terms of reference.  The committee reported and the Minister is now acting on that report.  The need for legislation to regulate the medical profession, its activities, standards, qualifications and so on possibly is overdue.  Deputy MacSharry mentioned the high cost of health services in this and in other countries.  In England it is very high in relation to the cost of other services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Here we have a system of health boards which cover regional areas.  So far as health services are concerned we have adopted a decentralisation system.  In one sense these regulations concern a fairly narrow field but they will have consequential effects right down the line to the patient in the doctor's surgery.  Because of the massive costs involved in providing these services&mdash;costs that are escalating <Col N="890" /> daily&mdash;it is essential that we get value for money.  That should be the main objective of any activities pursued by the Minister in relation to this Bill.</P>
    <P>How can we ensure that this objective will be attained, that is, if it is attainable at all?  The establishment of the Medical Council to replace its predecessor is a first step forward.  In common with other speakers I am disappointed about the representation on the council of people from the greatest portion of the population, namely, lay people.  Section 9 states there will be representation from the colleges of medicine, from the various specialist interests such as an anaesthetics, radiology, pathology, obstetrics, gynaecology, psychiatry and two from the general practitioners area.</P>
    <P>When we discuss this matter on Committee Stage I hope to hear that the Minister's four appointees will be lay people.  That would be some redress for the imbalance that appears to exist on the council at the moment. Of course it does not follow that because of the number of specialist interests represented on the council the end result will be a misrepresentation of the facts, it does not mean it will work to the detriment of the general public.  However, it would seem to the lay man that risk exists because of the composition of the council.  To minimise that risk representation might be juggled around to give more to lay people.  We should be seen to be equitable in our approach in this matter if that is possible.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the Minister's difficulty in that the matters to be dealt with by the council are highly specialist matters dealing with the type of education the medical profession will obtain and with other matters concerning the profession.  Many of the questions they will discuss will not be within the competence of the lay man to discuss but we must remember that at the end of all this is the lay person in the doctor's surgery.  The way he will be treated by the general practitioner or by a specialist will depend ultimately on the activities of the council and the way they lay ground rules for the <Col N="891" /> qualifications necessary for medical personnel.</P>
    <P>Section 26 deals with the establishment of the register and one aspect strikes me as commendable.  Up to now we have had a general register on which was included all doctors with different kinds of qualifications. Now we will have a general register of medical practitioners and also a provisional register.  Has the Minister in mind a kind of probationary period?  If so, is the person on the provisional register open to any kind of test or examination before he is put on the general register?</P>
    <P>Section 29 (2) states:</P>
    <P>The Council may extend a period determined under subsection (1) of this section for such further period or periods as the Council may determine, provided that the aggregate of such periods shall not exceed five years.</P>
    <P>When the change-over comes does that person have to go through any kind of test?  It will be a good thing to have a register specifically dealing with post-graduate training; we have not had this up to now.  It always was a highly specialised area and it is becoming even more specialised.  In these modern times the equipment needed to carry out work in hospitals is highly technical and specialised knowledge is needed to operate this equipment and use it to its full capacity.  I presume a specialist register will look after the type of personnel involved in this activity in the profession.</P>
    <P>The west of Ireland in the past has suffered because the population is scattered.  Many sparsely populated areas have not been a great attraction to doctors.  Is there any way the practical difficulties of the Western Health Board, which includes Mayo, Galway and Roscommon, can be overcome?  Patients in those areas, because of their geographical location, do not get the same service as patients in Galway, Dublin and areas adjacent to the medical centres, the specialist hospitals, the general hospitals or the university medical schools.  A person <Col N="892" /> in some areas of the Western Health Board who needs a particular type of specialist treatment may have to travel up to 100 miles to get it.  He may have to travel from the north west of Mayo to Galway where the specialist facility is available.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the Minister's difficulty in getting over that problem but we must set out to treat all our citizens equally.  I do not know how the Minister can get over this problem. Obviously, this Bill will not be concerned with that although it must have a bearing on it when one considers the qualifications of the people coming out of medical school.  It is important to disperse that manpower in the most efficient way to give value for the money invested in the service. We must remember that no amount of money will buy a life and we are dealing with the lives of people.  The problems facing us in the future will be even worse than those that face us now because people will demand the service they feel they are entitled to.</P>
    <P>People are now looking for information about their rights and are not prepared to be fobbed off with highly technical data.  They want to know why a person living in a backward area should not be able to get the same treatment as a person in a central area.  Under the law that person is entitled to get it.  We are dealing with an enlightened community whose demands are increasing all the time.  We will not be able to provide the facilities demanded by that community if we do not plan ahead. We have long gone past the day when a Minister for Health can say that something cannot be done because it will cost too much.  He is dealing with the health of the people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardFilgate" hpid="Mr. Filgate Mr. Filgate">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Filgate</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like, first of all, to congratulate our very discerning Minister for Health on bringing this Bill to the House.  It is one of the most important Bills which has come before the House because it deals with the life and welfare of the community.  I was pleased to hear some of the Deputies saying they would like to see some lay people represented on the new council.  This is <Col N="893" /> very important because for too long we believed that the medical profession should always be separated from the views of the ordinary people.  We have seen during the past six or seven years that this does not work.  There has been great co-operation on the health boards throughout the country between the medical profession and the public representatives who represent the community.</P>
      <P>It is very important to note that in the early days, which we may refer to as the blood-letting days of 1858, the first measure was enacted to protect the community.  The preamble to that Act stated that the ailing patient must be in a position to know and distinguish between the qualified and the unqualified. This Bill seeks to clarify that.  The enlargement of the Council will ensure that there will be a wide range of opinion in the deliberation of the new council.  This means there will be greater protection for the ordinary people.  Patients will be assured that they have the best qualified doctors to deal with them.  We know that there is no more vulnerable person than the patient.  He or she is totally dependent upon the skills of the doctor who is giving medical attention.  In other professions error can occur which can be remedied.  The architect or engineer can make an error in drawing a plan but the plan can be rectified.  This does not apply where the doctor is concerned.</P>
      <P>I am glad to see that provision is being made for the setting up of a separate register of medical specialists. This is most important.  According to the Bill, this will be at a later date and the Minister will undoubtedly give deep consideration to it.  Such a register is in use in all the other member States of the EEC except the United Kingdom.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has taken steps to ensure that there is no conflict between the provisions of the Bill and the Constitution. This is of paramount importance. It is right to say that the medical profession, no more than any other, is not free of human error. Errors can occur and it is of the upmost importance to ensure that those <Col N="894" /> who enter the field of medicine should be very well qualified.  The community must be assured that the very best that can be provided by the State will be provided.  I should like to compliment the Minister on the introduction of this Bill and to wish him well.  I know that he is a very discerning person and that he will do all in his power to ensure the maintenance of the highest medical standards.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ChrisJFox" hpid="Mr. Fox Mr. Fox">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fox</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like, first of all, to compliment the Minister on the efficient way he opened the debate in assuring the House that he is taking the best possible advice available in the planning of the hospital in north county Dublin.  This is in total contrast to the suggestion from the other side of the House that the hearsay of a rather disgruntled junior Member should be given precedence over the evidence of the experts.</P>
      <P>One of the functions of this Bill is to ensure that the standard of knowledge required at examinations held by the medical schools is adequate.  It would seem that certain professions and some trades admit people according to the attainment of a competitive standard rather than an objective standard. The most important resource of any nation is the intellect of its people. The utilisation of the intellect of our people should not be confined by restrictive practices of this type.  There might be a case for saying that the attainment of an objective standard is more worthy of consideration than confining a profession to a small competitive <i>élite</i>.  Even with an amount of free education it is still a very great sacrifice for many parents to pay for the training of a doctor or a nurse.  Because of the intense competition a person who may have achieved a very satisfactory standard may be ineligible for entry to a certain profession.  This is to be deprecated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The achievements of the Irish medical profession range far beyond the borders of Ireland.  Its members have made a contribution throughout the free world, particularly in areas of great need.  The contribution of Irish nurses and doctors in Africa, South America and the Far East is incalculable. <Col N="895" /> There is tremendous wealth in the Middle East but a great scarcity of hospital facilities and trained medical personnel.  I am led to believe that whole hospital towns are being established on a contractual basis in various parts of this area by international cartels.  I would suggest that the intellect of our people could be used in that area.  After all, medicine is a global thing; it is not national or parochial.  It could be of great benefit to this country to ally the availability of talent in the fields of medicine and construction.</P>
    <P>At this point I digress for a short time to mention the fishermen of Skerries.  Being anxious to expand their trade and knowing that Skerries is the most suitable point on the east coast for the provision of a harbour, they employed a consultancy firm to confirm that it was feasible to put a fine harbour at that location.  They have given an example to the medical profession, not just in the maintenance of standards but in the provision of opportunities for the people.</P>
    <P>Africa is at the threshold of expansion. Its untold wealth must surely be used by its people but they have great educational needs in the medical sphere.  There was a time when we were known as the island of saints and scholars but the Africans would recognise us as the island of doctors and nurses because we have provided a considerable number of doctors and nurses for that Continent.</P>
    <P>I respectfully suggest that there is an opportunity for the Department to explore the feasibility of that need to the advantage both of our people and the people of the developing countries. In this context we could expand our training facilities and if possible provide a total package where necessary for the developing countries.  The one thing they are not short of is money. It is true that they can pay for the provision of training facilities.  I suggest to the Minister that the various facets of the medical profession should not be confined to standards for doctors and nurses but that the undoubted opportunity for the widening of the profession for the <Col N="896" /> benefit of the country should be considered.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>In common with the other speakers I should like to congratulate the Minister on the great work he is doing in his Department. People are more aware of the efforts being made to expand and improve the health services and this Bill represents a further step in that direction.</P>
      <P>It is 50 years since we had major legislation on this matter.  In the meantime we have had minor legislation but this Bill is fundamental and reflects the thinking of the Minister and his Department.  We all believe that a change was needed and the Minister is giving us a change which will be of advantage to the medical profession. The medical profession must change in order to keep up with modern trends.  One hears complaints about the lack of doctors at certain times in some areas of the city.  I have often wondered whether it would be possible to have a mobile team of doctors at each health centre who would be on call to perform minor operations on patients in their own homes.  Nowadays, most of our housing is of a high standard and I believe that it would be of benefit to people if minor operations were performed in their own homes.  It would mean that the mother of a young family would not have to be removed from her home and family, which can be very inconvenient. I suggest that it would be a less expensive way of dealing with minor ailments.  This is not a new idea as maternity hospitals have been providing a similar service for a long time.  The medical profession deserves the respect which we give to it.  We must fight disease and therefore cannot invest enough money in the health services.</P>
      <P>The Minister has a difficult task ahead of him.  Some time ago I read that we need to appoint 300 more consultants to the teaching hospitals and that, if they are not appointed, the service will have to close.  I read that in a responsible journal and I am sure that it is true.  On the other hand, we hear that the medical schools are reducing the number of entrants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="897" /> While this year's cutbacks will not influence the number of consultants, we will have a scarcity of consultants in a few years.  On one hand, people are complaining about the shortage of doctors in certain areas and on the other hand the medical schools are cutting back on the number of entrants.  Generally speaking, the medical profession has been drawn mainly from middle class.  Many young boys and girls want to study medicine but their hopes are remote at present despite free education.  Even if people have the money to attend medical school, the high grades required mean that a great number are refused entry. We may well be paying a terrible price for this system in that many young people who might become brilliant doctors are never given a chance.</P>
    <P>The medical profession is going through a bad time in Dublin because of the proposed federation, the closing of the older hospitals, the enlarging of St. James's and the new hospital at Beaumont.  I would like the Minister to assure doctors and staffs of the federated hospitals that their future will be safeguarded.  I believe the older hospitals will be used for long-term patients.  The Minister should consider the plan of the federation of hospitals, especially as he has sanctioned the extension of St. James's hospital.  There will be a great demand for doctors, surgeons and specialists and I hope the new Medical Council will consider the problems of the doctors in the federated hospitals in order to ensure that their places will be safeguarded.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fox mentioned a very important point&mdash;our connection with the Third World and even with the more developed countries in, for instance, the Middle East.  It is only fitting that we pay tribute to all those Irish men and women who gave up so much to help the people in those other countries.  In this tribute we include not only the religious but all those lay people who have been involved so actively in improving medical services in these areas.  Their task in the past was very difficult because they had not available to them the drugs and various aids that we are familiar with today.  In addition to the people in the medical sphere we have exported <Col N="898" /> people who became involved in the political life of those countries.  In a sense there is an association between a politician and a doctor to the extent that public representatives when they attend at what are popularly known as clinics are often confronted with people who merely have come along for a chat.  One such person, an old man, comes to see me regularly at my clinic.  On such occasions one can become impatient if there are a lot of other people waiting for a consultation but I always try to have regard to the fact that it means a lot to this man to come along to the clinic merely to talk to somebody.</P>
    <P>However, politicians may not be the best people to cope with situations like these and this is where the doctor is very important.  Deputy Brady raised a point about how difficult it is for a patient to see a specialist.  Indeed it is very difficult for one to see the doctor of his choice.  Although people may not be ill as such they may be disturbed emotionally in which case a chat with their doctor could be of immense help.  It is said that there are not sufficient jobs for the numbers of personnel graduating from our medical schools but it is my opinion that we should be training doctors in even greater numbers so that we could concentrate more on preventive medicine. Economically, too, this would make sense since it is not as costly to prevent illness as to cure it.  Because of the pressures of today's life styles, there is a much higher incidence of nervous disorders especially in so far as young people are concerned.  We hear tragic stories from time to time of students finding the strain of examinations too much and, consequently, having to be hospitalised.  This can happen to students at any level of education and it is an aspect of this whole sphere of medicine to which the new council might give close attention.</P>
    <P>This Bill signals a very good beginning to the tenure of office of the new Minister but we must not let the occasion pass without recording our acknowledgment of the very good work that has been done by the present Medical Council.  Discipline in the medical profession has always been <Col N="899" /> high here.  However, one hears from time to time of apparent breaches of this discipline.  I am referring to allegations of over prescribing of drugs but perhaps one can sympathise to some extent with a doctor who, under much pressure, takes the easy way out and prescribes drugs which may not be totally necessary.  On one occasion I asked a well-known doctor whether he had any view in this regard.  He said that in his opinion there was over prescribing in some instances.  On many occasions people coming to see me, women in particular, produce bottles of tablets that have been prescribed for them and say that without these drugs they could not survive.  I wonder often whether all these drugs are necessary. A politician, although he may be under a great deal of pressure in trying to cope with a heavy work-load cannot take the easy way out when people come to him with their problems.  He must do everything possible to help.</P>
    <P>It would be a wonderful contribution to the Third World if we could find it possible to provide places in our medical schools for personnel from these areas, especially people wishing to be trained as nurses.  It will be a long time before that part of the world has a sufficiency of doctors but if our teaching hospitals, for instance, could accommodate trainee nurses from the Third World, these nurses, on the completion of their course, could return to work with their own people.  I am sure that this would be of tremendous benefit until such time as there are enough doctors in these areas.</P>
    <P>We need have no fears regarding the standards of doctors in the EEC countries but our membership of the Community brings changes in this sphere of medicine.  It presents a challenge which the medical profession must face.  We have always had a good relationship with the medical profession in the UK and it is accepted that our medical schools are of a very high standard but the demand on them will be much greater in the future.</P>
    <P>Up to now it has been the situation here that we have drawn on a fairly narrow sector of society for our doctors but with this new legislation at <Col N="900" /> our disposal we should look at this whole situation and endeavour to recruit people into the profession from all sections of society in order to ensure that the people who are best suited to this profession will be recruited. We can aim at the expansion and benefit of the profession and, therefore, at an improvement in general health.  This Bill will play a tremendously important part in the change which must be brought about. Again I congratulate the Minister on the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Haughey)</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I greatly appreciate the manner in which the Bill has been received by the House and the contributions which have been made by Deputies on all sides.  A Leas-Cheann Comhairle, from your experience in this House you will probably agree with me that the standard of debate on this Second Stage augurs well for the future of this Dáil.  I hope that the spirit in which the measure has been received and the quality and range of the arguments put forward will be a constant feature in regard to other legislation.  I am very honoured by the number of new Deputies who decided to make their maiden speeches on this measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of the points raised by Deputies are not particularly relevant to the legislation.  They were important and interesting points and they were valuable from the point of view of the general administration of the health services.  Even though they were not perhaps relevant to this legislation and to the functions of this new council, nevertheless I want to assure the Deputies who put forward these points of view and raised these issues that I shall keep them in mind in the general context of health administration. A number of the matters which were raised about the Bill dealt with the new council which is to be established, its constitution, its membership, its functions and the committees which are to be established under it, particularly the Fitness to Practise Committee. Reference was also made to the financing of the council and to the special register for specialists which will <Col N="901" /> be established under the legislation. Some criticisms were made about the council itself as to its constitution and membership, but before coming to these I would like to talk for a moment about the general and fundamental principles on which the legislation is based.</P>
    <P>I want to emphasise that this is primarily legislation which will enable the medical profession to regulate and control itself, and in this context I want to reject most of the arguments and criticisms put forward by Deputy Noel Browne in his very interesting and stimulating contribution. It is possible for me to recognise and admit that the contribution he made was interesting and stimulating while at the same time I contradict his basic thesis.  I suggest to the House that in this country we are firmly committed to the idea and concept of our professions in so far as possible regulating themselves.  One of the hall-marks that distinguishes a profession is its ability to control and regulate itself as a profession in the best interests of the community.  I have no hesitation whatever in entrusting to the medical profession that task and that responsibility.  We have the same situation prevailing in relation to many other professions.  Solicitors in particular have their own legislation which enables them to control their profession, and if anybody thinks about it for a moment and examines it in depth it will be realised that this is by far the best way to do things. If you do not have a profession controlling and regulating its own affairs and imposing its own disciplines on itself, what other way could you achieve it?  Would you entrust the task to some bureaucratic agency?  Would you entrust it to some general purposes body of public opinion?  When you look at it in depth you realise that by far the best way of doing this thing is to devise legislation which will enable a profession to govern and discipline itself in accordance with its own best traditions.</P>
    <P>To anybody who would criticise that concept I would like to say that I have found&mdash;and I am sure that many other Deputies in the House <Col N="902" /> have found the same thing&mdash;that when it comes to professional matters and protecting standards and traditions in a profession, the profession itself and the members of that profession are far more assiduous about that aspect than anybody outside the profession is likely to be.  Very often you find in this area that a profession in disciplining, controlling and regulating itself is far more severe on itself and far more exacting and demanding than any outside body or person would be.  In so far as this legislation is based on the principle of the profession, subject to the overall public interest and public control of its activities, looking after its own standards, procedures, discipline and conduct, that is easily the right approach.</P>
    <P>Having said that I want to add that I cannot agree with Deputy N. Browne in his severe criticism of his own profession. Like most other Deputies in this House I am fully aware of the activities and standards of the profession. I was fully aware of the activities, standards and approach of the medical profession long before I ever became Minister for Health.  While it is fashionable these days to criticise professions as élitist groups, I think that generally the medical profession does hold its own special place in the respect and affection of the Irish people.  It has served them well and if in the complicated, complex situation of a modern society the members of the medical profession have to band together in an endeavour to protect their own interests as best they can in a competitive society, then they are perfectly entitled to do that.  I could not possibly accept that they protect their own interests on any occasion to the detriment of the common good.</P>
    <P>The traditions of the profession are as respected today as they ever were and the concept of dedicated service is still cherished in the medical profession today the same as it ever was. I do not think Deputy Browne need worry too much about there being a very strong pressure group so far as my being Minister for Health is concerned. First of all, I do not regard them as an unduly abrasive pressure <Col N="903" /> group at all, but even if they were excessibly active in their pressurising, I would hope that I would be prepared to resist those pressures if I thought they were going beyond the bounds of what a particular situation called for.</P>
    <P>I have a very high respect and regard for the medical profession as it presents itself to me today and in particular for the traditions of commitment and dedication which it has built up over the years.  I have had, on a number of occasions, medical people coming to me and proposing courses of action which seemed to them to be desirable in the public interest.  I have said to them on such occasions: &ldquo;But if I pursue this particular course of action and if it is successful, it means that your branch of the medical profession will be superfluous.&rdquo; Very often medical men propose courses of action which will ultimately result in the complete eradication of a particular disease or ailment, and time and again I have been met with the reply by the representatives of the profession: &ldquo;So be it.  Even if this course of action results in our becoming superfluous in this area and there is no longer any need for our services in this area, the common good will have been served, the welfare of the community promoted, and we will be satisfied.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>As to the council itself, the first criticism has been about its size.  Here a number of factors have to be kept in mind.  This is a representative council primarily.  It is not an expert body. If it were to be an expert body entrusted with the implementation of some medical programme, then it would be a different type of body, but basically it is a representative body which hopefully will represent all the best people in the different areas of the medical profession, who will come together to decide on the issues relating to the control, the discipline and the regulation of their profession.  It has to be a certain size if it is to be as fully representative as it should be. On the other hand, it cannot be too big, because we all know that if a council is too big effective power falls into the hands of a small executive <Col N="904" /> group, committee or clique.  I think we would all like this governing body of the profession to be as representative as possible and that the council, what-ever size it is, would be able to operate effectively as a council and not because of its size, have to delegate its powers and functions to some small section or committee.</P>
    <P>Because of its function in the areas of under-graduate and post-graduate education, it is essential that the council represent the various bodies involved in these areas.  It is also important that the general practitioner sector of the profession be adequately and fully represented.  Some Deputies expressed anxiety about that aspect. They were afraid the council might be overloaded with academics or with specialists and that the general practitioner section of the profession would not get adequate representation.  I will look at that again, but as far as I can assess at this stage, I think the mix is probably about right.  There are only about five people who must be from the academics, and the rest of the members can come from any sector of the profession.  In the normal operation of things, because general practitioners constitute such a large body of the profession as such, I would think that the election procedure and the other procedures would ensure that they would have a high level of representation on the council.</P>
    <P>On the question of size and membership also, a fair amount of comment was devoted to the question of consumer representation.  This is important, but here again we have to be careful to preserve a balance.  This is basically a council of the profession to control the profession itself and there would be a great deal to be said for having it confined exclusively to the profession.  In former times such a concept would have been unchallenged. It would have been mantained that only the members of the profession would be in a position to understand all the intricacies and complexities of the profession and to know and to comprehend its traditions, and therefore only a body composed of the profession itself would be legitimately entitled to decide questions of discipline, <Col N="905" /> striking off and so on.  But I think today there would be fairly wide acceptance of the fact that, whereas in the main the profession should govern itself through its own mechanism, at the same time the general public should have some voice in the procedures.  For that reason the Bill provides that the Minister can nominate four persons for membership.</P>
    <P>I would not like at this stage to commit myself to the opinion that those four persons should represent the consumer interest entirely.  It might be that in the normal working of the mechanisms which the Bill establishes, some section of the profession would not be represented on the general council which I would like to see, and therefore I might wish to avail of one, two or three of these four places which are reserved to me to give representation to a particular branch of the profession which had failed otherwise to have a voice.  These four places will provide me with an ample opportunity to give reasonable representation to consumer interests.</P>
    <P>That aspect of consumer interest and representation was raised in connection with the council as a whole, but also in relation to the Fitness To Practise Committee.  People felt that on that committee there should be a consumer voice, and it is easy to sympathise with that point of view.  Deputies will have noticed that as the Bill is framed other committees can have outside representation on them.  Other committees established by the Medical Council under the Bill can have persons appointed to them who are not members of the council, but that does not apply to the Fitness To Practise Committee: it is stipulated in the Bill that that committee must be composed exclusively of members of the council. They will be a very important committee dealing with very delicate and serious issues and it is right they should be composed entirely of members of the council fully conversant with the affairs of the council.  There might be something to be said for the suggestion that there should be some provision that the Fitness To Practise Committee would necessarily include <Col N="906" /> one or more of the four persons appointed to the general council by the Minister.  That would meet both points: it would give a consumer interest in the committee without at the same time breaching the principle that the committee should be composed exclusively of members of the general council.</P>
    <P>I was particulary impressed by the wide range of interesting points made during the debate.  I can honestly say that Deputies raised aspects of the whole matter which had not previously occurred to me.  One question was that of making finance available to the council.  It is intended, as is the case of other professions, that the council should be financed by the medical profession&mdash;that the profession should finance their own governing body.  However, there is no reason why if I were to ask the council to perform some particular function I should not make funds available to them in the normal process of the finances available to me.</P>
    <P>I will now come to some points made by Deputies, and I am sure other Deputies will forgive me if I first take the points made this morning because they are freshest in my mind.  Deputy Fox raised a very interesting point about the profession being confined to an intellectual élite.  This has attracted a great amount of attention and debate in recent times&mdash;how entry to the medical profession would be determined, what is the process of selection?  This is a deep problem which does not alone apply to the medical profession but to the other professions.</P>
    <P>The principal stumbling block that confronts one who wishes to have an element of flexibility in the arrangements is that if one departs at all from the objective criteria one raises the whole question of patronage.  I am sure Deputies have come across a suggestion put forward recently that entry to the medical profession should be, if not reserved for doctor's children, at least that they should get special preference.  That is a very old tradition which applies more to crafts and trades than to the professions.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="907" /> There is the practice that one of the perks or privileges of a trade or craft is that the son of the tradesman or craftsman is entitled to preference.</P>
    <P>I do not think anybody would seriously suggest that we should adhere to that traditional principle where modern medicine is concerned. I merely mention it as a factor here. I do not know what the mechanism should be; I have no great practical experience in relation to this profession. However, I know about the veterinary profession in which I have come across cases of young people, who because of their natural attributes would make ideal members of that profession, who because of their love for and knowledge of animals would make excellent veterinarians but who, because of the academic qualifications laid down have no hope of securing entry to the profession.</P>
    <P>I am sure that in the medical profession there are boys and girls who would make excellent doctors or surgeons but who because they cannot achieve that degree of academic excellence being laid down have no hope of securing entry.  That is a very real difficulty in this area but I could not possibly envisage how it can be overcome, because if you depart at all from the objective academic criteria you leave the way open to all sorts of undesirable practices.  There-fore I am afraid that at the moment we have no option but to stay with the existing system, and perhaps this council may bring forward in conjunction with the medical schools and universities some more sophisticated and improved way of selecting persons for the profession, devising an entrance system that will ensure that the best people are selected.  At the moment I cannot put forward any possible solution along these lines.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fox also mentioned an interesting aspect relating to the general question of recruitment to the medical profession and the number of doctors we produce.  He related this to the developing situation in so far as the Third World is concerned, and particularly the Middle East.  There is no <Col N="908" /> doubt there is an almost insatiable demand for medical and paramedical personnel in the Middle East, and more and more we are being involved in this situation.</P>
    <P>It is, of course, absolutely right and proper that we should, but the contacts with these countries are increasing every day and the possibility of fruitful arrangements between ourselves and these countries are manifesting themselves.  I have been giving some thought to this matter and it will be both necessary and desirable to establish some sort of formal channels through which these contacts can be pursued.  At the moment there are a number of countries in touch with us looking for various facilities.  The requests coming in are diffuse and the manner in which they are being received and dealt with at this end is also diffuse, so there is a case for some sort of formal arrangements for this whole area.  I am very glad Deputy Fox raised the matter.  It is, perhaps, not strictly relevant to this legislation but I am glad to have had an opportunity of dealing with it.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Toole adverted to the provisional registration situation envisaged in section 28.  He asked, very validly, if there is any test at the end of the period.  I want to make it clear now that this is not really a probationary period.  This provisional registration is meant to cover a period of a year of supervised hospital experience. The doctor must have been awarded a certificate from an appropriate medical school in which he graduated before he goes on to the provisional register established under section 28.  Section 29(2) provides that the council may extend the period provided the aggregate does not exceed five years.  That is a different matter. That is intended to deal with the case of foreign doctors from countries outside the EEC who come here for post-graduate experience.</P>
    <P>There are two different proposals enshrined in the Bill.  One deals with a period of supervised hospital practice and experience and the other deals with a doctor coming in here for post-graduate experience from a country outside the EEC.  Perhaps I should deal here with the EEC situation because <Col N="909" /> it is important that the House and the general public should fully understand what is involved.  Deputy Dr. Browne inquired as to whether or not we have the right to go over to the institutions and schools in member countries of the EEC and inspect them and whether they would have the right to come here.  That will not happen. That situation will no longer prevail. Under the EEC directive which came into operation on 20th December, 1976, any doctor of a member State with a qualification of training in that state is entitled to become established and provide a service in another member State.</P>
    <P>This brings about a very significant change in the traditional relationship we have with the United Kingdom. Up to now our doctors could establish themselves and practise in the United Kingdom and, in return for that privilege, the British Medical Council inspected our schools and institutions. That situation will no longer apply. Instead there will be a new situation under EEC competence.  There will no longer be any inspection between EEC countries.  Each member country will inspect the diploma and the qualification of a fellow member country but medical persons coming to establish themselves here and practise here will have to register here and they will be entitled to that registration.  We will have to accept the qualifications of other member countries and they will have to accept ours.  There will be no process of inspection.</P>
    <P>The EEC has established a committee of medical training.  That was established on 11th June, 1975, and its task is to help to ensure a comparable standard of medical training in the Community with regard to both basic training and further training. That committee will operate in the following way.  First of all, there will be an exchange of comprehensive information as to the training methods and the content, level and structure of theoretical and practical courses provided in the member States. Secondly, there will be discussion and consultation with the object of developing common approaches to the standard to be obtained in the training of doctors and as appropriate to the <Col N="910" /> structure and content of such training. Thirdly, the committee will keep under review the adaptation of medical training to developments in medical science and teaching methods.  There, in very broad outline, is the new situation. Each country in the Community will respect the qualifications of the other and members within the profession will be entitled to establish themselves and practise in any other country.  All they will have to do is register with the appropriate authority. There will be a central advisory committee which will, broadly speaking, endeavour to synchronise and improve standards of training, both basic and advanced.</P>
    <P>There will, perhaps, be one little gloss on that in regard to specialists. We will still maintain in a modified form our traditional links with the United Kingdom.  Those links will be maintained as far as specialists are concerned through the joint higher training committee.  Irish visitors will be involved in inspecting training programmes in the United Kingdom and United Kingdom visitors will inspect programmes here and trainees will complete their training at the same stage in both countries.  As I mentioned yesterday, the establishment of a specialist register in the United Kingdom was recommended by the Merrison Report but that has not happened and, until that happens, we still keep our 1927 agreement in existence.</P>
    <P>The right way to proceed, and what the medical profession here are anxious to do, is to synchronise the introduction of a specialist register here with the introduction of a similar register in the United Kingdom. Whereas throughout the medical profession generally this new EEC situation will prevail in regard to normal basic degrees and specialist degrees we will have at the same time this particularly close link at specialist level with the United Kingdom and it is hoped they will establish their specialist register simultaneously with ours.  In that context then this mutual inspection and training will continue.</P>
    <P>Deputy MacSharry, understandably in the light of his experience as a <Col N="911" /> former chairman and as a member of a health board, concerned himself with the question of the conditions of service for doctors.  I want to make it quite clear that will not be a matter for this council.  The council will be concerned with training, education, post-graduate training, admission, striking off, disciplining and so on.  It will not be concerned at all with conditions of service.  I am sure most Members are aware that the conditions of service where consultants are concerned have been unsatisfactory for some considerable time and recently I made arrangements to have a working group or committee established which will set about devising an appropriate contract for consultants to be of general application and also devise a new common procedure for the selection of consultants for appointment to our hospitals.</P>
    <P>Deputy MacSharry also asked about this council giving advice.  He is quite right in that regard.  As Deputies will see, section 62 of the Bill provides for the giving of general advice to the profession by the council.</P>
    <P>The question was also asked, again by Deputy MacSharry, as to whether there will be an onus on doctors to participate in post-graduate education and training.  Deputy O'Hanlon also referred to this.  In my view this is not only a very important aspect of the training of doctors, specialists and consultants but it is also very important from the point of view of the administration of our health services. Both medical bodies, the association and the union, mentioned this matter in discussions I have had with them: the absolute desirability, even to the point of calling it a necessity, of post-graduate training for the ordinary practitioner, some system whereby he or she can secure from time to time refresher or updating course and be enabled to do this while continuing to practise.  It is very desirable and important that they should be able to keep in touch with the very latest developments and advances in their field and so on.</P>
    <P>I would certainly see an important role here for the Medical Council. <Col N="912" /> This is something I had not thought specifically about until Deputies raised it and I commend them for directing attention to it.  Certainly it is worth thinking about and exploring, whether I should not ask this new council from time to time to undertake some particular programme in this area of providing post-graduate training for general practitioners.  Whether or not that would involve provision of funds could be teased out.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Hanlon had some reservations about the constitution of the council.  He thought it might be too academic, too few practical people on it and that it might be too Dublin oriented.  There is no reason why it should be academically controlled or even why there should be any overwhelming academic presence. The only specific provision for academics is in section 9(1)(a) where it is provided that there must be five members from the academic institutions. Otherwise there is no reason why any of the others should be academies. It will be very much a matter for the profession to decide, and I again stress that the overwhelming number in the profession are in general practice and hopefully, their very numbers would ensure that they are represented.  The same situation should ensure that the council will not be excessively Dublin oriented&mdash;I do not think anybody would wish that to happen.  One very encouraging thing in the administration of our health services now is the way in which so many excellent centres are developing outside Dublin particularly in the regional hospitals.  In some of the provincial regional hospitals standards of excellence and centres of specialisation are developing which are completely on a par with what is available in Dublin.  One hopes this will reflect itself through the procedures laid down in the legislation in the composition and membership of the Medical Council.</P>
    <P>I have already dealt with Deputy O'Hanlon's point about post-graduate education but in that connection, apart from a sort of general power and competence which the council will have in the whole area of postgraduate <Col N="913" /> education, it is open to me under one of the sections to assign specific functions to the council and ask them to carry out particular assignments.  I shall certainly consider the question of whether or not at some time we would ask the council to take positive steps&mdash;or even place some obligation on them, perhaps&mdash;in regard to post-graduate, refresher type education for the general medical practitioner.</P>
    <P>I hope I have dealt with most of the points raised in the debate about the legislation, the council and the general provisions of the Bill.  Some Deputies raised other matters of very great importance.  For instance, Deputy R. Burke spoke of the very urgent and important question of the type of medical practice which is evolving in Dublin city and suburban areas where one gets an answering machine instead of a doctor when one telephones.  While important, that is not strictly relevant to this legislation and it is not something in which the general council would be involved but it is something of which I must take cognisance in the general context of health administration.</P>
    <P>Other points of a similar nature were raised by other Deputies and the fact that I am not specifically dealing with them or adverting to them in my reply does not mean that I shall not give particular attention to them; I will, because they are all very valuable and important.  No doubt we shall hear about them again when we discuss Estimates and other Health business in the House.</P>
    <P>I hope that in the time available I have dealt as fully as possible with the arguments put forward and the points raised by different Deputies. I congratulate the Deputies who spoke on all sides on the very useful and valuable contributions made.  This is very much a Committee Stage Bill.  We shall not take the Committee Stage for a couple of weeks and I hope that Deputies will put down any amendments which they feel appropriate arising out of the Second Stage discussion. I assure them that all amendments will be carefully considered and will be dealt with in the same spirit <Col N="914" /> as Deputies have considered this legislation on the Second Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Fisheries (Mr. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann approves the following Order in draft:</P>
      <P>Elections of Conservators (Postponement) Order, 1977</P>
      <P>a copy of which Order in draft was laid before Dáil Éireann on the 1st day of September, 1977.</P>
      <P>Elections to boards of conservators, which under the Fisheries Acts would normally be held every five years, have been deferred by amending legislation since 1974.</P>
      <P>Under the Fisheries (Amendment) Act, 1976, the elections were postponed to 1977 or such later year as may be fixed by order.  I now propose to make an order postponing these elections to 1978.</P>
      <P>This further postponement is necessary as it is still considered inappropriate to allow elections under the old system to go ahead in advance of the new legislation proposed to give effect to the main recommendations of the Inland Fisheries Commission.  I hope to be in a position to introduce such legislation early in 1978.</P>
      <P>As Deputies are no doubt aware, changes in the existing structure of boards of conservators is warranted having regard to the fact that the present system, which has been in existence for about 100 years, contains many of the unsatisfactory features of 19th-century administrations. Under the proposed new legislation the boards will be replaced by seven regional fishery boards and a Central Fishery Board.  In addition, the Inland Fisheries Trust will be integrated into the Central Fishery Board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Despite the handicap of their outdated structure boards of conservators have carried out invaluable work in <Col N="915" /> the protection and conservation of inland fisheries.  I am very glad to have the opportunity to express my own personal and my Department's appreciation of the wonderful work done by the boards and by their staffs.  I must also stress that this service by the members of the boards is a voluntary one which takes up a lot of their time and energy.</P>
    <P>It is fortunate that our inland fisheries have had the benefit of the service of such dedicated people who have been willing to continue in office beyond their normal term.  I have no doubt that the boards' statutory duties will once again be in good hands with the continuance in office of the board's members for a further year.</P>
    <P>I accordingly recommend to the House that a resolution be passed approving of the draft order.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in favour of anything that will strengthen the hands of the boards of conservators and I am looking forward to this proposed legislation. There are very few areas which have been as neglected as the conservation of our salmon and trout fisheries. The board of conservators need to have their hand strengthened considerably. At the moment the money they get is completely inadequate and, as a result, the manpower is way below what it should be and the equipment they have to work with is entirely inadequate.</P>
      <P>I have seen the conservators and their staff working at first hand and I have seen the great handicaps under which they are working.  I have seen the enormous damage being done to our inland fisheries, salmon in particular, as a result of these inadequacies. The sooner we have a streamlined system whereby poaching is curtailed, the better.  Poaching is taking place on an extraordinary scale at the moment.  In recent statements the Minister has emphasised that it is his wish to have it eliminated or seriously curtailed. I do not think this can be done until a new system of boards of conservators is set up, and the sooner the better.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Hear, hear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>The poaching to which I refer is a grave danger to the future of the salmon industry.  It is occurring on a huge scale, from what I can gather from newspaper reports, on the west coast in places like Kerry, Mayo and Donegal.  If it is not curtailed it is quite possible that in a few years time we will have no salmon industry whatever.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have had a great deal of controversy in recent years over the issuing of salmon licences and drift netting at sea.  If the drift net licences are maintained at the present level there is no danger to the future of the salmon fishing industry.  However, if abuses of the regulations are allowed by people who have licences, and if the <Col N="917" /> existing poaching which is being tolerated continues by people who have not got licences, this industry could very well die out and disappear completely.</P>
    <P>In my experience the best behaved areas are those places where large numbers of licences are issued.  For instance, the Waterford area has 250 licences, approximately, and the Lismore board issues about the same.  The poaching which goes on in both areas is minimal because the fishermen have long recognised that it is in their own interests to curtail poaching.  They have formed organisations within their own fishery districts and there is great discipline within the districts as a result of these organisations and the excellent work they are doing.  The Minister should encourage the formation of associations such as these because no discipline is as effective as internal discipline amongst the fishermen themselves.  This is obviously lacking on the west coast in the areas I mentioned.</P>
    <P>I have heard a complaint that there are only nine licences in Kerry and very small numbers in places like Mayo and Galway.  Great political pressure will be put on the Minister to have the number of licences in these areas increased. I am quite certain of that.  He is probably under pressure already.  I would ask the Minister to spurn any such requests because we cannot have drift netting at sea increased.  It is at its maximum level at the moment.  The Minister is under great pressure from certain political representatives who, in turn, are under great political pressure from people who have not got licences.  The licences should be restricted to people who are traditional salmon fishermen&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkKillileaJnr" hpid="Mr. Killilea Mr. Killilea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>Hear, hear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and not people who operate trawlers and find it much easier and more lucrative to drift net for salmon during the summer rather than go trawling.  That type of thing should be discouraged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We had a Bill before both Houses last year known as the Water Pollution Bill.  I was really quite amazed <Col N="918" /> and annoyed that the Fianna Fáil Party in opposition did not oppose certain aspects of it more strenuously because it had deficiencies.  It will not be implemented as it should be implemented and I would ask the Minister to see that it is implemented.  Many of our problems with regard to the extinction of our salmon and trout fisheries are caused by pollution.  One of the greatest shortcomings in that Bill was that local authorities are still given far too many powers to allow effluent which kills fish life to go into existing waterways. The Minister should see to it that that practice is curtailed.</P>
    <P>A serious defect in that Bill, as I said in the Seanad, was that local authorities were being given the power to licence people when it comes to permitting effluent enter our waterways. It seems ridiculous that local authorities should have such a power because they are the greatest polluters of our waters. It is like asking a poacher to become gamekeeper over night.  Many of the rivers in which fish life has been killed off completely have been polluted by local authorities.  Even this year a number of our rivers were polluted by local authorities.</P>
    <P>In conjunction with the Minister for the Environment, the Minister for Fisheries should see to it that that practice is eliminated.  He should see to it that a close watch is kept on local authorities.  Officials of local authorities, under pressure from members of such bodies who are under pressure from the public, must endeavour to save money at every opportunity.  One way of doing that is by not having sewerage treatment plants and allowing sewage straight into rivers and canals. They consider those as an extension of their own plants and a cheap way of getting rid of effluent.  If they can get away with it they do not worry too much about the consequences unless the Ministers and his officials pursue them.  Boards of conservators have prosecuted a number of local authorities but the fines imposed were minimal. I understand that elsewhere in Europe representatives of a local authority or industry found guilty of pollution can be jailed.</P>
    <P>Two years ago the Department of <Col N="919" /> Fisheries announced that it was intended to set up an aquatic environmental unit to deal with pollution of inland waterways.  I should like to know if that unit has had any impact of pollution.  Has the unit commenced operations?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>My fear is that the elections may not take place next year. A restructuring of these boards is essential.  The Minister recently gave great lip service to what he intends doing in this regard and I am looking forward to his putting that into practice. I noticed in recent press reports that it is the intention of the Minister to increase the depth of the net from 30 meshes to 45 meshes in the Lismore fishery area.  I understand that it is the intention of the Minister to introduce an order to that effect.  In common with the fishermen in the area I am pleased at this move.  One thing that surprises me is that there has been a change of heart in this regard.  When we approached officials in the Department six months ago on this issue they told us this could not be done.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>At first sight this would seem to be a relatively simple matter of procedure giving the Minister approval to defer the elections of conservators once again for a further period.  The Minister I am sure is looking forward to a speedy passage of this motion.  One would hesitate to oppose a motion of this kind.  One understands fully the limitations under which the boards of conservators operate and the degree to which they are handicapped for want of financial resources, equipment and advice.  One appreciates that they are dealing here with an archaic system which has been in operation for almost a century and that there are glaring defects in the system.  Allowing for those defects and the lack of change over 100 years, I wish to join with the Minister in paying tribute to the members of the boards of conservators for the invaluable service they have provided in the realm of fishing.  It is all the more creditable because they have done this work purely on a voluntary basis without recompense.  Anything I say on this motion must not be construed as denigrating in any way this great voluntary effort on the part of individual members of the boards of conservators.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am bound to advert to the fundamental principle giving rise to the establishment of boards of conservators and their continuation.  Their primary function is to protect fish life in our rivers.  In that regard it must be said that the boards of conservators, perhaps through no fault of their own, have been guilty of dereliction of duty in respect of the protection of fish life. When they were first established over 100 years ago it was probably with the intention of curtailing poaching, which was the main problem at that time. They did not have to contend with the advent of pollution.  When the scourge of pollution appeared in so many rivers and tributaries it was to be greatly deplored that successive Governments did not give those boards the <Col N="922" /> support, finance and expertise necessary to enable them to deal with this very serious matter.</P>
    <P>Last Tuesday I asked the Minister by way of parliamentary question if he was aware of the recurring pollution of the river Suir and many of its tributaries which resulted in the massive destruction of fish life in these rivers and if he will indicate in detail the sources of that pollution and the steps he is taking to prevent such pollution in future.  His reply is on the record.  He laid the responsibility squarely on the Waterford Board of Conservators.  He said that that board were responsible for the protection of fish life in the Suir, that their pollution officer was actively engaged in keeping the position under review and that the negotiations with various bodies concerned were achieving a solution of the problem.</P>
    <P>No words of mine could adequately describe the feelings of anger, dismay and bewilderment with which the people of the counties of Tipperary and Waterford view the situation in the river Suir, which has won for itself the dubious distinction of being the most polluted river in Ireland.  It is fast becoming a cesspool because of the inability of the Waterford Board of Conservators to grapple effectively with the problem.  The Minister told me in his reply that within recent times, even within the last two years, there have been two major fish kills in that river and we have witnessed many kills in the tributaries of the Suir as well. In that kind of situation one could not blame me for hesitating to give to boards of conservators, and to the Waterford board in particular, an extension for another period having regard to their inability to cope with this serious problem.</P>
    <P>The anger of the members of fishing clubs, the damage this is doing to tourism, the heart-rending sight of fish, their bellies turned up, being heaped on the banks virtually in tons&mdash;all this is a shame and a national disgrace.  It is happening repeatedly in the Suir. The Minister's predecessors have been unable or unwilling to grapple effectively with this problem.  I am demanding action.  I say it is high time <Col N="923" /> to sack and dispose of an archaic body of this kind which cannot resolve that problem.</P>
    <P>I am entitled to ask the Minister &mdash;I had hoped he would have given me a more extensive reply&mdash;what action the Waterford Board of Conservators took in this matter and to what extent they pursued those who were responsible for the pollution of the rivers in that area.  If it is industrial sewerage or untreated sewerage why were the local authorities not taken to task?  As members of local authorities we have been aware that they were unable to deal with this problem because of a lack of funds. It was the State's responsibility to assist them to deal with untreated sewerage and eliminate pollution from that source.</P>
    <P>I contend also that the pollution caused by effluent from industries and from farms, especially from pig farms, is a serious contributory factor. This motion will give boards of conservators a new lease of life for the next few months.  The Minister may hope to have this more comprehensive measure ready early next year, but it may transpire that he will not be ready then and he will be seeking a further postponement and we shall have to live with this problem in the interim.  I am appealing to the Minister to come to the rescue of the boards of conservators, the Waterford board in particular, and give them the resources they require to grapple effectively with this scandalous problem which has continued for too long in that area.</P>
    <P>Normally we would give the Minister this motion without very much debate, argument or opposition.  I agree with my colleague, Deputy Deasy, that poaching is a problem but it pales into insignificance when one considers the damage done by pollution. Something must be done to resolve this problem.  It may seem parochial of me to mention the Suir in particular when there are other rivers and lakes with the same problems, but I do so because unfortunately the river beside which I <Col N="924" /> was born and which flows through most of my constituency, has won for itself the name of being the most polluted river in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Accordingly that river is entitled to special treatment to remedy the situation. I appeal to the Minister to vest in the conservators or to take powers himself to pursue the people responsible for pollution and punish them with the full rigours of the law. In other countries for mortal damage of this kind to a very precious amenity jail sentences are the order of the day.  I do not ask for that, but too many people have got away with this shocking crime too often and it is time to cry halt.</P>
    <P>I look forward to the more comprehensive legislation coming before us so that we shall get down to this business in a more detailed manner and try to do many other things which very much need to be done in the whole sphere of fishing.  I wish the Minister well in all his endeavours for the protection of fish life and for the advancement of those engaged in the fishing industry.  The Minister should pay attention to the matter I raised.  While one understands my reluctance to condone his continuation of that system for a further indefinite period, I do not wish to reflect on individuals.  They have been doing their best, I presume, in very difficult circumstances but it is not good to leave the clearing of this sorry mess to the responsibility of the board without the active assistance of the Minister and the Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkKillileaJnr" hpid="Mr. Killilea Mr. Killilea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this postponement. It is important to note that at long last there is a move from the Department of Fisheries to do something positive by creating seven new regional fishery boards.  What is far more important however is the system by which we will have a Central Fishery Board with responsibility for them. This should be set up within the next 12 months and it is something that everybody welcomes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is common knowledge that local authorities have been the biggest polluters of the inland waters.  About three years ago the General Council of <Col N="925" /> County Councils recommended to the Government that special amounts of money should be made available to the local authorities, who were creating most of the pollution, from the central fund to help to alleviate the problem. Water pollution had increased to such an extent that untold destruction was occurring throughout the country.  We are not two weeks back in this House and the Minister is expected to have all, the answers.  When the Government were asked for financial aid to alleviate this problem it was not forthcoming. The Inland Fisheries Commission Report remarked on that fact.  It would have been wrong to expect certain ratepayers in certain counties to carry the burden: this was a national problem to be dealt with on a national scale.  The Inland Fisheries Commission report came out three years ago, but only now is it referred to as being urgent.  What has happened in the last three years?  The Minister for Fisheries has given his time, patience and knowledge in this area.  I welcome this legislation because it will enable a positive programme to be put forward.</P>
    <P>The old boards of conservators had very little power but that power certainly had not the finance to back it up.  In Lough Conn pollution is taking place at a rapid rate.  We begged for financial aid to alleviate the problem. This lake is known as one of the finest fishing lakes in Europe for trout and salmon.  I hope the Minister will take note of the pollution problem there and will help to alleviate it, so that it can remain a fine fishing lake.</P>
    <P>In inland waters these days there is not much pilfering of salmon stocks because quite honestly the salmon are not there.  The pilfering goes on at the points where the sea water meets the fresh water.  It is not being done by moonlight poachers with flash lamps and spears; it is being done by men with seven and eight miles of drift-net, taking every size fish on their way to spawn or on their way back from spawning.  The Minister's attention must be drawn to this.  We all know that the fisherman is a hunter and that like all hunters, he will naturally hunt at a point where he will have a chance of catching the most fish.  He knows <Col N="926" /> exactly where the salmon stocks are to be found.</P>
    <P>These people made not thousands but millions of pounds throwing out their nets, sleeping on board for an hour or so, hauling and then rushing ashore to make the salmon available at a port at an enormous price, then out again to do the same thing four hours later.  That is where the problem regarding salmon stocks originated.  It is all very well for Deputy Deasy to say that up to now the number of the salmon drift net licences has not created a problem.  I flatly contradict that.  At the Salmon Weir in Galway at one time one could walk over the bridge and see salmon waiting to be let upstream.  I ask the spokesmen on behalf of the Opposition parties to bring their binoculars down to the Salmon Weir in Galway now and see if they can find a few salmon crouching waiting to go upstream.  They have become a very scarce commodity and they have not been robbed or plundered inland.</P>
    <P>The issue of the drift net licences warrants through examination by the Minister.  There must be conservation at certain points along the shore, particularly in unpolluted rivers to allow salmon free entry to spawn.  That is an absolute necessity.  The time has long since passed when certain areas, such as those I have mentioned, should be banned from salmon fishing to allow of conservation and stocks to be rebuilt. That is not asking any great sacrifice of the multi-millionaires who have fished with drift nets.  Indeed, had those licences been given to men known to the local fishermen in the last four-and-a-half years diminution of stocks would not have taken place to the same extent.  However, that was not the position.</P>
    <P>For the most part it was the city slicker who obtained the licence, the guy who knew there were many pounds to be made.  I notice that the man responsible for issuing those licences is present in the House.  I know of an instance in west Cork where a sixth generation fisherman, in a family who had fished a bay there, was refused a drift net licence while a man from Dublin city could go out into the bay and, having a drift net licence, fish <Col N="927" /> day and night.  That was a cruel and wrong decision.  The Minister for Fisheries has an onerous task in respect of the conservation of salmon stocks and everything to do with salmon fishing.</P>
    <P>Conservation is an absolute necessity. Authority must be given to the new central board.  That must not be questioned.  The Minister must keep abreast of the job daily because conservation is something that must be scrutinised, if not daily, at least weekly in regard to fish caught whether it be inland or at the mouth of many of our major rivers.  I am sure the Minister's legislation will be adequate and appropriate because an enormous amount of knowledge has been gleaned in recent years.  There was a time when I would not have known the difference between a trout and a mackerel placed on a plate before me. In the Council of Europe I was honoured by being a rapporteur on fish-the conservation of the living resources. Going through the documents concerned there I was amazed at the wealth of knowledge to be gleaned and the sorrow attached to the fishing industry in the last ten or fifteen years since it became highly mechanised. All of Europe today is looking towards conservation.  I presented that report to the Council of Europe and got a unanimous decision on conservation.</P>
    <P>I am glad to note that at long last our Minister for Fisheries has found the answer to the fishing problem&mdash;certainly it will be based on conservation in the legislation he proposes to introduce before 1978.  There is an enormous amount of work ahead of him and a wealth of knowledge to be gleaned at the same time.  I hope he will scrutinise closely the question of the salmon drift net licences, the conservation of salmon stocks and the areas where salmon are being caught. I know such stocks are not being diminished by poaching or pilfering inland.  I wish the Minister well in his task reminding him that it will warrant his total concentration if he is to be successful.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M. P. Murphy Mr. M. P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the need for this measure.  The Minister <Col N="928" /> mentioned the setting up of a central board and seven regional boards in proposed legislation.</P>
      <P>I should like to offer my opinion on the question of the central board. It has always been my belief that in this House we have delegated too much power to boards.  I should prefer to see the Minister retain the full powers of his Department.  If he establishes a central board, then I feel it should be solely an advisory one.  I believe that the man selected by this House as Minister and by the people should hold that power.  The view seems to be held that politicians are incapable of determining matters of any kind on an impartial basis or of making factual assessments and that, consequently, powers must be handed over to boards.  I believe it would be detrimental to do so.  Were the Minister to hold all of the power, then at least we could ask him questions here and discuss with him the question of inland fisheries.  On the other hand, if he hands over his powers to some central body, not answerable to this House except in the most indirect way, we will be unable to obtain the type of information we need or have the kind of dialogue we would like with departmental people.</P>
      <P>During my time in this House I have experienced the handing over of authority to various boards by Ministers and Departments.  I do not know how many boards have been set up; in some cases their establishment was essential.  Until recently&mdash;I think it was in 1976&mdash;there was no question of keeping an eye on boards or of prying into their affairs; they had too much autonomy and independence.  It would be better for the personnel of the boards and all concerned if the House were able to scrutinise more closely the activities of the boards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I thought the previous Government might have changed that trend but the majority were generally in favour of it.  I am not saying that if the previous Government had changed the position the central authority would get more power.  I do not know because the position was not finalised.  I am telling the Minister to hold on to the power <Col N="929" /> he has, the power of the central authority, the power vested in him by the people.  As democrats we must accept the democratic voice of the people.  The Minister and his team in the Department can make as good an assessment of the potential of the fishing industry, particularly the inland fisheries, as any outside group that may be appointed.  It is quite in order to set up a central authority that will co-ordinate the efforts of the seven regional boards proposed but I should like to see that authority simply as an advisory one.  I want the Minister to hold on to the maximum power in his Department.  When power is handed over it is difficult to get it back.</P>
    <P>Deputy Killilea raised the matter of salmon licences.  It is quite clear he is not conversant with the system of salmon licences that has operated during the years.  The boards will have applications from many people, many of whom can lay good claim to a salmon licence.  Because of the recent increases in the cost of salmon good incomes can be made from salmon fishing.  It is obvious that a board will not be able to grant all applications. Certain criteria must be laid down and applicants must measure up to the requirements of the relevant orders in order to qualify for a licence.</P>
    <P>The 17 boards of conservators had the sole right to determine who would get a licence.  That was their absolute duty and function and generally they discharged that duty reasonably well. I did not hear too many complaints from the Galway and Mayo regions on that score; in fact, the number of licences in Galway, Mayo and Donegal relative to the country was exceptionally high.  It is completely out of place for a Deputy to come to this House, as Deputy Killilea has done, and cast a grave reflection on the administrator of the Cork fishery board when he said that someone came from Dublin, presumably with no entitlement to a licence, and got a licence while traditional fishermen had their applications rejected or were deprived of their licences.  The administrator appointed in Cork was a man of the highest integrity.  He made his <Col N="930" /> assessments, as he was entitled to do, completely on his own and he made them having regard to all the facts. He granted licences to people who measured up to the requirements of the orders relating to salmon control which were approved by this House and he rejected those who did not measure up to such requirements.  The same could be said of another administrator in Louth so far as determining applications for licences was concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkKillileaJnr" hpid="Mr. Killilea Mr. Killilea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>That does not mean that the Dublin man did not get the licence.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M. P. Murphy Mr. M. P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>There was no such question.  That is a load of rubbish.  I appreciate that the boards had considerable difficulty in this matter.  First, they were limited in the number that could be allowed under the control orders.  Secondly, individual members of the boards were under pressure to get licences for people. They had to reject many representations. In the period when I was concerned with the working of the Department, generally speaking the boards and the administrators did their jobs quite efficiently.  Naturally they were unable to satisfy everyone and the Minister will find out soon enough that it will be impossible for the new boards and for him to satisfy everyone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was alleged in this House that salmon licences were allocated on a political basis.  But if one viewed it from the political angle with a view to getting additional support for oneself and one's party one would abolish drift net licences because for the one man who favours drift netting there are ten people against it.  However, it would be wrong to consider it from that point of view.  Many people around the coast have earned a substantial part of their livelihood from salmon fishing and it would be unfair to deprive them of it.  In a way they are a privileged group; it is somewhat like the merchandise licences that were issued in 1934, where those who got them hold them and those who have not the licences find it extremely difficult to get them.  It is not possible to hand out a salmon licence to everyone <Col N="931" /> who applies, unlike the position that obtained until 1972.  Up to that time all that was necessary was payment of the licence fee.</P>
    <P>The Minister, with the help of his advisers, must examine the position from year to year.  I cannot foresee the Minister or any authority making a long term plan for salmon fishing.  This is a matter that must be reviewed from year to year.  I do not know if the Minister was wise in moving from the order relating to the 30 mesh which we brought into operation.  The strongest representations that could be made were made.  Every avenue of approach was used to have that order rescinded but neither Deputy Donegan nor I rescinded it because we felt it was essential.  We felt that in the long term it would be of benefit and that it should at least get a trial period. The Minister has now opened a door. Everybody knows when a door is opened it is very difficult at times to try to close it.</P>

      <P>A very strong case was made by south-west Cork to have this order abolished.  Several supporters of mine asked me to do it but I refused because I felt I would not be measuring up to the requirements of my office if I agreed to their demands.  Unfortunately reports in the Department indicated this was necessary and that we must do something about conservation.  This order was brought in.  It should have been given a trial period.  Now that the Minister has changed it in respect of one board I see no reason why I, as representative for south-west Cork, should not ask him to give the Cork board the same concessions he is giving the Lismore board.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">

      <P>I am conversant with the situation so far as the Lismore and the Cork boards are concerned. <Col N="932" /> They are similar.  There is no justification for giving one preferential treatment over the other.  Will the Minister give the Cork board the same concession because their pressures are just as soundly based, from the fishermen's point of view, as those from the Lismore board?</P>
      <P>This is a limited debate as this order is just asking permission to postpone the election.  I ask the Minister to hold on to his powers.  If he decides to set up a central body let it be an advisory one and let the final authority rest with the Minister and the Department of Fisheries in Dublin.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to draw the Minister's attention to one point in relation to his proposals on the election of boards.  I refer to the great dissatisfaction being expressed at the moment by the inspectors on conservation boards.  They have very unsatisfactory conditions of employment.  They have no fixity of tenure.  I understand they are appointed on a year-to-year basis.  They have no right to a pension or gratuity.  It must be admitted, when we consider the kind of work they carry out, that it would be impossible to quantify what they should receive, especially when one considers the amount of poaching going on at the moment in different areas.  A considerable amount of poaching takes place in my area.  The only suggestion I can make to help in this matter is that something be done similar to what is being done in the Waterford area where people get together and form a watchdog group to look after their interests.  I hope the Minister can improve the conditions of inspectors and give them what is their right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister on his appointment as Minister for Fisheries.  He was Parliamentary Secretary in charge of fisheries some years ago and he has wide experience of inland fisheries, which is very important. I know that he will bring a new life to his Department.  We have needed this for over four years.  This should change the confusion, delays and uncertainty in relation to fisheries we had during the tenure of the Coalition Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="933" /> I objected when a motion like this was brought in by the previous Government because I felt that this could mean the postponement of elections year after year and that this was a bad thing for fisheries.  I still have those reservations.  I can understand the confusion during the period of the previous Administration because I heard Deputy Deasy, who is now spokesman for Fine Gael on fishery matters, say at a by-election meeting that his party would take no action in relation to the Inland Fisheries Commission report.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>At the particular meeting when I heard the Deputy speaking he said that he did not consider the Inland Fisheries Commission report significant and as far as he was concerned he would not place very much importance on it.  If the Deputy has changed his mind since then I am glad to hear it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason given at that time for the postponement of the elections was that the Inland Fisheries Commission report was not in and the Minister had not time to consider the implications of it.  I am glad that action will now be taken on the recommendations of the Inland Fisheries Commission.  We have indicators, where counts have been taken in places like Ardnacrusha and the Thomond Way along the Shannon river, which show the decline in the number of salmon.  The decline in the number of salmon passing through Ardnacrusha and the Thomond Way this year is catastrophic.  The decline has been at least 100 per cent.  The main cause of the decline here is the amount of netting taking place.  I am not complaining about the licensed nets operating in the estuaries and on the coast but about the unlicensed salmon nets which are depleting the stock.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The salmon industry is being put in jeopardy by the unprecedented <Col N="934" /> netting which took place outside Loop Head in my constituency.  The mouth of the Shannon Estuary was blocked off by nets which resulted in the catastrophic drop in the number of fish running through the Thomond Way and Ardnacrusha into the Shannon.  If the fish are prevented from getting into the estuary spawning will not take place and our salmon stocks will be depleted further.</P>
    <P>This matter has to be looked at very carefully and some system will have to be devised to monitor the number of salmon landed here and also those sold by fishermen out of boats operating outside.  Some of those fish may not come on our markets but may be sold to factory ships.  I have heard reports during this fishing season of massive amounts of salmon being sold out to ships, fish which are not coming on to the market here.  I feel that the Minister in the EEC might be able to set up some kind of monitoring system throughout the Community whereby a total figure could be put on fish landings in all EEC ports.  In this way we could have an overall picture of the situation in relation to salmon stocks.</P>
    <P>I should like to see great care being taken in the composition of the Central Fisheries Board.  This board will be the key to the future development of inland fisheries.  The Minister must ensure that the people appointed to the board will be of the highest ability, having the capacity to carry out the task of restructuring salmon fisheries.</P>
    <P>I feel strongly about the conditions of employment of the staff of fisheries boards.  In the past they have been poorly paid and had no guarantee of continuity of employment.  They were employed on a year-to-year basis by the board and they could be hired and fired at the whim of board members. This system needs to be changed and I hope that when introducing the proposed legislation the Minister will seriously consider a proper grading and remuneration scheme for these people.  There may be some hope of continuity of employment for those engaged as inspectors, assistant inspectors, head keepers and water keepers.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="935" /> I am well aware of the good work that has been done by these boards in the past.  As a member of the Limerick board I know that they have had enormous difficulties.  The principal difficulty was that they did not have the financial capacity to carry out their task.  From year to year the estimates submitted by the boards were curtailed and they did not have the resources to deal with problems of pollution or the enforcement of fisheries laws generally.  Far more money will have to be provided to deal with existing problems.  The Minister has the ability and capacity to do a good job.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach and to the Minister for Defence (Mr. P. Lalor)</NameTxt>
      <P>The discussion we have had has been extremely constructive from a number of points of view.  The motion before the House seeks this deferment because of the fact that the incoming Minister is not in a position to bring before the House the Bill to which he referred when moving the motion.  The reason for this is that he took up office in early July and there would not be any possibility of his having got through the Bill by now in order to avoid the necessity of having this motion presented to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a lesson to be learned in this regard.  First of all, the lesson which is evident from today's discussion is the impossibility of Government by coalition.  The former Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy Murphy, sincerely and genuinely appealed to the incoming Minister in relation to the proposed legislation asking him not to hand over to a central fisheries board the powers he has at present or will have in the future.  Deputy Murphy did not put it that way but he indicated that the buck stops at the Minister's table and that he should accept responsibility for decisions.  The Parliamentary Secretary went on to say that the outgoing Government preferred it the other way.  It is quite clear that he, as parliamentary Secretary and endeavouring to do the right thing, found it impossible to get that message across to his colleagues <Col N="936" /> in the Cabinet.  Deputy Murphy promised in June of last year that the proposed Bill would be introduced before the end of that year or, at the latest, early this year.  It was not possible to introduce the Bill simply because there was disagreement.</P>
    <P>Deputy Deasy, the spokesman on behalf of Fine Gael, stressed and spelt out quite clearly that there must be more restriction with regard to the issuing of drift net licences.  I am not an expert in this field; I am a midlander. However, I contributed to the debate on the last Bill which enabled the Minister today to ask for this postponement. Dealing with drift nets in reply to the debate on the Fisheries (Amendment) Bill, 1976, the Parliamentary Secretary said:</P>
    <P>That question came up during the term of office of the previous Government and they dealt with it in the way they thought necessary and essential at the time.  As everybody knows, they imposed grave restrictions on drift net licences, and it was very difficult to measure up to the criteria laid down by my predecessor, Deputy Fahey, to qualify for a drift net licence.  The Government and I felt we would take a more liberal stance and that we could do that without endangering our salmon stocks.  As a result, we amended the order that existed in 1972 and changed the qualifications particularly for drift net licences and thus enabled fishermen who are to a large extent dependent on fishing for their livelihood, and many of them to a reasonable extent on salmon fishing, to acquire licences.</P>
    <P>I am not criticising the Parliamentary Secretary in this regard but that was his view and he said that it was shared by his colleagues in Government.  On the other hand, Deputy Deasy called for more restrictions.  By way of interruption during Deputy Daly's speech he stated clearly that he was pursuing that line.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I advocated that there should be more licences than Deputy Fahey was issuing.  What Deputy Murphy did was in order and he has given the maximum number allowed.</P>

      <P>We would not have to be involved in this debate if the previous Government could have reached agreement.  I was trying to draw attention to the commitments that have been entered into by the former Parliamentary Secretary.  Last year I spoke on this debate and there was a guarantee given by the then <Col N="938" /> Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, Deputy Murphy, that this legislation would be introduced before the end of last year. The suggestion that I am filibustering is upsetting.  In his speech of 22nd June, 1976, the Parliamentary Secretary said that he had got the report of the Inland Fisheries Commission in August, 1975.  Not that it is much of a debating point, but Deputy Deasy said it was 2nd July.  The Parliamentary Secretary also said that not only would the legislation be ready by the end of the year but that we would have an opportunity of debating the fishing industry generally.  We still have not had that opportunity.  We did learn to-day the reason for the difficulty in reaching agreement.  I share the former Parliamentary Secretary's view, though his colleague, the Minister for Local Government, wanted to take this power out of the hands of politicians. I do not disagree with Deputy Murphy when he says the Minister should accept responsibility and should try to hold on to power in this regard.  No matter how much a Minister is maligned&mdash;and Deputy Murphy was criticised today by Deputy Killilea in relation to the appointment of an official in south-west Cork&mdash;I agree with him when he says that the Minister is the man who has been elected by the people and that he should hold on to his power.  A change of Government from time to time is no harm because it makes people appreciate the responsibilities and the difficulties that arise for those in power.</P>
      <P>Another thing we learned from the debate was that the senior civil servants of the Department had changed their policy, which is an interesting point.  The Chair may be tempted to rule me out of order but we are discussing the policies of the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Sean Browne">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>The point I am anxious to make is that the remark can be taken as being of credit to the civil service on the whole.  It has been traditional to think of civil servants as being <Col N="939" /> the instruments of Government and those who implement policy.  Deputy Deasy's comment that the opinion of the civil servants had changed between Ministers is to the credit of the civil service.  On one occasion they were acting on the instructions of the previous Minister and on the next occasion he found they had changed their opinions because they were adopting the new Minister's line.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>I trust that when the legislation is introduced it will incorporate the much-needed power both for the seven regional fishery boards and the central fishery board and also that the Minister will assume responsibility for the problem to which Deputy Treacy referred, that is, the whole question of pollution and the provision of powers to deal with this problem. The legislation in this area is very much outdated.</P>
      <P>Much work has gone into the preparation of the proposed legislation in the form of recommendations, advice and so on.  It takes account of the recommendations that were made to the then Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries as far back as 1975. Having regard to all the effort that is being put into it, the Minister should be in a position to bring forward a satisfactory Bill.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Fisheries (Mr. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset I wish to assure the <Col N="940" /> House that this will be the last motion of its kind to be presented here for discussion.  It is the fourth motion of this nature and we have now had enough.  The legislation is practically ready.  There is some hold up while one or two legal aspects are being resolved.  These relate to the proposed new powers in the Bill whereby there will be provision for the compulsory acquisition and voluntary purchase of fisheries by the Minister.  These two innovations were key recommendations in the Inland Fisheries Commission Report.  We hope to have the Bill published before the end of the year and to be able to introduce it during the first session of the New Year.</P>
      <P>The debate has been constructive and has raised a number of points that will be elaborated further when the Bill is brought before us.  In the meantime, I shall deal with the points that were of some constructive interest. Deputies Deasy and Daly referred to the inadequacies of the protection service.  It is very important that we have an adequate protection service backed up by adequate enforcement facilities and powers and the necessary finance.  In this regard the new legislation will be very important because it is proposed to establish personnel of the protection service on a properly established superannuation basis.  At present they are recruited in a haphazard way without any guarantee of permanent service.  Neither have they any pension or gratuity scheme. The antiquated method by which the boards are financed does not allow for their proper financing.  In the legislation we are proposing that the board be financed properly by way of a combination of a grant-in-aid from the Central Fund both to the central fishery board and to the seven regional boards.  In addition, we will be proposing certain levies on the industry itself, in particular, on the first sale of salmon.</P>
      <P>What is important in the first place is to have a properly organised and properly staffed situation.  This is the sort of situation that we are providing for in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many of the difficulties associated with our inland fisheries stem from the <Col N="941" /> situation in which there are a number of boards around the country, each independent but also understaffed and underfinanced.  Our intention is to centralise the whole operation and to have available the development staff and resources that are administered now by the Inland Fisheries Trust. It is proposed to integrate into an overall system the staff of the trust and the funds that are devoted to it.</P>
    <P>I agree with what has been said in regard to the large-scale poaching that has taken place in recent years.  This poaching must be stopped.  To this extent I am serving notice of my intention to introduce stringent controls before the end of the year in this regard, control that will involve further regulation and which will result in stringent enforcement in order that we may preserve our salmon stocks and prevent the extinction of salmon stocks&mdash;something that is a real possibility unless measures are taken to deal with the problem. As Minister I shall not allow that to happen.  In advance of the legislation proper I propose using the existing statutory powers to bring in the appropriate regulations and control before the end of this year so that it may operate next year.  The legislation will include regulations and controls and provision for much stiffer penalties but in advance of the Bill I shall utilise to the full the existing powers in this respect.  In addition, I shall use the powers at my disposal in the meantime to ensure the recruitment of adequate staff.</P>
    <P>I assure Deputy Deasy that I will resist any pressure that might be designed to divert me from the course that I have outlined.</P>

I propose that the Minister for Fisheries will be the person who will acquire either voluntarily or compulsorily any fisheries that may become available.

      <P>I share Deputy Treacy's apprehension at the situation which has been allowed to develop in the River Suir. As he said, it has been forced by a combination of local authority pollution, industrial projects and farm activity.  I and my Department are in the course of taking active steps on this matter.  We have pressed the Irish Sugar Company who have been responsible for some of the pollution there, and they have spent over £100,000 this year in order to rectify the situation of effluent from their factory operations. In addition to that the Deputy might like to know that a number of meetings have been held with the various angling and fishery organisations as well as with various firms and bodies responsible, unfortunately, for effluent pollution.  A further important meeting will be held in Cashel next Monday night at which my officers will be present with a view to adopting further measures.  We are very conscious of this problem and we are pressing the Department of the Environment with their powers under the recent antipollution legislation.  I will be in touch with the Deputy on the matter.</P>

      <P>Research and investigation is continually being carried out by my Department's veterinary officers on all aspects of bovine tuberculosis, including the cause of recurrence of the disease in herds which were previously free from it.  When results of TB tests are being interpreted, the Department's veterinary inspectors decide, on the basis of the test results, the herd history and any other relevant information, what cases warrant more detailed investigation, for example, where multiple reactors are discovered in a previously clean herd.  In all of the problem cases epidemiological investigation is instigated covering the herd history, origin of the reactors, history of contiguous herds and other possible sources of the disease however remote, including infection by humans or by other animals such as pigs, poultry and wildlife.  In the course of this detailed and timeconsuming research and investigation the herdowner is advised about cleansing, disinfection, defects in fencing, danger from stagnant pools, and so forth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBermingham" hpid="Mr. Bermingham Mr. Bermingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bermingham</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Parliamentary Secretary aware that in several cases that I can quote to him where herds have been free for up to five years and the people concerned have been most careful in their purchase of stock and so forth, they cannot find any reason why stocks have become reinfected.  There seems to be no research <Col N="946" /> and no information available to them as to the cause of this, whether it is wild animals or anything of that nature.  Is the Parliamentary Secretary aware that the information available to people in this regard is very limited indeed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that herds which had previously been cleared of the disease developed TB again.  There are many causes for this, such as the inward movement of cattle.  During the period 1975-76 about 10 million cattle changed hands, and this is one of the things that can cause the spread of the disease.  There is also the lateral spread from farm to farm, and this can happen of course when cattle mix or even make contact with each other across fences.  Wildlife, too, is a potential carrier of the disease, although examinations have proved that this is not the greatest source of infection.  In tests carried out in the past few years only five badgers and two deer were found to have TB, so they are not the greatest source of spreading the disease. Infection of cattle by humans is another factor.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bermingham</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy. It is very frustrating for the farmers concerned, and indeed it is also very frustrating for my Department who have been trying to improve on the testing and clearance of this disease.

My Department have 16 outdoor officers to supplement the headquarters staff in the <Col N="950" /> enforcement of the quality standards. They attend daily at wholesale and retail outlets.  Warning letters are issued to offenders and legal proceedings were recently instituted in a number of cases.

      <P>Presumably the Deputy's question relates to an article which was published in the Journal of Agricultural Economics and discussed at a recent seminar organised by the Irish Housewives' Association. The conclusions drawn in the article are an assumption as to what would happen in the market if the EEC were to withdraw recognition of the lowest of four approved grades into which certain fruit and vegetables must be classified.  There are no reports that I know about the existing grading system having the effect of unduly raising the cost of vegetables to the consumer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy whether it is intended to impose an embargo on the further export of zinc and lead ore from Tara mines until appropriate steps are taken for the provision of adequate smelting facilities in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the Deputy's question is &ldquo;No&rdquo;.  Apart from other considerations an embargo on the export of ore by Tara Mines Limited would result in loss of employment for many hundreds of people who are employed at the mine and in associated activities.</P>
      <P>I would inform the Deputy, however, that obligations have been imposed on Tara Mines Limited and on Bula Limited to supply the concentrate requirements of an Irish smelter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>30.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy if he will indicate his plans for the Navan ore body; and how he sees the working relationship between the two mining companies there, Tara Mines Limited and Bula Mines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The two mining companies have legal rights to develop <Col N="970" /> their respective portions of the Navan orebody and the manner in which they are doing, or plan to do, this is primarily a matter for them.  These rights are, of course, subject to the terms of the lease and agreements to which I am a party and subject also to planning and other statutory requirements.</P>
      <P>At the present time, and particularly in view of the fact that one of the companies has not yet obtained planning permission for its mining development, it is not feasible to suggest the kind of working relationship between the two operators which would be most appropriate.  The fullest co-operation between them is clearly desirable in the national interest and I will do what I can to promote such co-operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister been in contact with either or one of the two companies, or with both of them, about this matter?  Have any communications been formally sent to the two companies about this matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department are constantly in communication with both companies.  As I have explained in the reply, the question of their co-operating in their mining operations will not arise until both of them are actually mining, or in a position to mine.  As the Deputy is aware, one of the companies, as I have already pointed out, has not yet got planning permission.  Therefore, there is no way in which any scheme of co-operation could be implemented at this time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister will agree that, because factors about such operations are important in the granting of permission, now is the time, before planning permission has been granted, for his Department to communicate whatever viewpoint the Government have on this matter rather than waiting until the permission has been granted?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>As I am sure the Deputy will appreciate, the difficulty is that until planning permission is granted we do not know, first of all, whether one of the companies will ever get permission to mine and, secondly, <Col N="971" /> we do not know under what conditions it will get permission to mine.  As I understand it, the application is for opencast mining.  If it gets permission to mine but not to carry on opencast mining the situation is radically different from what this company envisaged or appears to envisage in its earlier days.  The question of co-operation would have to be looked at then in a very different light.  It is only right to point out to the Deputy that there are conditions in relation to co-operation in the agreement with one of the companies and in the lease with the other company.  Certainly the conditions in regard to co-operation in the agreement with the company which has not yet got planning permission are not very helpful from the point of view of enabling the State to insist on reasonable co-operation because there are a number of areas or headings where the right of the State to ask for co-operation is specifically excluded.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>

      <P>It is a matter that is most appropriately dealt with by the management of the company and the trade unions concerned.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy if he recognises the particular problems of unemployment which have confronted Dublin city and in particular <Col N="974" /> the Dublin port area as a result of internal structural change within the Irish labour market and the location of industry throughout the country; if he will ensure that the IDA will be encouraged to create new jobs in the Dublin urban area; and if he will undertake to establish industrial estates within the built up areas of the city with particular emphasis on the inner city both north and south of the river Liffey.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the unemployment difficulties which have confronted Dublin city, and of the need for further industrial development in the port and inner city areas in particular.</P>
      <P>The Industrial Development Authority is giving immediate attention to the creation of new manufacturing employment in Dublin and has taken a number of initiatives to this end.  These include the provision of advance factories, the promotion of the area for large-scale industry and the extension of the small industries programme to Dublin for selected sectors.  I am informed by the IDA that in the six months January-June, 1977, projects involving over 2,500 jobs were approved grant assistance in Dublin, and on my return from the United States on Sunday week I was able to announce a further four projects for Dublin which will create 750 jobs at full production.</P>
      <P>The IDA is giving special attention to the problems of the inner city area. The small industries programme is being actively promoted in the inner city, and negotiations are almost completed with Dublin Corporation for the acquisition of a site at Newmarket in the Liberties on which a cluster of factories for small industrial projects will be constructed.  A consultant architect has been appointed and planning of this project has commenced.  Two further clusters will be constructed at locations yet to be decided.  There are difficulties in promoting the inner city area for medium and large scale enterprises as there are few suitable large sites immediately available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The IDA is also examining urgently the question of industrial development in the port area.  I understand that an <Col N="975" /> outline plan for the development of the port has been completed by the Dublin Port and Docks Board and is currently being examined by the IDA. The IDA is working with the board and with Dublin Corporation towards the provision of a suitable environment in the port for industrial development.</P>
    <P>In addition, the IDA is a member of the Dublin special and permanent development team set up by Dublin City Council to explore ways and means of promoting industrial development in centre city locations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank the Minister for his comprehensive reply but, with all due respect, we were aware of many of the measures announced.  Frankly, while some of them were taken on by the previous Administration and are now under the able care of the Minister, I do not believe, as a former member, that they will be sufficient.  Will the Minister give an undertaking to the House that he recognises in a real way how serious the problem in Dublin is?  Will he specifically encourage the IDA to attract large scale industries to selected sites within the inner city area? Under the terms of the Minister's reply he is excluding substantially large industries from the inner city areas where the need is greatest.  The level of unemployment in the inner city area on the north side is up to 28 per cent and none of the measures announced by the Minister will alleviate that problem in the short term.  With due respect, the Minister has not addressed himself to the problem outlined in the question.</P>

      <P>I must take cognisance of the growing habit of Members of making long statements without putting a question.  If that is permitted to go on Question Time will become a mockery.

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>What I said about large factories in the inner city area <Col N="976" /> is that frequently there are not suitable sites available for large projects and, therefore, the kind of projects that can be promoted on the outskirts of the city frequently cannot, for obvious physical reasons, be put into the centre of the city.  This does not apply to Dublin alone; it applies to other cities. It is more feasible to put in small industries in the inner city areas.  That is being done and the IDA are promoting Dublin now on the same basis as any other part of the country because they realise, as I do, that the unemployment rate in Dublin is very severe and the comparatively favourable situation which existed in Dublin up to some years ago no longer exists.</P>

      <P>I would like to take this opportunity of congratulating the new Minister on his appointment to this extremely interesting Department. Yesterday he intervened in the debate because he said the Opposition did not seem to have a proper grasp of what his Department was about and he tried to improve the quality of the contributions from the Opposition benches.  Subsequent speeches would seem to indicate that even yet they do not have a proper understanding of what the new Department is all about.</P>
      <P>The Minister's experience and ability to take charge of this Department cannot be questioned.  Yesterday he referred to his experience in economic planning in the Department of Education in the early sixties right through to the time when the Fianna Fáil Government first produced their economic plan for expansion.</P>

      <P>When I spoke here on 5th May I followed the former Deputy Halligan, who was a great man for talking about corporations for development and so on but, like the rest of his party, did nothing about it.  One speaker found fault because this new Department was not mentioned in our manifesto.  On 5th May, 1977, in volume 299, No. 3, at column 422 of the Official Report, speaking after Deputy Halligan, I said:</P>
      <P>Having listened to the previous speaker one feels the oracle has spoken... He chastises the Fianna Fáil Party because of their economic plans which he said did not work.  This shows how little he knows about the recent history of Fianna Fáil plans.</P>

      <P>It is with great pride that we can refer to the past achievements of Fianna Fáil in office and the complete and utter failure of successive Coalition Governments in relation to economic planning.  It was said that the Third Programme for Economic Expansion failed miserably but it was very rarely admitted that a number of its targets were achieved. Fianna Fáil have always believed in economic planning, and I believe that this is one of the reasons we are in office today.  Before the Coalition came to power they were in favour of setting up a Department of Economic Planning but when they came into office they were against it.  I was astonished to read comments by the Leader of Fine Gael, Deputy G. FitzGerald, on the setting up of this Department.  He said it would not work because there would be friction between the new Department and the Department of Finance.  I can understand Deputy FitzGerald saying that, because he does not know what it is to be in a Government working in harmony with your colleagues.  These comments led me to believe that he considers we should be a bureaucracy rather than a democracy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I felt very proud when I heard the new Minister speaking yesterday.  He radiated confidence.  I am sure Deputies on all sides were impressed by the way he presented his Department and told us how it would work. <Col N="981" /> It is a tremendous task for any Minister to be the first to lead and train civil servants in any new Department. If Deputy O'Donoghue had been engaged as a consultant by the State, he would have cost the Government more than he costs by being a member of the Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe this Department is a good move.  It will not be concerned with day-to-day executive activities but with long-term planning, surveying the existing state of the world economy, our own economy, looking ahead, knowing when to draw back and knowing when to expand.</P>
      <P>The fact that there will be liaison with other people in various Departments is a good indicator.  The Minister said that members of the Opposition would be welcome to suggest ways in which the Department could be structured rather than criticising it. The Minister referred to the Department of Education in the early sixties which contained a planning unit to plan ahead for education.  That worked sucessfully, but the Coalition disbanded that unit when they came into office.  Coalition Governments always seem to destroy without rhyme or reason everything created by Fianna Fáil just because Fianna Fáil created it.  That was a foolish move on the part of the Coalition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ministers today are so overburdened with the number of calls on them in relation to minor functions that they are very often not permitted to become involved in future planning for their Departments.  As the new Minister said in his speech yesterday, it is essential that the burden become less for Ministers.  This new Department will assist in this.  The Minister will act as a watch dog, as it were, on events and will be able to indicate the outlook for the next six months or a year.  The Minister stressed that his Department would not overlap or undermine other Departments but it will be there as a &ldquo;think-tank&rdquo; to set the climate for growth and expansion. This is something which we could have done with over the last <Col N="982" /> four years.  The former Minister for Finance, Deputy Ryan, said that one cannot plan in a time of recession because one does not know what will happen next.  That is the time when one must plan ahead.  Mr. Harold Wilson once said that in a time of recession one can pull the string too tight but it cannot be pushed back again.  Fianna Fáil have always known just how tight to pull that string in times of recession.  It is vital to have a Department of Economic Planning in times of world recession.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the historical background of his Department. In one way or another this has been a thread of Fianna Fáil policy since the 1950's.  The first programme for economic expansion was started by the late Deputy Éamon de Valera and continued by his successor, the late Deputy Seán Lemass.  This debate gives the Opposition an opportunity to make constructive suggestions on the future of this Department.  I cannot see any future Government disbanding this Department. It will be an essential part of Government.  Other countries will probably imitate this Department very closely.  This is not our first time to introduce innovations.  We were the first country to introduce children's allowances.  We should not be afraid to come forward with new ideas.</P>
    <P>I am glad that one of the functions of the Department will be to ensure that existing Departments will have adequate planning facilities.  It is essential to progress that this structure be created in each Department.  It takes a lot of planning to set up a Department like this and the House must appreciate that it calls for a person with a very special talent to deal with it.  The Minister is talented.  He has worked successfully before, not as a Member of this House, with the Taoiseach, Deputy Jack Lynch, prior to 1973 as his economic adviser.  The new Minister is one of the best acquisitions to Fianna Fáil in many years and the people will benefit.  When glancing through the newspapers this morning I noticed that Mr. Bruce Arnold of the <i>Irish Independent</i> was very much interested in the Minister's speech.  The members of the press inform the public <Col N="983" /> about what is going on.  They have a responsibility to do so in a responsible manner.  The Minister's speech certainly had this reporter's goodwill and good wishes and his is certainly the feeling of the people.</P>
    <P>If the Minister succeeds in having this Department functional by early next year, it will be quite an achievement because there is much work ahead of him.  I hope he will receive all the co-operation for which he has asked from this House.  Certainly the Committee Stage should be a very interesting one.  In many years I do not think I have listened to a debate in which the people participating showed greater interest than in this one.  Perhaps it is because it is new or that we have not spoken about this Department before.</P>
    <P>I was very aware yesterday of the tremendous interest in the Minister's speech and, of course, in the introduction by the Minister for Finance.  At one stage he was accused of being vague.  One cannot be definite on every aspect of something one is in the process of setting up; that has to be understood. The one man who does know what he is about, who has lived with this a lot longer than we have&mdash;since we received the Bill, as it were&mdash;is the Minister in question.  He is the right man in the right place at the right time and I wish him the best of luck in his work ahead.</P>

      <P>While this is the first time we have debated a motion on the setting up of a Ministry for Economic Planning and Development we have had several debates in the House over the years on economic planning and development.  We have had five-year programmes and schemes drawn up by Departments.  I remember that at the 1957 election there was a programme drawn up by the then Taoiseach which was highlighted as creating 100,000 additional jobs.  Of course, at that time jobs were exceptionally welcome.  Unfortunately, it transpired that while the 100,000 jobs were provided our people had to go to Birmingham, London, mainly to Britain to get the jobs.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;to the Government team.  He must be a superman because the Minister said in his introductory remarks that one need not dwell unduly on the very serious economic difficulties we have experienced over the last four years. Other Members said that the National Coalition Government was disastrous. Fianna Fáil have succeeded what has been termed a disastrous Government and what is happening?  Despite the recession and how badly it is said the country was doing they have produced this booklet.  The Minister for Economic Planning and Development at present without portfolio owes his position to the part he played in introducing this manifesto.</P>
      <P>Fianna Fáil were in office&mdash;and it is no harm to look back because, in order to assess future needs, one has to take cognisance of what happened in the past&mdash;from 1957 to 1973.  16 consecutive years.  And, as Deputy Briscoe asserted a moment ago, they did not always play in harmony. However, leaving that aside, there were several questions posed by the Opposition to the Government during that lengthy period, questions we thought should have been answered in the affirmative and which we considered vital to sections of our people. The Official Report will bear out that money was not available to implement any of those proposals.  I am referring to such matters as the reduction of the qualifying age for old age pension.</P>

      <P>Previous Deputies referred to what happened under Coalition Governments when they went back to the forties.  As we have been told from the Fianna Fáil benches, this constitutes a major step forward.  Therefore, it is quite in order to make an appraisal, admittedly as briefly as possible, of what was the position in the past.  I remember addressing questions to Deputy Haughey, the then Minister for Finance, about easing the burden on the tax-paying community, particularly that on the working section.  He gave a rather lengthy answer and also lengthy replies to supplementary questions, that it was impossible to do this, that raising the level would cost so much money because all taxpayers inside the net would be affected; there-fore, were one to give an allowance of only £5 or £6 per head to all of those people it would amount to a sizeable sum of money.  The Leas-Cheann Comhairle looks somewhat uneasy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Advancing then to 1973, the Fianna Fáil Party were defeated.  Deputy Vivion de Valera told us last evening that they had used their time endeavouring to promote policies with a view, <Col N="986" /> obviously, to winning the election. That was the main purpose behind this manifesto.  It is peculiar that&mdash;as they assert&mdash;after a period of disastrous government so many innovations can take place simultaneously or so we are told.  In the manifesto&mdash;which I know was a votebuying document&mdash;we were told that we would not have to pay car tax any more.  Most of us own cars and I suppose we are all pleased to some extent that it has been abolished but, perhaps, we should ask ourselves the question: should we be?  If it is not paid under the heading of car tax it must be paid under some other.</P>
      <P>I have been in this House since 1951.  In all the debates that have taken place here since then and in the many questions addressed to Ministers I am sure the Official Report will bear out that at no time did any Member of this House assert that car tax should be abolished.</P>

      <P>It is an elaboration of the Minister's opening statement and I am entitled to comment on it.  I made a suggestion with regard to car tax.  We have been told what will happen so far as rates are concerned and so far as taxation generally is concerned we are told there will be a marked improvement.  The Government have said all these improvements in the area of taxation can be obtained at a time when, according to them, we are after four years of disastrous government.</P>
      <P>We hope these improvements can be made.  If it happens it will be a tribute to the previous Government who were in power for four years. Fianna Fáil had three or four terms of office, from 1957 to 1973, but they were not able to bring in any proposals to improve the lot of the people.  We have to doubt the sincerity of the proposals now made.  It has been pointed out that the Department of Economic Planning and Development was not mentioned in the election manifesto.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>How will the Minister go about his task?  According to the newspapers he is charged with responsibility to provide jobs.  The Government told the people that in their first year of office 20,000 additional jobs would be provided and that this number would be increased sharply in subsequent years. All of us would like to see extra jobs being made available.  We know that one of the main problems confronting young people, and a matter that is a source of grave anxiety to parents, is the difficulty in obtaining employment <Col N="988" /> for them.  This is a growing problem, especially as we have no emigration outlet, an outlet that existed in what some called the good old days.</P>
    <P>There is an obligation on everyone to make an effort to provide additional jobs but I do not think that is being done.  We are not creating a favourable atmosphere in the industrial area. The Minister for Economic Planning and Development or some other Minister must take a stand on this matter. It is very disheartening to read in the newspapers each day about the many strikes that are in progress and that are pending.  The IDA and the Government are making efforts to attract industries here but their efforts are hindered to a considerable extent by what is happening in the country. The present system has outlived its usefulness.  Unless something is done the same situation with regard to strikes and disputes will obtain in six months time.</P>
    <P>There must be some other way of solving disputes between management and unions.  The present system is obsolete and is not working.  This is a vital matter so far as economic planning is concerned.  If we are to continue year after year with the present system in operation there is very little use in our sending ambassadors abroad in an effort to attract industry.  The first essential is good labour relations. Any industrialist interested in coming here will investigate what is happening here.  The Twenty-six Counties comprise a small area and we have little more than three million population. Many of the unemployed are desperately anxious to obtain work.  They want to give a fair day's work for a fair day's pay but because of the disruption throughout the country they are unable to get employment.  Any industrialist from the European Community or from the United States who may wish to establish an industry here will think twice about it when he reads of the industrial disruption presently occurring.  We must change our attitudes.  What happens to those people who are engaged in civil disputes? They go before a body that makes a decision.  Generally such a decision is acceptable&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Another desirable feature, so far as the Minister's task is concerned, is co-ordination of effort among the different Departments.  I mentioned on previous occasions that one Department acts as if no other Department exists in the State.  This certainly comes under the heading of this Department of Economic Planning and Development.  The Department of Posts and Telegraphs, for instance, may have six casual workers doing a job in a certain place.  The Department dispenses with the workers services after a few months when the job is completed.  Why can such workers not be transferred to the ESB or some other body and continue in employment instead of going to the labour exchange and drawing unemployment benefit?  It would be far better for the workers to move to other employment with some other body.  The subventions they receive from the Department of Social Welfare would go a long way towards the money they receive when they are given this extra employment.  The State would get some work in return for what is paid out.  The Exchequer would also benefit from the insurance contributions and income tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill invites contributions from Deputies on how things can be changed.  I believe co-ordination of effort is a main factor as far as the work of the new Department is concerned. It is important to get State <Col N="990" /> bodies and local authorities to send those casual workers I have been talking about to other employment.  Some officer should be appointed to look for alternative employment for them.  It is impossible to overemphasise the importance of employment today.  One of the main problems facing us in south west Cork&mdash;I am sure Deputies representing Dublin and other constituencies throughout the country have the same problem&mdash;is to try to find employment for our constituents.</P>

The Bill deals with planning and development and the establishment of a new Department.  That is all it deals with.  The debate is very limited.

      <P>When the Minister for Finance opened the debate yesterday he said that the Minister in charge of the new Department will be in regular contact with his colleagues at Government meetings.  This means that the Minister for Economic Planning and Development will be in regular contact with his colleagues irrespective of the portfolios they hold. I understood, according to the procedures of the House, that it was quite in order to refer to what he might say to his colleagues.  I have been talking about the co-ordinating effort he can make to continue employment for people casually employed by public bodies and State services.  We have many casual workers employed all over the country by the Department of Finance, the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, the ESB, county councils and other public bodies.</P>
      <P>I would like the Minister to have a look at the position at the moment. When a State body have no further work for employees they let those people go to the labour exchange. Would it be possible to move them on to another public agency so that they can do some other public work? That would save the loss in social welfare payments.  I have been dealing with people for a long time and I am of the opinion that people would prefer to work.  We must ensure that every able-bodied man is provided with a job.  I expressed that opinion here about 25 years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The manifesto tells us about the 160,000 who are unemployed.  We all <Col N="993" /> know that there are many people on the unemployment register who are incapable of work because of physical disability or injury.  Such people should be provided with adequate benefits. Those of our citizens who are anxious to work must be provided with jobs. When I heard about the establishment of this new Department I thought that it would be the Minister's task to bring about an improvement in this position.</P>
    <P>I am afraid, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, that if I were to continue for much longer you would have occasion to reprimand me again.  I have the greatest respect for your impartiality, but I think you may possibly have made an error of judgment.</P>

      <P>(a)  to promote and co-ordinate economic and social planning for the development of the economy both generally and as respects different sectors thereof and different regions of the country,</P>
      <P>(b)  to identify the policies it considers necessary for general economic and social development and to report thereon to the Government,</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is a relatively new Member of the House.  Without reflecting on his qualifications in any way, he would not have the rural knowledge, by virtue of his Dublin base, which we rural Deputies have.  I thought it would be an advantage to mention these factors.  Nobody can hold him responsible for the position obtaining since he is only just appointed.  We all want to see him doing a good job.  I mentioned the anxiety of parents in seeking jobs for their children.  All elected representatives have a duty to help anyone who is trying to give people jobs.  We should also take umbrage at those who are moving in the opposite direction, as some are at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will not continue on to other matters in view of the ruling.  You have made a decision which you think is correct.  I want to wish the Minister well.  I believe a co-ordinator is necessary because Departments cannot <Col N="995" /> act as if other Departments did not exist.  From what I have read and heard about the Minister he seems to have the qualifications to measure up to that kind of job.  I believe there is an obligation on all Deputies to put forward views which they think might be helpful.  If their suggestions are not feasible, cognisance need not be taken of them.  We require a very firm hand on the industrial life of the country and if we do not get it the figures on the unemployment register will not be reduced.</P>

      <P>I should like to wish the new Minister well.  Having said that, I will go on to give some reason why he might not get on so well in his Department.  We must have economic planning.  This attitude of &ldquo;Live horse and get grass&rdquo; is something that cannot be tolerated.  It is good to have such a Department providing it is given teeth and the muscle to act and take decisions.  I am afraid that this is where the weakness will lie and I feel that the Minister is, perhaps, being &ldquo;set up&rdquo;.  Most people say he was the architect of the Fianna Fáil manifesto and of the promises and gimmicks contained in it.  If it is successful the Government will take credit for it.  If it is a failure they will need a &ldquo;fall guy&rdquo; to take the blame and I believe the Minister is being set up in this way.  I hope it is not true but only time will tell whether it is true.  The Government can say they were badly advised and that they will dispense with the services of the new Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish the Minister well and hope that he is successful.  I am not the type of Deputy who would come into the House in order deliberately to offend another Deputy. The Minister could be set up in this fashion.  After all, he is new to this aspect of the political scene and there are a few hardy annuals who would do it to him.</P>
      <P>The Minister is bound to come up against the other Departments.  For instance, I believe that our educational system is wrong and that we should be geared towards technology.  The Minister might also believe this to be true. He may make suggestions along this line to the Department and they may tell him to mind his own business.  He may want to enter into the sphere of labour which is an important aspect of our economic development.  He may have some good ideas in this respect but he may also run up against a stone wall.  Departments are jealous of their autonomy and will not hand anything over to a new Department. however generous they are with an older Department.  It would be wrong for the Minister to believe that he will receive a lot of good will.  It is in this area that the Minister will meet his first obstacle.  He may tell the Department of the Environment that our roads are not adequate and that our communication structures are too week and the Department may very well tell him that they are quite satisfied. At the end of the day the Minister will have a lot of good suggestions but will become a jack of all trades and master of none.  When the errors are made he will be the one to carry the can.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope that the Department is successful because we must have long-term planning, divorced from the cold hand of the Department of Finance. In the past the problem has been that the Department of Finance have stifled development.  After all, their role is to reduce spending.  One cannot be too critical of their role but I believe they will be in control of the new Department.  If that is so, how can any real development take place?  No doubt there will not be a shortage of white papers and green papers.  There <Col N="997" /> will be plenty of reports from the Department which will, like so many previous reports, be left to gather dust.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will be able to use some muscle in his dealings with the Departments.  If he is not able to do that he will not succeed.</P>
    <P>The Minister should consider Dublin as it is a particularly run-down area. For a long time we have been hearing about the great hardship suffered in the west but the only poverty in the country today is in Dublin, with its high unemployment rate and environmental problems.  The port of Dublin has been under-utilised for a long time.  Many people in the city want to stifle progress in the name of a number of things.  I should like the Minister to tackle this problem because the port area has potential for development. That is an aspect of economic development to which the Minister should have regard.</P>
    <P>On all sides of the House we are concerned with the problem of unemployment and we realise that there is no easy solution to this question but in their manifesto Fianna Fáil talked about creating an additional 20,000 jobs per year.  The word &ldquo;additional&rdquo; in this context is important since there will always be redundancies, closures and wastage of one kind or another.  Far be it from me to throw cold water on the Government's aspiration to provide these extra jobs.  We are in early days yet and we all realise that the Government's commitment in this area will involve them in a huge task.  The Minister will have the full support of the House in any steps he may take towards the creation of these additional jobs.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Murphy said, the whole question of industrial relations is of major importance.  It is an area that has been neglected down through the years with the result that we have structured our industrial relations to the needs of modern society.  The new Department will not have any hangups and because of this will be in a position to play a very active and co-ordinating role in the proper development of industrial democracy <Col N="998" /> in the labour relations field.  Without such a structure we will run into trouble.  At present we are witnessing the problems at Ferenka which, if not resolved shortly, will have serious consequences in so far as potential industries for the future are concerned. I may be straying a little at this point but I trust the Chair will have patience with me.</P>

      <P>This is one area of activity which may lead the Minister into some contention in that he may have to tread on some people's toes but I trust he will be strong enough not to deviate from his point of view.  Otherwise, the civil service would kill him.  In saying that I am not reflecting on civil servants but they have a strong network.  They operate in a certain way so that the Minister would need to be very strong-willed to maintain his position.  It is acknowledged that civil servants are very good administrators so I am not in any way being critical of them.</P>

Civil Servants are not in a position to defend themselves here but if the Deputy believes that they are a threat to a Minister, it is appropriate that on this debate he would indicate the nature of the additional safeguards or powers which should be given either to a Minister or to Ministers to allay that threat.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I was not referring to the civil service in any derogratory sense.  We all know how the civil service of any country operates.  Power <Col N="999" /> is an important part of any sphere of activity so it can be assumed that civil servants, like any other group, would endeavour to have as much control as possible.  It will be a matter for the Minister as to how this situation can be overcome but I am convinced that he has the right type of personality to enable him to be successful in this respect.  However, it is something that he will have to be conscious of.  We read in the newspapers from time to time of where Ministers in other countries succumb to pressures.</P>
      <P>The Minister's greatest battle will be in relation to the Department of Finance because they are the people who call the tune.  In this respect I wonder whether the new Department will have a separate budget or whether it will be purely a co-ordinating Department.  Are they to have a budget that will enable them to initiate development or will they be merely a blueprint passing on their initiatives to other Departments to be implemented?  If the latter should be the case they will not get very far. We have heard fears expressed in regard to possible friction between the new Department and other Departments but there should be no friction. Perhaps, though, some Departments may not like the idea of shedding some of their responsibility and may endevour to maintain the <i>status quo</i>.</P>
      <P>Another point I should like clarified is whether the new Department will be examining every Department with a view to streamlining operations in the interest of economic development or is that the function of the Department of the Public Service?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinODonoghue" hpid="Professor O'Donoghue Professor O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy is talking of the actual operation of separate Government Departments I can tell him that the reform of those Departments is a matter for the Department of the Public Service. It is a specific task of that Department. The Minister for Finance touched on that subject in his opening remarks and he will be dealing with the matter in greater detail in the near future.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. F. O'Brien Mr. F. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>But I take it that the Minister for Economic Planning and Development will have a role to play within the Departments in relation to the implementation of changes that are considered good for the economy and for creating the right atmosphere for the provision of more jobs and more wealth.  Basically the function of the new Department will be to generate activity, wealth and movement on an upward trend.</P>
      <P>Will the new Department have any control over the semi-State bodies in being able to examine them and to ensure that, for instance, the ESB will fall in with any economic plans which we are formulating?  We must have a generating capacity within the electrical industry to meet any coming expansion. Will the new Department be able to say: &ldquo;We want this done&rdquo;, or make suggestions?  They should be able to go into every aspect of our economic life and to instruct rather than request that things be done.  The IDA play a very important role in the industrial development of this nation and they have done excellent work on job creation. Will the new Department be able to ensure that they will continue to play their part in the creation of jobs?  It is not enough to set up these bodies, finance them and let them work away on their own.  We have to do all that, but it is important that a Department such as the one being set up should be able to examine the role of the IDA. Córas Tráchtála and so on to ensure that they are doing their work.</P>
      <P>Our great social problem today is unemployment. We all wish that we could remedy it.  The Minister will be preoccupied with it in ensuring that we can develop our job potential to its maximum.  Given the whole area of what he has to do he has a great responsibility.  He has not a great deal of authority; he has not a great amount of muscle, and he should seek that for his own development because this Department could very quickly make or break his political future.  He could find himself thrown in at the deep end at an early stage without the force of some sanctions within his Department, and this could create difficulties for him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1001" /> The whole area of our infrastructure needs to be examined.  In Dublin county alone there are hold-ups in industrial development because the infrastructure is not there.  As a result industry cannot move on to sites.  The money that should be forthcoming from other Departments is not there and this again results in hold-ups.  This is an area in which the Minister could exercise his guidance to ensure that the various Departments know at budget time how the money can be used to the best advantage in job development and social development. The area that is most underdeveloped at the moment is Dublin city.  The Minister, being a Dublin Deputy, must fully realise that, although he may not represent the constituency which suffers most in that respect.  I represent <Col N="1002" /> a constituency which has very high unemployment.  Consequently I am very conscious of it and if I do overstate a little I pray for indulgence because I believe that the potential for job development is here.  When one asks a question regarding development in Dublin one is told that we cannot really develop the inner city because we have not the land, we have not got this and we have not got that.  I say that we have.  The new Department will be examining all these aspects and forcing the hand of the local authorities and statutory bodies such as the Port and Docks Board.</P>

      <P>Owners retrieving their stray animals from local authority pounds do not pay fines in the sense of penalties as such. The amounts they pay are fees which are intended to cover fair remuneration for the impounding, care and sustenance of, and attendance on, such animals.</P>
      <P>Pound fees are prescribed by regulations made under the Pounds (Provision and Maintenance) Act, 1935. The fees, which are revised from time to time to take account of increasing costs and prices, were last increased with effect from 1st January, 1976. They are being reviewed at present with a view to the prescribing of higher fees which will reflect the increases in costs and prices over the last two years.</P>
