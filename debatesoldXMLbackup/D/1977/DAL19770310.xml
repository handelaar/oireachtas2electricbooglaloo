I am giving him the answer now that on some occasions, as he probably knows, it is the Foreign Ministers on certain aspects of it who meet and on other aspects it is the Ministers for Agriculture and Fisheries or the Ministers for Fisheries and on other occasions it is a joint meeting.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to make the necessary legislative provisions to implement the social welfare increases and improvements announced in the budget.  It deals, therefore, with increases in the rates of payment under the schemes of social insurance and social assistance; with a number of important improvements in the conditions attaching to these schemes; and, with consequential changes in the occupational injuries scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1195" /> The Bill also contains the necessary provisions for increases in the contributions payable under the social insurance and occupational injuries schemes which are required to ensure the proper financing of the very extensive services now provided.  A special provision is included in the Bill to enable effect to be given to the ratification of multilateral instruments such as the European Convention on Social Security of the Council of Europe.</P>
    <P>As is always the case, this Social Welfare Bill contains a number of sections which relate to the amendment of existing legislation and which are necessarily technical.  Such sections can be difficult to follow.  The explanatory memorandum which has been circulated with the Bill has been drafted with the intention of clarifying the various provisions and I hope that Deputies will have been helped by it in their examination of the Bill.</P>
    <P>This is the fifth Social Welfare &ldquo;Budget&rdquo; Bill to have been introduced since the National Coalition came into office in 1973.  It is the 11th piece of social welfare legislation which I have brought into this House in four years. In all of these measures, the concern of the Government has been to advance the work of alleviating social problems; of making adequate provision for all our citizens against the universally recognised contingencies of life; and of laying the foundations for the eventual elimination of financial need from our society.</P>
    <P>As I pointed out in an Estimate speech here three years ago:</P>
    <P>I have absolutely no illusions about the size of the job which we are facing and I am making no facile promises about easy solutions or fast conclusions.</P>
    <P>The struggle against inequality and financial disadvantage is, as I said then, a long and difficult one, but we have begun.  In fact, the advances made in social welfare in the past four years must be seen as the clearest evidence possible of the commitment of the Government to social progress and reform. In a period of almost unparalleled world recession, total financial provision for social welfare has <Col N="1196" /> been more than trebled and it has been possible, not alone to maintain and improve the real value of all basic rates of payment, but to bring about many important changes and expansions in our social welfare system. These achievements should be put into their proper context.</P>
    <P>There has been an increasing amount of comment on the difficulties experienced by national social security systems all over Europe as a result of the recession and, in particular, of the sustained high level of unemployment. The latest EEC Social Report pointed to the fact that: &ldquo;increased demands were made on social security . . . to alleviate the harmful effects of unemployment and inflation which mark the present crisis, whilst the effect of the recession was to reduce the financial means available&rdquo;.  The same report makes reference to restrictive measures being taken in respect of the social welfare system even of the most advanced member states such as Belgium, Denmark and Germany.</P>
    <P>A more recent report, by the International Labour Organisation, indicated that the problems of social security systems are continuing and made the point that just about the only good news about these schemes is: &ldquo;that they have not gone bankrupt as sceptics predicted they would in the aftermath of the oil crisis&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In these circumstances the progress which has been possible in our social welfare system must be seen as evidence of the Government's firm determination to ensure that the old, the sick, the widowed and the unemployed are not called upon, as in the past, to bear the full burden of the nation's economic difficulties.  Those who are, in fact, the victims of the working of our economic system must not be asked to pay twice for its failures.</P>
    <P>The increases in weekly rates of social welfare payments to be implemented in April will ensure that&mdash; taking into account the increases paid to many recipients last October&mdash;all those in receipt of benefit and assistance payments will have obtained increases of the order of 15 per cent over the rates in operation in April, 1976.  This will involve a total expenditure <Col N="1197" /> in the current year of over £46 million and it will bring the overall outlay on social welfare benefits and allowances to more than £520 million. This figure compares with the total outlay of £151 million in 1972-73.  It represents about 10 per cent of the projected gross national product compared with the corresponding figure of 6½ per cent in 1972-73.  These increases, together with the other very substantial improvements contained in this Bill maintain and consolidate the progress made since 1973 in implementing the social programme of the Government.</P>
    <P>In the period between July, 1973, and April, 1977, the increases in personal rates of payment under the social insurance scheme will have been between 120 and 142 per cent, while payments in respect of dependent children will have increased by between 163 per cent and 195 per cent.</P>
    <P>Maximum personal rates of payment under the social assistance scheme will have been increased, over the same period, by between 124 per cent and 155 per cent.  Child dependant allowances will have risen by between 174 per cent and 220 per cent.  Over the period from the beginning of 1973 to the present, the increase in the consumer price index has been of the order of 90 per cent &mdash;so that the increases provided for in the Bill in all rates of social welfare payments represent substantial real gains to all recipients.</P>
    <P>I want to be a little more specific about this question of real increases. In the period from early 1969 to early 1973&mdash;roughly the period in office of the last Fianna Fáil Administration the rate of contributory old age pension for a couple both over pension age, rose from £6.63 to £10.35&mdash;a rise, in real terms, of about 11½ per cent, taking inflation into account.  The real increase in pension for a similar couple in the four years of this Government will, at April, 1977 rates, be more than 20 per cent.</P>
    <P>In the same period of Fianna Fáil government&mdash;1969 to 1973&mdash;the flat rate of unemployment benefit for a couple with two children rose by just over 15½ per cent in real terms.  The <Col N="1198" /> corresponding real increase in the term of office of this Government has been about 18 per cent.  These superior real increases have been achieved in a period of unprecedented world recession and inflation.  They have been achieved at a time when, as I have already indicated, the position of income maintenance services all over Europe has been under the most severe pressure.  They represent a positive achievement and they prove the nature of this Government's commitment in the whole area of social welfare.</P>
    <P>The increases which come into operation in April are designed to ensure that persons who are dependent on social welfare payments will have been compensated for rising prices up to that date.  The Government have also decided that welfare recipients will not be allowed to absorb price rises over a full year period following on the April increases and provision is again being made for a further 5 per cent increase in rates from October next to provide against such price increases.  This further increase will be effected by regulation at the appropriate time.  Thus, an October increase is being provided for the third year in succession.  Deputies will agree with me that this has been a most important innovation in our social welfare system and one which takes full account of the special needs of social welfare recipients at a time of high inflation.</P>
    <P>Before turning to a detailed description of the changes proposed in the main rates of social assistance and social insurance payments I wish to point out that I intend to deal separately with each of the improvements and changes affecting the various schemes later in my speech.  Significant increases in the rates of all social assistance payments are provided for in the Bill.  The maximum weekly personal rate of non-contributory old age and blind pensions is being raised from £10.75 to £11.75 for persons under 80 years and from £11.60 to £12.65 for persons aged 80 years and over.  The rates of pension payable where the weekly means exceed £6 are also being correspondingly increased <Col N="1199" /> up to the point where means exceed £15 and no pension is payable.</P>
    <P>The maximum weekly payment for dependent spouses who are not themselves entitled to a pension will be raised from the October, 1976, level of £5.35 to £5.85, so that the overall weekly payment for an old age non-contributory pensioner with a dependent spouse will, at the maximum rate, be increased from £16.10 to £17.60 and where the pensioner is 80 years of age or over, from £16.95 to £18.50.  The corresponding rates in April, 1976, were £15.35 and £16.15, respectively.</P>
    <P>The allowance paid in respect of a prescribed relative giving full-time care and attention to an incapacitated pensioner is being increased by 55p a week to £6.55.  In addition, the increases payable in respect of qualified children are being raised by 25p to £3.15 a week for the first two children and by 20p to £2.40 a week for each additional child.</P>
    <P>The new table of weekly means and rates of pension in section 2 sets out particulars of these changes.  I should explain that, for a pensioner with qualified children, the means limit is greater than the £15 shown in the table and there is provision for extending the table to cover such cases.</P>
    <P>Section 4 provides for increases in the personal rates of unemployment assistance which are raised from £8.90 to £10.20 in the case of urban areas and from £8.55 to £9.80 in rural areas. Corresponding increases are made in the rates for adult dependants and for qualified child dependants.  Thus the rate of unemployment assistance payable to a married couple with one child is increased from £18.10 to £20.75 in an urban area and from £17.65 to £20.20 in a rural area, representing an increase of £2.65 and £2.55 in these payments, respectively.</P>
    <P>Sections 8 and 9 provide for the application of the budget increases in the weekly rates of non-contributory widow's and orphan's pensions.  These increases apply automatically to the social assistance allowances for deserted wives, unmarried mothers and prisoners' wives.  The maximum personal <Col N="1200" /> weekly rate of these allowances will be increased from £10.75 to £11.75 and the increase payable in respect of each qualified child is being raised from £3.55 to £3.90.  The orphan's non-contributory pension rises from £7.00 to £7.65 a week.  The single woman's allowance will also be increased and the maximum weekly payment will be £10.20&mdash;an increase of 85p a week. All of these rates, it will be remembered, were also increased last October.</P>
    <P>I now come to the increases in the rates of the contributory pensions and short-term social insurance benefits which are set out in some detail in section 14.  I will refer briefly to some of the main items.  The personal rates of contributory old age and retirement pensions, in the case of persons under age 80, go up by £1.15 a week to £13.60 and, for those over age 80, the pension is being increased by £1.25 a week to £14.75.  The maximum personal rates of widow's contributory pension and deserted wife's benefit will go up by £1.05 a week to £12.60, in the case of those under age 80 and by £1.15 a week to £13.60 for those over that age. The rate of invalidity pension is being increased from £11.45 to £12.45 a week. Again, it must be remembered that all the pensions I have mentioned were increased last October.</P>
    <P>The additions to pensions and benefits in respect of adult dependants and children are also being increased.  Thus, in the case of old age contributory and retirement pensions, a married couple both of whom are over pensionable age will get £24.40 a week pension from April or £25.25 a week if the pensioner is 80 years of age or over, as compared with £21.30 and £22.00 in April, 1976.  A widow or deserted wife with four qualified children will get £29.60 a week by way of contributory pension or benefit compared with £25.80 in April last.</P>
    <P>The short-term social insurance benefit rates are being increased in the same way so that a married couple with four children will get £33.55 a week by way of flat-rate unemployment benefit or disability benefit compared with £29.40 at present.  Maternity allowance is being raised from £10.90 to £12.45 a week, and the contributory orphan's <Col N="1201" /> allowances this year will involve an £9.20 a week.</P>
    <P>In line with the improvements in the general social insurance system, the Bill also provides, in section 19, for increases in the rates of benefit payable under the occupational injuries scheme.  The increases in weekly rates will be broadly in line with those provided for in the social insurance categories to which I have referred.  It is of interest to indicate more clearly the impact of these substantial increases by giving some details of the number of recipients involved.</P>
    <P>About 300,000 pensioners and 12,000 recipients of long-term benefits and allowances&mdash;together with their adult and child dependants&mdash; will receive increases under the various provisions of the Bill.  In addition, approximately 190,000 claimants to short-term benefits and allowances will receive the proposed new rates of payments, together with appropriate increases for their adult dependants and qualified children.  In all, some 930,000 persons will benefit from the provisions of this Bill.</P>
    <P>It is also worth while to say something about the breakdown of total expenditure on social welfare between the main categories of benefit and allowance.  The best estimates at present available to me indicate that of the projected total expenditure of about £520 million some 54 per cent will be spent on social insurance benefits, 45 per cent on social assistance allowances and just 1 per cent on occupational injuries benefits.</P>
    <P>Of the overall total, the amount estimated for payments under the unemployment benefit, unemployment assistance and pay-related benefit &mdash;unemployment&mdash;headings will be approximately £117 million&mdash;or 22½ per cent.  This figure very clearly underlines the fact that the social welfare system is not&mdash;as its vocal critics constantly suggest&mdash;catering merely for this one social problem.  In fact, by far the greatest proportion of projected expenditure relates to pensions of all kinds&mdash;which will account for almost £230 million, or 44 per cent of the total.  Children's <Col N="1202" /> allowences this year will involve an outlay of £50 million.</P>
    <P>For the fourth time since the Government took office, the qualifying age for old age pensions is being reduced by a further year&mdash;from 67 to 66 years with effect from 1st October next.  Section 13 of the Bill provides accordingly.  The significance of this advance can be appreciated by reference to the fact that, prior to 1973 and the advent of this Government, there had never been a reduction of pension age from the original age of 70 years.  That pension age was originally set, in respect of non-contributory pensions, 70 years ago in the Old Age Pensions Act, 1908&mdash;a United Kingdom statute&mdash;and, in the case of contributory pensions, 17 years ago in the Social Welfare (Amendment) Act, 1960.  Nothing at all was done in this direction in the whole period of Fianna Fáil rule from 1957 to 1973.</P>
    <P>I regard the progress made in this respect as most important.  The Government's original commitment was simply to reduce pension age, and four such steps have now been taken. It is estimated that these changes will have brought in more than 50,000 new pensioners by next October.</P>
    <P>This provision affects not only the qualifying age for old age pension, both contributory and non-contributory, but also affects the maximum age up to which the short-term benefits such as disability benefit and unemployment benefit and assistance may be received.  Liability for payment of social insurance contributions will cease also at age 66 and, in order to prevent any undesirable repercussions which this might have in relation to pension entitlement, the section includes a number of &ldquo;saver&rdquo; clauses to protect the position of existing pensioners and persons who may be approaching 67 years.</P>
    <P>The reduction of pensionable age will also have the effect of enabling more persons to qualify for the benefits of the free travel, free electricity and free television licence schemes and it is expected that, as a result, a further 11,000 persons will be brought into those schemes this year.</P>
    <P>I want to mention at this point that <Col N="1203" /> the facilities of free travel and, where appropriate, free electricity allowance and free television licence, are being further extended to include approximately 10,000 recipients of the invalidity pension under the Social Welfare Acts.  These facilities will also be made available to persons in receipt of the disabled persons maintenance allowance, under the Health Acts, thus bringing a further 32,000 persons within the scheme from April next.</P>
    <P>The Department of Social Welfare are finalising plans with the Department of Health which will involve my Department taking over the administrative arrangements for the extension of this scheme to those in receipt of the Health Act allowances to which I have just referred.</P>
    <P>As in the case of pension age, this Government have given very special consideration to the development of the scheme of children's allowances. The view, widely held among professionals in the social services, that these allowances are of particular importance in meeting the financial needs of larger and poorer families has been fully accepted.  The arrangement whereby the children's allowances are payable to the mother has added significantly to their effectiveness in social policy and thus it is now an indispensable element in our overall approach.</P>
    <P>The rates of children's allowances are being increased with effect from July next.  The increase of 50p a month will apply to the second and each subsequent qualified child and the monthly rates of allowance will then be £2.30, as at present, for the first child, £4.10 for the second child, and £4.85 for each other qualified child.  For a four child family, therefore, the monthly allowance will be £16.10.</P>
    <P>Thus, children's allowance rates have been raised four times in the five budgets of the National Coalition.  This performance&mdash;reflecting as it does the very firm commitment of the Government to a crucial form of social provision&mdash;is in sharp contrast to what went before.</P>
    <P>In the ten years from 1963 to 1973, children's allowances were increased <Col N="1204" /> only three times.  Over that ten year period the amount payable monthly to a four child family rose from just £3 to £6.50&mdash;an increase of 118 per cent.  In the four-year period 1973 to 1977, the increases will have been 148 per cent, bringing the amount payable in July this year to £16.10.  The real increase in the past four years is also greater than that in the previous ten. Expenditure on children's allowances has risen from approximately £17 million in 1972-73 to just £50 million this year.  750,000 children will benefit from this year's increases.</P>
    <P>As an expression of the special concern of the Government for the position of elderly pensioners living alone, this Bill also provides for the payment of a special increase of £1.00 a week to social welfare pensioners who have reached pensionable age and who are living alone.  This special increase will apply, therefore, to old age pensions, both contributory and non-contributory, retirement pensions, widows contributory pensions, deserted wife's benefit, invalidity pensions and death benefit pensions under the Occupational Injuries Acts, where the age and living alone conditions are met.  In all these cases, including qualified non-contributory pensioners who are in receipt of payments below the maximum, the special increase of £1 a week will apply in full.</P>
    <P>This improvement in the pensions scheme reflects an acceptance of the case made by many of these working with old people about the particular problems of those who are alone and dependent on the personal rate of pension.  It will raise the basic rate of contributory old age pension for qualified pensioners to £14.90 a week, with the rate for pensioners over 80 years of age rising to £15.75 a week. Similarly, the maximum basic rate of non-contributory old age pension for qualified pensioners will be raised to £12.75 a week with the rate for those over 80 reaching £13.65 a week.  It is estimated that at least 30,000 pensioners will benefit from this provision.</P>
    <P>Section 3 of the Bill increases substantially the amount of earnings which may be disregarded for pension purposes in the case of blind persons.  The <Col N="1205" /> changes will be as follows: the disregard in the case of the claimant will be increased from £65 to £208; that for an adult dependant from £52 to £156; and that for each qualified child from £39 to £104.  Thus, the earnings disregarded as means in the case of a couple with two qualified children will be increased&mdash;by 193 per cent&mdash;from £195 to £572 per annum.</P>
    <P>The &ldquo;housekeeper&rdquo; allowance which is at present payable with unemployment assistance, disability benefit, unemployment benefit, injury benefit under the Occupational Injuries Acts and invalidity pension, to single men and widowers in respect of a woman who has the care of their children, will in future be payable in the case of single women, widows and deserted wives in similar circumstances.  This goes some way further towards eliminating inequality of treatment of women in the social welfare system and towards meeting the recommendations of the Commission on the Status of Women.  The sections of the Bill which provide for this change in relation to the various benefits concerned are 7, 16 and 21.</P>
    <P>The Bill, in section 6, modifies the long-standing requirement that in order to receive unemployment assistance widows and spinsters without a child dependant must have had 52 social insurance contributions paid in respect of them in the four years preceding the date of claim.  The number of contributions required to have been paid in such cases will henceforth be only 26.</P>
    <P>Following a review of the special scheme of unemployment assistance for smallholders the Government decided, as announced in the budget that the increases in the rates of unemployment assistance provided for in this Bill will not apply to smallholders whose rateable land valuation exceeds £10 but does not exceed £20 and whose means for unemployment assistance purposes are assessed on a notional basis by reference to their valuations.  Subsection (2) of section 4 of the Bill provides accordingly.</P>
    <P>Section 5 of the Bill provides that the notional method of assessing means from land of smallholders in the specified areas whose rateable land valuation <Col N="1206" /> exceeds £20 will no longer apply. These smallholders may, however, continue to be eligible for unemployment assistance but only on the basis of factual assessment of means as in the case of applicants generally for such assistance.  The Government's decision in this matter was largely influenced by the significant improvement in present levels of farm incomes and the highly concessionary multipliers used in the calculation of means having regard to these improved income levels.</P>
    <P>In practice, these measures will mean that landholders whose rateable valuations do not exceed £10 will benefit from the increased rates of unemployment assistance provided in section 4; but landholders whose rateable valuation lies between £10 and £20 and whose means are notionally assessed will remain on their present rates of unemployment assistance. Such persons may, however, if they feel it would be to their advantage, apply to have their means assessed on a factual basis in which case they would receive the current rate of payment appropriate to their means as so assessed.  In the case of smallholders whose rateable valuation exceeds £20, and whose means have been assessed on the notional basis, their title to unemployment assistance will cease as from 30th March, 1977, but such persons may establish title on the basis of their actual incomes.</P>
    <P>An estimated 12,600 smallholders, or over 57 per cent of the 22,000 involved, will receive the rate increases provided for in the Bill.  The 8,000 in the over £10 to £20 rateable valuation bracket will remain on their present rates of unemployment assistance and the remaining 1,400 whose rateable valuations are over £20 will cease, as from 30th March, 1977, to be entitled to unemployment assistance on the notional assessment basis.  These may, as I have already stated, qualify for such assistance on a factual assessment of their means.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the special provision contained in section 22 of the Bill is to extend the power which the Minister already has to make orders implementing reciprocal arrangements made with individual countries so as <Col N="1207" /> to enable him to make similar orders in the case of multilateral instruments affecting social security.  This provision is necessary to enable consideration to be given to the question of ratifying the European Convention on Social Security of the Council of Europe.</P>
    <P>The convention is designed to ensure a broad measure of coordination of the social security schemes of the member States which become contracting parties to the instrument and it covers all the usual benefits in the field of social security. In general, nationals of contracting parties are covered, as well as refugees and stateless persons resident in the territory of a contracting party who are or have been subject to the legislation of one or more contracting parties, together with the members of their families and their survivors.  The convention covers both the employed and the self-employed.</P>
    <P>The extra cost of the rates increases and of the other improvements in the social insurance schemes which are provided for in the Bill must be met out of the social insurance fund which is financed by insurance contributions from employers and employees with an annual subvention from the Exchequer.  This extra cost, including the cost of the further increases in pension and benefit rates in October next, will amount to almost £23.4 million in the current year.</P>
    <P>To this must be added the sum of about £3.26 million to cover the full year cost of the October, 1976, increases and some additional administration costs, bringing the total additional expenditure to be borne by the fund to about £26.66 million in the current year.  The Exchequer contribution towards this extra cost will amount to approximately £13.77 million leaving the balance, about £12.89 million to be met from increased contributions.</P>
    <P>This will require an increase of 63p in the rates of contribution which account for all benefits, of which the employer will be required to pay 42p and the employee 21p.  And here I should mention that the special increase <Col N="1208" /> of 31p in the social insurance contribution introduced in 1975 is being retained for a further twelve months to meet the cost of the high level of unemployment claims still being experienced.</P>
    <P>The ordinary rates of social insurance contributions, including the occupational injuries contribution, will thus be increased to £6.41 for men, of which the employer will pay £4.06 and the employee £2.35.  For women the new ordinary rate will be £6.30 of which the employer will pay £4.01 and the employee £2.29.  These rates do not include the health contribution, where that is payable, nor do they include redundancy contributions.</P>
    <P>The rates of voluntary contributions will be correspondingly increased to £1.20 a week at the low rate and £3.10 a week at the high rate&mdash;an increase of 10p and 27p respectively.</P>
    <P>The special voluntary contribution in respect of a certain category of insured person affected by the abolition of the remuneration limit from April, 1974, will be increased by 17p to £1.90 a week.</P>
    <P>All of the new contribution rates come into effect from Monday, 4th April, 1977.</P>
    <P>In line with the improvements in the general social insurance schemes, the Bill also provides, as I have stated, for corresponding increases in the benefit rates payable under the occupational injuries scheme.  However, it is not proposed on this occasion to increase the rates of contribution to the occupational injuries fund, which are payable by employers only.</P>
    <P>All of the increases in the rates of social welfare payments provided for in the Bill come into effect at the beginning of April with the exception of the increases in the rates of children's allowances which come into effect from 1st July.  The reduction in pensionable age will operate from 1st October and in that month also the further increase in rates which I have already mentioned will be implemented. The substantial nature of the overall improvements included in the Bill may be judged by the size of the financial commitment involved.  On the assistance side, including children's allowances and the extra cost in relation <Col N="1209" /> to the extension of the free travel, etc., schemes the cost in the current year is estimated at £19.732 million. On the social insurance side the additional cost to be borne by the social insurance fund comes to £26.656 million.</P>
    <P>The overall cost is, therefore, of the order of £46½ million towards which the Exchequer contribution will amount to some £33.5 million in the current year.</P>
    <P>I have already indicated the overall level of social welfare expenditure this year&mdash;about £520 million.  The Exchequer allocation for social welfare this year has reached £290 million, compared with the 1972-73 figure of about £92 million.</P>
    <P>These increases should be viewed in the light of the overall rise in Government social spending since 1973.  As a proportion of the total current budget, Exchequer spending on the social services in general has grown from 37 per cent to 42 per cent.  This increase&mdash;representing a rise in cash terms of almost £600 million&mdash;reflects the determination of the Government to fulfil its social policy commitments.</P>
    <P>Total social spending in 1977, including the gross expenditure figure for Social Welfare, has been estimated at about £1,070 million.  This is approximately 21 per cent of the projected gross national product for the year&mdash;it may be compared with a figure of 13½ per cent in 1972-73.</P>
    <P>I feel sure that the House will agree with me when I say that these wide-ranging improvements add up to a most important social welfare package and one which greatly strengthens our overall welfare provisions.  Significant advantages will accrue, under the terms of this Bill, to very large numbers of persons many of whom are in categories which merit the highest priority in any consideration of social policy development.</P>
    <P>I want, at this point, to refer briefly to the position of widows under the social welfare code.  I have already indicated the details of increases payable to widows under the terms of the Bill and I have spoken about the introduction of a housekeeper allowance for widows and others.  The <Col N="1210" /> personal rate of contributory widow's pension will have been increased by 125 per cent between 1973 and April, 1977&mdash;the corresponding rate of non-contributory widow's pension will have risen by 128 per cent.  In the case of a widow with two children the equivalent percentage increases are: 145 per cent in the case of a contributory pensioner, and 149 per cent for a non-contributory pensioner.</P>
    <P>There has been an amount of comment to the effect that the contributory widow's pension should be raised to the rate enjoyed by recipients of the contributory old age pension.  This argument ignores the fact that the conditions for receipt of the contributory old age pension require the pensioner to have worked for a long time in insurable employment to build up entitlement, whereas a widow can qualify for the contributory widow's pension on the basis of insurance contributions paid over a much shorter period of time either on her own or on her husband's insurance.</P>
    <P>It is often asserted also that the widows do not transfer to old age pension.  The position in this respect is that a contributory widow pensioner, like any other potential beneficiary, can build up a personal entitlement to the contributory old age pension by working in insurable employment, without any diminution of her widow's pension. Indeed, employed widow pensioners have an advantage over other workers in that since July, 1973, they do not even have to pay the employee's share of the weekly contribution.  On reaching old age pension age then, a widow is in the same position as other workers who must make application for a contributory old age pension.</P>
    <P>In the case of a widow in receipt of a non-contributory widow's pension that pension is payable only up to pensionable age.  At that stage the widow applies for the non-contributory old age pension which is payable at the same rate as the non-contributory widow's pension.</P>
    <P>By now, Deputies will have realised the scope and, indeed, the complexity of this Bill.  It will be noted also that while most of these changes will become  <Col N="1211" /> operative in April, others will be implemented in July and October.</P>
    <P>I consider it to be of the greatest importance, therefore, that beneficiaries and claimants should be assisted as far as possible in understanding all aspects of the changes which are being introduced. Accordingly, my Department are arranging for appropriate publicity at the time of the introduction of the new rates and improvements. The Department of Social Welfare booklet which has been welcomed for its clarity, despite the complex nature of its contents, will be published at the time of the April changes as usual and further appropriate publicity will be arranged prior to the changes due in July and October.</P>
    <P>This Bill has the purpose of implementing a most important aspect of the budget strategy.  Very clearly, the budget was designed to fulfil a number of vital policy objectives: stimulation of the economy, creation of new jobs, winding-down inflation and ensuring equity.  The budget was to be seen as a package and, in that package, these social welfare proposals were accorded a highly significant place.</P>
    <P>While of necessity, the central thrust of the budget was in the direction of economic growth and job opportunity the Government allocated a major share of scarce resources to the social services, and to social welfare in particular. Such balancing of the economic and social aspects of budget strategy is surely crucial if there is to be real success in facing up to our national problems.</P>
    <P>Social policy and economic policy cannot be divorced.  To suggest&mdash;as is suggested by some people who should know better, if one considers the positions they hold in society&mdash;that social advance must await some undefined future stage of economic achievement is dangerously wrong.  Not alone is it wrong in terms of national strategy but it is potentially harmful to the interests of those groups in our community who are most vulnerable.</P>
    <P>Unless we can plan our development so as to ensure harmonious social and economic development at all stages the problems of the poor, of the badly housed, of the victims of discrimination <Col N="1212" /> and of the unemployed will increase, even in periods of alleged progress. Those who claim they cannot see this point are either ignorant of the real facts of life or are deliberately pursuing vested sectional interests.</P>
    <P>I see this year's budget as an exercise in achieving just the right balance&mdash;between incentive and investment on the one hand, and justice and equity on the other.  The social welfare provisions of the budget are realistic and essential in this context. I reject the idea&mdash;put forward in some early comments on the budget&mdash;that there is a contradiction between incentive in the economic area and improvements in the social welfare system.  Both are necessary if the overall goals of national policy are to be met.</P>
    <P>In this connection, I want to repeat here an opinion that I have voiced on more than one occasion in the past. While it is most necessary and desirable that social welfare policy should be widely and critically debated, some of the criticism made in recent times has been both ill-informed and damaging.</P>
    <P>It does not seem to have occurred to very many of the critics&mdash;not least those in business circles&mdash;that constant repetition of certain unsubstantiated allegations and assertions about the social welfare system could only have the effect of undermining progress which is absolutely necessary in the interests of the least well-off.</P>
    <P>It is commonplace at times of economic difficulty to find convenient scapegoats and these, all too often, turn out to be the unemployed and the disadvantaged.  If those who consider that they have a legitimate case in respect of particular aspects of the social welfare system or of its application would only pause to ensure that their remarks do not take on the flavour of almost universal questioning of social welfare as such we could avoid great potential damage.  We must all remember that the fundamental purpose of the social welfare system is to provide for the needs of our fellow-citizens who cannot make that provision for themselves.  Social welfare is a basic responsibility of society.</P>
    <P>I welcome the recent study made by <Col N="1213" /> the director of the National Social Service Council in which he laid, once and for all, many of the more pernicious untruths about unemployment payments.  In that study it was shown, conclusively I believe, that the payments made to unemployed persons cannot in general be described as over-generous.  Indeed, when one considers the conclusion of the paper that, in the period in question, about 80 per cent of those on the live register received at most flat-rate unemployment benefit and that only 20 per cent were in receipt of pay-related benefit supplement&mdash;at an average of less than £7 a week&mdash;the conscientiousness or the good faith of many critics of social welfare must be called seriously into question.</P>
    <P>This Bill represents a further considerable stage in the development of our social welfare system.  It provides for very real advances in that system and it must, accordingly, recommend itself to the House.</P>
    <P>However, it would be a grave mistake to be in any way complacent about the situation in the field of social welfare.  Whatever may have been achieved a very great deal remains to be done.</P>
    <P>The task of bringing about a better distribution of the resources of the country in favour of those in need&mdash; and to provide a broader range of supports capable of helping many of these people to provide for themselves and for their dependants&mdash;must go on. In particular this is true in the case of those who must resort to the Social Welfare system by reason of unemployment.</P>
    <P>We must pause, even when considering the very significant progress made in the Budget, and reflected in this Bill, to remember that the proposed new level of the contributory old age pension is no more than £13.90 a week and that of the noncontributory old age pension, £11.75 a week.  We still have a long way to go.</P>
    <P>No matter which benefit or allowance one points to, the consideration of the real needs of individuals and families must bear heavily upon us. A budget such as this marks a significant further advance but it should also serve to point out for us all, the <Col N="1214" /> huge responsibility which rests on the community to provide for those in need and the tremendous challenge which this throws out to our whole economic and social structure.</P>
    <P>In facing up to this challenge we must seek at all times to be fully informed and to make an objective and honest assessment of the whole situation.  Good policy springs from good debate.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I can say that this Bill is a genuine attempt to make the most positive and relevant contribution which our resources permit to the development of the sort of social welfare system to which the Government have committed themselves.  Not alone has the necessity of maintaining the value of all social welfare payments been recognised, and acted upon, but the opportunity has been taken to further improve and strengthen the system in many important respects.</P>
    <P>The new elements introduced and the specific improvements brought about in the areas of pension age, children's allowances, invalidity, pensioners living alone, widows and so on will benefit many thousands of families and individuals around the country.  They prove that the nation cares and that the resources necessary to make that care a practical reality will be allocated.</P>
    <P>I now recommend the Bill to Dáil Éireann for speedy and favourable consideration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary at the beginning of his contribution departed from his script and urged that in the light of the need to implement this Bill speedily to provide for those who are in serious need, the Bill should receive a speedy passage through the House.  I concurred with the Parliamentary Secretary and agreed to his request.  It is as well to point out that by the nature of this Bill amendments are precluded.  I understand that when a Bill gives financial benefits.  such benefits cannot be interfered with by way of amendment. Naturally, if we intended to interfere, we would look for increases rather than decreases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary has <Col N="1215" /> outlined the progress which has been made by the Government on the social security front since the passage of the last similar Social Welfare Bill. The Fianna Fáil philosophy on the social welfare front is a good one.  We apologise to no one for our achievements in the area of social welfare. Giving credit where credit is due, the Coalition Government undoubtedly set up a number of new areas of entitlement, but after four-and-a-half years in office that might well be expected. Apart from setting up most of the existing social welfare structures, we have articulated continuously the real need and the real purpose of ensuring equity and justice to those entitled to the various benefits, assistance and support.  The Government are forever proudly boasting about the numbers in receipt of one form of entitlement or another, 930,000 in all, men, women and children.  I would remind the Government that of that 930,000 there are 118,000 people in receipt of benefit against their will.  These are the officially unemployed.  They would rather not be in receipt of the Government's goodwill by virtue of the entitlements they are receiving as unemployed persons. If the unofficial figures for the unemployed were included, it would probably amount to 930,000.  Who is to say that it would not amount to one million people who would come directly under social welfare entitlements?</P>
    <P>It is not good enough to suggest that the unemployment figures are unacceptable to those elected collectively, as responsible for their unemployment condition, and leave it at that.  The Government appear to believe that if they continue to use the unacceptability formula, the problem will go away. This is one of the great catch phrases of the Government in the recent past, apart from the new clichés, called bunching together and oligopoly mentioned in the last two days.  An expression of concern is one thing and performance is another.  We in Fianna Fáil believe and have articulated by way of a policy document that we have the solution to the problem of the unemployed.  We can prove this if given an opportunity to do so by the electorate <Col N="1216" /> in the next general election which cannot be too far distant.</P>
    <P>In relation to unemployment assistance, it is common case that there is a minority of people who are strident in their condemnation of those in receipt of unemployment assistance. If thousands are in receipt of any benefit or assistance, we will have critics and we will have abuses.  Whilst not attempting to justify those abuses, it is well to say that only a tiny minority of people engage in abuses. The vast majority of those in receipt of social aid are decent people who would rather have the dignity of having a job.  The minority harm the system, as any minority abusing any system invariably does.  The suggestion that the level of payments be reduced is unjust as that proposition if acted upon would penalise the honest majority who are willing and able to work but would not penalise the dishonest minority.  The dishonest minority are the people who, whilst receiving unemployment assistance, invariably have another job on the side. Those people are damaging the good name of the people who genuinely seek employment and cannot get it. The critics who are most strident in their condemnation of the system of unemployment assistance might temper their comments with clarity, charity and Christianity.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary referred to Mr. Murray of the National Social Services Council, and I, too, would like to pay tribute to the most helpful survey done by him.  As the Parliamentary Secretary pointed out, the survey quite clearly puts into perspective the problem and the burden being suffered by people in receipt of unemployment assistance. Mr. Murray in his article pointed out, by way of a number of examples, offences relating to unemployment benefit and assistance.  In 1973 there were 78 such offences, in 1974 there were 40, and in 1975, 12.  Offences relating to payment of unemployment contributions, for example, failure to stamp cards and so on, amounted to 324 in 1973, 349 in 1974 and 192 in 1975.  In addition in the financial years 1973, 1974, and 1975 the Department of Social Welfare recovered <Col N="1217" /> a total of £3.7 million in civil proceedings.  At the end of October, 1976, 42,000 people received unemployment assistance at the maximum rate; for example, a husband, wife and two children received £20.85 per week; husband, wife and six children £29.25 per week.  However, the most insidious aspect is that 62,000 children lived in families on unemployment assistance at the time of the production of those figures in October last year.  Critics of those in receipt of unemployment assistance should remember that those individuals have to support a wife and children. The Government might also reflect on that figure.</P>
    <P>It is as well to point out again and again that the large majority of those people who are unemployed want to work.  The Government cannot give them work&mdash;they are suffering from some sort of immovability on the work front and they just do not seem to be able to produce the goods as far as the unemployment situation is concerned. We have the school leavers coming along again apart from all those people who have been at work for most of their lives and now find themselves unemployed.  Will the Government articulate their attitude in relation to unemployment before the next election?  The unacceptability formula does not work any more and the facts about what happened in the time of Fianna Fáil do not work any more.  This Government have been in office for almost four years with the clear prospect of going for five years. Indeed, the Parliamentary Secretary himself, during the period of euphoria following the recent budget, said that in certain circumstances the Government could go on for seven years.</P>

      <P>I understand that would be the Parliamentary Secretary's expectation and nobody would deny that expectation to him.  However, we are talking about unemployment, and the Government's lack of commitment.  All the benefit to be produced by this Bill is no solution to any great degree to people who would rather be working on the shop floor than going along on a weekly basis to get what they are entitled to as citizens.  The problem of unemployment is the uncertainty about the future.  A man who has been employed from the age of 18 to the age of 42 or 43 may suddenly find himself in receipt of unemployment benefit or unemployment assistance.  If that man knew that he would be reemployed within three or six months there would be no problem but the uncertainty about the future begins to work on his mind and on the minds of his wife and children.</P>
      <P>The father is at home almost 24 hours of the day and the male of the species, whatever about the feminists amongst us, was never intended to be at home for that length of time; he was meant to be out working.  The wife is entitled to work but meantime the husband, who should be the breadwinner in the family, finds himself at home all day under the feet of his wife and children.  Frustration begins to grip and uncertainty is there all the time; the husband begins to fret and tensions begin to build up in the home.</P>
      <P>On a number of occasions to my own certain knowledge there have been family breakdowns brought about by the spectre and the reality of continuous unemployment.  All the social welfare benefit, all the cash in the world, is no substitute whatever for a stable home.  Apart from the danger of the marriage breaking down the children are out in the street, finally ending up before the courts and becoming drop-outs.  The cost to the country in the loss of one young person's working life is quite considerable spread over a period of 40 years. The unhappiness of joblessness has a major effect on marriage and on the family home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So when the Government temporise or prate about their achievements on <Col N="1219" /> the social welfare front we will give them credit for just about keeping up with the times in the context of the increases in benefits up to about two years ago.  I have here a set of statistics which will explode in the face of the Parliamentary Secretary and his senior colleagues in the Government. The fact is that many of the increases which he proposes to implement on 1st April will have been eroded within a number of weeks and months after their implementation.  These are proven figures.  I refer to the publication of social welfare entitlements in the media by way of advertisement. It is extraordinary that when the allegedly good news is to be produced it is published in advertisement form by the Department of Social Welfare but when the bad news appears, namely price increases, the reason for the non-publication is put down to the psychology of inflation and consequently they are not published.  On the one hand, the increases are advertised on the media, the advertisements being paid for of course by the Government, and, on the other hand, price rises which take place weekly are not published because they tell a different story.</P>
    <P>It is good to note the Parliamentary Secretary is making some progress in the area of non-discrimination against women.  For the past four years we have been calling for an end to this discrimination and there has been some progress.  There is amongst us a group which can be described as the new poor.  These people are in the lower income group, adrift in the wilderness between social welfare and voluntary health insurance.  In terms of income they are a few pounds above the social welfare limits and they are unable to pay for voluntary health insurance. I understand the latter will be going up again arising out of what happened here yesterday.  That is not inconsistent.  It is apparently Government policy to increase prices at every opportunity.  I do not know what the Government plans for this particular group, an extremely harassed group in our society.</P>
    <P>Deputy Haughey spoke yesterday about the middle income group.  In <Col N="1220" /> addition to that group there is the middle middle income group and the upper middle income group.  I am specifically relating my remarks to the lower middle income group, to those people on fixed incomes, living for the most part in urban areas, people who have sought to set themselves a decent standard of living and some degree of certainty in regard to the future from the point of view of their health.  The only way they can do that is through the medium of reasonable insurance contributions.  At the moment they are between the devil and the deep blue sea.  They do not know where they are going.  They are given no lead by the Government.  I make a particular appeal on their behalf.  Someone must come to their rescue as a matter of urgency.  They need guidance and they need hope. They are apparently the concern of no one.  We should concern ourselves with them.  The group is growing and their conditions are becoming worse and worse.</P>
    <P>There are a number of anomalies which concern us and, no doubt, concern the Parliamentary Secretary.  One such anomaly is the position of a widow whose old age pensioner husband dies.  She may be 59 or 60 with no prospect of remarriage.  All the entitlements she enjoyed while her husband was alive, such as free travel, free electricity, free television and so on, cease.  This appears to me to be very callous.  I do not say this in criticism of the Government or the civil servants.  It is a criticism of all of us.  I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will change the system and put an end to this insidious practice.  It would not cost anything to continue these entitlements because the administration is already there.</P>
    <P>With regard to the stamp, there is a hidden form of taxation involved here.  This is grossly unfair, particularly in view of the Government's announcement anent employment premiums. The employer should not be asked to pay £4.06 and the employee £2.35 as their share of the stamp, bringing the total cost to £6.41.  This increase occurs at a time when we are in what is probably the gravest unemployment situation this country has <Col N="1221" /> ever experienced, at a time when employers should be encouraged to provide more employment, at a time when the Government and we, in Opposition, are asking employers to take on employees as a matter of patriotic duty.</P>
    <P>However, the social insurance contributions have been increased, savagely in my opinion.  Whatever about last year, surely the Government must have given the matter some reasonable thought.  In an unemployment crisis situation the last thing that should be done is to increase the social insurance contributions.  The Government produced all sorts of premium gimmicks which we hope will work although we have the gravest doubt about their viability.  However, we will encourage them.  On the other hand, the Government knock that reasonably good idea of employment premiums by increasing the employers' amount of the contribution on the social insurance stamp to £4.06 and that of the employee to £2.35 in the case of the male worker. In the case of the female worker the ordinary rate will be £6.30, the employer will pay £4.01 and the employee £2.29.</P>
    <P>The difference between the two is minimal, 11p, and I do not think anybody could be too proud of that.  Our main burden of criticism in relation to the increase in social insurance contributions is the fact that the Government increase them in these difficult times.  I am certain the Parliamentary Secretary will have some pat answer but it cannot be good enough because on the one hand they are encouraging employers to take on workers but on the other they are discouraging them by increasing this taxation.  It is a form of taxation which is unfair at present.  Because of the economic condition of the country the contributions should have been allowed remain static.  We suggested in our economic emergency policy that the employers' contribution should be reduced to that of the level of the employees.  That would have resulted in a huge saving, but that suggestion has not been answered.</P>
    <P>On the question of the employees' contribution I understood there was to <Col N="1222" /> be a <i>quid pro quo</i> arising from the budget and the national wage agreement. I understood the employees would receive a certain tax concession, but a hidden tax is being imposed upon them in the form of an increase in the social insurance contributions. That is the reality of the situation. Were the employees aware of that when the negotiations for the national wage agreement were in progress? They were, obviously, because the budget was introduced some time before the agreement was concluded. There was not much fuss made about it and we know what the Government did following the acceptance of that agreement.</P>
    <P>We stated our views in relation to that on the motion dealing with prices on Tuesday and Wednesday.  We know the Government held back the report of the National Prices Commission, in spite of the explanation given by the Minister for Industry and Commerce about the delay.  We do not believe that Minister.  He is unbelievable.  He is incredible.  Nobody believes him any more.  This morning on radio he told us about the rate of inflaton, in relation to Great Britain, going down.  But would he explain that to some of the old age pensioners, widows and others about whom we are concerned this morning?  Those people are not concerned about what goes on in other countries.  They are concerned with what is happening to them here and all the lies produced by the Minister for Industry and Commerce will not satisfy them, and lies they are.  They are deliberate misleading lies.</P>

I can imagine thousands of people turning off the radio this morning when they heard the announcement by the Minister, because nobody believes him any more.  Last Sunday he spoke about the wonderful job done in relation to the control of prices but on Tuesday and Wednesday the most savage price increases ever to hit the country were approved by him.  The Minister and his pals in Government can draw up all the comparisons they want; but can they justify to the old age pensioners, the widows and so on, the price of a bag of coal, the price of bread, butter and jam and other necessities of life? If he thinks he is going to satisfy them by comparing prices here with those in other countries he is all wrong, he does not know what he is talking about.  Of course, the Minister for Industry and Commerce is in a totally different category to those I am speaking about.  He can afford things the people I am talking about cannot.</P>

      <P>I am becoming a little heated but that is the effect the Minister's performance on the radio this morning had on me.  I am sure it was the same with many thousands of people.  I reflect the views of many thousands of people who elected me to reflect their views.</P>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary should tell us when the tax cuts promised will become effective.  Will they become effective when the insurance contributions go up or will the employees have to pay the social insurance contributions for a period before they become effective?  While the employer can get an employment premium he must also pay out £4.06 per week per employee.  This in insane.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have been criticised by a number of media mandarins in recent years for not raising the question of the flat <Col N="1224" /> rate as against that of percentage increases in the social welfare code.  As I understand it, people at the bottom of the scale do better with flat rate increases while those at the upper end of the scale do better with percentage increases.  I take it that is the reason the Parliamentary Secretary has opted for the flat rate in order to assist those people at the bottom of the scale.  I am subject to correction on this because it is only a theory of mine.  The Parliamentary Secretary may be able to kill the suggestion that the percentage increase is better than the flat rate increase and he may tell us if my reading of the situation is correct.  I think it is the correct and proper one. If the flat rate increase helps those who are in receipt of the least amount of money then it is proper that that system be operated.</P>
    <P>Last Tuesday I had the privilege of speaking here in connection with price rises generally.  I placed on the record a number of figures which I said could not be refuted, and I repeat my statement now.  I pointed out that they were answerable in the sense that those who wished to answer them could do so but I said that their answers were incorrect.  The figures I gave were correct and cannot be refuted.</P>
    <P>In his speech the Minister referred to the budget and he gave himself and his colleagues a pat on the back towards the end of his statement.  His references to the budget covered more than two pages but I am satisfied that if the recent price increases had not occurred we would have had about ten pages devoted to the budget.  It would have been mentioned at the beginning of his speech rather than deposited somewhere near the end of the script.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary and the Government know that the budget was introduced with one objective in mind, namely, to win the next election for the Coalition.  The psephologists, the political watchers, all those associated with politics and the politicians themselves saw that budget as an election budget but suddenly a few weeks later it ceased to be that.  The gimmickry had to stop.  It ceased to be an election budget when the price rises <Col N="1225" /> were announced and now it is necessary for them to produce something out of the hat.  The political magicians have to go to work again.  The Parliamentary Secretary has a deserved reputation of concern and up to recently he was recognised as one of the more progressive people within the Government party.  Suddenly he finds that the rug has been pulled from under his feet.  He has also built his reputation on a situation which I think any Parliamentary Secretary would have to do, namely, to readjust upwards as often as possible the various entitlements of those in receipt of social welfare benefits.  We do not give him too much credit on that front but we accept that he is a person who is concerned. Now he is in the unfortunate situation that the rug is pulled from under him because of the savage price increases that have occurred in the recent past.</P>
    <P>With regard to the increases announced, the widow's noncontributory pension in 1973 was £6.50; in October, 1976, it was £10.75 and in April, 1977, it will be £11.75. We estimate that the effect of those increases will be wiped out on 15th April, 1977.  The widow's contributory pension was £6.60 in 1973; in October, 1976, it was £11.55 and in April, 1977, it will be £12.60.  Again, we estimate that the benefit will be eroded by 15th April, 1977.  With regard to urban unemployment assistance: in 1973, it was £5.35; in October, 1976, it was £8.90 and in April, 1977, it will be £10.20.  We estimate the benefit will be eroded by 31st March, 1977.</P>
    <P>Many other allowances will be similarly affected.  In this instance I would mention unemployment benefit, contributory old age pensions, noncontributory old age pensions, children's allowances, the allowance in respect of a deserted wife and maternity benefit.  The best we can do for the Parliamentary Secretary is to instance the children's allowances. The allowance was £2 in 1973, in October, 1976, it was £3.60 and it will be £4.10 in April, 1977.  We estimate that by 15th October, 1977, the benefit will be eroded.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>Despite all the Parliamentary Secretary's loud shouting about the increases the realities can be instanced by those who are concerned with them.  We are concerned with realities.  I assure the Parliamentary Secretary that if he is looking for dates he will get them.  He will get as many dates as he wants and as regularly as he wants.  We should be under no illusion about the Parliamentary Secretary's effort this morning to put me off my stride by quibbling about the very important figures I have produced.</P>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary said that a single person living on his or her own will be given £1.  Is this really the answer to the problem?  Is the Parliamentary Secretary aware of the value of the £?  Are he and his colleagues in Government aware of what £1 can or cannot buy?  Is the Parliamentary Secretary telling the House that £1 is a substitute for social concern?  Is the Parliamentary Secretary telling the House that £1 is the answer to the problem of a single person living alone?  I do not believe he is.  If he does not believe it why does he come along and insult them by offering this £1?</P>
      <P>Is the Parliamentary Secretary aware that but for the fact that we have social service people, social scientists and voluntary organisations the whole system would collapse around his ankles and that of others? Is the Parliamentary Secretary suggesting that the answer to the problem is to continue increasing the entitlement of the single person living on his or her own?  Surely there is a different answer.  The Parliamentary Secretary should know that the answer is, first of all, to identify the conditions under which those single people are living and to bring them in touch with the various communities.  I do not believe that you can physically lift people, apart from the unconstitutionality of it, from the single rooms they are living in against their will and place them in institutions or wherever the State wishes to place them.  I do not think the State can engage in anything like that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe if we are concerned about <Col N="1228" /> the social conditions of people living alone a comprehensive policy should be produced by the Government.  It is no substitute for concern to give those people £1.  They want help and they want all the assistance they can get.  If we did not have voluntary organisations visiting those people a lot of them would die without the community knowing about it until some weeks afterwards.  This has happened on several occasions and will continue to happen if the philosophy enshrined in the giving of £1 to a single person continues to prevail.  I do not suggest that that person should not get £1 but it is ludicrous to be boastful about giving a single person living alone £1.</P>
    <P>In regard to the widow and the old age pensioner living alone, is the Parliamentary Secretary aware that there is a condition known as hypothermia and that in one instance in Dublin not so long ago a single person living in appalling conditions was found actually washing his hands in boiling water because he could not feel it.  He could not afford the price of coal because it was too dear.  He could not afford anything else because it was outside his price range.  Is the Parliamentary Secretary aware of that? I am sure that particular case was brought to his attention.  If it was not I would be glad to do so.</P>
    <P>Is the Parliamentary Secretary aware that in the centre of this city there are organisations doing a wonderful job for people living alone.  Despite all their good deeds and the tributes we pay them, they are working under the most difficult financial conditions. The social services of the various community organisations in the city and in the urban areas are working under the most difficult financial restrictions. This is an appalling commentary on our society and the Government charged with running it for the time being.  The realities are there.</P>
    <P>I can give the Parliamentary Secretary many cases.  I can bring him to people in organisations who will point out the tragic financial circumstances under which they have to work.  I have been on those tours of misery.  If the Parliamentary Secretary will accept my <Col N="1229" /> invitation I would like to bring him on a few of them also.  I do not underestimate the Parliamentary Secretary's concern, but when we are spelling out something let us be truthful about it. Let us not triumphalise it.  We give £2 or £3 in social welfare entitlements but does that solve the problem?  It does not.  It is not even touching the surface of it.  There are far more deep-rooted problems in connection with poverty than money will answer. George Bernard Shaw said: &ldquo;Poverty does not produce unhappiness.  It produces degradation&rdquo;.  That quotation sums up what I have been saying.</P>

      <P>No, he took off to Britain, I am told, under the first Coalition Government and did not return.  There are many people in this country who are suffering from poverty and it would be as well when talking about poverty to talk about policies. Fianna Fáil have produced a number of policies which have contributed something to a general on-going discussion on social affairs.  There was one document on retirement and another on income-related pensions. There was an extraordinary response to the document on income-related pensions.  Both employers and trade unions sought it and were complimentary about it.  The document on retirement was also much sought after and there was equally favourable comment on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1230" /> It is our intention now to produce in the coming weeks a document on the care of the aged.  The mark of any civilisation is its attitude towards its old people.  Its standards can be measured by that.  The present society are doing a reasonably good job in this respect, but much more remains to be done.  Apart altogether from shouting loud and long about social welfare increases, which are not real increases by any means, the Government have an obligation, as a matter of urgency, to produce a comprehensive policy on home care for the aged.  There is no use telling the Opposition what they should or should not be doing.  The Opposition are powerless; the policies they produce are policies for the future, but they cannot implement these policies until they are in power.  In the meantime, the people who are in power have an obligation to produce such policies and put them into effect.  One thing the Parliamentary Secretary could make his name on would be a comprehensive policy on home care for the aged.  The poverty programmes are proceeding and far be it from me to enter into a discussion on the whole future of these programmes, which I understand is rather delicately balanced at the moment, but when those engaged on the poverty programmes settle down finally, as we all trust they will, let us hope they will examine the care of the aged and produce a comprehensive policy about which something will be done by the next Government.</P>
    <P>To return to people living on their own and to give some of the facts of life to the Parliamentary Secretary, who talks in percentages and percentage increases.  The people in receipt of social welfare benefit are not concerned about percentage increases. They are concerned about the purchasing power of the money available to them, how they can budget.  I have a long list of items the comparative prices of which I think it is worth while to put on the record of the House.  The list draws a comparison between the cost of items at February, 1973, and March, 1977.</P>

    <P>The following items come under the heading of meat: streaky rashers, sausages, stewing mutton and shoulder bacon.  These may not be meat to the Minister for Industry and Commerce but they are meat to the old age pensioner.  Generally it would be a low grade, non-pork sausage, full of crumbs.  What else can you offer them?  As Marie Antoinnette said when she was asked what she would give the starving French because there was no meat: &ldquo;Let them eat cake&rdquo;. The people are entitled to the best of meat, but the items I have mentioned are all they can afford.  Let me continue with the list:</P>

    <P>Despite these increases the Parliamentary Secretary boasts of giving an extra £1 per week.  On the 24th February last, as reported at column 370 of the Official Report, I asked the Minister for Agriculture:</P>
    <P>if there is any policy in relation to the distribution of EEC food surpluses to persons in receipt of old age pension and other categories where the need is identified within this country; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    <P>The Minister's reply was as follows:</P>
    <P>Community schemes for the sale <Col N="1232" /> of beef and butter at reduced prices to persons receiving social assistance lapsed in April, 1975 and January, 1976 respectively.  At the meeting of the Council of Ministers on the 14/15th February, I urged that such a social scheme should be reintroduced in the case of butter.  There is provision in certain Community regulations for the sale at reduced prices of intervention stocks to social institutions.</P>
    <P>The reply was worded badly but my reading of it was that the beef scheme lapsed in April, 1975 and the butter scheme in January, 1976.  I cannot see any reason for these worth-while schemes lapsing.  They had been introduced with the usual fanfare of trumpets but their lapse was not given any publicity.  In fairness to the Minister for Agriculture he indicated, in response to supplementaries from me, that he was doing his best to have the schemes introduced.  In circumstances in which meat and butter prices are so high as to render them prohibitive in so far as some social welfare recipients are concerned, the Parliamentary Secretary must realise the desirability of having those schemes reintroduced.  The butter and beef mountains should be made available at reduced prices to the disadvantaged sections of persons within the countries of the EEC.  Is it not extraordinary that Russia, which is outside the EEC, can obtain butter at reduced prices while our people are left in a degrading situation? All of this diplomatic humbug that is part of the EEC set up makes me ill.  Is it not time we stood up for ourselves as a nation and not continue to allow ourselves to be humiliated as has happened, for instance, in regard to fisheries?</P>

      <P>That is so but the Minister for Social Welfare informed me that when those schemes were in operation they were not availed of despite the fact that those who would qualify in respect of them were so notified by way of a note to that effect having been attached to their social welfare books.  It is time this Government came to terms with themselves and stood up for what they consider to be right in the national interest. During the past two or three years we have suffered national humiliation on a number of occasions.  The people who will suffer most as a result of the Government's inaction at international level are those in receipt of social welfare payment.  If the Government are prepared to stand up and be counted at international level they will have the support of the Opposition and of the nation.  They must be prepared to go out as Irishmen in their own right and put their foot down once and for all.  I cannot stand the compromise, especially when it is compromise on a national level.  The butter and beef schemes are matters of national importance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have dealt with the range of social welfare increases and I think I have been able to indicate how these increases will be nullified as a result of the increases in the various commodities. On every occasion possible we shall put on the record of the House these figures which are unanswerable. Also, we shall endeavour on every <Col N="1234" /> occasion possible between now and the general election to apprise the public, through the provincial newspapers, of the reality of the situation.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary may point percentagewise to the various increases but in real terms the story is very different.  There is no point in comparing the shopping basket cost in Brussels with the situation in Dublin. There is no consolation in such exercise so far as the old age pensioner, the widow and others on social welfare payments are concerned.

      <P>The cost of the ordinary necessities of life since 1973 will have increased by over 100 per cent in March, 1977.  In fairness to him the Parliamentary Secretary should not have fallen into that stupid trap.  It is a stupid, silly nonsense point being made by a Minister writhing in a price chaos of his own making.</P>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary in his script referred to the intended publication of the rates increases and the Parliamentary Secretary must take credit for that.  Whilst we can be politically critical of the reason for the publication of the rates increases in the newspapers, a supreme effort has been made over the years to make people aware of their entitlements in this summary of social insurance and assistance services.  For the average mind it is a readable, understandable document, although some confusion could arise in relation to some of the interpretations.  It is a very nice reference book which can be carried around in one's pocket and referred to.  It contains a nice index at the beginning.  I would urge the Parliamentary Secretary to consider the possibility of attaching an index to the front of his lengthy script for easy reference.  It is proper that people should be made aware of their entitlements. If social welfare increases can be published, price increases can be published in similar advertisements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I congratulate the Parliamentary Secretary and the officials in his Department for the efforts they make in the production of information.  They have been very good in that respect. These officials always treat inquiries in a most co-operative and helpful manner, with courtesy, speed and efficiency, and that makes life easier for all.  The Parliamentary Secretary spoke at length about the budget in glowing terms.  One would wonder if the script was prepared before the recent price increases.  I will not labour that point.  There is one droplet of wisdom in the Parliamentary Secretary's speech to which I fully subscribe. It could have been built into a rather nice essay on social concern. It is the only reference, apart from <Col N="1236" /> the mechanical readjustment upwards of social welfare increases.  The Parliamentary Secretary, nearing the conclusion of his 30-page script, made the point that:</P>
    <P>The task of bringing about a better distribution of the resources of the country in favour of those in need&mdash;and to provide a broader range of supports capable of helping many of these people to provide for themselves and for their dependants &mdash;must go on.</P>
    <P>This is a very important sentence. In addition to financial aid people want other types of support.  I genuinely hope that the Parliamentary Secretary will give some consideration to my call for the production of a comprehensive policy on home care for the aged in our society.  Voluntary organisations have done a wonderful job in this respect but they operate under financial constraints.  If they do not get financial support from the various Government agencies, they cannot work.  All the ingredients needed to make up a voluntary organisation are there, but without Government aid and with continuing hopeless price increases taking place, the condition of those most in need is becoming worse.</P>
    <P>That is why I emphasise this sentence in the Parliamentary Secretary's speech.  It is a ray of hope.  I interpret the broader range of support as being in addition to the adjustment upwards to meet the cost of living.  I hope they will introduce broader ranges of support to the social services, the social sciences, to the religious organisations, to the non-denominational organisations and so on.  They are all doing a wonderful job in the interests of their community regardless of the religion of the individual they are dealing with.  These people deserve support from the Government. The Parliamentary Secretary is not out of touch.  He is as aware as I am of all these things.  The Parliamentary Secretary is aware that certain organisations are doing a brilliant job in this country but they are not receiving the support they deserve.</P>
    <P>There is one small town&mdash;the people of Kilkenny will forgive me&mdash; where there is a shining example to other countries.  There is a wonderful <Col N="1237" /> community service in Kilkenny in which the young and the old involve themselves.  The Kilkenny Social Services Council have a lot to be proud of. They have a bishop there who has done much to articulate the concern of those of us who believe in what he is saying.  We would be associated with his statements from time to time as we are associated with the statements of other religious leaders on other occasions.</P>
    <P>Those who are critical of the young might consider the part young people play in the running of social service organisations and community organisations. I am talking about people between the ages of 16 and 25 and organisations like the Simon Community. This is the kind of organisation we want to help and, I believe, the large majority of the citizenry wish to help.  Some weeks ago RTE showed a wonderful programme, &ldquo;The Dark City&rdquo;.  It must have made people sit up and think and wonder if this sort of thing really goes on in the city of Dublin.  The reality of this programme is that it does.  This programme and other programmes such as the one on homosexuality are really worth while. Despite all the criticism they get from time to time, I have to support RTE on this type of programme.  Some of us have an unfortunate habit of pretending that a certain situation does not exist whereas, in fact, it does exist. We pretend that, if we do not think about it, it will go away.  The problems dealt with in those RTE programmes will not go away.  We will have to do the best we can to assist those people and accommodate them.  I should like to take this opportunity of congratulating RTE on the production of these programmes.  As a politician I would go into the next election standing over what I have said just now in relation to such programmes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LukeBelton" hpid="Mr. L. Belton Mr. L. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Andrews has spoken for quite a while without saying much about the Bill under consideration. However it was consoling to see towards the end of his speech that at least he was in total agreement with this booklet issued by the Department of Social Welfare, with the running of <Col N="1238" /> the Department and, in particular, with the courteous manner in which he has been received by the officials of that Department.  I should like to add my voice to his in praising the courteous and efficient manner in which I have always been received by this Department. However, Deputy Andrews could find only one paragraph in this 30-page document with which he was in total agreement.  I find myself in complete agreement with the entire document. We can agree to differ on this.</P>
      <P>This Bill emphasises the concern and the genuine desire of the present Government, and particularly of the Parliamentary Secretary, to look after and care for the needs of the less well-off sections of our community. If praise were needed for the Parliamentary Secretary and his work in this field, it is evident from the fact that this is the fifth social welfare budget that has been introduced since the National Coalition came into office and the eleventh piece of legislation on social welfare which has been introduced.  He has brought this Department from being a mere talking shop to one of real concern where action is foremost and where the needs of the people are looked after in the best possible manner.  The Parliamentary Secretary is under no illusion about the task facing him in the Department of Social Welfare.  However, it is consoling to think of the progress that has been made in a time of financial recession almost unparalleled in the history of the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not wish to speak for very long because I know that the Parliamentary Secretary is anxious to have this Bill completed at the earliest possible time, but I wish to remind the Opposition of some of the provisions in this Bill. The increases involved are noteworthy, particularly when one bears in mind that those people also received a 15 per cent increase last October.  In the period between July, 1973, and April, 1977, the personal rates of payment under the social insurance scheme will have increased by between 120 per cent and 142 per cent; payment in respect of dependants will have increased by between 163 per cent and 195 per cent; payments under social assistance will have increased by <Col N="1239" /> between 124 per cent and 155 per cent; child dependant allowances will have risen by between 174 per cent and 220 per cent.  Even if we were to accept, which we do not, the figure given by Fianna Fáil of the percentage increases in the cost of living over this period which is generally regarded, according to their figures, as being up to 90 per cent, the increases in social welfare have more than kept in line. Even the Opposition will have to admit this.</P>
    <P>If we contrast the increases given by the present Government with those given by the Fianna Fáil Government we find that in their last period of office between 1969 and 1973 the contributory old age pension for a couple both over pension age rose from £6.63 to £10.35, a rise of 11.5 per cent.  The increase for a similar couple under the present Government in four years is 20 per cent.</P>
    <P>The same is true about most other payments under social welfare.  The maximum rate of non-contributory old age and blind pensions has been increased from £10.75 to £11.75 for persons under 80 and from £11.60 to £12.65 for persons over 80.  The maximum weekly payment for a dependent spouse will be raised from the October, 1976, level of £5.35 to £5.85. The overall weekly payment for an old age non-contributory pensioner with a dependent spouse will be increased to £16.10 and to £17.60 where the pensioner is 80 years or over.  There are also increases in respect of qualified children, an increase of 25p to £3.15 for the first two and 20p to £2.40 for each additional child.  There is a corresponding increase for adult dependants and qualified children.</P>
    <P>In every sphere of social welfare the increases far outstrip anything ever envisaged by Fianna Fáil.  Not alone have the Government increased social welfare benefits but they have also reduced the pension age.  This is of very considerable importance.  The Parliamentary Secretary referred to the fact that Fianna Fáil had never reduced the age between 1957 and 1973.  One can go further back and say that, when they first came into office in 1932, they <Col N="1240" /> never decreased the age limit for old age pensions, not by a single day.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>We never reduced the pensions either.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LukeBelton" hpid="Mr. L. Belton Mr. L. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree.  In the early 1940s Fianna Fáil talked about reducing the age to 65.  As I said in the debate on the budget, I knew a very well-known backbencher in Fianna Fáil who made the same speech at every chapel gate.  He talked of Fianna Fáil removing the land annuities, abolishing the oath and promising to reduce the age for old age pensions to 65.  He used to say they could not do everything at once but, if they got time, they would do all these things.  They got plenty of time, but they never reduced the age for old age pensions, not by a single day.</P>
      <P>We could go on talking about the various increases and drawing parallels. I would like to refer to children's allowances.  A very worthy change has been made by the present Government where children's allowances are concerned.  The mother now receives the allowance.  This is a step in the right direction.  We know the allowances have been increased considerably and they are of help to the mother of a large family finding it difficult to make ends meet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Andrews spoke at length about the extra £1 for the pensioner living alone.  He wondered what use it would be to an old age pensioner. I agree it is not a great deal but, again, it is a step in the right direction. He must admit this is something Fianna Fáil never dreamt of.  I am glad he spoke sympathetically about old age pensioners.  The Ceann Comhairle drew his attention to the fact that he was wandering away from the Bill and Deputy Andrews retorted: &ldquo;I am talking about matters which concern old age pensioners.  I am talking about meat, streaky rashers, bacon and sausages&rdquo;.  Fianna Fáil used to lead us to believe that old age pensioners could not afford anything better than bread and tea, not even butter for their bread.  At least he now admits that the price of meat, streaky rashers, bacon and sausages is of concern to <Col N="1241" /> the old age pensioner and I am sure he will admit it also is a step in the right direction if old age pensioners are now receiving sufficient to be able to provide themselves with these necessities. He also talked about the non-credibility of the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  He said no one believes him any more.</P>

He said they have introduced policies and statements and I think he will admit they have been much more prolific in introducing documents and statements since they went into Opposition than they ever were during their term in Government.  They produced their rates policy in a matter of days, if not hours, when they were in the throes of a general election.  Now Deputy Andrews knows each and everyone of us was using every minute at that time to knock on every door, but Fianna Fáil were able to find time to produce a rates policy.</P>

      <P>I suppose that is what they will be.  I do not think there is much hope of their returning to office. The people are not so foolish as to believe that a Government which had two uninterrupted periods of 16 years on each occasion in office and could make no headway and no progress will achieve anything more than they failed to achieve in those two uninterrupted periods.  Surely they do not think the people will be deceived by their promises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill is yet more evidence of the Government's genuine desire to look after the less well off sections in our community.  The Government have made great strides and I have no doubt that when they are returned to power after the next general election they will continue their good work.  Fianna Fáil will be left in the wilderness to formulate programmes and policies and issue statements in the hope that some day they will be returned to power. <Col N="1243" /> I agree with the Parliamentary Secretary that much has been achieved and I accept that the Government are conscious that much still remains to be done.  I am confident that the Government will continue this good work.</P>

      <P>In County Galway we have a habit of making large sheep cocks and when the sheep have eaten almost all the cock we prop the remainder.  In this case the Parliamentary Secretary is trying to prop up the unfortunate poor man against inflation.  I congratulate him on making a fairly decent effort to do that in this Bill.  It is not my intention to criticise the Bill because it was not introduced by the Opposition although most of us realise that the benefits referred to in it will be eroded when the people receive them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know where the Parliamentary Secretary is going to finish with his job because the most important thing for us at present is to take people off social welfare.  Nobody wants to be on social welfare and we are all aware that irrespective of what Government are in office social welfare will have to be given to a cetain section of the community.  There are too many people in receipt of social welfare and for this reason the Government should do everything possible to provide employment for them.  The Parliamentary Secretary has told us of his intention to give £1 per week to old age pensioners and those living alone but that will not be of much use.  I do not like to hear of people living alone and during the recent bad weather many such people died because they had no one to care for them.  I cannot understand why any Government would not give a decent allowance to relatives to keep their people out of hospitals and institutions.  I accept that an increase is being granted to those who care for bed-ridden pensioners but if I take a relative out of an institution who is not bed-ridden I am not paid any allowance.  A person taken out of an institution by a person other than a relative is paid an allowance.  I am sure Members are tired listening to me complaining about this but I will <Col N="1244" /> keep at it until I get results.  That is one of the most unjust things in the country.  I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will look into this matter.  If a generous allowance was given to those who keep aged people we would have fewer living alone and more accommodation available in hospitals and institutions.  It costs a lot of money to keep people in hospitals and institutions. This is a matter of great concern to people living in rural areas.</P>
    <P>At Question Time yesterday I asked about farmers on holdings from £10 to £20 valuation on the notional system getting no increase under this Bill.  Last year the Parliamentary Secretary changed the multiplier and gave everybody entitled to social welfare whatever was coming to him but this year he did not change the multiplier from £10 to £20 or give him any increase.  I accept that the Parliamentary Secretary is concerned but he does not understand farming and I do not blame him for that.  He told us that because farm incomes have improved he did not do this but is he aware that small farmers are in a bad state?  Farmers with 15 acres could have a valuation of £11 but they get no increase.  The Parliamentary Secretary may state that such farmers could go on the factual assessment of their means but how is this assessed?  Is it done on the same basis as the old age pension?  I asked questions yesterday about the assessment by the Departments of Health and Social Welfare and pointed out that they contradicted each other.  For that reason I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to tell me how a factual income is assessed.  That is an estimated income while the other is a cash income.</P>
    <P>A farmer with ten acres may have seven sheep, two cows and a few calves and I should like to know if all possibilities are taken into account when assessing his income.  If such a farmer loses a cow as a result of brucellosis or TB he will not be given anything near the replacement value of the animal.  That farmer cannot expand his holding because he has not the money and the result is that he is totally dependent on social welfare. <Col N="1245" /> If such farmers were given incentives to improve their holdings I would approve because they are not anxious to draw social welfare forever.  In my view the small farm community are being phased out because all the directives from the EEC are geared towards helping farmers with big holdings.</P>
    <P>At my request a directive was changed so that potential development farmers could get lands but when I inquired as to who qualified as a potential development farmer I was told that a farmer with a 40-acre holding did not qualify.  Farmers with a valuation of £25 or less might be called the middle income group but they are excluded from all benefits. Unless there is some change in the land policy of the EEC they will not get grants for development.  I am putting this point to the Parliamentary Secretary because I know he is concerned about those in the lower income group.  I want to see everyone having a decent standard of living.</P>
    <P>There is much talk about an increase in farmers' incomes but it is no use to them if they have not got stock.  I was surprised that people with a valuation of between £10 and £20 will not get the increases being given to others. Let the Government alter the multiplier as they did last year but let them not penalise people who are poor.</P>
    <P>I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to study carefully how to assess the factual income of farmers. Theoretical farming is fine but there are far too many people with books telling farmers what to do.  Let them try to put what they preach into practice and see what happens.  For instance, they make no allowance for the fact that a herd may be affected by disease.  If a farmer has only two cows and one dies, where will he get £300 or £400 to buy another cow?  At one time the cost of a cow was £20. I did not expect that the small farmers would be penalised, as has happened.</P>
    <P>People in cities and in the country would prefer to have employment.  I do not think anyone wants to receive social welfare benefit.  Many young people have told me they hate the situation they are in where they have <Col N="1246" /> to go to the labour exchange.  What they want are jobs.  If a small farmer got a grant to develop his farm he would much prefer that.  However, at the moment he needs all the assistance he can get to survive.  I am sure that the Parliamentary Secretary would agree with me when I praise our young people.  There is an old saying &ldquo;We may have good men but we'll never have better&rdquo;.  The young people today have a social conscience; they look after old peop'e and they help the community generally.  Outwardly they may not appear as good as us when we were young, but I am convinced they have proved themselves 100 per cent Christian. Even though I am a person of another generation I mix with young people quite a lot and I have nothing but praise for them.  Irrespective of whatever Government are in power, their greatest task is to give employment to the people rather than social welfare benefits.  The situation may not be quite so bad in the country because unemployed people can often help their neighbours on their farms.  However, it is very bad in towns where young people with the leaving certificate have no prospect of work.  Boys can get social welfare assistance but this is not available to girls.  This is completely wrong.  Those young people have nothing to do all day and this is the breeding ground of violence.</P>
    <P>I ask speakers on both sides of the House to stop talking about what happened in 1973 and what is happening now.  As the last speaker pointed out, we have never had such inflation.  Prices have gone completely out of control and the Parliamentary Secretary has a very difficult job to try to keep benefits in line with them.  The only solution is to provide employment and thereby reduce the cost of social welfare.  I want to impress on the Parliamentary Secretary that the vast majority of people do not want to draw social welfare.  All they want is work.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary to reconsider the decision made with regard to small farmers with a valuation of £10 to £20.  Will he give us some indication of how he intends to assess their income?  When a small farmer applies for the old age pension, an officer from the Department of <Col N="1247" /> Social Welfare assesses the income from the farm.  Will the same system apply in assessing the factual income?</P>
    <P>With regard to the prescribed relative allowance, the State would gain considerably if it paid a reasonable allowance.  The cost of maintaining old people in a home would be much higher than any allowance paid to the relatives.  With regard to those old age pensioners who have to go to a county home, I cannot understand why the major part of their old age pension is taken from them.  This does not apply where a person has a medical card. If I were the Parliamentary Secretary I would increase the allowance payable to relatives to look after elderly people in their own homes.  The Exchequer would benefit enormously. The Parliamentary Secretary should take the gamble, at least for one year. We all know of cases at present where married women who have a few children have to send their parents or parents-in-law into county homes.  This might not happen if a reasonable allowance were paid.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary mentioned the question of a flat rate.  I cannot understand how a trade unionist or a member of the Labour Party would opt for anything else.  I do not see how anybody with a social conscience could do otherwise.  All the increases in social welfare benefits were necessary because of inflation.  We are also getting an increase.  We are very high up in the scale.  We will get £8 and the man much further down in the scale gets £4.  How can anybody justify that?  The same applies to social welfare increases.  I am totally against percentage increases.  When I say that I do not say that everybody should be on the same salary.  That cannot be because people are doing different jobs and must be paid for their particular jobs.  If an increase in social welfare is given to meet the cost of living why should one man who is earning £100 get £4 a week, twice as much as the man who is earning less even though they are both doing the same job?  Is the better paid man given the larger increase to buy a better car?  Is it to buy brandy instead of a bottle of stout?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1248" /> I do not stand up in the House to complain unnecessarily about things. When two politicians are expected to be on television very few people listen to them.  Before I ever entered polities I heard people saying &ldquo;What can one expect when they are on?  One of them will attack the other.  When one of them says something good they are left on but when one says something derogatory about the other man they are turned off.  Most people expect politicians to attack each other.  We hear talk about promises at election time.  I do not know if many people will listen to them.  You cannot give the so-called soap-box promises any longer.  You must deliver the goods.</P>
    <P>I welcome the sections of the Bill which give small sums of money here and there.  I believe the Parliamentary Secretary will agree that a lot of it has been eroded since the increases were announced.  He has a job to try to keep up with inflation.  I do not like people standing up and talking about what happened in 1973 or some other year.  We are in a different ball game now.  We are in Europe and prices are going up every day.  I do not know why no attempt is made within the European Community to devise a scheme to distribute surplus butter and beef in the European Community. There are many poor in the Community as well as outside it.  When prices go up we have more poor because there are many people who cannot afford to buy food.  When I visited Paris a long time before we entered the EEC I found that their prices were much higher than ours.  Many people in the poor areas of Paris could not buy the goods on offer.</P>
    <P>I would like to congratulate the Department of Social Welfare on the booklet&mdash;it was referred to by some Deputies&mdash;which they have issued.  I want to express my appreciation of the courtesy of the Parliamentary Secretary and his officials.  I believe he gets as many letters from me as he does from any other Deputy.  The Department may be a bit slow in replying. I am sure they must receive a very large number of letters every day and this causes delay in replying.</P>
    <P>The Bill is selective as far as small farmers are concerned.  I believe the <Col N="1249" /> people in the city do not understand the small farmers.  I do not understand how people can live in Dublin.  I have been travelling up and down to Dublin for a long time.  I was brought up with small farmers and I understand them. The people in Dublin are ignorant of the way of life of people in the country. I ask the Parliamentary Secretary and other Dublin Deputies to try to understand that when the price of livestock is increased if a small farmer wants to get an extra animal he cannot get it.  The price of land is too high for many of those small farmers.  If something revolutionary is not done in regard to land settlement the small man will be lost.  I am afraid he will be on social welfare for a long time unless we have a dynamic land policy. I have criticised what I consider should be criticised in this Bill.</P>

      <P>I would like to thank Deputy Andrews for his agreement to give all Stages of this Bill today and his ready recognition of the desirability of having it passed as quickly as possible.  It is a little difficult to reply to this debate, not on the aspects relating to the Bill but because so much was said, particularly by Deputy Andrews, that had no relationship to the Bill.  Deputy Andrews has a great tendency to do this on every Social Welfare Bill.  If a stranger came into the House during Deputy Andrews's contribution he would be forgiven for thinking that I was the Taoiseach and that this was an Adjournment Debate.  He covered the Department of Agriculture, the Department of Labour, the Department of Industry and Commerce, the Department of Health, the Department of Foreign Affairs and so forth.  It would be extremely difficult to reply to many of the issues that were raised by Deputy Andrews which were outside the scope of the Bill.  It is also only fair to say that, with one or two exceptions, when Deputy Andrews stuck to the Bill he was very constructive and made what I considered a reasonable contribution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are one or two things which need reply.  Before going on to reply to them in some detail I would like to <Col N="1250" /> thank Deputy Andrews and the other Deputies who contributed, Deputy Belton and Deputy Callanan, for the tribute they paid to the officials of the Department of Social Welfare.  I wholeheartedly agree with their expression of appreciation to the officials for the very difficult and heavy task they perform day in, day out.  I am grateful to Deputies who have spoken on the Second Stage for the recognition of the service performed for the citizens of this country by people in the civil service and particularly in this case by those in the Department of Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>I shall deal as briefly as possible with some of the points raised.  One of the most important matters that I think must be clarified is the consistent, blatant attempt by Deputy Andrews and other Fianna Fáil spokesmen to distort the true situation as regards the increases in social welfare by this Administration.  I think Deputy Andrews clearly indicated this morning that he was aware of this distortion, that it was a deliberate distortion, that it was a thought-out disortion of the facts, when he refused point blank to identify the date in 1973 in respect of which he was making a comparison.  It is extremely important that the public should know what this distortion is when they are trying to compare what has been done and what is being done, and surely the people are entitled to do that.</P>
    <P>Deputy Andrews was using a base figure for 1973 but he could not identify the date in 1973, but I will identify it.  It was a date in 1973 that was after the first budget that was brought in by this Administration, and he was trying to ignore the increases that were provided in that and to have people believe what is factually incorrect.</P>
    <P>The legitimate comparison is between the figures that were there as a direct result of a budget and an action taken by Fianna Fáil, and the present day, not ignoring the first budget containing the increased benefits brought in by this Administration.  This distortion of fact is unworthy of Deputy Andrews.  Possibly some of the think-tank or the backroom boys think this <Col N="1251" /> is a very clever device.  I do not think it is clever to try to deceive the Irish people.  I do not think Deputy Andrews or any other elected representative should lend himself to such distortion.  We all present our case as favourably as possible.  I am not objecting to that, but I do not think we have the right to mislead the people by distorting the facts, and it is time it came to an end.</P>
    <P>Unemployment was spoken about at great length by Deputy Andrews.  I thought Deputy Andrews's contribution on unemployment was truthful and courageous in that it stated what he knows to be the facts about unemployed people; that they are not out to abuse the social welfare system.  By that he has not sought&mdash;and I think this should be publicly recognised and appreciated by me&mdash;to jump on the bandwagon which has been mounted by certain sections of our community who have no personal experience and never will have any personal experience of being unemployed.  He has stated consistently what he knows the position of the unemployed to be. These people are not spongers or layabouts. They are victims of the economic system and the form of society that exists in this country.  I duly acknowledge the fact that Deputy Andrews has not succumbed to the temptation to which other politicians have yielded, to jump on the bandwagon of interested employer groups who have sought to malign these people who are unfortunate enough to find themselves unemployed.</P>
    <P>However, if a stranger came into the House and heard Deputy Andrews talk about unemployment he would think that unemployment was a new thing in Ireland, that Ireland never knew what unemployment was until this Coalition came into being.  Deputy Andrews referred to a figure of approximately 118,000.  It is somewhat less than that, but his figure is a reasonable approximation. It is about 118,000 now in this country; it is 1,400,000 in Great Britain.</P>
    <P>I would like to bring the Deputy back to a period not too long ago, <Col N="1252" /> January, 1973, after 16 consecutive years of Fianna Fáil rule.  Let us see where is the concern about unemployment. He talked about unacceptability. In January, 1973, the registered published figure for unemployment was 76.000 persons, approximately 7 per cent.  What was it in Great Britain at the time?  What was it in the rest of Europe?  It was practically nil because it was during a boom period.  All through those years from the sixties up to late 1973 full employment was enjoyed by all the citizens of the rest of Europe with the possible exception of Spain and some parts of southern Italy.  As I say, in this country it was 7 per cent after 16 consecutive years of Fianna Fáil rule right through a boom period.</P>
    <P>What was Fianna Fáil's attitude towards the unemployed?  Seven per cent was so acceptable that it was not even a major issue in the general election that was held in 1973.  Therefore, this new-found concern by Fianna Fáil spokesmen about the rate of unemployment is a little hard to take. Deputy Andrews brought us to task on this side of the House for talking about unacceptability.  118.000 is unacceptable to me, but 76,000.  7 per cent of our people, is equally unacceptable to me and other Deputies on this side of the House.</P>
    <P>Another question raised by Deputy Andrews was that the increased price of the stamp put a tremendous burden on employers and workers.  At one stage Deputy Andrews implied that had workers known they were going to be charged on extra 21p for their stamp it might have coloured their attitude towards the national wage agreement. The fact is that the total increase in the cost of the stamp was made known this year in the budget.  So far as I am aware there is no precedent for that but it was revealed deliberately this year so that people would not make the type of charge that Deputy Andrews sought to make this morning and in order that both employers and workers would know to the last penny what was to be the increase.</P>
    <P>Deputy Andrews spoke of a tremendous burden and disincentive to employers <Col N="1253" /> in regard to engaging extra workers or even in keeping the numbers they had already because of this increase of 42p.  In fairness to the employers, they seem to be more enlightened and concerned in this respect than are Fianna Fáil.  I say this because some months ago and before the budget the employers indicated during the national wage talks that they recognised the necessity for some increase in the price of the stamp and they asked that this increase be kept within reason.  So far as I know they mentioned an increase in the region of 39p in relation to the employer.  The figure that emerged finally was 42p&mdash;a very small difference &mdash;and I have not heard of complaints from the employers in that respect.</P>
    <P>While I make that point, I regard it as only fair to say that I do not consider our system of financing social welfare to be the best possible.  There are other systems and, as I indicated here before, a departmental committee are examining this question.  I would hope for a departure from the flat rate contribution payment because this militates against the lower paid workers.  Consequently, it is not a fair system.  However, the argument in this respect is different from the kind of argument put forward today by Deputy Andrews when he referred to the desirability of flat-rate increases in social welfare.  I am confining my remarks strictly to the sphere of social welfare in this regard. Percentage increases or flat-rate increases in other spheres are a different matter.  On the one hand Fianna Fáil people are calling for the indexation of social welfare payments while on the other hand we have had this morning from Deputies Andrews and Callanan a call for flat-rate increases across the board.  If one is on the maximum rate &mdash;and this refers only to non-contributory benefits&mdash;he gets the full increase. Any reduction would be related strictly to another source of income so where is the equity in calling for flat-rate increases in those circumstances?</P>
    <P>Deputy Andrews indicated that he was very impressed by one sentence in my 30-page speech.  He was referring to the question of the desirability of a <Col N="1254" /> policy of redistribution in order that the most needy sections might be helped.  I am pleased that the Deputy highlighted this aspect of the speech but I am amazed that he should adopt this attitude since I have not noticed anything in either the policies or the actions of Fianna Fáil that would lead me to believe that party to be in agreement with Deputy Andrews on this question.</P>
    <P>Let us consider the question of redistribution so that we might ascertain the degree of commitment of either Deputy Andrews or of Fianna Fáil as a whole on this issue.  The Exchequer can only redistribute something that has accrued to it.  In other words, to make possible redistribution, wealth must be taken from those who have a lot and given to those who have little. During the first 18 months of this Administration the Minister for Finance, in his efforts to effect certain changes in our tax structure, had to contend with filibuster after filibuster on the part of Fianna Fáil.  For example, they opposed him bitterly regarding the introduction of the wealth tax.  They fought that legislation line by line.  Despite this attitude, Deputy Andrews tells me that the only part of my entire speech which impressed him was the one paragraph relating to the necessity and the desirability of redistribution.</P>
    <P>It is extremely difficult, if not impossible, to reconcile this attitude with the actions, the votes and the contributions of Fianna Fáil Deputies in regard to the wealth tax, the capital acquisitions tax and so on.  We can only conclude that so far as Fianna Fáil are concerned policy making, not only in this area, but in any other, is a matter of waiting to see which way the political wind is blowing, not only generally but from day to day.  It would be a help to us and to the Irish people as a whole if Fianna Fáil were to spell out clearly their policy in respect of social welfare.  I have asked for this repeatedly.  They might tell us, too, what are their proposals for raising the money that would be necessary to implement their proposed policy. We have spelled out clearly what our policy is.  Not only have we stated <Col N="1255" /> where the money will come from but we have provided that money.  Surely it is a reasonable request, not from me personally but from the electorate, that Fianna Fáil should tell them what their policy is in relation to social welfare and how they are going to finance it.  I cannot understand it.  I cannot get any glimmer as to what their policy is.  I cannot understand how they can claim to be committed to redistribution to any extent, when one judges the performance of their party in relation to the very desirable, necessary and just changes in the taxation laws that they so bitterly opposed.</P>
    <P>I spoke at considerable length when I introduced this Bill.  Deputy Andrews was good enough to co-operate and agree to all Stages.  The progress that has been made in the last four years in social welfare, whether it is moneywise, percentagewise or in real terms, is there for anyone to see.  It is not a question of speculation.  It need not be a matter of argument between Deputy Andrews and me.  It is there for all to see, and it speaks for itself.  As I said, we have no reason to be complacent about the area of social welfare.  We have come a considerable way over the last four years, but we have a very long way to go.  We can only go that long way if there is a true realisation by the Irish people, and by the various strong influential sections of our people, that it cannot be done by lip service or on the cheap.  There must be a true commitment to alleviating the very many social ills that exist in our country. It can only be done if people are prepared to pay for it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Callanan asked a question about farmer's dole.  No one, including smallholders, is being denied unemployment assistance.  If a man, by changes that are included in this Bill, feels that he would qualify under a factual assessment, he has the right to opt for that assessment.  There is no departure from the present method of assessing the means of a farmer.  This method has been employed for farmers over a considerable number of years.  There are 6,000 or 7,000 farmers who at all times have asked <Col N="1256" /> to be factually assessed.  The same method of assessment will be applied to any farmer who feels he has been unjustly treated under the change in the notional system.  Any objective observer would agree that the administration of the smallholders' scheme needed substantial rationalisation.  A start was made in last year's budget.

      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary may have dealt with section 13 when I was absent.  I apologise for my absence for the first ten minutes of his contribution.</P>
      <P>I referred before to the anomaly that arises when a pensioner dies and leaves a widow who is not of pensionable age.  The reduction of the qualifying age for pension purposes puts the widow in a more advantageous position.  Can the Parliamentary Secretary say why the widow in those circumstances should have free electricity, free television and free travel taken away from her?  The Parliamentary Secretary will agree that when her husband was living she had the benefit of all that, but now when her husband has died and she needs it most it has been taken away.</P>

      <P>She had the benefit of them so far as they were available on the basis of her husband's qualification for a pension that was payable to him.  I accept to some extent that there are certain cases where this could cause some hardships, but I cannot take it that universally widows would be caused hardship by this. These concessions can only be given where they are attached to a particular pension.  When the pension ceases in law to be payable it is not possible to continue with the concessions.  Up to the last couple of years, where a person was in receipt of a social welfare payment and died, the payments were stopped immediately.  If a cheque had been sent out and not cashed it was difficult to get it cashed and questions were raised as to whether or not one could legally use it.  We introduced a system quite recently whereby if the death of a person who was in receipt of social welfare payments occurs those payments would continue to be paid to the widow for a period of six weeks.  That is some recognition of the difficulties in which people may find themselves following the death of a loved one.  There are a tremendous number of areas where it would be desirable to extend schemes or introduce new schemes but it is not possible to rectify within a short space of time the neglect which occurred over a long period.</P>

      <P>The discussion on this Bill has been somewhat brief because of the desire of this House to have the Bill speedily passed and the courteous and willing co-operation from Deputy Andrews.  It was a useful discussion which brought out many factors.  As usual, Deputy Callanan in his contribution showed a tremendous amount of concern and common sense.  He raised the question of the change in the payment of farmers' dole and questioned whether it was justified by way of increases in farm incomes.  He went on to criticise, as did Deputy Andrews, the operations of the EEC.</P>
      <P>As I said previously, there were so many Departments covered in the discussion on this Bill that one would be justified in thinking we had an adjournment debate this morning on the question of farmers' incomes and how much they had increased.  One of the points made by Deputy Callanan was that not long ago if a farmer lost a cow he could replace it for £20.  If that happened today it would be a much more serious contigency in that he would need in excess of £300 to replace an animal.  It is clearly demonstrated by Deputy Callanan's own statement that farm incomes have undoubtedly increased.  If not too long ago one could replace an animal for £20 and the replacement of a similar animal today would cost in the region of £300, it is legitimate to say that farm incomes have increased.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of Dublin City Council's recent discussion of the employment difficulties in the city and, indeed, this is a problem which has been engaging my active attention for a considerable time past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over the past 18 months the Industrial Development Authority have, with my agreement, taken a number of initiatives designed to boost industrial employment in Dublin.  Dublin is now being widely promoted as a location for large and medium-sized projects, and furthermore the small industries programme has been extended to Dublin for certain selected sectors. Construction of a 70,000 sq. ft. <Col N="1264" /> advance factory has begun at Finglas and work on a similar-sized unit at Coolock will commence within the next few months.  In addition, the IDA are having discussions with the corporation about the possibility of acquiring land in Dublin city which could be developed for industrial projects.</P>
    <P>In all of these initiatives emphasis will be placed on attracting projects which would be likely to build up employment quickly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary fails to realise the urgency of this matter.  There are 33.000 people unemployed in Dublin at the moment and this figure is rising.  The Parliamentary Secretary said he has been working on this matter over the past year or so.  The fact that the figures are rising on the unemployment register shows that his efforts so far are not having the desired effect.  Would he consider making Dublin a special area for special attention to prevent more people going on the unemployment list?  Thousands of young people will be leaving school in a few months' time and they will not be able to get employment.  Would the Parliamentary Secretary consider zoning Dublin as an area which needs immediate remedial treatment by way of capital injection to the corporation so that they can carry on their building programme and provide much needed employment and much needed houses?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Undoubtedly the Deputy will be aware that the traditional policy of the IDA during the tenure of office of previous Governments was one of concentrating development outside Dublin.  It is only in recent years, and as a result of discussions between the Minister and the IDA, that certain initiatives have been taken to redress the balance in favour of Dublin.  Perhaps I might mention these measures briefly.  Dublin is now being promoted as a location for large and medium sized industrial projects. A decision has been taken to build the advance factories I mentioned.  The small industries programme has been extended to Dublin for the following sectors: chemicals, pharmaceuticals, <Col N="1265" /> plastics and precision engineering. Furthermore, a service industries programme has been initiated and this has particular relevance to Dublin because it involves export-oriented activities by people such as architects, quantity surveyors, processing and consulting engineers, and computer service companies. In the service industries programme 83 per cent of the jobs already created were created within the Dublin region.  In general I can tell the Deputy it is the intention to increase substantially the job target for the Dublin area as a result of the measures the Minister has encouraged the IDA to take in this context.</P>

Could some immediate remedial measures be taken to ensure that the people who are unemployed in the Ballyfermot area get some immediate relief?  The average there is twice the national average.  Is the Parliamentary Secretary aware that, within the perimeter of the city, it is not possible to locate the type of chemical works and other works he has mentioned?  It is not possible to provide chemical plants which would absorb the 33,000 unemployed mentioned by Deputy <Col N="1266" /> Moore and, indeed, the 1,700 unemployed in the Ballyfermot area.</P>

      <P>I understand that of the seven factories listed by the Deputy two are privately owned and the remaining five are owned by the IDA and Gaeltarra Éireann.  One of the advance factories, at Letterkenny, is not in fact vacant, having been leased to a firm which recently opened a major textile plant in the town.</P>

      <P>I would not agree that the advance factory programme is futile as the Deputy seems to suggest. We have attracted many industries to this country in the very recent past which would not have come here but for the fact that we have advance factories available.  I have no doubt that all these advance factories will be filled in due course and as quickly as possible.  There is no possibility of ensuring that every advance factory is occupied immediately it is built. Clearly, it takes some time to fill such factories.  There would be no point in an advance factory programme if one did not envisage that in some cases it would take some time to have them in production.</P>

      <P>Under Protocol No. 6 of the Treaty of Accession to the EEC all controls on the export of saw log from the State were removed as and from the 1st July, 1975.  A limited export of saw log has since developed. I believe that the basic problem of the sawmilling industry is excess capacity which results in too many mills competing for the available supplies of timber.  This problem was recognised <Col N="1270" /> by the IDA some years ago when they decided to confine re-equipment grants to existing saw mills where development plans included the production of timber for the building industry and where throughput at the time was at a substantial level.  The aim of this policy was to help in the rationalisation of the industry.  The IDA is at present undertaking a survey of the timber processing industry and, when completed, this will provide guidelines for future policy in the sector.</P>

      <P>The method of registration of title is <Col N="1272" /> provided for in the Registration of Title Act, 1964, and Land Registration Rules made under that Act.</P>
      <P>In reply to a question by Deputy Davern on 18th June, 1975&mdash;Dáil Debates Volume 282, No. 5, columns 893-896&mdash;I gave in some detail the remedial measures taken since 1973 in order to provide a more efficient service in the Land Registry.  The changes in the mapping procedures recommended by the study group are being implemented.  Further recommendations by the study group in relation to the reorganisation of the Land Registry are at present under consideration.</P>
      <P>As regards the legislative provisions, I might mention that the rules enable the Registrar of Titles in certain circumstances to dispense with or modify the official examination of title where the value of the property does not exceed a prescribed amount.

As a result of the improvements, could he tell us what the average delay is and if any further improvements can be expected?  Is he aware of the number of representations that have to be made to that office by Members of both Houses in an effort to speed up registration of title for their constituents?

It has been a matter of concern to the public, the legal profession and Members of this House for a great many years.  Because of that I am now studying proposals which have been submitted for a radical reorganisation of the Land Registry.  I hope when <Col N="1273" /> these proposals have been studied and are implemented that they will lead to dramatic changes in the efficiency of the Land Registry and that present dedays can be eliminated completely.

      <P>In regard to the Naval Service the establishment in 1972, when the Deputy's party were in office, was 435.  In 1974 the present Government increased that to 500 and again last year the present Government increased the establishment figure to 600.  Therefore the Deputy will see there has been steady progress in relation to the Naval Service personnel by this Government.  In regard to the Air Corps, if the Deputy is interested, in 1972 under Fianna Fáil the establishment figure for all ranks was 818.  In <Col N="1278" /> 1974 it was increased by the present Government to 863 and last year, 1976, it was increased again by the present Government to 869.  Therefore, the present Government and the Minister for Defence particularly since 1973 are giving more to the Air Corps and to the Naval Service than the clap-trap that they usually get and have got from Fianna Fáil.</P>

      <P>On 4th March I informed a deputation from the Conference of Major Religious Superiors that the capitation rate payable in respect of children in residential homes is being increased from £18 to £22 a week per child, with effect from 1st January, 1977.  This represents an increase of over 22 per cent.</P>
      <P>I further informed the deputation that an inter-departmental committee had already been set up to urgently examine the general question of financing the homes and to make recommendations in the matter by 31st March, 1977.  A further meeting with representatives of The Conference of Major Religious Superiors will take place on 20th April, 1977.</P>

I have seen the notification to the effect that they may close <Col N="1282" /> and it certainly would not be my intention to allow that to happen.

Under the terms of the Control of Fishing for Salmon Order, 1974, the number of licences which the Dublin Board may issue each year is limited to 18 drift net, 11 draft net and one loop net.  In the 1977 season the Dublin Board have allocated 16 drift net licences, for which the cost is £50 per licence, and eight draft net licences, for which the cost is £30 per licence.</P>
      <P>The licences do not stipulate where fishing may take place but the areas most commonly availed of by the fishermen are Dublin Bay in the vicinity of Ringsend, Broadmeadow off Malahide and offshore of Bray and Wicklow town.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Kelly)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to enable Ireland to ratify the Treaty Amending Certain Provisions of the Treaties Establishing the European Communities and of the Treaty Establishing a Single Council and a Single Commission of the European Communities. This new treaty which was signed in Brussels on behalf of Ireland by the Minister for Foreign Affairs on 22nd July, 1975, is, broadly speaking, designed to increase the powers of the European Parliament, or the Assembly, in respect of the Community budget.  It also establishes a Communities' Court of Auditors which it is intended will exercise, although in a more effective manner, the powers and jurisdiction at present conferred on the Audit Board of the European Communities and on the Auditor of the European Coal and Steel Community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The effect of the Bill, when enacted into law, will be to make this new treaty part of the domestic law of Ireland as from the date when it is ratified by all the member states.  As Deputies will recall, the European Communities Act, 1972, enacted into Irish law all the existing treaties governing the Communities and it is logical that an amending treaty should be treated likewise.  Accordingly, that Act has been amended by the insertion of this new treaty therein.  In accordance with section 2 of the 1972 Act, this new treaty will then become part of the domestic law of the State under the conditions laid down in the treaties <Col N="1291" /> governing the European Communities. The Minister will have power to make regulations to give effect to the new treaty by virtue of section 3 of the 1972 Act.  These will be subject to the annulment procedures contained in the European Communities (Amendment Act, 1973.  These can be exercised on the recommendation of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the European Communities.</P>
    <P>The Bill will come into force on the same date as the new treaty.  It is provided that the Minister for Foreign Affairs must give notice in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> when this happens.</P>
    <P>Under the original treaties establishing the European Communities&mdash; namely, the European Coal and Steel Community, the Eurioean Economic Community and Euratom&mdash;the European Parliament had very little control over the budget of the Communities. This situation was remedied to some extent by what is known as the Budget Treaty of 22nd April, 1970, which amended certain of the articles relating to the Community budget in the original treaties so as to increase the powers of the Parliament over the budget.  These provisions remain in force today, having come into operation on 1st January, 1975.</P>
    <P>At the time of the signing of the Budget Treaty in April, 1970&mdash;and this treaty is listed incidentally at section 1 (1) (f) of the European Communities Act, 1972&mdash;the European Parliament made it clear that it was not entirely satisfied with the new powers being granted to it.  For this reason it was agreed that in due course the Commission would make further proposals in the matter for consideration by the Council.</P>
    <P>On 8th June, 1973, the Commission submitted to the Council proposals for strengthening the budgetary powers of the European Parliament.  These proposals were subsequently revised in the Parliament.  The Council, after lengthy discussions and consultations with the Parliament, eventually agreed on a &ldquo;package&rdquo; of proposals on 4th June, 1974.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1292" /> After the proposals, as agreed by the Council, had been drafted in appropriate treaty form and after the Parliament had been formally consulted, the Council, acting in accordance with Article 236 of the EEC Treaty and Article 209 of Euratom Treaty, delivered an Opinion on 22nd July, 1975 in favour of calling a Conference of Representatives of the Governments of the member states.  The conference was duly held on the same day and the treaty signed.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned earlier, the two main objectives of the new treaty are to increase the powers of the European Parliament over the budget of the Communities and to establish a European Court of Auditors.</P>
    <P>Turning first to the powers of the European Parliament, the treaty specifically recognises the right of the Parliament to reject the budget <i>in toto.</i> Hitherto, there have been conflicting interpretations on whether or not Parliament has this right under the existing treaties.  For its part the Parliament has traditionally held that its power to adopt the budget also implied its right not to adopt the budget, that is, to reject it.  The Council's position has been that Parliament has the right to adopt the budget only but not to reject it.  Ambiguity over this matter is being removed under Articles 2, 12 and 20 of the new treaty which lay down that, for important reasons and acting by a majority of its members and two-thirds of the votes cast, the European Parliament may reject the draft budget and request the submission to it of a new draft.  In the event of the Parliament exercising the option of rejecting the draft budget outright, and if for this or other reasons the budget has not been adopted at the start of the financial year, it will be necessary to fall back on the system known as &ldquo;provisional twelfths&rdquo;.  Under this system, if the budget is not adopted by the beginning of the financial year, a sum equivalent to not more than one-twelfth of the budget appropriations of the preceding financial year may be spent each month.</P>
    <P>The new treaty also provides the Parliament with increased powers over <Col N="1293" />&ldquo;obligatory&rdquo; expenditure.  As Deputies will be aware, expenditure in the Community budget is broken down into &ldquo;obligatory expenditure&rdquo;, that is expenditure necessarily resulting from the treaties or from acts adopted in accordance therewith, and other, expenditure known as &ldquo;non-obligatory expenditure&rdquo;.  The basic difference between these two forms of expenditure is that the Council has the final say over obligatory expenditure, which accounts for about three-quarters of the current budget of the Communities and includes such matters as the funds available under the CAP, while the Parliament has the final say over non-obligatory expenditure which includes moneys available for such matters as the social fund, staff and so on.</P>
    <P>Under the existing treaties, the Parliament has a right to propose changes, known technically as modifications, to the figures for obligatory expenditure as established by the Council but unless these modifications are accepted by the Council acting by a qualified majority, that is 41 votes in favour, they are rejected.  I might mention that in qualified majority voting, votes are weighted in accordance with the provisions of the treaties.</P>
    <P>The new treaty will make the rejection of modifications by the Council more difficult where modifications do not increase the overall expenditure of an institution, that is in cases where a proposed increase in expenditure would be offset by a reduction elsewhere.  In such cases modifications proposed by the Parliament will in future have to be rejected by a qualified majority, that is 41 votes out of 58, otherwise they will stand accepted.  In all other cases, the existing arrangements whereby modifications proposed by the Parliament stand rejected unless adopted by a qualified majority, will continue.</P>
    <P>In addition, the new treaty provides that the European Parliament alone, acting on the recommendation of the Council, will be able to give a discharge to the commission in respect of the implementation of the budget.  This power of discharge which in effect amounts to a power to declare the accounts for the previous year finally and duly closed, is at present exercised <Col N="1294" /> jointly by the Council and the Parliament.</P>
    <P>The treaty also obliges the Council to consult the Parliament, and obtain the opinion of the new Court of Auditors, before making financial regulations relating to the management of the budget.  The financial regulations lay down the detailed rules for the implementation of the budget and of particular funds.  At present the Council may make financial regulations without reference to either the Parliament or the Audit Board.</P>
    <P>The provisions of the treaty that I have dealt with so far relate to the strengthening of the budgetary powers of the European Parliament.  The treaty has also the aim of ensuring a more effective management of Community finances and to this end provides for the establishment of a new body aimed at reinforcing the financial audit of Community revenue and expenditure.</P>
    <P>It is generally felt that the existing Audit Board of the European Communities has not been able to operate as effectively as might have been desired and this has prompted the Community to decide on the establishment of a new Court of Auditors.  The deficiencies of the Audit Board in no way reflect on the members of the board who are all highly qualified and expert in their field, but are due rather to the fact that members do not have available to them the conditions in which to operate effectively.  There are four basic reasons for this.  First, the members of the Audit Board are part-time and their duties in their home countries as members of national audit authorities.  Ministries of Finance and so on may not allow them all the time they might wish to carry out their functions effectively.  With the proposed new Court of Auditors, the members will be full-time and indeed, under Articles 7, 15 and 23 of the new treaty, members of the court are specifically forbidden, during their term of office, from engaging in any other occupation, whether gainful or not.</P>
    <P>The second difficulty for the existing Audit Board is that although they have the right to conduct an audit on the spot under Article 206 EEC, their right to do so in member <Col N="1295" /> states is not laid down specifically in the treaties.  For a number of years, there was a marked reluctance by some of the member states&mdash;not, however, including Ireland&mdash;to allow the Audit Board to carry out audits in their territories and because of this divergence of view the Audit Board did not until 1975 succeed in arranging any audits of its own inside the member states. Prior to 1975 on-the-spot audits were confined to the institutions of the Communities.</P>
    <P>Although there has been a marked improvement in the position since then, the present situation is regarded as unsatisfactory because the Audit Board cannot be expected to function effectively without being able freely to extend their operations, where appropriate, to the member states. This situation will be remedied under the new treaty where articles 8, 16 and 24 specifically provide that &ldquo;The audit shall be based on records and if necessary performed on the spot in the institutions of the Communities and in member states&rdquo;.  This provision, it is hoped, will bring about a significant improvement in the effectiveness of the Court of Auditors over the Audit Board.</P>
    <P>A third difficulty is that although the Audit Board have, in practice, begun audits of accounts before the accounts for a particular year have been closed this power of the Audit Board was not specifically spelled out in the treaties.  The new treaty will rectify this position and Articles 8, 16 and 24 explicitly provide that the &ldquo;Auditing of expenditure shall be carried out before the closure of accounts for the financial year in question&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The fourth difficulty is that the existing Audit Board may not, in practice, have been able to obtain access to all the information they need.  At a national level, as for example in the case of the Comptroller and Auditor General in Ireland, the office in charge of audit can ask for any information it needs and is given that information as a matter of right. The powers of the Audit Board in this regard were not spelled out in any detail in the existing treaties, the only <Col N="1296" /> reference being to the fact that the audit &ldquo;shall be based on records&rdquo;. The new treaty, however, will change this situation.  Articles 8, 16 and 24 state clearly that &ldquo;That institutions of the Communities and the national audit offices or, if these do not have the necessary powers, the competent national departments shall forward to the Court of Auditors, at its request, any document or information necessary to carry out its task.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Finally, the creation of a single Court of Auditors will mean that from now on there will be only one audit authority in the European Communities and that the present duality in auditing procedures will be abolished. Under the existing treaties the Audit Board are responsible for auditing the accounts of all revenue and expenditure in the Community budget except for the non-administrative expenditure and revenue of the European Coal and Steel Community.  The audit of this latter non-administrative expenditure and revenue is carried out by the Auditor of the ECSC.  Under the new treaty all audits will be carried out by the new Court of Auditors.</P>
    <P>Although the changes provided for in the new treaty are, we realise, somewhat technical they will, we believe, lead to some real improvement in the Community not only in terms of ensuring stricter controls over finance but also in recognising the growing importance of the role of the European Parliament in Community affairs.  These are objectives which we feel sure the whole House can share.  Indeed, the Joint Oireachtas Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the European Communities have already welcomed the terms of the treaty in a report of 7th May, 1975.</P>
    <P>The Government, for their part, are in full agreement with the terms of the new treaty which they welcome as a positive contribution to the development of a more democratic and efficient Community.  For this reason the Government consider it desirable that the present Bill should become part of our domestic law at the earliest opportunity so that this country may proceed to take the necessary steps towards ratifying <Col N="1297" /> the new treaty and thus help to bring it into operation as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Opposition also consider it desirable that this Bill should become part of our domestic law at the earliest opportunity, to quote the Parliamentary Secretary.  The difference between us is that if the Government consider it so desirable they have a lot of explaining to do and a brief historical analysis of the attitude of the Government towards this Bill, which the Parliamentary Secretary has outlined in some detail, might not be inappropriate.</P>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary correctly traced the history of the European Parliament in relation to budget control.  He has indicated that to some extent this Bill introduces a new relationship between the Parliament, the Council and the Commission. To the extent that it increases the power of the Parliament obviously it is a major innovation in the European Community.</P>
      <P>For this purpose the consultations that took place in 1974 within the Community with the Council, the Commission and the Parliament, were to increase the power of the Parliament in budgetary affairs and to establish the Court of Auditors, as proposed in this Bill.  These consultations finally gave rise to a treaty which was signed by this Government, among others, in July, 1975.  As the Parliamentary Secretary has noted, even before that, in May, 1975, the all-party committee of this House&mdash;of which I am a member&mdash;welcomed the provisions of the then proposed treaty draft and pointed out the desirability of implementing it.  However, here we are almost two years later introducing legislation which the Parliamentary Secretary tells us the Government consider should be introduced into our domestic law at the earliest opportunity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary has much explaining to do. <Col N="1298" /> The usual explanation that it involved detailed preparation by the parliamentary draftsman will not do.  If ever there was a short, simple, precise Bill this is it.  There are only two sections involved and they are purely formal &mdash;it is a matter simply of adding the title of the treaty of July, 1975, to the treaties referred to in the Act of 1972.  A first-year law student in the Incorporated Law Society or at King's Inns could have drafted the Bill for the Government in five minutes flat, and I mean that.  Therefore, it cannot be the usual problem of the parliamentary draftsman being under pressure of one kind or another. It is the simplest form of Bill to come before the House for a considerable time.</P>
      <P>The only explanation must be that the Government did not look on the matter with the urgency they now say it warrants.  If the Parliamentary Secretary has another explanation I should like to hear it.  This treaty awaits ratification because we alone of the nine member states of the European Community have not as yet adopted and ratified it into our national law.  Until we do that all the desirable things the Parliamentary Secretary has outlined, such as increasing the power of the Parliament and control by the Court of Audit&mdash; I welcome that and I will deal with it later&mdash;will have to be delayed because Ireland has not yet ratified it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Article 30 of the treaty referred to states: &ldquo;It shall enter into force on the first day of the month following the deposit of the instrument of ratification by the last member state&rdquo;.  We have well and truly anchored ouselves into that position.  This means this important Bill has to get a speedy passage through the House.  It means, if we are to give effect to our concern, that I, as spokesman for the Opposition, have literally to limit my contribution to a very considerable extent on what would otherwise be a very lengthy debate.  If I do not do that, we are delaying it further and further and the Parliamentary Secretary will tell us that there is other legislation.  That is an unacceptable position to me and I am not the only one who feels this way.  I asked a question in the House <Col N="1299" /> on the 15th December last.  It is extraordinary that the president of the European Parliament was so concerned at the Government's failure to pass this Bill that he wrote to the Taoiseach&mdash;that must be a rather unprecedented step&mdash;on the 29th October last asking him to do all he could to get this Bill that we are now discussing almost six months later introduced. There was not a speedy response from the Taoiseach.  The president of the European Parliament naturally communicated with his nearest senior colleague, the vice-president of the European Parliament, Senator Michael Yeats, who communicated with me and asked me to bring up this matter in the House so that this Bill would be introduced as quickly as possible. We now find that, even three months later, this Bill of great urgency is introduced.  It is a very severe criticism of the Government, who are supposed to be concerned about the development of the European Community and are particularly committed to the role that parliament represents in that Community, that they have been able to sit on this for the past two years without shaking themselves into recognising its importance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened to the Parliamentary Secretary.  He will find that this Bill will have got through the House before 5 o'clock.  If he is suggesting to me that the Government could not have arranged, over almost two years, one-and-a-quarter hours to have this done, it is some reflection on the way the Government order their business.  It is no wonder the Parliamentary Secretary is being prompted to respond to the position of the president of the European Parliament. The more I listened to the Parliamentary Secretary outlining the provisions of this Bill the more I became convinced, while he showed how important the Bill is, that he was expressing the strongest possible condemnation of the Government's failure, for no good reason that I can understand, to introduce this very <Col N="1300" /> important measure that he has now asked us to introduce into our domestic law at the earliest opportunity.</P>
      <P>That is almost two years after the treaty was originally signed and after the all-party committee, to which he referred, welcomed the provisions of this Bill.  We should be consistent.  We are the last member of the Community, dragging our feet, ensuring that the Court of Auditors particularly cannot be set up.  We have done that for two years because we have not ratified this treaty.  We are also ensuring that the parliament, to which we have expressed commitments from time to time, cannot formally get the increased budgetary powers that are required.  This is because we, alone of all the nine, have, for some strange reason, refused to introduce this Bill of one section, which a first-year law student could draft for the Government.</P>
      <P>I wait to hear the excuse for that. In the meantime this nation was embarrassed by having to wait until the president of the Parliament actually wrote to the Taoiseach and then to our Leader who passed it on to me asking: &ldquo;Will you get something going there&rdquo;.  This is extraordinary from a nation which talks about its European commitments.</P>
      <P>What has happened in the meantime? Parliament could not wait to get this formal authority.  They have on an informal agreed basis been exercising, without formal authority, the new budgetary powers that are proposed for them in this treaty.  We can say that parliament has not been compromised because the new budgetary powers are already being exercised by them without the formal sanction of the treaty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I noted the Parliamentary Secretary's detailed explanation of all the things that they can do and will do that have not been hitherto possible. They can do nothing because they cannot and will not be established until one month after the deposit of the instrument of ratification by the last member state, namely, Ireland. All the desirable things that they will do have to be held up.  The Parliamentary <Col N="1301" /> Secretary referred to some of them.  It is widely recognised that one of the problems within the Community is the investigation of fraudulent appropriation of Community funds by member states.  This has meant a loss to the Community of very considerable sums of money.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary pointed out that the present audit provisions, without criticising the members of the board, is defective.  One of the reasons, as he indicated, is that there is no provision for conducting an on-the-spot investigation in the country concerned.  The present audit board is part-time.  They cannot conduct an audit on the spot, which has been a very severe limitation on their inquiries into some of the problems of Community spending.  Fraud is not the only problem here.  This has to wait until the slow reluctant member of the Community, the Paddy Last, Ireland, can spare one hour or one-and-a-half hours to pass this Bill.  I have heard of some strange anomalies in our attitude to the Community but this one passes anything I have met. We might have spent two hours on it but now we will have to confine it to one-and-a-half hours because of the urgency the Parliamentary Secretary spoke about.</P>

      <P>I agree.  I will have most of it said but there may be other Deputies who will want to contribute.  I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary will acknowledge that there is important business next week, so important that the Minister for Industry and Commerce has to have it then.  There will be other important business the following week and somebody else has to have it as well.  I will not be the person who delays one step further our ratification of this treaty.  I suppose the Government will sit on St. Patrick's Day at this stage but they could not find one hour for this over the past two years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure the Parliamentary Secretary that he will have ample opportunity to explain the reasons.  I would not make the charges without wanting to hear from him.  I will listen with interest for the Parliamentary Secretary's excuses.  What has been lost by our delay?  The treaty has not come into force.  The increased budgetary powers of the European Parliament have not been implemented and the Court of Auditors have not been established.  As the Parliamentary Secretary has recognised, the Court of Auditors cannot conduct an on-the-spot investigation in any member state within the European Community.  Those are all very desirable things but still they wait. The delay has not been caused by a question of money.  We have an explanatory memorandum, which is a very precise document as one would expect for such a precise little Bill. It says in the final paragraph:</P>
      <P>Adoption of the Bill is unlikely to involve any charge on the Exchequer.</P>
      <P>Another excuse goes out the window. It cannot be because of financial difficulties that we had to wait for two years.  The Parliamentary Secretary might explain that as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>How could we possibly justify a delay in introducing it?  That is the first thing that has to be cleared up, because we already have shown ourselves less committed, less effective members of the Community by the disability&mdash;and I mean disability&mdash; which we have imposed by our delay in regard to the European Parliament and the Court of Auditors, and by our reluctance to support the new developments within the Community which generally means strengthening the role of Parliament and, to a certain extent, a diminution of the absolute <Col N="1303" /> independence of the Council <i>vis-à-vis</i> Parliament.</P>
    <P>Incidentally, the role of the European Parliament in all of this is important, as the Parliamentary Secretary has acknowledged, because the explanatory memorandum also says this will strengthen the powers of the European Parliament.  If we want to get a truly representative Europe, if we want to get a Europe which has real meaning for the people, then it must be a strong, representative European Parliament. This Bill is intended to do that.  We who have been saying so much about strengthening the Parliament have been doing so little about acting on our own terms.</P>
    <P>Summarising it as far as the powers of the Parliament are concerned, the Parliament has been accorded the explicit right of rejecting the draft Community budget as a whole and asking for a new draft to be submitted to it. I agree with the Parliamentary Secretary that there has been some difference of opinion as to what the powers of the Parliament up to this have been. Now for the first time they have been given this explicit right of rejecting the Community budget as a whole.  The important thing is that even within the Parliament the treaty provides that to effect that right the Parliament must pass a decision by a majority of the Members of the European Parliament, and there is a very strong qualification as to how the Parliament's view would be expressed.  It can only be expressed by a majority of its Members but by two thirds, in addition, of those voting. This will mean that if the Parliament is to give effect to this new budgetary power, it will need to have very solid support, indeed, among its Members.</P>
    <P>That brings us to the whole question of the role of the Parliament and what kind of Parliament it will be, and what Ireland's position within that Parliament will be.  This last week has been a very interesting one in regard to the European Parliament.  Ireland's place in the European Parliament has been highlighted very significantly within this last week for a number of reasons.  One of the reasons is the fact that a nominee who is a member of our party and who has earned much <Col N="1304" /> distinction in the European Parliament as Vice President, namely, Senator Michael Yeats, did exceptionally well to be defeated in such a narrow vote for the top position in that Parliament, by 87 votes to 77, being defeated for the position by a former Prime Minister of Italy, Signore Colombo.</P>
    <P>Let us look at the support Signore Colombo got and the support which Senator Yeats did not get, and let us look at the consequences of this for Ireland's representation in the Parliament which is strengthened by this Bill.  Signore Colombo, Christian Democrat, had the support in the final count of communist members of the European Parliament from his own native country.  Some communist members from Italy abstained but other communist members from Italy voted for their own national who is totally opposed for what they stand for. If in the Italian scene the communists can vote for the christian democrat, it might not have been too much to ask the Fine Gael members of the European Parliament to vote for a Fianna Fáil nominee.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought the Deputy was one of the greatest Europeans in the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am as good a European as the Parliamentary Secretary, if not better, but I want to show how small-minded the Government are in this matter.  The Italian communists voted for an Italian christian democrat while Fine Gael show a miserable, selfish attitude by opposing the Fianna Fáil nominee, a man of real standing in the Community and in the Parliament.  Had Fine Gael voted for Senator Michael Yeats he would now undoubtedly be the President of the European Parliament.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>How does the Deputy make that out?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>He lost by eight votes.  If the three Fine Gael votes had turned to vote for the member from their own nation, as the communists were able to do in regard to the christian democrat, despite the big gap between them, I would have <Col N="1305" /> presumed that, whatever Fine Gael thought of Fianna Fáil, they hardly think much worse of them than the communists do of the christian democrats.  That would make a gap of two, and we have very good reasons to know that if Fine Gael had supported Senator Yeats, Senator Yeats would have got at least one vote&mdash;that is all that was needed&mdash; from their christian democrat colleagues.  The thanks for the defeat of Senator Yeats in the election for the Presidency of the Parliament is due entirely to the Fine Gael Party.</P>
      <P>If that is the position Ireland is going to take up in the European Parliament, it does not augur well, but I would like to mention that by contrast the Labour Party, and Deputy Thornley, in particular, took a different view.  They said, &ldquo;if the socialists and the communists are prepared to support a man to whom they are totally opposed ideologically, we can support Senator Yeats&rdquo;, and Deputy Thornley, at all stages of the count voted for the Fianna Fáil nominee.</P>
      <P>I give that as an example of the kind of attitude this Government are presenting in Europe.  When we have a man of real standing to uphold the principles for which we stand in that Parliament, it is regrettable that the reason he does not get that honour is that three of his own countrymen&mdash; and I wish one of them would come in here and justify it&mdash;decide to reject him, not because he was not fit but because they were not fit to recognise what he represents, and adopted this small-minded attitude or, perhaps, they were acting on an instruction they got from home.  That is a second contradiction which this Government have to explain in relation to their attitude towards Europe and the European Parliament.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is particularly important that we as a small nation would play a prominent role in that Parliament.  It is not a question of any particular person in a particular position doing anything untoward or improper but of occupying a position with status and authority, an authority which Ireland so vitally needs there now.  Within the Community at the moment what one <Col N="1306" /> can loosely call the consumer lobby or the industrial nations, the major powers, are becoming more and more influential within the Parliament simply by force of numbers at the expense of producer countries such as Ireland who through lack of numbers are becoming less influential.</P>
    <P>That has become a fact of life in Europe since the accession of Britain and Denmark and because of the influence of Germany, France and Holland.  The consumer industrial lobby within the European Parliament has become stronger, and I will have more to say on this in a moment.  The producer lobby has become weaker, and if ever we needed a representative from our country to express that, even in status as distinct from undue influence, it was this last week and from now on.  It has been very obvious to anyone who has attended as an observer of the European Parliament recently that that trend is developing.  Yet, for some mean and miserable reason Fine Gael did not find themselves able to support a man who would express that view.</P>
    <P>Let us consider some figures in order to get an idea of the kind of Europe we are talking of.  A breakdown of population figures is very revealing in this sense.  We find that more than 80 per cent of the German population are living in urban areas of more than 20,000.  The figure is similar in respect of the UK and Denmark.  Obviously the industrial interests of these countries will be represented very strongly in the Parliament.  In Holland, Belgium and Luxembourg more than 70 per cent of the population live in urban areas that have populations of more than 20,000.  Therefore, we are thinking in terms of a Community which is basically an industrialised urban Community, a situation that must be reflected in the representation in Parliament. Only Italy and ourselves have about 50 per cent of the population living in towns or cities with populations of more than 20,000.  Consequently, it is of vital importance that the interest represented by Ireland as an element in Europe be promoted and supported.  It is in that context I say <Col N="1307" /> that what Fine Gael did this week in the European Parliament was a disservice not only to Ireland but to the entire development of the Parliament.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Deputy making the point that every country should act on its own?  I understood that the Community meant the transcending of national boundaries.  What the Deputy is saying is more appropriate to a county council.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not care less for Senator Yeats' own sake.  If the nominee were a member of the other side and if he had the status and standing of Senator Yeats, I would support him and would have him supported from this side of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that the Deputy would be generous enough to do that but he has a wrong view of what the Parliament is about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The conduct of the Government in regard to the delay in introducing this Bill shows who has the wrong idea.  In relation to the need for a Parliament that is concerned and determined regarding the implementation of the proposals of the Community, let us consider the draft budget for this year alone.  It stands at 8,646,000 units of account while for last year the comparative figure was 8,471,000 units of account.  When we subtract from the draft budget the administrative costs which have increased considerably and which are provided for we find that already the budget of the Community in the areas with which we would be concerned most and with which the Community have expressed themselves to be concerned most, is less in real terms in 1977 than it was in 1976. This is the Community that is committed to the elimination of regional imbalances and to making the Community area a better place for all to live in, not only in terms of cities but in giving meaning to the peripheries of the Community where there are real cultural and social values. Yet that Community have cut back in this year's budget.  In order to reject such a budget the Parliament must be concerned and determined to implement the stated aims of the Community. <Col N="1308" /> That is why every opportunity that becomes available to us should be taken advantage of in order to express our views in the strongest manner possible.</P>
      <P>Even the trend of voting on budgetary matters in the Parliament within the past few months indicate that the consumer lobby from the industrial nations is growing continuously stronger at the expense of the producer lobby, if the latter can be regarded as a lobby at all.  This will be one of the main issues in the development of Europe during the next few years.  In expressing our commitment to and our support for a strengthening of the European Parliament we must not allow ourselves to be blindfolded to the reality that the Parliament we are supporting in respect of greater powers may be an expression of an undermining of the very essence of the Community programme for the development of the peripheral regions unless those who represent the central areas&mdash;the prosperous centre&mdash;are prepared to express their concern for the peripheral regions. That is why our representation in the Parliament must have status and persuasion and, above all, must represent a united view irrespective of groupings because if we cannot speak with one voice in the Parliament, we cannot expect others to heed our views.  Therefore, we must avoid divided views.</P>
      <P>Although what Ireland has received by way of FEOGA grants is considerable we find from the latest report, that of October, 1976, that the amounts which have been transferred under the main elements have fallen.  In 1975 there was a net transfer of £102 million under the FEOGA guarantee section but in the first nine months of 1976 that had fallen to £69,500,000. Under the guidance section the figure fell in a full year from £25 million to £1,750,000 in nine months.  Unfortunately there has been a decrease, too, under all the other heads&mdash;the social fund, the regional fund and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us consider the social action programmes overall in the Community. In 1977 there is provision in the budget for 172 million units of account whereas the corresponding figure for 1976 was <Col N="1309" /> 440 million.  This is a steep fall-off. The social fund is an essential element within the Community's proposals in terms of implementing their stated programmes.  There is provision in the 1977 draft budget for what are referred to as commitment appropriations.  This amounts to 578 million units of account. These are simply commitments to do something during the next few years as a result of the continuing nature of the proposals for programmes under the social fund.  In this year the extent of the provision is 172 million units of account.</P>
    <P>It will be seen, then, that there is a great need for vigilance and that it is necessary to remind the Community that they must be true to their stated aims.  Otherwise what will develop will be a strengthening of the centre at the expense of the peripheral regions.  To some extent that process is under way. It is for the Parliament, with its increased powers, to ensure that that process is checked.</P>
    <P>In that connection it is vitally important that the stages for the direct elections to the European Parliament be introduced as quickly as possible.  Here in Ireland there is no sign of any sense of urgency in this regard but there may be greater justification for the delay in announcing the procedures for election.  None of us in politics can claim to be totally pure but let us refer to the drawing of constituency boundaries in terms of what that exercise represents. It is a fix.  The boundaries are in no way related to consistent characteristics. The Minister for Local Government smiles and the more he smiles the more one knows that something insidious is hidden behind his proposals. If we are to have a truly representative European Parliament, the Minister for Local Government could have done better than to have introduced the kind of constituencies which he did introduce.  I wish that sometimes I could volunteer to object to what is being done in the name of this country, so that someone over there could say that what is being done by that Minister in the name of fair representation is a disgrace.  The Minister has introduced constituencies <Col N="1310" /> such as that stretching from Donegal to Offaly as homogeneous constituencies. This Bill is an amendment to the Bill by which we became members of the European Community and it gives powers to the European Parliament.  We are entitled to discuss the nature of the elections we will have to the Parliament which will exercise these powers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I will.  Any Minister who can introduce constituencies that comprise areas as unrelated to each other as County Dublin, much of which is comprised of built-up suburban areas, parts of Louth, Wicklow and Kildare, shows no concern for the European Parliament. It saddens me to think that they can then present themselves as being concerned for direct elections.  When the time comes anybody could present a more reasonable outline of constituencies, allowing that we all like to give the advantage to each other.</P>

      <P>To ourselves, of course.  Here we have a situation where once again we are undermining the European Parliament and all it represents by the attitude of a Minister who has a very small mind, or who is too cute.  Perhaps the Minister wants to check the balance that Fianna Fáil have exercised over the years and he is so determined to do that that he will sweep anything aside, even our representation in Europe.  When Fianna Fáil come back it will not be done that way and the commission about which we spoke will be introduced unless we can get agreement here on what is a fair and proper way to do it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The last discussion we had in this House on the European Community was on 27th February, 1975.  On that occasion we discussed the third and fourth reports on Developments in the European Community.  Since that time we have had a fifth, sixth and seventh <Col N="1311" /> report, and now the eighth report, going up to October, 1976.  Under the European Communities Bill we must have these reports before us twice a year.  The fourth report was published in December, 1974, and I presume the third one was published some time around March of the same year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems a pity that we have not had a discussion on our involvement in the European Community since February, 1975.  It seems a pity that the fifth, sixth, seventh and eighth reports of the European Community have not been discussed.  It is a pity that we have not been able to analyse our role within that Community at Parliament level, Council level and Commission level.  For that reason I make a passing reference to it today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to Europe generally since we joined, it has become a Community where the centre is dominating the periphery.  This Parliament to whom we are giving these powers, will have to check that development. It has become a Community where the disparity between the gross domestic product in the richest regions, Hamburg for example, and the poorest regions, such as the west of Ireland, has increased from five times to almost seven times.  This pattern has also been reflected between the centre and the periphery in the south of Italy.  This Parliament which is getting these increased budgetary powers will have to play a very important role in correcting that development.  The Council, in the allocation of the funds, have been <Col N="1312" /> more concerned with the vindication of their national interests.  That is perhaps understandable, but they should not call themselves members of the Community and say they are acting in Community interests.  Where is this Community going?  There is no point in us talking about treaties, instruments and ratifications.  The European Community is a great Community for terminology, procedures, instruments and all kinds of documentation, but unless there is a central will there is no Community. The Parliament can be given the extra powers to reject the budget or to give a discharge to the Commission in respect of the implementation of the budget, or to consult between the Parliament and the Council so that from now on the Parliament through its deputation will have the right to consult with the Council on the financial management of the Community budget.</P>
    <P>All of these are desirable but they do not matter unless there is concern. All the procedures and provisions in the world and all the strengthening of the powers of the European Community, do not matter unless there is an awareness within the Parliament, the Council, and the Commission of the sort of Community we will have, and the values which it will maintain and develop.  That awareness has been sadly lacking.  The Parliament, if its power is to be effectively expressed to realise the aims of the Community should ensure that the commitments of the Community expressed as long ago as the time of the Rome Treaty, within the Paris Summit and elsewhere will be implemented through the social fund, the regional fund and also through the strengthening of obligatory spending under the common agricultural policy.</P>
    <P>We must consider that there are people within the Community, in Italy, and some in our own country, who live in a totally different world. Some of them have been displaced from the south of Italy and have had to go to live and work in Germany. I think it is fair to say that they have been propelled in one move from the Middle Ages and the customs, social and otherwise, of that period to the <Col N="1313" /> highly industrialised activities of German cities.  What is being done about this?  These poor wretches from Calabria and the heel of Italy can be &ldquo;turfed&rdquo; around.  Are we concerned about the magnificent cultural and social traditions which they have had since the days of the Roman Empire? These should be strengthened and promoted and encouraged.  The same is true of the west of Ireland.  Surely the values of a rural people living close to the ocean are worthwhile, not only for Ireland but for the community as a whole?</P>

Otherwise we will have more and more cities like Hamburg, Bremen, Bremerhaven or Stuttgart which will be visited by people like ourselves and there will be less people around the perimeter of the Community.</P>

      <P>Is it forbidden to express some basic philosophical notion of what the Community represents?  We are talking about an amendment to the Bill which brought us into the European Community. The Bill which made us a member <Col N="1314" /> of the Community is the European Communities Bill.  Today we are talking about the European Communities (Amendment) Bill.  Is the Chair telling me that I cannot even question the basic philosophy of the European Community?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill is brief in its format but very deep in its ramifications and the consequences may be wide ranging.  Forgive me, with due respect to the consistency and fairness of your rulings, if I seemed to express impatience.  It is impatience with the way we have accepted so much from the Community. This treaty is great but it must be backed up by action and philosophy or it will mean nothing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have had a situation where the growth rate at the centre of the Community&mdash;I trust the Chair will accept this as relevant because we are talking about the budgetary powers of the European Parliament&mdash;has been achieved at the expense of the periphery.  This has been quite obvious and I do not see that we should stand back and blandly accept that it is inevitable that Germany and Holland will become richer and Italy and Ireland will become poorer.  As a group we have become richer and many problems throughout the rest of the world in which we should have been showing an interest have become more acute.  That is not the kind of Community that we would enthusiastically embrace.  I say this as a convinced European.  These questions have to be asked and must be answered. I would hope that the Parliament in the exercise of its budgetary powers which we are discussing this afternoon would see just that.  If the Council will not be consistent with its own stated aims, it should be made to recognise it.  If the Commission will not be consistent with its own stated aims, it must be made to recognise it.  It must not be allowed to escape in a waffle of words and documents and <Col N="1315" /> instruments which pour out at a great rate from the various agencies of the Commission.  Let us bring some reality to this, a reality of concern, of culture and of happiness which I would think is a lot deeper in the peripheral areas than at the prosperous centre of some of the cities I have been talking about.</P>
    <P>I am glad that the Parliament has generally supported the enlargement of the Community.  We will have a better balance.  Is it a coincidence that a country such as Greece is poor but has such a deep cultural sense of history and otherwise?  I am thinking of Greece, Spain, and Portugal.  Sometimes it seems almost strange that the awareness of the real values seems to be in inverse proportion to the degree of prosperity in an area.  I want to see a more realistic and balanced European Parliament which will be concerned about the peripheral areas which are suffering at the moment at the expense of the centre.  The regional policy must be an element in that and I would hope that this Parliament would reject under these new powers any budget proposed by the Council, after having the opportunity of consulting with them under this treaty established in 1975, which will not contain a real element of regional policy. Certainly it is not there at the moment.</P>
    <P>The budget for the regional development programme, having regard to the imbalances within the Community, is inconsistent with what they pretend to support.  It is more than that&mdash;it is ludicrous.  Far from eliminating regional imbalances it does not even maintain the <i>status quo.</i> The peripheral regions are falling behind at a greater rate.  What price regional policy?  Is regional policy meant to eliminate imbalances or meant to ensure that instead of being seven times worse off they will not be eight or nine times worse off.  I know there are practical political problems involved in this but there must be a consistency in the expression of the European view, especially from a country such as ours. It must be stated that a cutback in the regional fund goes in the teeth of the stated principles of the Community and will ensure that these imbalances will be maintained and aggravated.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1316" /> That brings me to my final point and it is also relevant.  That is the fishery question.  I will not go into this in detail but just in outline.  Here we have a peripheral region, the west of Ireland, that would benefit to a very considerable extent from simply being allowed to exploit the natural resources off our coasts and this is being prevented by the Community.  They say that we must protect the traditional fishing fleets, many of which come from very prosperous nations.  I know the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary will say &ldquo;We agree but the reality is that is the view they take&rdquo;.  Perhaps that is true.  We have to remind them more and more that, in taking that view, they are not helping the regions by contributing anything extra and they are depriving the regions of the opportunity to exploit the little natural resources they have.  To a certain extent the centre has been discommoded&mdash; and that is not too strong a word to use&mdash;but by new developments in the International Law of the Sea, the centre will maintain its strength in Holland, Belgium, Denmark or somewhere else.  It is a sad reflection on the Community that they should take that view.  We may be said to be the selfish ones.  Perhaps we are.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Not again.  The Minister is a man of many words. Do not draw me out on that.  I hope to see him back in the House very shortly.  I asked him did he utter even one whimper or one whisper on this. He cannot be accused of being silent. Not even once in 1972 did he whisper: &ldquo;Be careful because perhaps a new regime will be coming in later&rdquo;?  Not even that Minister who has been heard so often opened his mouth.  Why not? Because it was not an issue then. There was no economic zone then. This Government will have to face that fact with honesty.  I am tired of hearing that yarn.  I respect no man's honesty more than that of the Parliamentary Secretary.  I do not want to embarrass him about it.  Sometimes I would accuse him of blatant honesty but I will not listen to it even from him. He knows as well as I know that was <Col N="1317" /> not an issue in 1972.  Because the economic zone has become an issue since, new advantages have accrued.  Let us not get involved in that debate.</P>
      <P>The Community must be true to themselves and say to us in accordance with the Treaty of Accession: &ldquo;We will have a survey done which will check the social and economic development of the coastal regions.&rdquo; They obliged themselves to do that under the Treaty of Accession, before introducing a new regime.  They have not done it.  They are in the difficult position that they have to respond to what sometimes seem to be unreasonable national demands.  It is easier for us to look for 50 miles than it is for the Government.  I accept that. Having said that, the Government are going the wrong way about it.  They introduced impossible conservation measures.  They are now talking in terms of impossible, unworkable quotas which I do not think will ever be accepted.  As such, quotas do not work despite promises that everyone will register and stamp the fish &ldquo;Caught in France&rdquo; or &ldquo;Caught in Ireland&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Fianna Fáil in Government will succeed in getting that band and the fishermen and the public will be satisfied. I bet we will succeed.  Within that band we will accept licensing arrangements for specified areas for traditional fishing fleets.  The result will be: (a) we will not have to go out and board ships because they will be fishing within their own zones under licensing arrangements sanctioned by us which the fishermen accept; (b) we will not have the problem or cost of patrolling these areas; and (c) each year our development potential as an island will be able to be monitored.  In each year we will be able to say: &ldquo;Those licensing arrangements were or were not satisfactory and we will adjust them a bit.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is not too much to ask from the Community.  Nor is it beyond the wit of negotiators to present it on that basis in dealing with a Commission who have a great grasp of the whole matter.  This will be acceptable to the fishermen because they know that if we had it all to ourselves we could <Col N="1318" /> not supply from the coastal band the consumer market of Europe.  We can not act the dog in the manger.  Having that coastal band, we can make licensing arrangements to ensure that the market will be supplied by the fishing fleets, and equally to ensure that our development and the development of our fishing industry will be protected.  That is vitally important. We have a Minister who literally jumps in&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I should like to thank Deputy O'Kennedy for the couple of kind things he said in the course of his speech.  I hope he will not mind if I <Col N="1320" /> do not quite stick to the single question to which I know he would like to confine me.  In fairness I must be given a chance, however briefly, to deal with some of the matters Deputy O'Kennedy succeeded in making appear relevant.  The powers of the European Parliament are being extended. I agree with everything the Deputy said about the potential importance of the budgetary power of the Parliament in enforcing greater regard for the periphery of the Community.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Kennedy felt solidarity should have been shown by my party in the election of Senator Yeats.  I sat in the Seanad for the better part of four years under the chairmanship of Senator Yeats and I thought him an excellent chairman.  I say that unaffectedly. I would be glad to see him advanced in the European context but not at the expense of sacrificing what I take to be the point of the European Parliament.  What is the sense of having groups corresponding to large political directions unless people sink their national differences and adhere to these groups?  We have all been put to a great deal of trouble and the Community has been put to a great deal of expense in setting up a Christian Democratic Group, a Socialist group, a Liberal group, a Gaullist group and a Communist group and whatever other groups there may be if they are not to mean anything.  I shall not say any more about this except that I think Deputy O'Kennedy showed a lamentable lapse from his ordinarily high-minded acceptance of the European idea in supposing that Deputies McDonald, Creed and L'Estrange should have trooped over to Strasbourg, abandoned for the day their party allegiance over there and trooped into the lobby with the rag, tag and bob-tail of the Gaullists and&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>No, it is the group to which Fianna Fáil are affiliated or associated.  I only observe that it consists of the Gaullists whose policies and philosophy, although policies clear to a Frenchman are not explicable in Irish terms, and a Danish party, the principal plank in whose platform is the abolition of income tax.  I say to Deputy O'Kennedy in all friendship that the reason his party is in that <i>gallaird</i> is that they could not find it in themselves to join where they naturally belong, either the Liberal group&mdash;because they are all great believers in private enterprise&mdash;or more naturally&mdash;I hope I do not run into criticism from my own side for saying this&mdash;the Christian Democrat group.

      <P>The Deputy found it possible to move on from that to the question of constituencies and he invited the House to hold in ridicule a constituency for the European Parliament which would stretch from Donegal to Offaly.  I presume the Deputy would accept the principle of proportional representation on the Irish model for the election for this parliament.  I assume he would not regard that as contentious.  If we have that we must have constituencies with at least three seats because you cannot achieve proper proportionality otherwise.  Any constituency involving any part of the western seaboard, where we have only 16 seats altogether, would be immense by contrast with ordinary Dáil constituencies. If it is a thinly populated <Col N="1323" /> seaboard perhaps a three-seat instead of a four-seater there might not have stretched from Donegal to Offaly but it certainly would have stretched from Donegal to some part of the Midlands not normally associated with it.  It could not be organised otherwise.</P>
      <P>I cannot see why there is all this mewling and whining about these constituencies. I challenged Deputy Lynch when he went over the top on the day when they were announced and said it was a blatant piece of gerrymandering and I asked what would happen in these constituencies.  Very likely, unless there is a revolutionary change and Deputy O'Kennedy's party falls into gross disfavour or mine does, or the Labour Party does, it looks as though it will work out like this: the two four-seaters will have two seats all, Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil; the five-seat constituency looks as it will probably go three&mdash;two in favour of Fianna Fáil.  In regard to the minority two, perhaps one Fine Gael and one Labour might be a reasonable guess. A non-committed observer might guess that it will go that way.  That leaves the eastern Leinster constituency as the cockpit in which the overall ascendency will be decided.  What is so dreadful about that?  Where is the gerrymandering? It seems to me that Fianna Fáil cry &ldquo;gerrymandering&rdquo; unless the result of the European&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>If the Deputy is not careful I shall move the adjournment of this debate and resume it next week if we get time.  I shall not have the Deputy, at least if I can avoid it, broadcasting to the nation his eccentric views on European gerrymandering without being given an opportunity to reply.  I cannot see how it can be described as gerrymandering unless, as I said six weeks ago, that Fianna Fáil regard as gerrymandering anything that does not provide them with a built-in advantage.  They are accustomed to that because they fixed all the constituencies that were ever fixed until two years ago and it is difficult for them to conceive of anything else which does not give them an advantage. <Col N="1324" /> This does not but I am damned if I can see that it provides the Coalition parties with a built-in advantage either and it is perfectly possible that Fianna Fáil will wind up with a bare majority of these European seats and if they do so in rough correspondence with the way the people have voted, good luck to them.  It is possible that Fianna Fáil will end up with an overall majority of seats in the European Parliament.  If people vote that way, I do not question their right to end up with a majority but if the people do not vote that way I certainly question their right to end up with a majority based on a possible minority of votes.</P>

      <P>I believe there must be at least three seats and that means that in rural Ireland constituencies will be enormous as whole packets of counties will come into it.  The Deputy moved on to the question of how long it had been since we debated Europe here.  It is true that the Government are obliged to report to the Oireachtas on developments in the Communities every year.  There is no obligation on the Government to devote parliamentary time to debating them.  It is a useful and agreeable exercise when there is no severe pressure of legislative work.  That has not been the case since the time the Deputy mentioned, early 1975, because 1975 was a murderous year in parliamentary time.  I shall never forget it; it nearly killed some of us.  This was largely accounted for by the gross squandering of time by the Opposition in fighting against capital taxation reform Bills, which they would now prefer to have forgotten because they realise that they made a serious mistake in opposing them.  To some extent that is why time has been short ever since.  As regards the delay I have not time to explain in the greatest detail the various problems that arose behind what seems to be a very simple Bill.  I agree that a first-year law student, if told what to do, could have drafted this Bill in five minutes.  But he might have made the <Col N="1325" /> wrong decision, or anybody else might have, in regard to whether to have a Bill at all or whether to have a much more detailed Bill.  Serious doubts and questions of a legal and constitutional kind arose in regard to implementing the treaty we signed in 1975.  The papers I have in front of me are by no means the whole file.  Correspondence and consideration has been going back and forward between my Department and the Attorney General's office at least since the beginning of 1976 which accounts for more than one complete year of the 18 months of which the Deputy complains.</P>
      <P>That was a year in which the Attorney General's Office was by no means at leisure.  That was a year when they were put to the pin of their collars not only with their ordinary work but with work on the Criminal Law Jurisdiction Bill, the Emergency Powers Bill and the enormous range of constitution difficulties which arose in that connection.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I will give one constitutional issue.  I do not want to raise a scare or panic about this and I would sooner not go into these matters.  I will mention one difficulty which I do not think is very serious but which others thought was substantial.  The constitutional amendment passed in 1972 which provides that nothing in the Constitution shall be invoked to invalidate something which is necessitated by our membership of the Community &mdash;I do not think that is correct but others are less certain&mdash;arguably refers only to necessities arising from the structure of the Community as it was at that time.  I do not think that point has much substance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Nor would anyone else.  I asked for an example of a constitutional issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said, I do not think that point has much substance but others whose expertise is greater than mine were not so sure.  Points of greater complexity also arose.  The <Col N="1326" /> Deputy is smiling because he knows that his charges have been nearly set in type by this time and that anything I now say&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot imagine what constitutional lawyer would hold that view&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that is a substantial point but I say for the third time that others disagreed.  The Deputy has enough experience of Government to know that disagreement on a matter like this generates a great deal of paper and a great deal of delay.</P>
      <P>I had in mind to say some hurtful things about delays I experienced under other Administrations, but I will let them go because it is getting late.  In order to put into perspective what Deputy O'Kennedy was saying at the outset of his speech about how we had a lot of explaining to do, I want to say that this Opposition, for the first time ever, have at their disposal three hours week in and week out.  There is nothing in Standing Orders, the conventions of this House, the law or the Constitution to prevent them putting down a motion which would take the form of a motion to read a Bill of this kind which according to Deputy O'Kennedy they could draft in five minutes, or a law student could do it in five minutes, or a chap in the think-tank could do it in three minutes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to be clear on this.  Is the Parliamentary Secretary suggesting that the Opposition should put down motions to give effect to treaties signed by the Government?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  What I am saying is that if I were in Opposition and felt as strongly about this as Deputy O'Kennedy pretends to feel, I would have done that instead of wasting the time of this House looking for more money for Fota Island, the Rosslare train service and so on.  These are the issues we have heard week in and week out.  As soon as the newspaper has been used to wrap chips these issues are forgotten. If the Opposition knew, as Deputy O'Kennedy knew because Senator Yeats told him, that we were being chivvied by the Europeans&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry.  I accept that of course.  If the matter was that serious, what was to stop the Opposition from using their Private Members' Time to show up the Government.  They would, of course, have got a very full answer in regard to delay, just as I have been prevented from giving that.  They could have had this information last month, six months ago or even a year ago. Incidentally, the same goes for general European discussions.  There is nothing in the world to stop Deputy O'Kennedy from putting down a motion for this House to take note of the Seventh Report, whichever report has not yet been discussed, of the European Communities.</P>

      <P>With the permission of the <Col N="1289" /> Ceann Comhairle Questions Nos. 28 to 34 are being taken together.</P>
      <P>In relation to the matters referred to in the Deputy's questions the statutory function of the Minister for Education derives from the Documents and Pictures (Regulation of Export) Act, 1945, which provides that the Minister shall, on application, grant a licence for the export of an article to which the Act applies. Before issuing a licence he may, under the Act, request facilities to make photographic copies of the article which it is proposed to export and in such case the licence shall not be granted unless the request has been complied with.</P>
      <P>Numerous applications are made each year for export licences under the Act.  In the year 1976 the number of licences granted was 333.  No order has been made under section 2 (2) of the Act.  Under section 2 (3) of the Act an order entitled &ldquo;the Document and Pictures (Regulation of Export) Exclusion Order, 1946&rdquo;&mdash;Statutory Rules and Orders 1946, No. 334&mdash;was made, which provided for the exclusion from the operation of the Act of &ldquo;documents being title deeds of properties lodged with a bank as security and passing between the head offices and branches of banks in the ordinary course of business&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>All applications for licences under the Act are referred to the Director of the National Library for action on behalf of the Minister.  The question of referring applications to outside sources for advice does not arise. Sculpture is not governed by the Act. Under subsection 4 (2) of the Act facilities for the making of photographic copies of the following were requested by the Minister and granted to him before licences were issued: a portrait of Parnell, the Gormanstown register, and parts of certain books from the King's Inns Library.</P>
      <P>The question of prosecution does not arise under the Act.</P>
