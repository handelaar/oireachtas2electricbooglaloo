      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>When I assumed office as Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries in 1973, one of the matters awaiting resolution was the re-organisation of the agricultural advisory service.  It was a subject of which I think I can claim to have some modest experience and in which I have always had a very considerable interest.  I found that submissions had been received from every possible organisation and group that could conceivably be associated with the topic.  As might be expected, the recommendations put forward were wide-ranging and covered the whole spectrum of possible solutions.  If there was any common factor among the many suggestions submitted, it was the advisory service needed to be reorganised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In concurring with this sentiment, I have no wish to belittle the services which the committees of agriculture and their members have given in the past and, indeed, continue to provide; nor is it my intention to decry the contribution <Col N="1074" /> to agricultural development of the many committed men and women who constitute our present advisory service, or their predecessors over the past 70-odd years.  It was clear, however, that the increasing demands on its facilities had revealed a number of weaknesses in the existing structure of the service, arising from divided control, lack of overall leadership and direction, unsatisfactory career structure, excessive movement of staff and the absence of specialist and support services, among other things.</P>
    <P>With the increasing urgency for the most efficient techniques in agricultural production, processing and marketing which our recent accession to the European Economic Community imposed and the realisation of the contribution the advisory service would make in this direction, it seemed to me imperative that rather than seek any further views I should concern myself with the formulation of proposals to remedy the defects in the existing system, which I have already outlined, and endeavour to provide a structure that would, as well, be of the utmost benefit to farmers and the agricultural industry.  I was anxious to have a system which would bring together in one organisation the different services that are working for the benefit of agriculture and in a manner that would promote good working relations between them.  It seemed desirable that the farm and other rural organisations be involved so that they would have an effective say in the activities of the new organisation. I had to bear in mind also my responsibility to the Government and the Oireachtas regarding the overall policy that might be followed by whatever structure would eventually be established.</P>
    <P>I am convinced that, as the existing advisory, education and research services have a common objective, it is necessary to group these together in one unit and to provide a common direction to ensure the necessary co-ordination and co-operation between them.  I look forward to a situation where the existing network of agricultural colleges, research stations and farm training centres will have the <Col N="1075" /> greatest possible influence on farming in the surrounding areas.  Training courses at educational institutions will provide young farmers with the knowledge and skills which already exist; the advisory service will continue to keep the knowledge of practising farmers up to date and the task of the research arm will be to generate new knowledge as well as to provide answers to problems arising within the industry.</P>
    <P>These aims, objectives and proposals were set out in the White Paper which was laid before this House in April, 1975, and the measure now before you is intended to give legislative effect to Government policy as outlined in that document.</P>
    <P>The explanatory memorandum circulated to Deputies gives particulars of the provisions of the Bill and, except for the more important proposals, I do not intend to go into them in very great detail.  I should like to emphasise however that, as indicated in the memorandum, the Bill was prepared following consideration of submissions from farmers' organisations, the council of An Foras Talúntais, the National Science Council, the Irish Veterinary Association and the Association of State-aided Agricultural Colleges as well as from the trade unions and staff associations representing the interests of staff affected by the White Paper proposals.  These submissions were in the majority of cases followed by discussions with representatives of the organisations concerned.</P>
    <P>The two most important elements of section 2 relate to the respective definitions of &ldquo;agriculture&rdquo; and &ldquo;research&rdquo;. &ldquo;Agriculture&rdquo; as defined in the Bill represents an expansion of the definition in the existing statutes to cover the widest spectrum of agricultural activities and includes such items an animal nutrition, farm management, agricultural economics and marketing, together with the processing of agricultural products, which did not appear in the previous legislation.  Plant breeding has been specifically included in the definition of &ldquo;research&rdquo; so as to enable the authority to perform a function which has hitherto not been exercised <Col N="1076" /> by An Foras Talúntais.  It has been necessary, however, to exclude from the definition the testing and grading of animals and products regarding which the Minister has a statutory or regulatory responsibility.</P>
    <P>The transfer to the authority of the different functions in relation to education, agricultural advice and research, as provided for in sections 11 to 18, are in accordance with the directions in the White Paper; but it will be observed that in the exercise of the activities concerned, the authority are obliged to make themselves aware of similar facilities being provided by kindred institutions to avoid overlapping in these spheres and the authority must co-operate with these institutions on a mutual basis as opportunity offers.  The advisory functions of the authority are, as will be noted from section 15, specifically orientated towards the individual farmer, and this obligation is further strengthened under section 30, which deals with the powers and duties of the board of the authority.  The board are required to lay special emphasis on ensuring that the services provided by the authority have the greatest possible effect on agricultural productivity at local level.  The research functions set out at section 17 correspond with those at present carried out by An Foras Talúntais, with the addition of responsibility for basic veterinary research.  Section 20 provides for the closer integration within the authority of the schemes of aid to farmers, referred to in the White Paper, if this is considered desirable.</P>
    <P>The activities of the authority as I am sure Deputies will appreciate, are most diverse, if not diffuse and it seemed to me, therefore, necessary that it should have on its board the benefit of advice and experience of people engaged in or concerned with as many as possible of these diverse functions, without, at the same time seriously reducing the board's effectiveness because of too large a membership. The board of 24 members as proposed in section 25 seems to me to be a reasonable compromise between these possibly competing objectives and it will also be observed that provision is made in the Second Schedule <Col N="1077" /> for a considerable measure of continuity as between one board and the next.  In accordance with the provisions of the White Paper, the Board will be composed of members nominated by the General Council of Committees of Agriculture together with members representatives of agricultural and rural organisations, the staff of the authority, the universities, the State-aided schools and such other agricultural interests as may be prescribed in a statutory order, which will provide machinery for selection and nomination of board members.</P>
    <P>The new authority will be an integrated national service and will be constituted as an executive agency of the Minister on the broad lines visualised in the Devlin Report.  It is necessary, therefore, that a minimum of control should be exercised over its activities by the Minister and this is provided for in sections 32 and 44. Under section 32 the board is required to prepare in respect of each financial year a programme of its projected activities and, under section 44 it is required to prepare annually an estimate of its expenditure and receipts. The programme and estimate will be subject to the approval of the Minister, and the board may not engage, without the Minister's consent, in activities other than those appearing in the programme, or incur expenditure in excess of that appearing in the approved budget.  Apart from these restrictions, the authority is free to operate within the entire ambit of its statutory functions.</P>
    <P>The committees of agriculture will, as indicated in Part IV of the Bill, no longer have responsibility for the local advisory and educational functions, but they are empowered to prepare an annual advisory and educational programme for their counties.  These programmes must be considered by the board and account taken of them by the board in preparing its annual programme of activities to be submitted for the approval of the Minister.  The committees will, in addition, have the important watch-dog function mentioned in Section 36, not only in relation to the board's activities, but in relation to centrally administered agricultural schemes <Col N="1078" /> also.  Section 43 provides for the recognition of the General Council of Committees of Agriculture referred to in paragraph 3.3 of the White Paper, and, under section 42, it is indicated that, in future, not more than half the members of the committees will be county councillors; the remaining members will be nominated by voluntary rural organisations active in the county, the organisations and their representatives to be determined by the Minister under a statutory order.</P>
    <P>The revenue of the authority will be derived from State grants, contributions from the county rate, the proceeds of certain investments at present in the hands of the Agricultural Institute, fees for services undertaken on behalf of persons or bodies availing of the authority's research and kindred services, from donations and contributions by farming organisations, agricultural co-operative societies, and so on and from the proceeds of sales of stock and and institutions.  The State endowment will be in two parts, namely, an annual capital grant of such amount as may be determined by the Minister with the approval of the Minister for Finance and an annual grant towards current expenses which shall not in real terms be less than the total amount provided for the activities concerned in the financial year immediately preceding the establishment of the authority.</P>
    <P>In order to make satisfactory arrangements for appropriate contributions from the county rates in respect of the local advisory and educational functions being transferred to the authority, it has been necessary to alter the present system.  Hitherto, the amount of the rates contribution for agricultural services in each county was entirely within the discretion of the county council concerned.  In future, however, each committee of agriculture will be required to furnish each year to the Minister proposals in respect of its expenditure on the services being retained by it and, having considered these, the Minister will issue a certificate authorising the committee to demand from its council a sum which will include provision for the committee's expenditure on its retained services and also in respect of the estimated cost to the authority of providing <Col N="1079" /> in the county the advisory and educational services which were formerly made available by the committee.  The council is obliged to pay the full amount of the demand to the committee and the committee in its turn must remit to the authority the certified estimated cost of the advisory and educational services in the county.  The income accuring to the authority under the annual local contributions from committees of agriculture may, under section 47, be used only in support of the advisory and educational services formerly provided by the committees. Section 50 extends to the authority powers to borrow for the purpose of the administration and operation of its functions.  This facility is not available to the Agricultural Institute; Part VI of the Bill deals with the transfer of property and staff to the authority.</P>
    <P>The entire property in the hands of the committees of agriculture and An Foras Talúntais will be transferred to the authority on the commencement of section 53.</P>
    <P>By far the most valuable portion of the property to be transferred from the committees will be the agricultural education centres and office premises provided by them since they became corporate bodies in 1958.  The cost of providing these facilities was met in roughly equal proportions from State grants and local rates contributions. Although I am advised that there is no strict legal obligation on me in this respect, I consider it only equitable that the local bodies should be compensated for the contributions they have made towards the expense of providing these facilities.  It is, accordingly, proposed under section 58 to pay compensation in respect of half the net value of the assets of the committees to be transferred to the authority and this will be done on the basis of a direct payment to the committees proportionate to their expenditure on their retained services in the year prior to integration, the balance to be covered by an appropriate increase in the annual State grant to the authority and a corresponding reduction in the demand <Col N="1080" /> from the committees on the county councils concerned.  This arrangement will serve, to some slight degree, towards a reduction in local rates.</P>
    <P>It will be recalled that, on the establishment of An Foras Talúntais in 1958, a generous subvention was made by the United States authorities out of grant counterpart funds to support the activities of the institute and to assist it in acquiring lands and premises and other facilities of a capital nature. These moneys constituted the capital and endownment funds of the institute. At present, the capital fund is nearly exhausted, but the endownment fund of £1 million is still intact.  An agreement has very recently been reached with the United States Government terminating the obtained agreement and concurring in proposals from the Irish Government as to the disposal of the residual funds.  It has, accordingly, been decided, as set out in section 54 of the Bill, to transfer the moneys in the endownment fund and any unexpended balance in the capital fund of the authority which may be utilised for such capital purposes in relation to any of the functions of the new authority as may be approved by the Minister, after consultation with the Minister for Finance.  I should like to place on record on my own behalf and on behalf of my colleagues in the Government, our satisfaction with and appreciation of the generosity and co-operation of the United States authorities in this regard.</P>
    <P>Section 53 sets out the properties of the Minister to be transferred to the authority.  As you will note from the explanatory memorandum, the line followed is to transfer lands and premises where more than 50 per cent of the work concerns research, education or agricultural advice and, therefore, only the agricultural schools at Athenry, Clonakilty, Ballyhaise and Kildalton will become the absolute property of the authority.  The Minister's interest in the cereal station at Ballinacurra, County Cork, will also be transferred under this arrangement, but the Minister will retain such property or premises at these locations as are required by him for such activities as do not come within the province of the authority.  The Minister <Col N="1081" /> may, however, under section 60 transfer by statutory order not only these retained properties, but any other property, in course of time that he considers should be made over to the authority.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 2.2 of the White Paper states that the staff of the authority will comprise the existing staffs of the committees of agriculture, An Foras Talúntais and the relevant staff of the Department of Agriculture together with such personnel as may subsequently be recruited.  Provision for this is made in section 65 which proposes that the entire staff of the committees and of An Foras will be transferred on the commencement of the relevant section, together with such members of the staff of the Department of Agriculture as may be designated by the Minister.  Every member of the transferred staff will carry with him such rights as he now possesses in relation to remuneration and conditions of service and will be subject to such obligations as apply to him in his existing service.</P>
    <P>Similar provisions are made under section 66 in relation to superannuation. The superannuation provisions prescribe that credit will be given for previous pensionable service, whether under local authorities, or the State and in the case of officers of committees of agriculture their rights under the local government superannuation code to the addition, in certain circumstances, of years to pensionable service have been preserved.  In response to representations from a number of staff associations, section 69 has been inserted to provide an appeal procedure for any member of the transferred staff who may consider he has a grievance in relation to his conditions of service or to superannuation on his transfer to the new authority.</P>
    <P>It should be understood, in regard to the staff and superannuation provisions of the Bill, that, as indicated in sections 34 and 35, a united and co-ordinated system of grading, remuneration, control and conditions of service and pension for the entire staff of the authority is eventually envisaged and that the specific arrangements in <Col N="1082" /> this connection set out in sections 65 to 69 are intended to deal with contingencies arising in the interval between the transfer of staff to the authority and the approval of the staff and superannuation schemes referred to in sections 34 and 35.</P>
    <P>As the establishment of the authority will result in the transfer of existing services to unified control, no expenditure of any magnitude is foreseen.  The proposal in section 59 to pay compensation in respect of property transferred from the committees of agriculture will, however, involve some additional State expenditure but it is not estimated to appreciably exceed £100,000 in all.</P>
    <P>In coming to a close, I should like to acknowledge my indebtedness to the many organisations which have made submissions and offered advice leading to the formulation of the White Paper and the consequent legislation now before you and I would hope that they would find some reflection of their ideas in these documents.</P>
    <P>The publication of the White Paper and this Bill represents in my view a very significant milestone in the development of services for farmers and the agricultural industry.  The proposals outlined in the Bill offer, to my mind, the best means of providing the kind of service which the farming community and the agricultural industry require and which can be provided for them and I look forward to securing from all concerned the enthusiastic support and co-operation which will ensure that the measures now proposed will greatly benefit farmers and the agricultural industry as a whole.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>We on this side of the House accept that there is a need for the reorganisation and the revision of what are known generally as the advisory services.  Having said that I turn to the last paragraph of the Minister's speech&mdash;the fanfare paragraph&mdash; where he says that:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proposals outlined in the Bill offer, to my mind, the best means of providing the kind of service <Col N="1083" /> which the farming community and the agricultural industry require and which can be provided for them and I look forward to securing from all concerned the enthusiastic support and co-operation which will ensure that the measures now proposed will greatly benefit farmers and the agricultural industry as a whole.</P>
    <P>There is nothing in the Bill which would indicate that the measures proposed by the Minister deserve either the enthusiastic support or any other kind of support of the farming community. Neither do these proposals offer any improvement in the present situation which the Minister finds satisfactory.</P>
    <P>One need only apply the acid test: to look at the situation in which young agricultural graduates coming from our universities have no prospect of jobs from the advisory services or from any other State or semi-State source.  Consequently, the Minister's expression of hope from the farming community is a lot of poppycock and should be recognised as such.</P>
    <P>Section 10 of the Bill contains no more than a few words.  These are that &ldquo;the Institute is hereby dissolved&rdquo;. Section 25 provides that there shall be a board to be known as the Board of the National Agricultural Advisory, Education and Research Authority to carry out the general government of the authority and the general administration of the affairs of the authority.  Let us put both those provisions together and see what is proposed.  An Foras Talúntais have been in existence for about 19 years.  This organisation have a very fine record and an international reputation, a body to which there was easy access by the farming community and which have produced research of the kind that is of vital importance to Irish farmers.</P>
    <P>One case that comes to mind immediately is the research and the effects of that research carried out by the institute in relation to sheep flocks in the west, especially in relation to the Galway breed.  But that is only one of the many cases.  It is proposed now <Col N="1084" /> to dissolve the institute in one fell swoop.  I am afraid this is being done at the request and in order to gratify personal whims of certain personages in Dublin whose connection with the agricultural industry is rather tenuous. For that reason alone the Bill deserves to be thrown out.  What is proposed is the cold-blooded dissolution of the Agricultural Institute, one of the institutions of which we can be proud and one of the few institutions which the farmers have come to rely on and to have resourse to personally in matters of specialised advice.</P>
    <P>The Bill proposes to establish a board of 24 people under a chairman all of whom will be nominated by the Minister.  It would be foolish not to have regard to the performance of the Government in the formation of Government boards and the patronage that they have practised since they came to office in this regard.  It is notorious.</P>
    <P>To use the famous words, it has been a &ldquo;thundering disgrace&rdquo;.  Every Government board has been loaded up with party hacks.  The performance of the Government in the appointment of membership of Government boards has been an absolute disgrace and we cannot hope for any radical change in the thinking of the Government.  We will have the shreds and tatters of the once fine institution that we established, An Foras Talúntais, being administered by a crowd of people who must be called party hacks because that is what they are going to be.  One has only to look at the people who were removed from State boards immediately on the accession to power of the present Government and look at the people who have replaced them, whether it be in Bord Fáilte or an agricultural board.  It is a bad day for agriculture that this should happen.  The notion that a group of people such as this should be in the position not only to influence but to control agricultural research or any other kind of research is not acceptable to any rational person. Research, by defination, must be free from the interference of interested people of one kind or another.</P>
    <P>It would be wrong not to recognise that there has been a certain tension between the Agricultural Institute and <Col N="1085" /> the other areas of agriculture since the establishment of the institute.  This is no reason for its dissolution.  I earnestly draw the Minister's attention to the undeniable fact that the dissolution of the Agricultural Institute, An Foras Talúntais, is an unwarranted shameful thing to do.  I believe it is being done for unworthy reasons.  A very grave disservice is being done to the industry to which I belong by people who have no right to do it. Even now there is speculation as to the eventual identity of the person who will preside over the board of this new organisation.  I think I know who it is going to be.  Even if he may have blotted his copy in recent times in the matter of the clash within the Government about the appointment of the new European Commissioner, I still think our friend will make it.  That, too, is a bad thing for the future of agriculture in this country.  Worst of all, it is sad and shameful that agriculture should be dragged into the mire of cheapjack party politics as is happening now in this Bill.  I belong to the farming industry and I do not want to see that happening to it.  I do not want to see the Agricultural Institute being destroyed because it served me well as a farmer and it served the industry to which I belong.  The unworthy insupportable reasons for its dissolution should be disregarded.</P>
    <P>The title of the authority which is proposed, gives some small indication of the condescension and the paternalism of the people who conceived this Bill and it shows the total absence of any new thinking, of any penetration of new illumination, a total failure to recognise the transformation that has taken place among the young people on the land in the past 20 years or so. In the very word &ldquo;education&rdquo; lies the implication that until the arrival of this authority the people of the land were uneducated people who had to be taken by the hand and put on the path to progress by the more enlightened.  The drafters of this Bill for which the Minister must take responsibility are plainly unaware of this change.  They still want to act in a paternalistic way and still feel that if any of the exercise of power is to be given to the people of the land in the carrying out of their business, <Col N="1086" /> it had better be given with the greatest caution by people who know better than they.  That concept is shown by the incorporation of the word &ldquo;education&rdquo; in the title of the Bill.  It reveals a world of being out of touch with the agricultural industry.</P>
    <P>The day that young men and women went into agriculture after leaving primary school is gone.  When one is talking about educating people for agriculture one is talking about a good basic general agriculture and thereafter specialised training.  There is an important difference not appreciated by the Minister, between training and education. A concept enshrined in the word &ldquo;instructor&rdquo; as opposed to the word &ldquo;adviser&rdquo; is enshrined in this Bill. &ldquo;Instructor&rdquo; suggests the young university graduate going among primitive people to teach them how to use a hoe, a spade, or a plough.  This is not how it is on the land at present.  We are dealing with a new educated rural population, certainly in need of specialised training, specialised courses, and on the job courses for both men and women in the industry.  Except in the expansion of the definition of the word &ldquo;agriculture&rdquo; at the beginning, there is a failure to recognise that agriculture does not mean just the production of crops any more, if it ever did mean that.  Agriculture means the processing and selling of the produce of the land. I can find no indication in this Bill except in that passing allusion that there is a new era dawning and a new race of men far better trained than we were are now taking possession of the land.  The primitive or fairly primitive notions conceived in the old parish plan are being carried over into this new legislation and the parish plan is at variance with the requirements of the country now.  We need to expand our horizons.  This Bill is infested with the notion of the parish plan.  I use the word &ldquo;infested&rdquo; advisedly because that is what it means.  It is a stultifying stupefying notion that one should enclose the thinking of people in a parish plan concept as this document does.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to tell me in what part of this Bill is there a promise of a better advisory service. He referred to it as a better educational <Col N="1087" /> service but I would call it a training service.  Is the super-imposition of yet another bureaucracy going to improve the situation?  I do not think it is.  Is there any mechanism in the Bill for the securing of a better system of promotion or a better system of job prospects for the people in the advisory service?  If there is, I cannot see it.  Neither do I see how it can be procured by an organisation presided over by people whom I shall call party nominees, in order to avoid calling them worse.  There are no prospects to be seen in this Bill for giving a better service or a service manned by more people.  There are graduates down the street working in bars and on the docks but all this Bill offers is jobs for the boys.  There are no jobs for the graduates, for the specialists and for the people for whom this Bill should cater&mdash;not a damn prospect.  The Minister has nothing to boast about here.</P>
    <P>The Minister made some passing allusions to the arrangements for the financing of the activities of the new committees of agriculture who seem to be stripped of any vestige of power. It appears to me that we are heading towards a situation where we will have taxation through the county rate without any kind of representation.  The scheme of things will have to be decided upon by the Minister, presumably in consultation with his 24 nominees.</P>
    <P>This Bill was conceived without any regard to the profound changes adumbrated by the farm modernisation directives, especially Directives Nos. 160 and 161.  I am not aware of any reference to the need for the establishment of socio-economic advice systems under the general ambit of Directive 161.  I do not think there is any such reference.  The bones of this Bill have been hanging around for years, long before Directives 160 and 161 saw the light of day in Ireland.</P>
    <P>This Bill is dowdy and unimaginative. It is building on out-of-date and obsolete foundations.  There is no indication of any new thinking in the Bill.  There is no recognition <Col N="1088" /> of the fact that Irish farming is at the crossroads, a crossroads that will probably decide the eventual fate of the whole country in that we are on our own now.  We can develop our food industry and our food processing industry or sell it to the multi-nationals.  That will happen in the next ten years.  There are very dramatic and radical changes that must be made in the make-up of the management structures of our co-operative industry.  If they are not made, the ownership of these co-operatives will pass from our hands into the hands of foreigners and strangers.</P>
    <P>It is necessary to think of an advisory service, a training service, that will deal with the agriculture industry as a whole from the production of crops by the people of the land to the sale of the finished product on the export market.  We must begin to think of programmed, planned production from beginning to end.  Again, there is no glimmer of recognition in the Bill of what I consider to be an urgent factor.</P>
    <P>It is very difficult to say anything good about the Bill because apart from creating a new bureaucracy, of creating jobs for the boys, I cannot see any glimmer of hope for the improvement of the situation the Bill purports to improve.  It is not there. Speaking as a farmer, I reject it out of hand.  It is no good.  If it does serve any useful purpose, it may be that it will stimulate discussion.  Its very hollowness, its vacuousness and its emptyness will underline and draw attention to the total failure of the Minister even to recognise the urgency of the problems that confront the industry at present.</P>
    <P>Instead the Minister without any reason abolishes the best establishment we have created for many a day. The ostensible reason I understand is that the mechanism for the transmission of the information produced by research is found by some people to be defective.  This is not so and I have personal experience of this.  As a farmer, I have consulted directly many times with the Agricultural Institute and I found them excellent.  All the <Col N="1089" /> dairy farmers in Munster and many in Leinster have been in and out of Moore Park many times, the cattle men have been in and out of Grange and tillage men have visited the machinery and research station in Carlow.  The farmers have always resorted to the institute.  It is a very important part of their business.  I am afraid it is going to be stultified and circumscribed by the provisions of this Bill.  That is a situation that cannot be allowed to continue for very long because it will break the morale of the institute.  The institute have demonstrated that Irish agricultural scientists, left on their own and given a fair chance, are equal to any in the world. This is recognised throughout the length and breadth of Europe and beyond.</P>
    <P>This Bill does not give us a lead into the type of advisory service we should have and the House should therefore reject it.  The Minister may push it through the House and thereby do serious damage to the industry.  It will be rejected by the people in the industry and by all working farmers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>It astonishes me to see the Fine Gael benches empty.  I can speak with a little authority on the subject of agricultural advisers, having been associated with them for many years.  I served on the General Council of County Committees of Agriculture and on that body I was among only two or three who were not from the benches opposite.  All were opposed to the taking over of the advisory services by the Department.  They are not here.  Of course they will vote for this Bill but they should be here to voice their opinions.  In particular, I would have expected to see the new Minister for Defence and Deputy McDonald in the House today because I have no doubt they share my views.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was in a hopeless minority on a sub-committee of the general council. When we first got aid from the US, various opinions were given as to the kind of institute we should have.  Some people at that time were in favour of a new university with powers to confer degrees in agriculture and others <Col N="1090" /> expressed opinions in favour of a research institute.  The Agricultural Institute were set up and they have done an excellent job in the meantime. As a member of a rural organisation I served on a small committee which did a lot of research and we came out in favour of amalgamation of research and education.  At the time we proposed an autonomous board.  The board of the Agricultural Institute were autonomous but this Bill will change that.  The new board will come completely and entirely under the Department without any room for manouever.  The Minister will have power to sanction everything.  Ministers for Agriculture come and go and as a farmer I am not prepared to allow any Minister for Agriculture to have the measure of control over the new board that this Bill will give to him.  The new board will be directing agricultural policy for years to come.</P>
    <P>At the time I mentioned earlier, we recommended that agricultural policy should be controlled by an autonomous body on which there would be a majority of representatives of county committees of agriculture with representation from other sectors.  We hoped then that we would get a faculty in agriculture in UCG like that in a dairy science in Cork University which has been of such benefit to the dairy farmers of Munster.  We wanted a research department for the suggested faculty in Galway.  We sent deputations to the then Taoiseach, Deputy Costello.  What we got was a research institute which it is proposed to abolish by this Bill.  At that time we recommended that research results should be channelled directly to working farmers because the farmer is the man who counts in the industry&mdash;he knows the practical problems of working on the land.</P>
    <P>It is evident there will be very few practical farmers on this board of 24. From what the Minister has said and from the white paper, I foresee there will be only about eight farmer representatives. We have not been told from which organisations they will come.  I ask the Minister seriously to consider the views of elected representatives on the composition of this <Col N="1091" /> board which appears to be loaded against ordinary public representatives.</P>
    <P>When the Agricultural Institute was established I did not think the information from the research done would be channelled back to the farmers as efficiently as it has been done.  This new board is being set up at a time when agricultural advisers are engaged in much heavier work than previously. At the moment county committees of agriculture are doing their best to implement EEC Directive 161 and we want to be sure that ordinary farmers will get the full benefit of that directive and that its import will not be confined to people dealing in theories.  Only about 4 per cent of the farmers in my area will be involved in development plans and they are not in a position to avail of research in regard to such plans.  The directives must be changed to bring in 50 per cent.  The services should be expanded because, if they are not expanded, there will be no hope of servicing these directives.</P>
    <P>County committees of agriculture work at grassroots level and they could give valuable assistance.  With regard to the classification of potential development farmers, the Minister knows that only certain clearly defined people qualify under the farm retirement scheme.  I believe that any young farmer who is doing well should be classified as a potential development farmer.  On the question of joint management, both the Minister and his opposite number are pupils of the joint council.  Both served on that council. The graduates from that particular school were not at all bad.  There are several county committees of agriculture and, as far as I know, they are not all that bad.  There may be some square pegs in round holes but that is the pattern pretty well everywhere.</P>
    <P>It is stated that at least one member of the new board will be appointed on the nomination of the Minister for Education and at least one member of the joint council of county committees. These committees have been running the advisory services.  It may be thought that they were not doing <Col N="1092" /> that work well enough.  The fact is that they were starved for money.  I was chairman of my own committee and I would have liked to do a great many things.  I would have liked to move faster on Directive 160 but we could spend only a certain amount and we could demand only a certain amount from the local authority.  We had to stay within a specific estimate. Ambitious young people with ideas could do nothing because the money was not there.</P>
    <P>I presume farming organisations will have a representative.  There are many facets which should be represented. But I cannot see the board coming from grassroots level.  Experience is all important and theory without experience is pretty useless.  The man of practical experience knows what can and cannot be done and a substantial number on that board should be ordinary farmers.  There should also be public representatives.  It is said that this body must demand from the local authority a certain sum of money.  That is something we could never do in the past.  We were allowed very little.  The Minister mentions the amount of property that will be transferred from the county committees to the new board and he says this may keep down the rates.  It may do that for one year. When the property is bought by way of compensation the rates will have to be paid.  In Leinster it is 50/50 and in the west 75/25.  That is the position at the moment.  The rates will have to be paid.</P>
    <P>The Minister talked about giving back authority to local people.  This is actually taking away authority from local level.  Politics never entered into county committees of agriculture except, perhaps, on the election of the chairman.  Once that was over politics were never mentioned.  The committees worked in the interests of the farmer. I was in a minority on my committee but what I had to say was respected. We brought in certain recommendations. We consulted various organisations. We did not have complete agreement but we worked very well together. Public representatives are the guardians of the ratepayers and they have to give an account of their stewardship to the <Col N="1093" /> ratepayers.  The people on this new board will not have to go back to the people and give an account of their stewardship.  People from rural organisations would be the ideal on this proposed board.</P>
    <P>I am very disappointed.  The Minister is a cute politician.  We are in an election year and no one knows how many will get representation on this board.  It is like the budget&mdash;a little bit for everybody.  What should be spelled out is not spelled out.  The Minister knows a great many will be claiming entitlement to representation. All we are sure of here is that there will be one member from the General Council of Committees of Agriculture to represent those committees.</P>
    <P>I am sorry I will have to oppose this Bill.  It is a complete takeover.  We are totally opposed to it and if I were on that side of the House and it was my Minister who was bringing it in, I would give my own opinion and say that I could not approve of it.  I would go with my own party, but surely the people who are voting will agree with me.  I hope that on Committee Stage they will try to change it because this is not a political issue and I am not one who will make a political football of it.  It was agreed by all political parties that we would not accept the type of board put before us here today.</P>
    <P>As regards the question of specialists, we have been advocating specialists very strongly for a long time.  We had not got specialists and it was only recently that they were trained.  I remember a man on Galway County Committee of Agriculture six years ago.  He said he was associated with pigs and that it was hard to get a specialist on them.  A specialist should be employed where there would not be a big concentration of pigs, and the same applies to specialists in dairying. Perhaps two counties could employ the one specialist.  The county committees and the general council are 100 per cent in favour of any advance educationally in this line.  We want progress.</P>
    <P>Another matter of vital importance, particularly in the west of Ireland, is referred to in the White Paper where it is stated:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1094" /> ... the Farm Development Service whose function it will be to ensure that the scheme services operating in the county are available to all farmers requiring them and that priority is given to those farmers operating modernisation schemes...</P>
    <P>That would be 4 per cent in that county, people who, in fairness, are the least in need of the advice.</P>
    <P>The Minister has charge of lands.  I have reservations.  Any forward thinking designed to save small farms and to make them viable emanates from the General Council of County Committees of Agriculture because we are the grassroots and we know what to say.  I am afraid that, if this goes on, the majority of the people, excellent thought they are, will have no respect for the social side of agriculture.  We on the county committee are watchdogs and if the watchdog is not able to bark he is not of much use.  If he has his teeth pulled out, he will not do much.  In my view the teeth are drawn from the watchdogs.  We are going to be mere talking machines from now on.  Never was there more need for a good watchdog with good teeth than there is at present.</P>
    <P>At the moment we have to see that the country is not being swept from the small farmers.  Something to be considered in connection with agriculture is the question of the Land Commission being able to buy land.  This is under the Minister's umbrella now. Land in the west is £60 an acre and in the east it is £120 an acre.  There is an option to buy at half the price.  They can buy it out after getting it from the Land Commission, but if a man in the west of Ireland gets 15 acres from the Land Commission he gets £15 an acre to buy it out or he pays £50 or £60 rent.  We will have to be thinking of some kind of loan to put down to get that money.  He has not a hope.  This question will have to be gone into very seriously and this is where the county committees of agriculture and the general council are concerned.</P>
    <P>I have reservations about the abolition of the Ministry of Lands at this time.  It may not be exactly relevant to the matter we are discussing but, in <Col N="1095" /> passing, I want to say that the most serious situation at this moment is the question of an injection of money to try to get land for people.  They must get the land first.  The Minister has a big responsibility.  There is much to be done in the development of agriculture. I am hoping that there will be a man with a dynamic outlook on the question of land.  The land question would be moving along with a very small budget each year.  Now it is all under the umbrella of the Department of Agriculture and the Minister has the responsibility.  I am not prepared to go along with the Minister in the handing over of all authority to the Department. This board is completely tied up and whoever occupies the Minister's seat&mdash;and I am casting no reflection on him&mdash;has complete control.  That is something I will never accept.  If it were an autonomous board as the old Agricultural Institute was, I would be criticising the constitution of it but I would not be too much against it.</P>
    <P>I will have a lot to say on Committee Stage, but I am very disappointed that we have not the people involved in agriculture and that good men on that side will not come in and give their views on this.  We discuss it in a general way.  I do not believe that anybody will agree with the constitution of the board.  As I said before, the Ministry is a new one and if the university come up they will say: &ldquo;How are you going to divide goods?&rdquo;  There is no indication of how it is going to be divided and the ordinary farmer and the ordinary man has no practical experience of it at all.</P>
    <P>Criticism has been levelled at the county committees of agriculture. When I was a very young man I was on the Galway County Committee of Agriculture.  We had two instructors and nobody wanted them at that time. I want to pay tribute to Macra but it could not exist without the advisory services of the county committees of agriculture who were in the forefront of every move in the right direction. Organisations throughout the country operated under the county committees of agriculture, but they operated independently.  I hear people saying <Col N="1096" /> the instructors should be under this, that or the other, but I wonder will they be as free to give advice to all farmers as they were under the county committees of agriculture.</P>
    <P>Nobody has ever come to me in Galway and said the advisers were not ready to help and assist anybody, anywhere, when a move was made to improve the lot of the farmers.  The only thing wrong with the county committees of agriculture was that they had no money.  In the old days you could do nothing with the money we had, and you can do nothing with it now.  A directive will come down to us at county level and we will be expected to levy it on the rates.  The committee will be expected to pass on the directive to the county council and that is something I cannot and will not accept.</P>
    <P>I should like to be supporting this Bill but I cannot support it because of the composition of the board.  It is against everything we ever talked about.  I am surprised that a man of the Minister's calibre, an ex-pupil of the general council, should make so little of that body and the county committees as to say they will have one member on a board of 24 to run the advisory services which they have been running fairly efficiently.  Quite a number of them&mdash;and we have done this in my own county&mdash;have opened educational centres.  We have appointed our educational director.  I was present when certificates were given to all types of farmers.  Every effort is being made to educate people in modern developments in farming through the county committees of agriculture and through the general council.</P>
    <P>The problem is staff and money. We have not got the staff.  It may be said we have enough instructors. Many instructors are idle at the moment.  We have been looking for a few extra in my county and we have not got sanction yet.  We have also asked for clerical staff to allow the instructor to go out and do what he was trained to do.  He was not trained to have a heap of books in front of him.  He got a degree in agricultural science to go out into the field and tell the farmers what to do.  We cannot <Col N="1097" /> get sanction for staff.  The committees may be criticised because they have not got the money to do forward planning.  Deputy Hussey is a member of Galway County Council and he knows that we are tied hand and foot.  We cannot go forward. That is why I think the Minister has made a grave mistake.</P>
    <P>This should not be a political football. The decision by the General Council was unanimous.  I know the Minister can get the Second Reading of the Bill through the House by force of numbers but, when it comes to Committee Stage, he might agree to make some changes.  I have always said we should be willing to accept change.  I have seen many changes in my time and I have always gone along with them.  I am not prepared to go along with change for change's sake. Having regard to their experience down through the years, the County Committees of Agriculture should get reasonable representation on this board.  The Minister should not have as much control as he has.  This should be an autonomous body.</P>
    <P>I personally will fight every section of the Bill relevant to what I have been talking about.  It is over 20 years since we first started discussing the Agricultural Institute and the type of advisory services we should have.  I sat on a number of committees.  I do not intend to accept the type of board proposed here today and I am disappointed in the Minister whom I hold in fairly high esteem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>Looking at this Bill the first thing one asks oneself is whether it will benefit agriculture generally.  Listening to the Minister's speech one has grave doubts about that. All the Bill is doing is transferring the staff and buildings from the county committees of agriculture to this authority.  Looking at the composition of the board, 24 members, and having regard to our previous experience of the Government's attitude towards those appointments, we cannot be blamed for being suspicious of the membership of the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The previous speaker mentioned the fact that there are very few Deputies on the Government benches.  That is <Col N="1098" /> an indication of the Government's approach to agriculture.  Empty benches, empty thinking.  After four years of Coalition Government, this is the type of Bill we have come to expect from them.  Their attitude to agriculture was outlined in the Estimates on 14th December, I think, prior to the Dáil recess when we saw a saving of £800,000 on fertiliser subsidies. That shows the lack of confidence in agriculture which has been generated by the Coalition.  They withdrew a fertiliser subsidy which was a mere pittance in comparison with current prices.  It was reduced from 62p per unit to 54p.  We object to their approach to this matter.</P>
    <P>This is the time to generate confidence in agriculture.  When we look at the composition of this board and the way it will be appointed, we are very suspicious that there will be, as there has been over the past few years, a great deal of political pull involved. It has been said that the county committees of agriculture will remain as watchdogs.  I say that they will remain as lapdogs.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated:</P>
    <P>I was anxious to have a system which would bring together in one organisation the different services that are working for the benefit of agriculture and in a manner that would promote good working relations between them.</P>
    <P>That seems to indicate that relations to date were not too good but in my view that is far from the true position. While at times we were critical of them they did good work.</P>
    <P>Our spokeman on Agriculture compared this Bill to the Parish Plan and I can see a resemblance to the views of James Dillon in parts of the Bill.  We want to improve the advisory service and generate confidence in agriculture.  The agricultural instructors are important but they have a big problem and I do not think the Bill will relieve it in any way.  The instructors on most occasions are preaching to the converted.  Until we reach out to the farmers who up to now have not availed of the advisory service to those <Col N="1099" /> who are most in need of such advice in the development of their holdings, we cannot claim any success.  I have noticed that at meetings in schools and halls, on tours to various farms, including those run by the Agricultural Institute, the best type of farmers take part.  The most effective way of contacting the farmers who have not availed of the advisory service is through the committees of agriculture. Until such farmers realise the benefits that can be derived from agricultural education and the proper use of the advisory service it is hard to see how agriculture can progress.</P>
    <P>In my view the Government have fallen down because they do not realise the potential of agriculture or the contribution it can make to the economy. The Minister told us of the agricultural projects that have collapsed in recent years.  He told us:</P>
    <P>The two most important elements of section 2 relate to the respective definitions of &ldquo;agriculture&rdquo; and &ldquo;research&rdquo;.  &ldquo;Agriculture&rdquo; as defined in the Bill represents an expansion of the definition in the existing statutes to cover the widest spectrum of agricultural activities and includes such items as animal nutrition, farm management, agricultural economics and marketing, together with the processing of agricultural products, which did not appear in the previous legislation. Plant breeding has been specifically included in the definition of &ldquo;research&rdquo;...</P>
    <P>The Government fell down in regard to plant breeding and the production of potatoes.  On many occasions I asked the Minister to outline his proposals for the improvement of the potato growing section of the industry but I heard little.  The Government permitted hay seed to be imported from countries outside the EEC with the result that the seed growing industry here was killed.  While we should be engaged in more research in these fields we have allowed those industries to die a slow death.</P>
    <P>Is agricultural education being curtailed or could it be further developed <Col N="1100" /> if it was embraced under the general educational system?  This should be examined closely particularly when one has regard to the fact that there has been a falling off in the number of applicants for positions in the agricultural colleges.  This was very noticeable in 1974 and 1975.  One would expect a greater demand for such places.  I notice that Ballyhaise will come under the control of the new authority but that St. Patrick's in Monaghan will not.  Those colleges could accept more pupils but the Government have not created any confidence in the future of the agricultural industry to encourage young farmers to attend them.</P>
    <P>I note that the Agricultural Institute will come under the umbrella of this new authority.  I hope the institute will continue to give a good service as they have done down the years. We fear that the activities of the agricultural advisers will be curtailed when under the control of the new authority.  Advisers have been of great benefit to the farming community and it is my hope that when they leave the control of the committees of agriculture they will continue to provide a good service.  I regret that there is no forward planning in the matter of the advisory service.  The Minister stated:</P>
    <P>I am convinced that, as the existing advisory, education and research services have a common objective, it is necessary to group these together in one unit and to provide a common direction to ensure the necessary co-ordination and co-operation between them.</P>
    <P>However, the Minister did not give any indication of what he has in mind.</P>
    <P>The Minister also stated:</P>
    <P>I should like to emphasise, however, that as indicated in the memorandum, the Bill was prepared following consideration of submissions from farmers' organisations, the council of An Foras Talúntais, the National Science Council, the Irish Veterinary Association and the Association of State-aided Agricultural Colleges&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1101" /> I would be interested in hearing the views of those bodies after they have read the debate on the Bill.</P>
    <P>A Bill is of no advantage if the Government do not endeavour to create confidence in the industry or if the Government do not make available sufficient funds to improve the advisory service.  We are all aware of the difficulties in the farm modernisation scheme and few of us are satisfied with the progress it is making in any county.  There is a big backlog of applications and more staff should be employed to deal with them.  The backlog exists at a time when farmers need to know their classification and other details so that they can programme in advance for their buildings, and so on.</P>
    <P>I believe there is not sufficient staff in many of those areas to handle the farm organisation applications.  There is very little in this Bill for anybody. It is just a transfer of staff and buildings from one body to another.  We on this side of the House are very disappointed with it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanToal" hpid="Mr. Toal Mr. Toal">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Toal</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to give a wholehearted welcome to this Bill.  It is a non-political measure designed simply to unify the various advisory services, the educational and research services, in the Department of Agriculture, to have all those services work in harmony and complement each other so that our farmers can get the best possible advice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many Deputies and certainly many farmers throughout the country will agree that there is a tremendous duplication of services in the Department of Agriculture.  Many farmers are annoyed with this.  This Bill will do a lot towards correcting that situation.  It is designed to streamline the advisory, research and educational programmes in the Department. This is for the good of the people in the Department, the county committees of agriculture throughout the country and farmers.  If all of those services do not get to the individuals farmer they will be of no avail.  The only uncertainty that will hang over this legislation is that it could become a one-way effort.  There can be a great streamlining from the top down but <Col N="1102" /> how does the individual farmer, when he looks for advice, work from the bottom up?</P>
    <P>Farmers throughout the country look on their local representative of the Department as their adviser in all farming matters.  He may only be in charge of farm buildings or some other section in the Department but the farmers look on him as their link-man between the Department and them.  If this Bill brings all the advisers under one roof and they consult with one another it will have done a great day's work. I hope the individual farmer on the ground will be helped by this Bill and that he will have easy access to the advisory services.</P>
    <P>Farmers were in a straitjacket in the past.  They were like students doing the leaving certificate.  If the student doing that examination does not concentrate on passing it he will not be a full student.  Similarly in the case of a farmer if he only contacts an adviser when he is looking for a grant and concentrates all his activities on securing the grant the advisory services are not performing their full task and that farmer is not taking everything he should out of them.  If the Bill does more to bring the agricultural advisers out into the open and more into contact with local farmers it will have done a good day's work.  There is great anxiety throughout the country that a lot of the agricultural advisers are spending 80 per cent of their time processing applications from farmers, are bogged down in paperwork and not getting out of their offices to have discussions with farmers.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see that the county committees of agriculture will be part of this new authority.  They will prepare annual programmes for their respective counties and these will have to be submitted to the authority where they will be given consideration.  I am also glad to see that the county committees of agriculture will be changed and that rural organisations will get representation.  Some county committees of agriculture have done this already but there are some who have given no representation to the farming <Col N="1103" /> organisations.  I am glad the Minister is giving statutory effect to the idea that farming organisations will receive representation on these committees.  I would like to congratulate the Minister for the enthusiasm with which he has introduced this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>I, like many of the other speakers this morning, am rather disappointed with the proposals outlined in the Bill.  We hoped for a different set-up in such a Bill.  When one considers any reorganisation of the agricultural advisory services one must take into account the development in agriculture in recent years, the new thinking in it and the many new schemes which have been put into operation as a result of our accession to the EEC.  How will this change improve the lot of farmers who should be our first consideration?  Will there be greater communication between the farmers and the advisory services under this reorganisation scheme? Will there be any extension of the advisory service?  Will counties that are still on a quota have to stick to their quota of advisers as they must at present?  Too much of the advisers' time is spent on paper work, as has been emphasised here by many speakers this morning.  New schemes have to be explained to farmers who have to be advised on how to apply for grants and so on and much of the advisers' time is taken up with this work.  I see no reason why the Department could not allow committees of agriculture to employ clerical officers who could relieve the advisers of much of this work.  Our committee asked that this should be done but we were refused.  Our application to appoint further temporary instructors was also refused even though there is great demand for them at present and even though we have a number of young graduates within the county who qualified as agricultural instructors in the past year and have been unable to find employment.  This is an unfortunate situation at a time when agriculture should be developed to the maximum and when there is such demand for those advisers.  They <Col N="1104" /> should be employed and the farmers should have the benefit of their advice.</P>
      <P>I remember when Directives 159 and 160 were issued and I recall the demand from the farmers for advice at that time.  It was very hard to get advice at any level and particularly at top level, by which I mean the Department of Lands and the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries, the two Departments then mainly responsible for the implementation of those directives. Here the advisory service within the county came into its own and they were the people from whom the farmers got this advice.  The advisers made every effort to brief themselves fully on those directives, how they would be implemented and how farmers could benefit from participation.  I compliment the advisers on that because they certainly did a very good job.</P>
      <P>We find that in the composition of the boards proposed by the Minister in this Bill, 50 per cent will be elected members.  I do not agree with this; I think elected members should have a majority on any board and this is one case where I think elected members are entitled to a majority.  I realise that voluntary organisations must be represented but you do not always get the best farmer appointed from those voluntary organisations.  At least the elected representative has to answer to the electorate every five years and he will not do anything drastic in the allocation of money or impose any severe tax on the people he represents because he knows he must go back to them at election time.  Therefore, he will act responsibly.  However, if you give a majority to non-elected members, they do not have to answer to anybody and they can put up all sorts of schemes and levy all kinds of demands on ratepayers since they know they will not have to face the ratepayers at election time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have seen the health boards operating and I do not think very many people at present are satisfied with the way they operate.  I wonder if the health of the community has been looked after more effectively as a result of introducing these health boards.  They are top heavy with officials, doctors and chemists and so <Col N="1105" /> on.  I should not like to see the same thing happen in this case because gradually we see the power and influence of elected representatives being eroded.  In most health boards elected representatives are not permitted to write or make a recommendation on behalf of an applicant for a job.  Would the same thing happen in boards of this kind?  Would the CEO at some future date, when an elected representative makes representations on behalf of a farmer who has a problem about a grant, use the threat that if this type of activity is going to be pursued the farmer might be disqualified from getting the grant?  This type of thing goes on and I would hate to see it develop in connection with what it is proposed to set up here.</P>
    <P>I also fear that power is being taken away from the counties and being vested in Kildare Street where all the decisions will be made.  I regard this as unfortunate.  Committees of agriculture will no longer have any real power and will merely be advisers.  These committees have made a considerable contribution to agriculture and have laid the foundation for the advancement that has taken place in it.  Their advisers have always been available to the farmers.  They have given lectures frequently in cold halls in winter and have always been available to give advice.  The farmers accepted and used this advice and we can see the benefit of it generally throughout the country.</P>
    <P>I am also concerned about financing. According to the Minister there is to be a contribution from county rates.  Hitherto the amount of the rates contribution for agricultural services in each county was entirely within the discretion of the county council concerned. In future each committee of agriculture will be required to furnish each year to the Minister proposals in respect of their expenditure on the services being retained by them and, having considered these, the Minister will issue a certificate authorising the committee to demand from their council a sum which will include provision for the committee's expenditure on their retained services, and also in respect of the estimated cost to the authority of providing in the county <Col N="1106" /> the advisory and educational services which were formerly made available by the committee.  Here is the most important thing of all in the Minister's statement:</P>
    <P>The council is obliged to pay the full amount of the demand to the committee and the committee in its turn must submit to the authority the certified estimated cost of the advisory and educational services in the county.</P>
    <P>The county council must pay whatever demand is made on them under this scheme but there is no guarantee in this legislation that the amount taken in rates will be spent in that county. This is a very serious omission.</P>
    <P>Heretofore the amounts levied on the county council were limited to a certain figure and the county had the power to change that if they wished. Under this Bill that power is also taken from them.  An Foras Talúntais are also abolised.  Why is that being done at this stage?  The Foras Talúntais research stations gave a great service to the farming communities by way of specialised advice on new buildings, machinery, sheep, with which we are concerned in the west, and so on.  It is unfortunate that they are being abolished now to make way for this new board which I consider will not do anything to improve the service to the farmer.  We should all be concerned about this.</P>
    <P>It is not a question of who will be appointed to the board or whether the best people are appointed.  Rather is it a question of whether the proposed change will be better for the farming community.  In this time of change many new schemes are being introduced and many grants are available from the EEC about which the farmers are not informed.  We want to ensure that the best possible use is made of those schemes for the benefit of agriculture and the nation.</P>
    <P>Our most important industry is agriculture and we seem to be tinkering about with it.  Why cannot we get down to brass tacks and make an assault on this industry and improve it?  If we have a thriving agricultural industry, our economy is in good condition.</P>
    <P>I can visualise the appointees on this <Col N="1107" /> board.  Many of them will not have a genuine knowledge of agriculture and this would be unfortunate.  Again I stress the importance of appointing the majority of places to elected representatives. I do not care to what party they belong.  They will be more concerned about how this service is run than many of those I visualise will be appointed.</P>
    <P>I hope that the amendments submitted by our spokesman and others on Committee Stage will be accepted by the Minister and will help to make this a better Bill.</P>

      <P>I welcome the setting up of this authority.  In my county the party I represent has a very small representation on the committee of agriculture which was set up by the Opposition. They gave us what they wanted to give us and not what we were entitled to.  There are 13 Fine Gael members in the Mayo County Council, yet Fianna Fáil gave us only eight seats out of 24.  In other words, they kept complete control.  This applies too in Deputy Hussey's area, Galway.</P>

      <P>When I look at the members on the committee in Castlebar and see five, six or seven professional people put there by a political party, I realise that they are not the people who should be on agricultural committees. Representatives of the committees should be members of rural and farming organisations.  These people are down to earth and do not play a political game.  The advisory staff in County Mayo give a wonderful service and are very co-operative. On that basis I welcome this Bill because it is a step in the right direction.</P>
      <P>As a farmer I know the situation. I have seen appointments made.  If the Opposition wanted to employ a temporary instructor they were free to do so but we did not have a say in it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1108" /> It was only by influence or persuasion that we could get an appointment from that committee.</P>
    <P>I would like to see part of the agricultural centre moved nearer to Galway city.  I am told that the majority of the people working in this institution have moved into Galway city and have to travel 15 or 16 miles to the centre.  If the centre was moved nearer to the city it would be more convenient for them.  This is not a healthy position for agriculture.  If a man has a job in a particular area he should not be allowed to move into a centre.  As a result of this, our institute in Ballinrobe has been degraded. Many people in my constituency, particularly the farmers, are anxious that the 400 acres of land and buildings which belong to the African Mission College at Ballinafad should be used as a centre.  Representations will be made to the Minister about this matter later.  It was originally a secondary school and has the necessary accommodation for use as a centre.  The proposed committee will make a recommendation to the Minister that this place be used as an advisory centre for agriculture, which is our greatest industry.</P>
    <P>I often wonder whether enough thought is put into agriculture.  It costs £15,000 to employ one man in industry.  If you travel in County Mayo or any other part of the west you will see that the bulk of the land is waterlogged.  The Minister will not be allocating the money for this service but he should stress the need for extra money.  If all this land could be reclaimed we would double our production in the west.  Agriculture makes an important contribution to the economy at present.  The price of all types of agricultural produce has increased by 100 per cent.  More money should be injected into agriculture in order to help the economy and the people who live in the west.</P>
    <P>I have been a member of the Mayo County Committee of Agriculture for the past 16 years.  I welcome this proposal because the ideas of the various organisations will be pooled to ensure that the best possible service is given.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to join my colleagues in opposing this Bill because it means centralisation in the best sense of the word.  As a result of this proposal, the Minister and the Department will have complete control of agriculture.  We are actually handing over control to the civil service. Some of us know that the civil servants have been looking for this control for a long time, that they are jealous of the powers of An Foras Talúntais and the advisory service.  I am sorry that the Minister has decided to give way to pressure from the civil servants in order that they can have this control which will abolish the existing services.</P>
      <P>Deputy Finn had the courage to speak on this Bill.  To date we have not heard many Government speakers on this subject.  It appears that the Government backbenchers are not happy with this Bill.  As a man who has served on a county committee and who knows what has been happening in County Mayo, he is the last man who should try to run down the construction of the county committees. The county committees of agriculture, as we know them, will be abolished for the reason that they are going to be subject to the Minister.</P>
      <P>We are all aware of the great work done by the advisory service in the past.  They had the problem of trying to make the farmer understand the importance of advice and planning. They have only succeeded in breaking down the barriers in the past few years.  The farmer regarded the adviser as one who had come from a college or university and did not accept that he was in a position to advise him on planning his farm in order to gain the greatest advantage from it.  The value of the advisory service has been recognised by Muintir na Tíre, Macra na Feirme, Macra na Tuaithe and so on. All these organisations owe a great deal to the advisory service for their educational programmes which were carried out under harsh conditions, such as going into cold schools in remote parts of the country.  The advisory service gradually broke down the barrier and now the young farmers are prepared to recognise them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1110" /> It is a pity that these people are being taken into the civil service.  From now on they will lose their local identity and will be civil servants.  We have a great deal to lose because of this proposal.  The local adviser will be a nine to five man from now on and will play the role of the average civil servant.  In many counties there were CAOs with initiative who were prepared to introduce various programmes in the interests of their area. We had a number of CAOs in Mayo who did excellent work.</P>
    <P>It is obvious from the Minister's speech that even the board itself will not have autonomy.  It will be tied to the civil service and to the Department of Agriculture.  This is contrary to present trends and structures in the country as a whole.  Even the county councils will be affected because they will no longer be able to decide on the amount they will make available to help the committees of agriculture. The Minister will have a say in this. I refer to part of the Minister's speech which clearly shows what is happening in this field.  The Minister said:</P>
    <P>In future, however, each committee of agriculture will be required to furnish each year to the Minister proposals in respect of its expenditure on the services being retained by it and, having considered these, the Minister will issue a certificate authorising the committee to demand from its council a sum which will include provision for the committee's expenditure on its retained services and also in respect of the estimated cost to the authority of providing in the county the advisory and educational service which were formerly made available by the committee.</P>
    <P>There may be merit in having a look at the existing structures in agriculture but I am convinced that in this Bill the Minister has gone too far.  Deputy Finn has mentioned the county committees of agriculture and the politics involved in the selection of members of the county committees of agriculture.  He is not being entirely fair in saying that in Mayo his party did not get fair representation.  The members of the county council have endeavoured to <Col N="1111" /> give fair representation to all groups in the county.  Having eight of the 24 as elected representatives was, I think, a fair representation in this case.  We also recognised the value of voluntary bodies and have always nominated people from these bodies to the county committee of agriculture.</P>
    <P>Deputy Finn's statement poses one question in relation to the constitution of the proposed new board.  He states that the county councils have not been fair in appointing the members of county committees of agriculture.  Is he suggesting that in the new board we will have political appointees rather than people who are appointed on merit or because of their knowledge of agriculture?  When one considers what has happened in the case of other boards one must conclude that Deputy Finn knows what he is talking about in this matter.</P>
    <P>An Foras Talúntais have done a tremendous job and there are very few counties in Ireland which have not benefited in some way from their work.  My experience has been that they were always available to give advice and assistance, not only to committees of agriculture but also to individual farmers.  I can also recall an instance where one of their officials was very helpful to sporting organisations like the GAA in advising them about the best type of seed to use on football pitches and so on.  To say that An Foras Talúntais did not have any tie up with the farming community or with organisations within the country is unjust and unfair.</P>
    <P>One of the factors in the success of An Foras Talúntais is the fact that they were an autonomous body.  They were free to carry out their own programme as they saw fit, subject of course to the money being available from the Department.  I am wondering what will happen to the stations in Mayo at Glenamoy and Creagh where we have seen a downgrading recently. What will happen when they come under the proposed board or directly under the Department of Agriculture? One can draw a parallel here with the position under the health boards <Col N="1112" /> where bureaucracy has taken over completely and where the elected representative no longer has any say.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I know this and personally I have never been in favour of it.  I have said so in this House and at local level.  We can learn from the mistakes that have been made and we have here an example of bureaucracy which excludes the elected representative. It is important that people who present themselves for election at either national or local level should have some say in affairs.  The powers of the county committees of agriculture and the county councils themselves are being eroded and I am afraid that the proposals which we are now debating will not be to the benefit of agriculture.</P>
      <P>I believe that there is nothing new in this Bill.  It is a piece of window dressing.  It must be repeated over and over again that we are giving central control to the civil service and to the Minister and taking away all power from local authorities and local groups.</P>
      <P>For that reason, I wish to oppose this Bill as strongly as possible.  We will be putting down various amendments on Committee Stage.  We all recognise the value of agriculture to our economy and it is a pity that we should have any division in relation to this important industry.  There are many things to be done, and by taking a good look at the existing services and trying to make more money available to them, we could do a great deal more than we are doing.  This centralisation of matters will only hold up the development of agriculture and, in the long run, the farmers and agriculture will suffer as a result.  Therefore, I wish to join with my colleagues in opposing this Bill.</P>

      <P>I expect the Minister has given very long and careful consideration to the changes that he as Minister for Agriculture is bringing about.  Now that Lands is in his Department, I can see he is in for a tough time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1113" /> I would like to say a special word of thanks to the many people who have given years of service on these committees and to the various chief agricultural officers and their staffs who have also given long and faithful service to agriculture.  The various members of the committees were dedicated and attended those meetings month after month.  I am confident that the changes the Minister is now proposing will be for the betterment of agriculture, which I know is in safe hands when it is the responsibility of Deputy Clinton as Minister for Agriculture.</P>
    <P>For years I have been a member of the committee of agriculture in my own county and I had been watching it for years before that.  I have never seen any changes in the voluntary service or in the machinery set up to deal with the various problems.  In my own county we have a very dedicated chief agricultural officer and a staff second to none.</P>
    <P>Convenient to where I live in the constituency of Sligo-Leitrim there is an AI station at Doonalley, County Sligo.  It was in trouble a few years ago, but I am glad to say it is now a thriving concern.  This is due to the fact that people have begun to appreciate the value of those well-bred livestock that are to be seen throughout the country as a result of the operation of this AI station.  It is also due to the fact that our livestock trade has improved so much financially that people are now prepared to avail of the AI station facilities.  The result is that the quality of our livestock has improved considerably.  Cattle and sheep prices have increased and milk prices are excellent.  If a reasonable return is forthcoming to the farmer, he is prepared to spend money to have lime and manure spread on his land and incur all the other expenses that are involved in farming.</P>
    <P>In 1974 we had the sad experience of this country being in jeopardy. That proved beyond doubt the importance of agriculture.  Simply because there were two bad seasons for crops the country was in a very serious financial position.  All the other activities, industrial and so on, were going well, but nothing could put life into <Col N="1114" /> our economy when agriculture went down.  However, after two bad seasons we were fortunate to have a follow-up of good weather.  Our export market improved and sales generally were excellent, and this had a beneficial effect on the whole economy.  I am sure the Minister is heartened to hear the AI stations are making such good progress.  It was very depressing to find the staff working in them uncertain about their future and wondering whether they would be obliged to look for another job.  I am meeting the same people now and they have told me that conditions have improved and they are now in good steady employment, because the work has increased considerably both during the winter and the summer.</P>
    <P>It is noticeable that more people are coming back to the land.  A great number of people have established homes within the last two years.  This trend is very encouraging because for too long our people have had to seek employment in England and elsewhere.  The Minister's task is an onerous one but there is no better person than he to tackle the job.  During the terms of office of successive Governments not nearly enough was done for agriculture particularly in those parts of the country in which land is crying out for improvement.  There is much work to be done in the field of drainage and cleaning up operations.  We have been remiss in this work to date compared with countries such as Holland where so much has been done to utilise every inch of land and to improve it. Thousands of acres of land in this country are sadly neglected.  It is my opinion that we would have been much better off improving land that had been neglected rather than endeavouring to reclaim other land.  We have some of the best land in the world but it is not always utilised properly.</P>
    <P>Now that the Minister's portfolio includes Lands, he has a big responsibility, too, in this area.  In many cases farms have been left idle for a long time.  Sometimes land is rented with the rent increasing every year but with very little return.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1115" /> On the question of tillage generally, I recall that when we had a few good seasons in the past, farmers grew more oats, potatoes, and so on than there was demand for.  I am speaking particularly of the west where I saw potatoes, for instance, being left in the fields because there was not the demand for them locally although people were prepared to go to the towns to obtain supplies.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am saddened that the Minister should introduce a Bill of this kind.  During the course of my contribution I shall reveal the reasons for saying this.  The Bill which is being opposed by our party is designed to take from the agricultural advisory service and the agricultural research service&mdash;An Foras Talúntais&mdash; the autonomy that they enjoy.  This autonomy has been to the benefit of agriculture during the years since An Foras were set up.  It has been said that there is not a free flow of advice or of the results of research to the farming community in general but I dispute that contention.  Being involved both in agriculture personally as a farmer and in the advisory service at local level, I know that the advice of An Foras and the findings of their experiments are available readily both to the advisory service and to the farmers.  Now, however, all the work of that body over the past 18 years is being sold down the river as a result of this Bill, the provisions of which are, in most cases, subject to the Minister. That is bad enough but there is reference also to the Minister for <Col N="1116" /> Finance and the Minister for the Public Service.  The Bill represents a deviation to some extent from the recommendations of the White Paper.  This has been illustrated forcibly in a statement published in <i>The Irish Times</i> of Monday last in which reference was made to this Bill and which referred to the fact that the scientific staff of the Agricultural Institute were seeking an immediate meeting with the Minister in regard to the Bill.</P>
      <P>To support what I have stated these research workers maintain that the new Bill deviates considerably from the type of changes envisaged in the White Paper on the reorganisation of the advisory service and its merger with the Agricultural Institute.  This article also supports what is being repeatedly stated from this side of the House: that the scientists' biggest fear is that the new Bill will result in civil service control of research and that the autonomy the Agricultural Institute had since its establishment in 1958 will be eliminated under the new structure, which gives the Minister powers over the financing of research, the type of research to be undertaken and the manner in which it is to be carried out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those powers are very far reaching when one considers the autonomy enjoyed by the Agricultural Institute up to the present time.  The Chairman of that organisation stated that research could not be carried out under a civil service type structure or under the restraints imposed by civil service type control.  He went on to state that an assurance had been given in the White Paper which was published in the Spring of 1975 that the authority of the Agricultural Institute would be maintained in the new body.  No such provision has been made in this Bill. This brings home to me and to my party that this Bill has deviated a long way from the proposals outlined in the White Paper.  I also understand that due to printing difficulties this Bill was not widely available to people concerned with agriculture with the result that they had not an opportunity to study it in detail.  I fail to see the necessity for this Bill to be passed through the House in such a hurry. People involved in agriculture should <Col N="1117" /> have enough time to consider it.  I am amazed and saddened that the Minister could be a party to a Bill of this type, knowing his experience of the practical side of agriculture, due to his membership of local committees of agriculture and of general councils of committees of agriculture, and knowing his experience in the administrative end over the past four years as Minister for Agriculture.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his speech said:</P>
    <P>It was clear, however, that the increasing demands on its facilities had revealed a number of weaknesses in the existing structure of the service.</P>
    <P>I agree with this but it is not necessary to introduce a Bill of this kind to remedy those weaknesses and shortcomings. The Minister went on to say that the weaknesses arise from&mdash;</P>
    <P>divided control, lack of overall leadership and direction, unsatisfactory carrer structure, excessive movement of staff and the absence of specialist and support services among other things.</P>
    <P>I agree with some of these suggestions but I disagree with the question of overall leadership because, so far as agricultural research is concerned, leadership is second to none and the direction of the research arm of agriculture is second to none.</P>
    <P>Perhaps in the advisory service the opportunities for promotion require a certain amount of experiment.  The situation should also be looked at from a careers point of view.  There was of course excessive movement of staff and I suppose this was as a result of the appointment of temporary instructors. After a period of probation temporary instructors should be made permanent.  I disagree with the Minister when he states that there is an absence of direction.  As we know, the agricultural advisory service was set up under the 1931 Act which replaced the Department of Agriculture and Technical Instruction by the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries.  The existing system of the 27 county committees of agriculture was maintained by 50 per cent of the costs coming <Col N="1118" /> from the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries and 50 per cent by demand on the local rates.  Supervision is exercised at various levels by the Department, by the district inspectors and by the specialists and supervisory staff.  Therefore absence of direction is not apparent.  This is not sufficient reason to introduce a Bill where this direction will be under the control of the civil service.</P>

RTE have considerable difficulty in financing their programmes and the complete abolition of drink advertising would necessitate an increase of approximately 0.75p in the licence fee in order to compensate for the loss of revenue.  There is a code of standards in relation to this matter and I can supply a copy of that to the Deputy.  As on and from 1st October, 1977, advertising of alcoholic beverages during afternoon sportscasts will cease.  I would hope eventually such advertising may be phased out, not only out of broadcasting but perhaps generally.  That, of course, is primarily a question for the Department of Health.</P>

      <P>I am aware that telephonists in Ballinrobe are dissatisfied with the accommodation and staff facilities in the telephone exchange there.  The Department have been trying for some time to acquire a suitable site on which to erect a new manual exchange to replace the existing one which is too small, as well as to meet some other needs.  Acquisition of the origional site selected was held up because of protracted legal difficulties which have not yet been resolved. When it became evident last year that it could still take a long time to clear the legal formalities in relation to this it was decided to get an alternative site for the manual exchange building.  Negotiations for the leasing of this site have recently been completed.  Work on the provision of the new exchange building on this site is now in hands and will be pressed ahead as quickly as possible.  Meantime, the Department are examining the possibility of providing welfare facilities in rented acommodation close to the exchange and of improving the position for the staff in any other way possible.</P>

      <P>Could the Minister comment on the fact that the numbers he has indicated show that at no time did the number of new connections match the demand?  The backlog must be increasing each year.

    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>The most succinct way I can answer that question is to supply the Deputy with figures for demand and connections in 1972 and 1976.  In 1972 the demand was 32,000 and connections were 25,600, running, that is to say, not far from 7,000 below demand.  In 1976 the demand was 36,000 and connections were 38,700. In that year for the first time in many years the rate of connections topped the rate of demand.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted that the Deputy has asked that question. It is quite true that in that period, 1974 to 1976, the fall in the rate of telephone demand was an index of the effects of the world depression setting in in the year 1974 on Ireland.  However, in 1976 there was something of a turning.  I will give the House the comparative statistics for the different quarters of 1975-76.  First, let me give the 1976 figures: first quarter 7,500; second quarter 8,450; third quarter 9,150; fourth quarter 10,900.  The improved demand is reflected also in the small part of the present year which has gone by.  It was 4,100 in January, 1977, as against 3,500 in January, 1976. In the fourth quarter of 1976 the figure as compared with the corresponding quarter of 1975 was higher for the first time.  In 1975 it was 10,650, in 1976 it was 10,900, so the indications are that demand having gone down for some time then flattened out, is now rising again.  I would agree with the Deputy that telephone demand is quite a sensitive index of how business is looking and <Col N="1132" /> feeling.  This index, together with other indices, bears out the diagnosis of the Minister for Finance that in 1976 we started emerging from the recession.</P>

Each engineering district comprises a number of exchange areas.

      <P>The new telephone charges will apply to operator-controlled trunk calls from coin box telephones from 1st April next.  It will not be possible to introduce the 5p local calls from automatic coinboxes as the automatic coinbox mechanism has to be modified using components which have to be specially manufactured. It will be about eight months before the necessary components will be available from the manufacturers. Modifications of coinboxes will be carried out by the engineering branch staff and will take about three months from the time components become available.  It is not proposed to introduce a 5p local call fee for manual coinboxes until the automatic coinboxes are modified.  The new automatic <Col N="1134" /> coinboxes with a 10p slot will also have to be modified for 5p local call dialling as they are designed for 4p local call working.  This is a small job.

The Deputy will understand that we cannot meet all the demands for teachers' centres in any one year.  Some form of list will have to be drawn up so that a certain number can be opened each year.

      <P>The whole question of special pay increases over and above the standard pay increases of the national wage agreements is under consideration in the light of the proposals for a new employer/trade union national agreement, 1977, which are at present before employers and trade unions for ratification.  In this connection I would refer the Deputy to the remarks made by the Minister for Finance on this subject in his budget speech on 26th January, 1977.</P>

      <P>Yes, I think it is a very serious dispute.  The Deputy knows the background to the dispute <Col N="1143" /> and the embargo that existed in the public pay sector in 1976.  The Minister for Finance said in his budget speech that subject to the ratification of the new wage agreement included in the budget there was a certain sum for this year for special increases of this nature.  That is no guarantee that it will apply in this case but there is a sum of money available if the national agreement is ratified this day fortnight.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not the Department of Education but the Government as a whole who decide that they must make an effort to stop the growth and as far as possible reduce public expenditure.  On 19th December, 1975, they imposed an embargo on any special pay increases for the following calendar year to ensure that there would not be a growth in that sector. the people involved in this dispute were caught in that embargo.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>It is my policy to channel grants from the special fund for youth and sport through the national governing bodies of the various voluntary organisations.  There have been a few exceptions in favour of youth organisations prior to 1974. At that date it was decided not to initiate any new schemes of aid to individual counties on a piecemeal basis but to wait until a national scheme could be introduced which would be just and suitable to all areas not already getting aid.  A great majority of the groups involved in the Ferns Diocesan Youth Service belong to organisations which are in receipt of substantial grants from my Department.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The intention of the annual provision for youth and sports organisation is to maintain a fund out of which grants may be made according to current needs.  It is considered desirable to retain a balance in the fund for unexpected or unusual needs. The amount remaining unexpended on the 31st December, 1976, approximately £89,000, is available in addition to the amount of £400,000 provided in the Estimates for the current year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wyse</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the amounts expended were: in 1974, £22,000; in 1975, £56,000 and in 1976, £27,000?  Is he further aware of the urgent need to finance various youth organisations, taking into consideration the impact of inflation on their work?

      <P>In any one year the Department make their allocations of total fees to various organisations and on top of that have a contingency fund for special projects which can be anywhere or attached to any organisation. At the end of the year whatever is left over from the total fund is brought forward to the next year and is topped up by moneys voted in the Dáil and that is then spent either by grants directly to organisations or special projects. Whatever is left the following year is transferred forward again. Therefore, in each of the years the Deputy mentioned the money was not lost but was brought forward to the <Col N="1148" /> following year and became part of the fund available for that year.  Similarly the £89,000 which was in credit at the end of 1976 is brought forward and added to the £400,000 voted for 1977. There is a fund of £489,000 available for 1977, but at the end of this year there will be some money left which will be brought forward to 1978.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Keating) Justin Keating">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Keating)</NameTxt>
      <P>When we debated this section last night the Deputies opposite were asking about the financial plans for the development of the orebody.  It was perfectly proper to ask if there were well drawn up and serious plans for that development.  On the basis of the scrutiny of the experts available to me I can tell the House that this is the case and that the matter from our side has been properly and thoroughly investigated. I think that it is proper to ask if the question of the financial planning was discussed by the arbitrators and formed a part of the final arbitration and I will answer that question. Yes, it was taken into account in the valuation.  It seems entirely improper for the House to ask for the details.</P>
      <P>Last week and again this week we have discussed the extent of revelation and the extent of confidentiality and the need for a balance in our society between those two things.  This particular instance, the financial plans of a mine, is a perfect illustration&mdash;I could not ask for a better one&mdash;of the need for confidentiality.  This is the most public place in the land.  I had affirmed last week that behind the Canadian company, the parent company of the Irish subsidiary, there were some of the most powerful mining houses in the world, though because of nominee shareholdings they were difficult to identify in all cases.  It is a fact about which we could agree that there are intimate relationships between the great mining houses and the mining finance companies and I think we could agree that banking is a world-wide club.  I think we could also agree that one of the most precious things that the private citizen, especially the businessman, possesses is his power to borrow and I am asked, in fact, to bare the jugular of Bula Limited.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am asked to reveal details which could very obviously be the basis for the sort of pressure which would make that orebody difficult to finance.  I am not saying that this would be the case because I have no way of knowing. Banking is a club and the result of this demand, were I to accede to it, would be to do damage to Irish businessmen of good standing who have contributed to this society and who have broken no law and to do damage to the value of the participation of the State in the development of this orebody.  It would damage both in a very obvious way which nobody can contest.  I could not pick a better example than this of the need for the preservation of confidentiality. The breaking of this confidentiality would be detrimental to the private individuals in the enterprise, to the enterprise itself and to State participation in it.  Anybody who knows about financing will appreciate this. The plans were thoroughly prepared, investigated and examined by the arbitrators <Col N="1157" /> and I stand on the quality of those who studied them on my side and I stand on the quality of those who arbitrated on the final orebody of the mine.  Here we have a very good example of how a company could be damaged by total revelation of confidential data.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is reassuring, even to a limited extent, that the Minister now knows something about the plans for the development of this mine because quite clearly in his answers last night he did not know anything about them, and indeed, said so.  He was not, of course, asked for detailed plans for the development of this mine.  Assuming that the cost of getting the mine into production is £25 million, the figure the Minister gave, I asked him for a general outline of how it was proposed to finance this.  The principal question I asked was whether it was intended that the State would have to invest more money in this connection and if so I asked the Minister if he could give an approximate idea of how much was involved.  The Minister could not give any idea of that and of course it is ridiculous to suggest that to answer that question would put at risk the future borrowing prospects of Bula Limited.  That is so totally removed from reality that it hardly needs further comment.</P>
      <P>I was very interested to hear the Minister say that this was a good example of the need for confidentiality. If it is, it bears out precisely the point I made yesterday that there is a major distinction between the day-to-day operations of a company, on the one hand, and the arrangements made for initial investment, on the other.  I asked the Minister previously, and without success, if he would indicate in what way the future of this company could be put at risk by disclosing the terms agreed on, not for the development of the mine, not for its future policy, but simply for investment in the share capital.  I am assuming, of course, that the agreement referred to in this Act which the Minister is refusing to produce relates only to investment in the initial share capital and does not extend beyond that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister's reply was that he <Col N="1158" /> could not and would not give details in relation to this particular company and that he had to talk about categories of companies.  Therefore, I am asking him now, if, in relation to any company of any category in which the State participates, he would indicate one way in which disclosure of the details of the State's investment in that company could be damaging to the company's prospects.  I want to repeat that I am not talking about the operations of the company, merely of the initial investment.</P>

      <P>I think I ought to draw the attention of the House and of anybody else who is interested to the fact that one of the major planks in the Minister's argument for non-disclosure of this agreement is now being totally withdrawn.  His whole case was that he would not give information about this company.  I have asked him to give any example he likes, in respect of any company or all companies in which the State participates, of how disclosure of details of the initial investment could damage that company, and the Minister has refused to reply.  I hope the Minister will think better about his reply before we conclude on the section.

      <P>I am rather perturbed that the Opposition have proceeded to make a meal of an issue which one would have thought at this stage would be crystal clear to them and to the public at large.  One can only infer from their sustained campaign to date in relation to this matter that their real purpose is to do everything possible to discredit the concept of State participation in a company of this nature.  That has a great deal of foreboding for the prospect of Deputy Colley being Minister for Finance, as he would wish to be, in the event of his being successful in the next general election.  As a trade union official of some years past, I can recall Avoca mines making representations to Deputy Colley, then Minister for Finance, for State aid, and many a time when, in Opposition, I looked for details in relation to a company of that nature, I was greeted with horror on the part of Deputy Colley at the very prospect of data being made available to this House in relation to, say, the Canadian directors of that company and the local management in respect of negotiations which took place very frequently at that time with the Department of Industry and Commerce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I could draw innumerable analogies of that situation, and the only conclusion I can come to is a deliberate ideological decision by the Fianna Fáil Party to denigrate, to destroy, if at all possible, the concept of State participation in the future development of our natural resources.  I asked here the last day&mdash;and I intervened only once previously in this debate&mdash;what was the real purpose of the Fianna Fáil intervention; whom they really represented? I have not the slightest doubt, <Col N="1160" /> having read the various statements made, particularly by the other companies directly involved in this, that there was a fronting operation going on.</P>

      <P>I want to dissuade the Deputy and any other Member of the House from engaging in what is tantamount to a Second Reading speech on this occasion.  We are dealing with section 1 which concerns definitions.  There has been very wide latitude in respect of this matter, but I cannot permit the equivalent of Second Reading speeches all over again.</P>

      <P>I could not agree with you more and, therefore, I shall be as brief as possible.  However, we have this razzmatazz on the part of the Opposition, the republican party, whose heart is bleeding in this House for multinational mining companies, because the one thing that has stuck in the craw of those companies is the prospect of this State getting even a 2 per cent shareholding in such companies. This is their total opposition, and Fianna Fáil have fallen for it hook, line and sinker.  I am not a bit surprised at Deputy O'Malley falling for it. While he is one of the most perceptive Members of this House, he acts like a bull in a china shop, demolishes all in front of him and then has to withdraw as gracefully as he can.  Deputy Colley had, I thought, a little more experience and circumspection in that regard. Therefore, if the Opposition wish to prolong this relationship, one must ask them whom they are speaking for.  As regards the agreement originally made between the principals of Tara as originally established and the multi-national corporation which eventually took over the total holding, is there the slightest suggestion on the part of the Opposition that that agreement should be disclosed to this House?  Not at all, because that is private, and this one happens to concern State money.  There is not a peep out of the Opposition that an agreement entered into with a private, multinational company, owning and controlling a wholly Irish subsidiary and totally dominating it here in terms of its attitude towards the State, should be disclosed.</P>

But the Minister understands it so well that when put up against the wall, so to speak, he refuses to answer. I might very briefly explain the position for the benefit of Deputy Desmond.</P>
      <P>This section contains a definition of the agreement.  Later in the Bill there are references to acts that may be undertaken by the Minister subject to the agreement and this House is asked to approve of that situation.

      <P>The Minister has told us that one of the reasons for not disclosing the terms of the agreement is the consideration that to do so would be damaging to the affairs of the company concerned.  I have no wish to be unfair to the Minister.  He has said he cannot reply in respect to this particular <Col N="1163" /> company but that he can reply only in respect of companies as a category.  He has said that if he were to give a reply in regard to particular categories, he would breach the whole tradition of confidentiality which would mean that business could not deal with the Government in future.</P>
      <P>We have pointed out that there is an enormous distinction between, first, disclosing the affairs of a business in relation to its day to day affairs and, secondly, disclosing the arrangements made already for the initial investment by the State in that company.  In respect of any category or of any company of any kind in which the State has participated or might participate, I have asked the Minister to give one concrete example to illustrate in what way the disclosure of the arrangements made for the initial investment could damage the affairs of the company.  In giving an example the Minister need not mention any company.  He may mention a category of companies.  That very reasonable question was met with the reply from the Minister that the matter had been dealt with already on the amendment. The Minister did not deal with the question on the amendment although he was asked to do so.  The Minister's stance goes to the whole root of the Bill and to the root of parliamentary democracy.  If he persists in refusing to give even one example of how disclosure of the information would damage the company, the significance of his refusal cannot be lost on anybody who pays any attention to the whole matter.</P>

      <P>Associated with the point made by the Opposition in regard to the disclosure of the terms of the agreement is a share of innuendo as to the reasons for this stance on the part of the Minister.  Surely the innuendo <Col N="1164" /> cuts both ways.  For that reason I do not wish to travel on that particular road, at least not yet, but I would remind the House that in matters of this kind, non-disclosure on the part of the State in relation to its commercial dealings with companies of the type we are talking of, indicates a strength rather than a weakness.  It might act to the advantage of the State's development of our natural resources that there would be a very broad area of confidentiality because the State is in the business of being a competitor.  It must go out and seek various partners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I might interrupt the Deputy for a moment.  As he appears to be serious in relation to this matter, can he distinguish for us between the disclosure of a company in relation to its day-to-day workings and disclosure in relation to the initial investment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>A brilliant observation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHalligan" hpid="Mr. Halligan Mr. Halligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Halligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall come to that. We are in the business already, in relation to the development of our natural resources, of shopping around between many multi-national companies.  Consequently, there is the necessity for getting the best bargain possible.  Deputies opposite must know that if we were to disclose our hand fully in regard to every agreement, we would be weakening our bargaining position.  The great strength of the State in this sphere is that the companies concerned do not know what their competitors are giving. In dealing with a cartel, for example, where supposedly a product is sold at a fixed price, members of the cartel make secret deals with a company. I should hope that nobody would put a semi-State body here into the position of having to disclose such details.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For that reason the principle of disclosure, as has been raised by Deputy Colley and others, is very important. Since they have attacked the principle I would like to defend it from the point of view of development of our resources. I regard it as being an essential weapon if we are to deal with these <Col N="1165" /> companies who are tough and ruthless and will exact from the State the maximum they can.  They seek maximum disclosure of information so as to weaken the State.  Deputy Colley made an important contribution in relation to the establishment of an Oireachtas committee on semi-State bodies.  The legislation dealing with semi-State bodies contains a provision whereby at the request of one of these companies information is made confidential only to the members of that committee.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHalligan" hpid="Mr. Halligan Mr. Halligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Halligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I made the point that we had to seek a balance between confidentiality and the principle of public disclosure.  I had the advantage of having worked for a semi-State body and I have been involved at a level of management where I was privy to exchange of information between the company, its board of directors and the Minister.  This information was never put before the House.  Deputy Colley and Deputy de Valera made the point that it may be that this committee even with its wide powers would not be able to get access to information which flows between the offices of the Minister and the chairman of the board of directors, and the general manager, of the company.  We accepted the principle there in the formation of an Oireachtas committee dealing with semi-State bodies.  Shall that principle not apply to this deal where the Minister is investing the State's money?  A semi-State company which is voted taxpayers' money by this House could make a similar deal and would not have to come before this House with any element of disclosure such as is now being sought.  I believe Deputy Colley will be a member of this committee, and if this company was to come before the committee and request that there be no public disclosure of information, that information shall not be published.  The committee does not have any discretion.</P>

      <P>I know that and I was very sympathetic towards the point made.  In the end I came to the view that, perhaps, the balance of advantage lay in the company having the right to demand that its information remain privileged because otherwise it might be that we would not get the information. I have been in the business of writing reports and presenting information. We all know that there are very many ways of presenting information. It can be cloaked very easily on occasion.  I draw the attention of the House to the distinction which is being made in relation to a disclosure in respect of this agreement and disclosure in respect of a similar agreement which could be made between a semi-State body and Bula Limited or anybody else.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Halligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Without disclosing confidential information, I will give the Deputy one example.  I worked in a project where a semi-State body was attempting to set up a joint venture with an American multi-national company. State money voted by this House was to be invested in the new company. Disclosure of the information relating to the provisions of equity participation by that company in the new joint company would have been damaging to the operation of the venture.  It is ludicrous to pretend that there is a distinction between an agreement regarding equity participation and disclosure of information about day to day operations.  Perhaps it is the argument put forward by counsel speaking for some other interest who wishes to elicit information which should not be put before this House.</P>
      <P>This State has through its various agencies put money by agreement into companies and those agreements have not been brought before this House and have not been sought.  I direct the memories of Deputies opposite to the Potez affair in the early 1960s.  A fine factory was built for a French company on the Naas Road to produce aeroplanes.  The IDA and An Taisce lost £1½ million of public funds on that venture and were we to gross that amount up in today's terms it would be considerable.  It is important to note that the agreement in relation to this large project which consumed such amounts of public money was never published and the equity participation was in the region of £1 million to purchase shares.  I agree with Deputy O'Malley's Second Reading speech in relation to the risks associated with equity ventures being true.  The Minister is not being selective in relation to Bula Limited.  The Minister should not be persuaded to disclose more information than he thinks fit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1168" /> Deputy Lalor said that we are setting a precedent for the development of our natural resources and the State's participation in that development and I agree with him in that.  Let us not be so naive as to underestimate the forces with which we will have to unite on occasion.  Let us not be so naive as to throw away the weapon of commercial confidentiality.  In the last analysis this House must have sufficient trust in any Minister of State and in any Government so that if information is not forthcoming, it is accepted that it is not for any private reason associated with personal or party advantage, but it is simply in the public interest.  I would not refuse to extend that trust to members opposite if they were in Government and I expect them to do the same here.  The amount of innuendo that is being passed around here is damaging all of us.</P>
    <P>Yesterday it was asked what was being hidden, what was the Minister hiding?  My answer to that is &ldquo;Nothing except that which is in the public interest&rdquo;. There is nothing in the Minister's personal interest that is being hidden and the amount of innuendo which suggests that there might is disgraceful. It should not be allowed to pollute the debate because that is what is happening.</P>
    <P>This debate should be about the important question of the development of our resources.  There is a clear philosophical distinction about how the two sides view this.  Well and good.  Let us have the debate on that but let us not drag down the debate to the level of personal innuendo.  Mind you, we are all tempted to follow that and I am as open to that temptation as the next person.  Perhaps I will succumb to it and doubtless I shall feel sorry afterwards. The issue is too important for us to fall to that level.  The issue is whether we want State equity participation or not and, if we do, what are the conditions under which we give assent to it here.  The issue is what are the limitations on the amount of information we in this House accept as being realistic in proportion to the commercial risk.</P>
    <P>As the Minister said yesterday, <Col N="1169" /> there is a fine distinction to be drawn in the balance of advantage but I would say that the development of our resources will take such a period of time that it can be legitimate to expect that that side of the House will be over here during that period.  That is the way democracy works.  When they are I hope we will extend to them the same trust that we now ask them to extend to us.  In the last analysis there is only one motivation in this case which is the public interest. There is no other motivation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to prolong this debate unduly but there are one or two points I wish to make.  For a fair proportion of Deputy Halligan's contribution the thought was in my mind that I would speak when he finished and that the first thing I would say was congratulations to him. I do say it but with less enthusiasm than I was inclined to say at first.  I say congratulations because he attempted to deal with the problem in a way that the Minister has not attempted. The Minister has run away from it.  I congratulate Deputy Halligan on the fact that he has at least put forward the argument that here we are dealing with a new situation, the development of our national resources. The Minister has tried to pretend he is doing exactly everything that was done in the past and is sticking to that but he is not.  At least Deputy Halligan is putting forward a logical reason when he makes that argument although it does not stand up to examination.</P>
      <P>My less than enthusiastic response to Deputy Halligan is because earlier he said he was going to deal with the point I had been making, namely, the distinction on the one hand between the initial investment and, on the other hand, the day-to-day working of the company.  When it came to the crunch he dealt with it by saying that there was no distinction.  With all due respects to him, that is not dealing with the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am assuming all the time that the agreement referred to in section 1 relates only to the State's initial investment in the company.  If it relates to other things&mdash; we have no way of knowing unless the Minister tells us&mdash;<Col N="1170" /> that raises another issue.  We have not been told anything about this except such as would suggest that this agreement relates only to the State's initial investment.  Clearly the Minister does not or cannot tell me but perhaps Deputy Halligan can answer my question which is, in what way can the disclosure of the terms, fixed and agreed and already in existence, for the State's initial investment damage the company?  In what way could similar disclosures in respect of any other company cause damage?</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I have asked the Minister to answer it and he cannot and neither can Deputy Halligan.  Deputy Desmond did not even attempt to do so and it must not be as simple a matter as it seems to him.  It is not a matter of its being a difficult question. It is a question of political will. It is a question of what is at stake here.  We do not know because the Minister does not tell us what is in the agreement.</P>
      <P>On the assumption that it relates solely to the terms of the State's investment, I ask any Deputy, any reasonable person, to give an example of what way the disclosure of the terms of the State's initial investment could be damaging.  It is a simple straightforward question and it goes to the root of this section and of the Bill.  It goes even further but yet we have not been able to get an answer.  It is no good trying to muddy the water by talking about the necessity for confidentiality in regard to the ongoing work of the company and the possibility that its commercial rivals might get advantage by knowing about it. That is common ground and it has always been so.  However, it is not what we are talking about here.  We are talking about the disclosure of the terms of the State's initial investment. In what way can that damage this or any other company?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnGrattanEsmonde" hpid="Mr. Esmonde Mr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>It appears that one matter has been lost sight of in the debate, namely, the purchase of shares in a private company.  As I read the case made by the Opposition, the hypothetical questions put amount to a request for a prospectus as one would have on an issue of shares in a public company.  It may be difficult for certain public representatives, full <Col N="1172" /> of bloom of acting for the public, to have to accept the fact that there is a very big distinction between the operation of a private and a public company.</P>
      <P>It is also well to bear in mind that when a person buys shares in a private company he does not buy them on the blind, so to speak, as a result of public blurbs or comment in the financial columns of newspapers or stockbrokers' handouts.  He does it as a result of his own private investigation on expert advice.  That has been done in this case.  It may be hard for Members to stomach this and to stomach the fact that, when one is dealing with private companies, one is dealing with a big emphasis on the word &ldquo;private&rdquo;. If we were to ask for the disclosure of the terms of the agreement a simple corollary to that would be to ask for the terms of the advice and we would be running completely contrary to the legal and commercial principles involved in a private company.  It is difficult naturally for people who represent the public to accept that fact.  They would like to be able to turn around and say the facts are such and such.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a novel venture by the State and we must look at it in the light and from the point of view of the Minister acting on behalf of the State putting himself in the position of a shareholder in a private company. Bearing in mind what I have said that is the position in which he is putting himself.  Deputy Colley sought to make a distinction between initial investment details and day-to-day working.  I do not know whether Deputy Colley is aware of what the circumstances are like in relation to mining enterprises.  Without being too caustic, cynical, critical or sarcastic, I would suggest to him that one is dealing with a completely different set-up when one is dealing with mining companies and secrecy in relation to such companies is an absolute must because eventually one will be dealing on the international market with the produce, the rate at which it is produced, the percentage of deposit, the finance involved at any stage and, above all, the time factor.  These are <Col N="1173" /> just a few small facets that have to be weighed in consideration of a mining enterprise and the disclosure of even one small facet of these things could be highly damaging to a mining enterprise.  It might have the effect of literally putting the mine into liquidation or into cold storage for years.</P>
    <P>Those of us who can read know that when we open the mining page of a financial paper we see there surmises in relation to mining shares. There has to be a cloak of secrecy if a mining concern is to be successful. I am not talking about the effect disclosure might have in relation to obtaining further working finance or the terms of that finance.  This will be an ongoing commercial enterprise.  If public money is invested in it is it not in the interests of the public that we give that company, particularly our shareholding in it, maximum advantage? It is all very well for Deputy O'Malley to give us a litany of ifs and cute, clever questions.  They are exactly the questions a client asks his legal adviser or his financial adviser when making an investment.  Is it to be assumed that, because these questions were asked and because they are given great mileage by certain scribes, Deputy O'Malley is making a great case for the Opposition and that the Minister is on a beating to nothing? Let us have a little common sense.  Let us live in the world in which we are and let us realise we are dealing with a very vital commercial enterprise.</P>
    <P>We are not here to pander to the curiosity of commentators.  We, on this side, are concerned with ensuring this will be an ongoing, viable enterprise. It is vitally important from the point of view of the State and from the point of view of the citizen that we should have a stake in the resources of the State and not just be a little officer on the tilley going out of the mine taking our pence here and there.  It is time we got involved as a State. Questions such as were asked yesterday by Deputy O'Malley are questions Deputy O'Malley or I would ask if we were advising a client.  Deputy O'Malley is assuming the Minister has not had advice and has not got experts. If the Minister says he has taken the <Col N="1174" /> best advice available to him, are we not right in accepting that?</P>

He had a contract that was put to arbitration at which worldwide expert opinions were given and the arbitrators came down with a finding which bound the Minister under the arbitration.  I cannot see what question mark there can be over that.  There might be question marks had there not been an arbitration.  Did that not happen before where there was no arbitration clause where a Government did deals?</P>

The fact remains the Minister has brought in a Bill here and failed to produce an agreement.  We are not here to pander to commentators.  We are here to protect the rights of the people who sent us here.  That is common sense.  This is a private company and this private company will in due course have its annual general meeting and at that meeting any shareholder, if dissatisfied, will have the right to ask for an agreement, if an agreement has been entered into.  If the board of directors fail to produce that agreement, the shareholder then has the right to go to the courts and the courts will make an order directing the board to produce the agreement.  That situation can arise in this particular case.  A shareholder will be able to take action <Col N="1175" /> and the agreement we have been debating here for two days or more will find its way before the courts for the benefit of that shareholder.  Here we are acting on behalf of 3.1 million shareholders and this House cannot have access to that agreement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Esmonde is a man I have a degree of regard for.  I look upon him as an honest Deputy and I fully accept that what he said by way of contribution a few moments ago was given to us in all sincerity and that he meant every word.  He opened by saying that we have here a totally private company and it was most improper of us on this side of the House to be demanding information with regard to the internal dealings of a private company and that we were linking up with the media in bringing in this ministerial bashing.  I presume that is the situation as Deputy Esmonde sees it, but surely it is our responsibility as the representative of, by 1973 figures, little less than 50 per cent of the public.  I believe, as the representative of the majority of the public at present, that if the State invest £9.54 million of public money, taxpayers' money, the money which is the property of the people, that it is very wrong for Deputy Esmonde or the Minister or his backup Deputies Desmond and Halligan to castigate the Opposition on our insistence that £9.54 million of public moneys be properly protected at least.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What got me to my feet was this allegation of the media bashing the poor, unfortunate Minister caught with the child in his arms.  What was that in comparison with the bashing that I got in 1972 and early 1973 in relation to this?  At present the State is proposing to invest £9.54 million in this project but four years ago at this time the State had under Lalor, Minister for Industry and Commerce, sold down the river; it was all gone, there would not be any possibility four years later of getting this sort of money for it, it was all evaporated.  The three principal subscribers here today, the Minister backed by Deputies Desmond and Halligan, were standing on the <Col N="1176" /> same platform with the Neligans and the Merrigans who were making this claim.  They are still standing on the same platform and we have to listen to the allegation that we are crying crocodile tears for £9.54 million of taxpayers' money.</P>
    <P>This debate went on yesterday morning.  Talking about the agreement, I referred yesterday evening to the fact that it was clear from the interest being taken on the Government side of the House that there was the feeling of sympathy for the Minister and he played up to it with his speech about a beating to nothing.  The Deputy who stayed longest in the House was his colleague, the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, and I became convinced that that colleague was affected by the argument yesterday despite the fact that he made no contribution.  At lunchtime today I found that he had arranged with RTE to put the director general of Bula, Mr. Wymes, into the programme to protect the Minister by saying: &ldquo;We will call foul if the Minister proposes to disclose the terms of the agreement&rdquo;. The Minister directed attention a few minutes ago to the fact that we were over-flogging the definition section of the Bill.  I agree that section 1, the definition section, has been discussed far more than normally but it is the first time ever in a definition section we had a description where the description is not amplified.  Here we have just three definitions:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;the Company&rdquo; means Bula Limited;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;the Minister&rdquo; means the Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;agreement&rdquo; is defined as meaning:</P>
    <P>...the agreement dated the 12th day of December, 1975, and made between Bula Holdings, Patrick Wright, certain other parties named in the Agreement and the Minister;</P>
    <P>This is one of the very significant omissions from the Bill.  Perhaps it should be included in section 2 but I mention it here because the omission strikes me as being remarkable.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his opening remarks in what I presume to be the <Col N="1177" /> explanation of the agreement, through not stated, says: &ldquo;...we have also secured 25 per cent of the equity for nothing and 24 per cent on a valuation, giving us in all a 75 per cent share of the profits&rdquo;.  We are conducting our debate here on the assumption, although we have never seen anything positive in writing, that the State&mdash;because we get mixed up with Ministers later on&mdash;is, arising from this agreement, going to have a 49 per cent share in this company.  There is nothing in the Bill which says this. We of necessity have to take what the Minister says in good faith and I do not question that aspect of it.  Deputy O'Malley yesterday made reference to the fact that the Minister had of necessity to tell us something about what was in the agreement and I presume that this 49 per cent is built into it.</P>
    <P>We heard the Government side media bashing today.  I am usually an expert on that.  While on the subject of the media, I thought it extremely significant that the Minister's directorgeneral in relation to this business is booked specially on radio today to announce that it would be a breach of confidence for the Minister to disclose this.  He was asked if he thought that was fair to the Irish people whose £9½ million was being invested and his reply was that that was a matter for the Dáil.  I agree that it is and this is why we are making the battle in relation to this today.</P>
    <P>Deputy Halligan seemed to go much further in an effort to justify this.  To use the cliché and put it on the record of the House, it was interesting to hear Deputy Halligan say that non-disclosure is a strength rather than a weakness.  He is a new recruit, of course, to the open Government party. He had a lot to do with getting them elected four years ago.  We heard the former secretary of the Labour Party saying that proudly.  I agree with him. I am not saying he was wrong.  He said they are shopping around with multi-national companies.  I wonder what his two colleagues who are not in the House yet have to say about that.</P>

He said it was improper for the House to ask for details of the financial arrangements for the working of this business.  I accept that.  As Deputy Colley said, that is not what we want. I would draw the attention of Government backbenchers to the fact that they are subscribing to this without it being written into the Bill that we will get 49 per cent.  I take the Minister's word for it, but in Parliament we should not be expected to do so. Deputy Halligan said future legislation may involve this sort of thing when the Labour Party have finished shopping around with the multi-nationals.  When the State is participating and taking equity in companies such as this, the Bill should spell out the value of the shares.  This Bill does not do that.

Apart from the political aspect, commercially it would be most unwise to have an agreement of the type we are discussing today bandied around in public.  It could jeopardise any future agreement.  This could be extended to any future developments on the oil <Col N="1180" /> scene and to any future mineral finds. If this agreement were published, it would be available to very wellinformed international conglomerates and multi-nationals.  This could jeopardise a Government decision in the future in dealing with multi-national companies in relation to exploration of our mineral wealth.  On that basis it would be very unwise.  The general tenets of the agreement have been revealed by the Minister.</P>

There are two basic principles involved under this section and one is that the Government are right to retain confidentiality in regard to the commercial agreement they are entering into in relation to mineral wealth development.  Such information should not be available to people in this industry or to people who might be developing any future mineral wealth found.  Secondly, this agreement is an innovation.  It is a sign that the Government are confident in themselves and in our mineral resources and are prepared to put the people's money into a wise investment.

      <P>We had to do without the benefit of their wit and their wisdom.  The debate was conducted between the Minister on one side and Deputy Colley and myself on the other.  In the course of the debate I asked the Minister a number of brief questions which he tried to answer as far as he could.  We came to a point when we were discussing capitalisation of the company where the Minister said he did not know in reply to a number of questions I asked, adding: &ldquo;I have no brief on that&rdquo;.  He had four officials with him but one assumes they did not know either or had not the information with them because they did not offer it to the Minister.  The debate was adjourned at 7 o'clock and I had expected and hoped that when we resumed on the definition section at 3.30 p.m. this afternoon the Minister would have said that Deputy O'Malley had asked a number of questions last night which the Minister endeavoured to answer but did not have sufficient information but had since looked it up and the following are the answers.  The Minister stood up all right and said he had made inquiries in the Department and found there were answers to these questions but he was not going to give them.</P>
      <P>The two questions were: what were the arrangements about a rights issue and what was the Minister's position in regard to a rights issue?  These are relevant matters which we sought to have clarified last night.  It seemed to me that if the Minister had to take up 49 per cent of a rights issue he would have to take up, on figures I worked out last night and to which the Minister did not demur, about £2 million in rights.  That is not allowed for in this Bill and a further Bill would therefore have to be introduced to enable rights to be taken up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I inquired about the guarantee situation where the Minister as principal individual shareholder in the company would certainly be the most attractive guarantor from the point of view of the bank.  I was told that he <Col N="1183" /> did not know the position in that regard.  I presume he knows it now. We have now spent about one hour and 20 minutes in discussion although admittedly 95 per cent of the time went on totally different matters and did not deal with matters relevant to this section.  It we could get back, now that we have had the four crown princes displaying their wares&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>These are the questions that Deputy Colley and I posed last night.  They relate entirely to the capitalisation of the company and it is quite ridiculous for the Minister or anybody behind him to suggest that to disclose the capitalisation of a company will give commercial competitors an advantage or that it will inhibit the borrowing powers or ability of the company which I think was what the Minister said at one stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The lenders will certainly have to see the information if we do not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister or those behind him have the faintest idea of what is involved?  If you go to a bank or group of banks for longterm finance to open a mine and put it into production is not the first question the banks will ask: &ldquo;What is your capitalisation?  Have you a capitalisation plan?  Have you any money subscribed in cash in respect of <Col N="1184" /> your equities?&rdquo;  Of course, in this case the answer is: &ldquo;No, we have no money subscribed in cash.  We have 9,998 shares issued for consideration other than cash.  We have no cash.  We owe large amounts that appear on the registrar of charges in the Companies Office and they appear to be very substantial amounts.  Everything we have is mortgaged.  But we have a capitalisation plan.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Minister seemed to suggest last night that there was no plan.  That surprised me because as reported in the Official Report of 2nd February, 1977, at column 721, when the Minister was going through the 20 propositions I put to him he came to number nine and said:</P>
      <P>...The next point, that no capitalisation plan exists, is untrue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Where is it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>A capitalisation plan has been submitted to my Department. It exists and we have received it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>When was it submitted?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then he went on to the next one.  We had that kind of not very useful debate.  Although on 2nd February he avowed the existence of this capitalisation plan he did not seem to know anything about it last night.  He now says there is a plan but that we will not get any details.  But the public and the Deputies are entitled to know if the Minister is going to subscribe to rights.  Perhaps I should explain for the benefit of some of those opposite what rights are because they probably do not know but that would not inhibit them from pontificating on this matter.  If a company wants to raise additional equity capital or, in this case, if it wants to raise any cash at all&mdash;it has no cash, only shares issued for consideration other than cash&mdash;it has to go back under a rights issue to its existing shareholders and ask them to contribute cash on an agreed basis.  Shareholders normally contribute so much per share in accordance with the proportion of shares they have.  This means that the Minister in this case would have to contribute 49 per cent. <Col N="1185" /> I have suggested that the figure would be about £4 million which would leave the public subscribing a further £2 million.</P>
    <P>We have no answer on that yet and we have no answer about the guarantee. The Minister will be expected to guarantee at least half of the bank borrowings which it appears would have to be about £30 million at the least and probably more.  That would leave public liability in that respect at £15 million in round figures.  Add that to the £9.5 million in this Bill and to the £2 million under the rights issue and you get about £26.5 million approximately of potential public liability in respect of this matter.</P>
    <P>It is wise to go back to first principles: this is a private company in which the State is risking all its capital in order to acquire a maximum of 49 per cent of the shares.  It has no say in the running of the company and cannot ensure that the company ever goes into production.  In order to get itself into that situation, it has not invested one penny in our natural resources but it has handed £9.54 million tax-free to four individuals.  This is the great investment in our natural resources that Deputy Collins, Deputy Desmond and the others become so eloquent and proud about.  These four individuals are in the happy position that they have £9.54 million in their pockets and they still control the company. This is incredible but it is true. They still decide whether or not the company will ever go into production. They may say: &ldquo;We are up more than £2 million per head and we see no point in undertaking all the trouble and worry about planning permissions, taking on staff, having strikes and breakdowns of machinery, borrowing money and all the trauma involved in opening a new mine particularly for people who were never before involved in it and we will not bother going ahead.&rdquo; I hope they do not say that but one must accept the possibility of such a decision.  If they were to say that there is nothing the Minister can do about it&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us talk about the 40 ministerial orders your Government brought in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1186" />
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;because the Minister for Industry and Commerce at that time, whoever he may be, will be in the position that £9.54 million will not have been invested in our natural resources but will have been given to four individuals tax-free.  If they were able to manoeuvre a Minister into that situation they must have some ability.  They must certainly be good businessmen if they could get that money from the Minister and still retain him in a minority situation. They have some negotiating and commercial ability.  It may not lie in the mining field.  The present Minister or possibly myself, or whoever may be next Minister for Industry and Commerce will have to sit there with a 49 per cent share and say that a lot of money was paid for those bits of paper but the directors of Bula have now decided to postpone production indefinitely until world markets improve, or something like that.  In the meantime, the minimum outlay of £9.54 million is useless; it is gone; it is not invested in the mine or in the company.  It is not invested in natural resources.  It is gone under the worst deal that any Minister in our history has ever done and I think nobody can seriously dispute that because nobody with the faintest commercial sense would pay £9.54 million particularly out of public money and still end up in a minority with no control, no say and no voice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Arising out of that situation, I asked certain questions about capitalisation of the company which had no bearing on commercial opponents.  It does not matter to them how the company is capitalised.  It has nothing to do with the operation of selling their product or anything else.  The only reason the Minister could give after a great deal of pressure from Deputy Colley&mdash;first we discussed this yesterday and it finally came down after three or four efforts by Deputy Colley to asking not in relation to this company but in relation to any company, how any harm could come to the company by a disclosure of capitalisation&mdash;was that it would weaken their borrowing position.  The banks from whom they would borrow should <Col N="1187" /> know their capitalisation.  Is that not the first question the banks would ask? &ldquo;What is your equity?  How much is actually paid up in cash?  What is your position <i>vis-á-vis</i> a rights issue if we say that before we will lend to you, you will need more capitalisation? Will you refuse to take up your right?&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>These simple questions were asked last night.  In fairness to the Minister he tried to answer similar questions last night but when we came to these he said they were very technical and detailed and he just did not know.  I got the impression, perhaps falsely, that if he did know we would have been told.  That is why I was happy the section was not completed last night because it gave him an opportunity to find out and no doubt he has done that.  But perhaps he has not; perhaps there is no decision on these matters.  He does know whether the State will have to take up further shares through a rights issue.  Perhaps no decision has been made on it.  Perhaps he does not know what the situation will be in regard to guarantees.  If that is so, he should tell us that no decisions have been made by the Government or the Department in relation to those matters. This has nothing to do with commercial operations.  It is simply an attempt to assess what the potential full liability of the taxpayer will be in relation to this ill-fated and unhappy purchase.</P>

      <P>Once again one sees Deputy O'Malley playing postman's knock for other commercial interests.  It is getting less impressive <Col N="1188" /> as the days pass.  It started out with the ministerial order which should have been renewed because the first one was defective.  Then he went on to the fact that from his investment analysis of the situation the bargain was not a good deal anyway.  Such was the comprehensive details of his equity investment analysis.  Yesterday it finished up being unconstitutional. Today we are back in the same merrygo-round again.  I think this House is being subjected to the spectacle of a lecture from somebody who cannot even select a good stockbroker.  We have had a dose of a lecture in that regard.  I hope that some day the Deputy will be Minister for Industry and Commerce because it would be with a sense of great irony that Deputies would put to him the disclosure of, say, agreements reached between An Bord Gáis and individual companies in relation, possibly, to offshore gas exploration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us pinpoint the touching selectivity of Fianna Fáil on this matter.  Deputy Halligan rightly went back to the Potez days and indeed we had enough of that I well remember the late Seán Dunne taunting the Government of the day in relation to their most amazing secrecy at that time.  Of course, this was a private <Col N="1189" /> French company for a while and details could not be disclosed.  We built the wings of jet aircraft in a premises which is now, ironically, owned by a company which we have been discussing here today.  History has a peculiar way of repeating itself, particularly in the context of the Fianna Fáil operations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the Deputy realises the real irony of what he is talking about, that that particular company had State participation and disclosed full details of it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>We can get on to that.  I drew a number of analogies without any great difficulty, whether it is NET in relation to its particular contracts with private companies or the ESB and its contracts with private companies.  Deputy Colley often sanctioned under the public capital programme the relationship between the post office and private companies. When I was only 18 years of age and worked for a metal fabrication company in Cork city before I joined&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I think one should go right back to the foundation of the IDA and that exercise will be done. I have not the slightest doubt about it because it will be a very interesting exercise in terms of the dramatic about-turn of the Fianna Fáil Party in relation to a mixed economy in which the State is entitled to have fundamental rights regarding the confidentiality of its affairs.  This would be completely wiped out by Fianna Fáil by initiation of a new principle here under the rule of debate. It will be marked not merely by the Confederation of Irish Industry but by many public and private entrepreneurs in relation to any future dealings under a Fianna Fáil regime.</P>

      <P>This frenzied concern of the Opposition for the total disclosure by the Minister of the capitalisation of the company on a joint basis under the agreement with Bula Limited is, to say the least, suspect. It is suspect because the Fianna Fáil Party cannot get rid of the ideological blockage from which they are still suffering in relation to companies who happen to have, under our Constitution, the private ownership of resources of gas and minerals.  The Opposition have had four years of advance warning of the intention of the State to change that situation dramatically, and now, as a last gasp, they want to destroy the prospect of future international investment in this country so that companies who want to join in a venture with the State would have to disclose the whole capital outlay and capitalisation of such a joint venture for every scavenger, public and private, to proceed to make a fast buck on the situation.  It is significant that a man who has a wiser financial head than the rest of the party put together, Deputy Haughey, has not expressed approval of the strategy being followed by his party in this matter.  I doubt very <Col N="1194" /> much that Deputy Haughey would approve&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>A cursory examination of the record of Fianna Fáil in relation to any State-sponsored body or in relation to agreements with private companies will show that they tried to stand the principles, which they supposedly upheld, on their heads. They are now doing a bad day's work for future joint-venture investment in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The level of the debate was reduced to an all-time low by Deputy O'Malley and he made one of the worst speeches in the 20th Dáil, with due respect to the parliamentary correspondent of the <i>Irish Independent</i>, in his introduction to this matter, because it had not a shred of factual evidence to substantiate the global assertions he made with gay abandon, ranging from £7½ million to £290 million.  Of course one can disagree with one's colleague either in the House or through the media; it is part of Irish life, and one does not need to be nasty about it. One can have a difference of opinion with the Minister of the day.  The attitude of a Minister for Posts and Telegraphs and a Minister for Justice in a previous Administration surprised me. I am sure they had many tenders before <Col N="1195" /> them from private companies in relation to the supply of materials for their Department and had to make up their minds on an interdepartmental basis with the Department of Finance which tender should be accepted in the national interest, the details of which would very often not be disclosed to the House.  One would have thought that these two former Ministers of the Fianna Fáil Party would have exercised more wit in relation to this fundamental issue.  If I had £20 million for investment in this country I would make sure I would not be coming over here to negotiate with a Fianna Fáil Minister for Industry and Commerce, bearing in mind that if the State put in another £10 million, three months later I would be screwed right left and centre by the publication of the details involved.  Whether it was with CIE, ESB, Aer Lingus or any other of our companies deeply involved in public capital expenditure, not one industrialist would trust the Fianna Fáil Part in relation to an agreement because the precedent they are trying to breach here would have a scuttling effect on investment.  It is a deliberate effort on the part of the Fianna Fáil Party to write down whatever value Bula may have, so that another company, well known, immediately close to it, can move in and buy out at a chickenfeed price.  That is the real effort behind the scenario.</P>

      <P>The analogy is very interesting.  If we had succeeded in obtaining a majority shareholding, Fianna Fáil would have issued a joint statement, probably with Tara, to the effect that the country had gone into a rampant socialist escapade in terms of State investment.  But the situation is unpalatable for Fianna Fáil even with a 49 per cent shareholding just as it would be unpalatable for them if the ratio were 42 or 25. This attitude can be described only as the royalties razzamatazz of the Fianna Fáil front bench.  Even that is so discredited now that they are changing feet and are suggesting that the Bill be sent to the President so as to elicit his opinion in regard to State investment on a joint venture basis.</P>

It is not possible for them on the one hand to have a defective order which they wish to have renewed while on the other hand to send legislation to the President on grounds of its compliance with the Constitution in the hope that from his past ministerial experience he may remember an analysis on a question of constitutionality. On the other hand, the <Col N="1197" /> legislation cannot be sent back to private enterprise in order to get the information that Fianna Fáil seek.

      <P>I am glad that this debate has gone on for so long on this section because Deputy Colley dropped a political and economic bombshell in the last quarter of an hour when he stated that: &ldquo;We in Fianna Fáil will disclose agreements between the State and companies who are taking State money.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 2, subsection (1), line 18, after &ldquo;acquire&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;, after full and final planning permission has been obtained for a partly open-cast lead/zinc mine at Nevinstown, Navan, County Meath, by the Company&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to make the purchase of these shares conditional on full and final planning permission being obtained.  The purpose of trying to ensure there is planning permission&mdash;in the financial context of this whole operation viable planning permission not subject to conditions which are onerous or expensive&mdash;is because, without knowing what the conditions are, and obviously there will be conditions, one cannot know the cost of establishing or the cost of running the mine because there are matters entirely dependent on the conditions of the permission. We have been informed that an application was made last August to the Meath County Council.  It is disturbing to find that it was only in August, 1976, that application was made because the Government have apparently owned this property since some time in 1971 and it has taken over five years to make application for planning permission.  The Minister came to his agreement regarding the purchase of shares and the obtaining of other shares free in June, 1974, although the agreement was not formally signed until December, 1975.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Planning permission, the most necessary single step in the whole process of trying to put this mine into production and create employment, was only put in train 2 ¼ years after the Minister became involved in the shareholding of the company.  We are, of course, fortunate enough to have minerals like this in the country.  This is the first time a rich orebody has been found but to my mind there has been a quite extraordinary delay on the part of the company in seeking planning permission. The application was put in in August, 1976, and one learned it was <Col N="1206" /> not making much progress and the most important single environmental factor that should have been in the planning application was not in it at all.  I refer to the diversion of the River Blackwater which is pretty well essential for economic development. One can assume that Meath County Council would hardly have looked very favourably on a planning application that omitted the most significant aspect of the whole operation. Since then we have learned in more detail what the attitude of the Meath County Council is in relation to this planning application.  Unfortunately, from the point of view of the public, if this Bill goes through, as presumably it will by virtue of numbers, if nothing else, we have since discovered that the situation is in fact a great deal more serious than we might have thought.  I will quote now from an article in last Sunday's <i>Independent</i> written by Mr. Vincent Browne.  I might add that there has been no denial from Meath County Council of anything in this article so I assume it is accurate.  The article states:</P>
    <P>Serious difficulties have also emerged this weekend about planning permission for the development of the mine.  An official of Meath County Council said that on the basis of the present planning application there was &ldquo;no chance&rdquo; that planning permission would be given.</P>
    <P>Later on, the writer says:</P>
    <P>On the issue of the planning application, Bula Ltd. first submitted an application last August, but this was returned to the company in October because information accompanying it was inadequate.</P>
    <P>The county council &ldquo;in returning the application asked 32 question mainly related to noise, dust, environmental and health aspects, but most of these questions were unanswered when the planning application was re-submitted on December 21, last&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The article goes on:</P>
    <P>This weekend the planning application has again been returned to Bula, without even formal consideration <Col N="1207" /> of it by the Meath County Council.  Bula would certainly appeal to the Planning Appeals Tribunal recently established, if Meath County Council ultimately rejects its application. Since the setting up of the tribunal, there is considerably less scope for political interference with planning permissions.  It cannot be taken for granted, therefore, that even ultimately Bula will get the planning permission.</P>
    <P>It also emerges that Bula has made no application for the diversion of the river Blackwater, under which much of the ore in the area is situated.  Lack of information on this, and on other critical aspects of the project, is one of the reasons why there is such disappointment in the Meath County Council with the Bula application.</P>
    <P>That appears to me to be a vital statement of the current position in relation to the planning application from the point of view of bringing this orebody to the point where the mine might be able to go into production.  Planning permission was not sought for more than five years after the company purchased the property and for more that two years after the Minister became involve through the medium of the agreement he came to in June, 1974. These delays are very distressing and the likelihood of early planning permission seems far from hopeful.</P>
    <P>Thirty-two specific queries were apparently raised by the county council and after an interval of some months a lot of those were not even answered when the planning application was re-submitted to the local authority.  The position as of last weekend was that there was not even formal consideration given to the latest re-submission because it was apparently so incomplete and the queries not dealt with and it was sent back to the company. So we are in every sense back at square one and no more advanced in regard to the planning application than we were in August, 1976, when it was first submitted or indeed in June, 1974, when the Minister first became involved.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1208" /> One aspect of this application is that it seeks permission for the mining of the Bula part of the ore in this orebody partly by open-cast mining. Roughly speaking, the percentages or ratios are that they want to get out about 50 per cent by open-cast mining and 50 per cent approximately by ordinary conventional underground mining.  It is necessary to consider for a few minutes the nature of open-cast mining because we have not had it in this country on a big scale.  We have had it on a limited scale.  In recent years the Gortdrum mine was partly, to a limited extent, an opencast mine; but the Gortdrum mine was situate quite some distance from any town. The nearest town to it of any size would have been Tipperary town.  I cannot say exactly how far away it was but it was certainly several miles and there was no great accumulation of houses in the vicinity of that mine. Any other opencast or partly open-cast mine that we have had in this country would have been in the fairly distant past or just a sort of quarrying operation where minerals were not really involved, but just stone, and these have tended to be away from centres of population.  On the world scene opencast lead and zinc mines are not unknown but they tend because of environmental factors to be confined to more remote parts of the world.</P>
    <P>In this instance of this orebody a small part of it at the Bula end comes up to or very close to the surface before it starts to go down at an angle under the river and continue downwards or in a roughly downward direction for quite a distance on the other side of the river.  It is unfortunate that that part of it is at or near the surface and that that circumstance is combined with its extreme proximity to the town of Navan.  If this mine were situate at a more remote place it would be an enormous advantage to have it in this way with one end of the seam or orebody coming up to or close to the surface.  It is unfortunate that an orebody such as this should have turned up in the place that it did, so close to a fairly large town.  It appears that in the last five or ten years a lot of new houses have been built in the general vicinity of this orebody and <Col N="1209" /> in general the orebody is within half a mile of the town of Navan which is only a short distance in environmental terms when one takes into account the nature of an open-cast mine.</P>
    <P>An application to have the Bula ore mined partly by open-cast and partly by underground methods is based on the provisional mining plan prepared by the Canadian subsidiary of Bechtel on behalf of Bula and submitted to the arbitrators and to the local authority.  Bechtel apparently take the view that the more open-cast mining that can be done on this orebody the better because it will make the mine or the Bula part of it more profitable. The difference in cost of extraction and concentration of the two methods of mining is estimated at various sums. The best advice I can get in respect of that is that it would appear to be a difference of £4 a ton in production and concentration of the ore; that of course is a significant difference if one accepts the output of the Bula part of the orebody as being approximately a million tons of ore a year. That will mean a difference in running costs of £4 million a year approximately if one were forced into an underground situation rather than an open-cast mine.  It is obvious, therefore, that Bula and their advisers would, very properly in the interests of the company, presumably be supported in this by the Minister in seeking to have as much as possible mined by open-cast methods.</P>
    <P>An open-cast mine has to be opened by machinery and explosives.  The quicker it is opened the more commercially advantageous it is.  Therefore, having got your permission, you could open it by working 24 hours a day, seven days a week and so you would cut your costs and bring your mine into production much more rapidly.  In doing that you would keep down your capital expenditure.</P>
    <P>There will obviously be enormous, perfectly understandable, objections in the locality to work going on there on the opening of an open-cast mine and subsequently on the mining of the ore from it on a 24-hour-day basis or anything even remotely like that.  It will presumably be the wish of the <Col N="1210" /> local residents, if open-cast mining is to be used there at all, to have it confined to ordinary eight to five or eight to six working hours when people, particularly children, would not be expected to be asleep normally.  The county council will be very strongly pressed by objectors and local residents that, if they are going to give permission at all for open-cast mining, they confine the hours of the operation, and presumably also the mode of the operation of opening the pit and mining from it; and that the machinery and explosives appropriate to the opening of an open-cast mine in the middle of the Australian desert or some such place would not be at all appropriate to the edge of the town of Navan and that less efficient but environmentally more acceptable methods would have to be used.</P>
    <P>If the local authority listen to these views and accede to them&mdash;and one can scarcely envisage how they could refuse to do so&mdash;the costings of this proposed mine will be considerably higher than have been envisaged by those who made valuation bets on the Bechtel report.  Of course those who made valuations based on the Bechtel report were not confined by any means to Bula's economists or Bula's financial advisers.  The Minister did not have any detailed examination of the production plan of the mine carried out on his behalf and he simply used the Bechtel report and the other documents submitted by Bula to the arbitrators, copies of which were sent to him and these documents in turn were submitted by him to his various advisers, such as the Geological Survey, Lazard Brothers and Company Ltd., Mergers Ltd., and the other people who advised the Department from time to time in regard to the valuation, the feasibility and the likely cost of this project.</P>
    <P>It would appear from what we now know that Lazard Brothers were very concerned, and very properly so, about the planning and environmental aspects of the proposed operation. Although they had only six weeks to do a job which obviously would need many times that to do it as thoroughly as they would wish, in that period of <Col N="1211" /> six weeks they commissioned one of the leading firms of town planning consultants in Ireland, the name of which I understand is Delaney, McVeigh and Pike to advise them on the planning and environmental considerations involved.</P>
    <P>One understands that Mr. Delaney of that firm, one of the principal partners, in advising Lazard, who in turn passed on the advice to the Department, expressed grave reservations about the planning aspects generally, and expressed great fear about delays, and set out what he felt was likely to be a timetable.  He felt there would be considerable delay.  By virtue of the lack of progress of the application to Meath County Council for the reasons I mentioned earlier, it would appear that Mr. Delaney's timetable has been set back perhaps another four, five or six months, and that it could be late in 1978 before one would finally be in a position to know where one stood in regard to planning.</P>
    <P>All this presupposes that planning permission in some form will be given eventually.  I do not think one is entitled to presuppose that.  Many people take the view that it is unrealistic to talk about the possibility of planning permission not being granted because there is a Minister involved.  While that may be a popular way of looking at it, I do not think it is fair to the local authority concerned, who will look at the matter objectively whether or not a Minister is involved.  Although I do not know anything about them.  I hope the new planning board, with some experienced officials and some other members who I understand on the admission of their patron have no experience whatever in this field, will be equally objective, and one trusts they will, in their consideration of this matter.</P>
    <P>Obviously this is one of the most involved planning applications made to any local authority since our new form of planning came into operation in 1964 under the 1963 Act.  The appeal, if there is one, and there almost certainly will be either by Bula if they are turned down by the local <Col N="1212" /> authority or by the objectors if permission is given, will be a very lengthy process.  One would expect An Taisce to become involved as well as the local residents.  There will probably be an enormous amount of evidence given and technical evidence from various parts of the world will be called and 300 or 400 individual householders or house owners may wish to come along to voice their objections.</P>
    <P>Therefore, it is very likely to be up to two years from now before what I describe in this amendment as full and final planning permission is granted. An enormous number of things could well happen in that very long period, whether it is nearly two years, as has been suggested, or whether it is a shorter period of one year, or a year and a quarter.  Certainly it will be a very long period by any normal standards.  An enormous number of things can happen in the meantime. An enormous number of factors which are imponderables at present may clarify themselves in one way or another.</P>
    <P>If some of these imponderables and, in particular, if the planning imponderables clarify themselves in a way which is seriously detrimental to the company, is not the position of the taxpayer, who is ultimately carrying the can for the Minister in regard to this whole affair, seriously jeopardised? Should not the Minister wait until he knows where he stands in relation to planning before he commits himself and the taxpayer to the money mentioned here and to the potential further payments which may have to be made, and probably will have to be made, as a result of the undercapitalisation of the company and the necessity for giving guarantees, and so on?</P>
    <P>Would not any prudent businessman make perfectly sure that he would not expend a £5 note on a project of this kind which was obviously going to be the subject of enormous objection at the two levels of the planning process?  Would not a man of even the most moderate prudence decline to become involved until the planning situation had clarified itself?  It might be&mdash;although I think it unlikely&mdash;<Col N="1213" /> that Bula will get a fairly straightforward planning permission with some slight or what would be from their point of view very reasonable restrictions on their mode of working and the amount of work they could do in opening an open-cast mine and mining from it.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, it is very likely that planning permission could be granted subject to conditions which Bula or anyone else who owned an orebody they wanted to mine on the edge of a town by open cast mining would find very onerous in the financial sense to comply with?  Is it not perfectly conceivable in this instance that the conditions might be such, because of the nature of open cast lead and zinc mining, that the company in their commercial financial wisdom might decide it was too expensive to go ahead and that to comply with all those conditions would add millions of pounds and perhaps even tens of millions of pounds to the capital and running costs of the company?  Therefore they would decide as a matter of prudence not to go ahead with opencast mining and to think again about opening an underground mine to which one would assume there would be no significant or serious objection.</P>
    <P>The whole costing situation is then thrown into the melting pot if that happens.  I have been talking only about the things which might happen on the positive side.  I have been assuming all along that permission will actually be given.  Are we entitled blandly to make that assumption?  The public are making it because a Minister is involved but, as I said, that is not sufficient reason for making it.  We are not entitled to assume that, even subject to onerous conditions, permission will be given.  It is quite conceivable that it will be refused.</P>
    <P>I understand that in the past few weeks An Taisce have issued a public statement to the effect that this part of the orebody could be mined underground and, if that were done, there would be very little environmental or other harm caused in the locality. There would be no noise, or very little noise.  The noise would be quite negligible. There would be no dust because everything would be underground. <Col N="1214" /> There would be no muck or dirt because all the work would be going on underground.  There would be no danger to health from lead concentrate or zinc concentrate which I think is less dangerous but, nonetheless, contains some danger to health if inhaled in large quantities.</P>
    <P>All these problems would be avoided by underground mining but the cost to the company would be significantly more.  It might be that the local authority and/or the appeals tribunal to whom the inevitable appeal would be brought in this case by one side or the other would say: &ldquo;O.K. We accept the company's case that it would cost them a great deal more, millions and millions of pounds more, to operate an underground mine.  It appears to be technically feasible, at any rate, and even though it will cost millions and millions of pounds more, the harm to the environment caused by an opencast mine in this place would be so great that we cannot see our way to give permission for it.&rdquo;  That is on the cards.  I do not say it will happen but it is certainly a possibility to which one would have to give very serious consideration.</P>
    <P>The House should look at this question, not from the point of view of the Minister who is committing and has committed himself with his eyes closed &mdash;this was long ago in June, 1974&mdash; but from the point of view of a prudent and successful businessman, a man like yourself, Mr. Chairman.  Would any prudent and successful businessman commit more than £9.5 million into a venture such as this where the planning and environmental difficulties are enormous, probably greater than in the case of any other single planning application since 1964?  There is only one possible answer and that is that no prudent businessman would do it.  If a prudent businessman would not commit himself to spending this money whether he got planning permission or not&mdash;which is what this amounts to&mdash; why should a Minister in charge of public moneys commit those moneys to a purpose to which no businessman would commit his own money or his bank's or his shareholders' money? We all know that no businessman would do it but still we are asked here <Col N="1215" /> where we represent the Irish people to give <i>carte blanche</i> to the Minister for Industry and Commerce to do this with our money.  I think that is wrong and I would be very surprised if the chairman thought it was anything other than wrong.</P>

      <P>I know that.  In this amendment I seek to defer the payment of the money until permission is obtained if it is obtained, and if it is not, that the money should not be paid.  If it is obtained, I seek to give Dáil Éireann and the country at large an opportunity to assess the conditions, to give Bechtel an opportunity to produce a detailed production plan based on the actual conditions that will apply, not on some theoretical possibility that if we were given permission to do (a) we would do it this way and if the permission were (b), we would do it another way and so on.  Bechtel should be handed a planning permission if they ever come.  They should be told: &ldquo;These are the conditions for planning permission, now produce a detailed plan.&rdquo;  Having done that, they should go to the financial advisers of the Minister and the company and let them work out the capital costings and the day-to-day costings of producing the ore concentrate.  Until that is done, one cannot have all these plans the Minister says exists.  No doubt they all exist in the sense that they are written on paper that if such and such, then so and so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Until you know that, first, you have permission and, second, you know what the conditions are, you cannot produce any of the subsequent 19 points I referred to in my Second Reading speech, because you cannot have a production plan that is final or definite.  You can have an assumed one subject to contingencies; you can base it on a hypothetical situation that if you did have planning permission, subject to these conditions then this would be a suitable production plan. Until you know the conditions, you <Col N="1216" /> cannot know any of the other factors needed to arrive at the final figures in relation to this company.  Until you have planning permission and you know the cost of complying with those conditions you cannot make a final valuation of that company and you are foolish to try.  Lazard have said that very forcefully and clearly, and I have no doubt that various other advisers on all sides have said much the same.</P>
    <P>No prudent businessman would get himself involved in a situation of so many imponderables, and the biggest of them all is the planning imponderable. If no prudent, normal, businessman would do it, why should a Minister using public money do it?  Surely the standard for a Minister is not less than that of a prudent, knowledgeable, businessman.  I suggest that because public money is involved it should even be higher.  That only reinforces my argument.</P>
    <P>There is no point in somebody like Deputy B. Desmond coming in here, as he almost certainly will, and say that Tara went ahead before they had planning permission, as did other companies, for an underground mine where there was not the slightest difficulty or doubt about the fact that they were going to get it because there was little or no interference in those cases with the environment or with the locality or the amenities enjoyed by the several thousand people who live close by.  They were not seriously interfered with in all the development that has taken place up to now and they would not be interfered with to any significant degree by the non-open cast method of this mine.  They will be interfered with by open-cast mining. There is, therefore, grave doubt about the situation generally.</P>
    <P>It appears that Mr. Delaney who is very experienced in these matters gave precise and detailed advice to Lazard about the difficulties being encountered here.  He said there would be very substantial difficulties and that there was no guarantee that at the end of them the permission would be definitely forthcoming, although he thought it very likely that it would, and there was no guarantee that the <Col N="1217" /> conditions would not be extremely onerous and costly to comply with in financial terms.  That is the position we are faced with.  There is no businessman of even reasonable prudence who would commit himself to a deal like this without planning permission. The Minister is now seeking to do it.  Because of that, he is unable to assess accurately the costs of all the various other aspects of trying to open the mine.</P>
    <P>That is why I believe this whole operation is foolish.  I do not believe, as Deputy Desmond and others sought to suggest, that the State should never get involved in equity participation in companies, even in mining companies which are notoriously the most dangerous of all.  I have no objection to the State getting involved, subject to two conditions: first, that they have control of the company.  They should not be in the degrading position they are in now, where even if they got 59 per cent of the shares they would still be outvoted by the 41 per cent held in one block. Secondly, if the State is involved, the company should not act in a way a normal, prudent, businessman would not act.</P>
    <P>The State should not put in £9.54 million in circumstances in which a normal, prudent, businessman would refuse to put it in.  If a normal, prudent, businessman would wait to see the terms or existence of the planning permission, the Minister, too, should wait. I have no objection, to equity participation by the State in mining or any other commercial or industrial venture. I damn well object to the State going in in circumstances that they are making fools of themselves when no businessman would do the same.  I also object to them going in with a permanent in-built minority situation, and taking foolish risks such as this in paying a large sum of money for a minority shareholding, when there is no permission given for something one cannot assume permission about.  If the State were prepared to act as a normal, prudent, businessman would act, I would be behind them in that respect but they are not doing that here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I dealt at length with the subject matter of this section during <Col N="1218" /> the Second Stage debate.  Deputy O'Malley described the situation about the planning application which is between the applicant company and the people who have the statutory responsibility to deal with it.  I must be very careful not to express any views that could be interpreted as seeking to influence the decisions that these people may make.  Of course, there are certain things I can say without influencing the position or without, I hope, in any way being accused of endeavouring to apply unfair pressure.  Orebodies occur not where we would wish them, but they have been there for millions of years and they occur where we found them.  We do not choose the location. In having an orebody of that magnitude and of that quality, grading at that level, and coming so near the surface, we have had a great piece of good fortune.  In having it so close to Navan, we have had bad fortune, because one wants to keep the environment of our towns and cities not just as good as it is, but continuously making it better.</P>
      <P>It is a truism that between the optimum economic exploitation of that orebody, and the proper environmental concerns of the people of Navan, particularly those closest to the mine, that is, between maximum profit and maximum environmental protection, there is, of course, a conflict and there will have to be a trade off.  That is a truism which I am sure we all accept.</P>
      <P>The optimum economic development of this orebody is very important at a number of levels.  Firstly, it is important for prosperity.  Let us remember that while Navan have an environmental threat and they must be very aware of this, on the other hand they have good fortune because this means prosperity for the area.  The livelihood of the people employed there during the construction and production stages is also a consideration.  That is a plus. It is important for the State not only because of their financial interest in it but much more widely because of the added value which can be achieved from processing the ores by an Irish smelter and because of the significant impact that will have on our exports and our balance of payments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1219" /> On the other hand, there is the important consideration of the environment and of the entitlement of the people living in the area to arrangements which will not unduly interfere with their lives.  I believe the whole task is to find solutions which reasonably provide for both those important objectives.  I am prepared, even though apparently others are not, to leave it to the applicants for planning permission and to the competent authorities to work out appropriate solutions.</P>
    <P>I want to emphasise this.  The question of planning permission was fully considered by the board of arbitrators. They reached their decision after hearing all the facts.  It is relevant to say in regard to the seriousness of their work on the planning aspect that members of the board visited the site of the mine and were able to see for themselves its relationship to the town of Navan and its environment.</P>
    <P>There was an assault on the competence of the board of arbitrators, and the correctness of the Government in choosing that arbitration mechanism. The board consisted of three people, one a lawyer and an engineer, a rare combination in those important skills, a man who had considerable experience of planning because he had been involved in planning applications and planning permissions; another an accountant with money skills, and the third an engineer with technological skills.  In terms of the range of their skills, it would have been hard to find a more balanced board.  If one says there should have been mining specialists&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I was saying they had visited the site and not alone had they submissions but one was actually a planning specialist and they had gone to have a look at the mine. Such was the seriousness of the concern that arose on this question of planning permission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1220" /> Furthermore, detailed submissions were made by the State and their advisers in relation to the environmental indications on different mining methods, both as regards the type of measures which would have to be adopted to reduce the environmental impact of the operations to acceptable levels, and also how the provision of these measures would affect development and production costs.  The board were made fully aware of the planning legislation and procedures applicable here and the environmental standards which had been imposed in relation to mining development nearing completion in the area.  The report and outline specification which Bula submitted to the planning authorities were made available to the board.  Ultimately, the members of the board having seen the position on the ground, and having studied everything submitted by the two sides, had to draw their own conclusion as to what the likely outcome of the planning application would be.</P>
    <P>Let me say this about planning.  We have had bad experiences in two directions.  We have had had experiences because we let things happen which should not have happened.  They are numerous and stretch over a long period.  Now, at last, and I say it with great pleasure as a long-standing environmentalist, we have become aware of the environment. In politics it is suddenly a matter of public concern and I am very pleased about that.  Then we made a few mistakes by not permitting things to happen which should have.  I give the example of Schering Plough in the Suir Valley.  This industry would have been of great help and benefit to that area but it did not go ahead.</P>
    <P>The danger, as Deputies know, is to avoid exaggeration and hysteria and letting the genie out of the bottle because you can drive half-informed, quarter-informed or not completely informed people crazy with apprehension and prevent things from happening that ought to.  That is a great danger.  I regret Schering Plough.  We were doing very well in the pharmaceutical industry but it went astray.  I am sure it was a mistake, <Col N="1221" /> and as an environmentalist, I am sure that industry posed no threat to the environment.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, we succeeded with Asahi, though it was a close run thing.  I am glad we did but it was very dodgy and it makes a great deal of difference to a large area of Mayo. This is a delicate area and I want to avoid the possibilities of hysteria and bad decisions.  When that is said, it therefore follows that the valuation put by the arbitrators took into consideration all those things which were thoroughly and fairly put before them.  Indeed, a report which Deputy O'Malley quoted was in fact prepared for one of my advisers for my side of the argument and at my behest.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister suggesting that because the report was prepared for him it was geared to give the impression that the prospects of planning permission were worse than they actually were?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Since about 6 o'clock we have been behaving reasonably and on this very sensitive issue I should like to continue.  Suddenly we get the tone of sneer and of irrelevance introduced because the Deputy is talking about the question of valuation procedures. He has an amendment about valuation.  We will debate it.  I want to do so but if we observe the decencies we will get there all the quicker.  I was making the point that the material quoted was produced from our side. The valuation for the whole orebody took those things into consideration and the valuation assumes a normal return on capital.  That is one way of defining what a valuation is; it is that which gives an average return on capital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1222" /> If we had invested at that rate we might have been doing something good or something bad; we would have been taking the normal risk.  But we did not do that.  That is where the built-in protection is because we got more than twice as much as the money we spent.  We asked the valuation of the orebody and they gave us an answer.  That arbitration will stand up and the excellence of the arbitrators will stand up.  Of that total valuation we got more than 100 per cent compensation built in because we got 49 per cent for the price of 24 per cent.  It is something that a normal and prudent person would do because it is twice as good as that which the arbitrators considered would give a normal return on capital.  That is not the end of the story because Deputy O'Malley knows that the Tara orebody is four times as big as the Bula one, give or take a bit; we cannot be exact. Deputy O'Malley knows that I could not have got 25 per cent of Tara without 25 per cent of Bula.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Because there was an agreement given under duress by the previous Government that they would get a lease and because without the negotiating card in my hand, without having got the 25 per cent without charge from Bula, there was not a hope in hell of getting it from Tara.</P>

      <P>There are various other points but I have tried to deal concisely with what Deputy O'Malley said.  There are bits and pieces about open-casting, about small points that I could take up but I will not.  How can it be called a bad deal when one form-it be called a bad deal when one formally got twice as much and in fact got <Col N="1223" /> four times as much again as the amount an arbitrator considers will give a normal return on capital?</P>

      <P>What Deputy O'Malley is asking the Minister to do by way of accepting this amendment is quite reasonable.  The Minister has not dealt with the amendment at all in his reply. All Deputy O'Malley is asking the Minister to do is to postpone payment of any moneys until such time as planning permission has been granted.  This is a very reasonable approach and is quite a normal practice in business particularly when dealing with property. Most people who buy property for development in any form insert a condition in their contracts of sale making the purchase subject to planning permission.  Deputy O'Malley is asking the Minister to do something that is being done everyday.  What control has the Minister over the length of time that will elapse with regard to this planning permission? He has spoken about assessments and valuations by experts and so on.  He has mentioned Schering-Plough.  I mention the planning application for the Dublin Bay oil refinery.  How long did that go on from the date of the first submission to the planning authority until it finished up following and oral hearing?  As far as I am aware it went on for a number of years.  Surely the Minister will appreciate that the promoters of that project also had expert advice available to them such as the Minister says he has had?</P>

In the interests of the people of Navan and the surrounding area we hope that the decision about planning permission will not take too long but it is quite possible that it will take two years or longer because of emotionalism, oral hearings and all that goes with this.  We have experienced this recently in the case of the Dublin Bay oil refinery.</P>

      <P>At the outset I should like to pay tribute to the former Minister for Education, Mr. Richard Burke, who I suppose was in his own way a controversial Minister.  He was, I suppose, conservative, but he was honest and his actions followed through from his personal convictions. Anyone in politics who follows his conscience is to be admired.  Far too often politicians are accused of saying one thing and doing the other.  While I personally may not have agreed with him on a number of things, for instance, on contraception, at least the had the manliness to be honest about it.  I want to pay tribute to him not for his personal political convictions, which are his own, but for the good, solid work he did while Minister for Education.  I do not want to go into the amount of money involved since we came into Government, but in every city, town and village throughout Ireland the beneficial effects of his ministry are to be seen.  In my constituency the number of new schools and extensions to be built has increased dramatically, and I am proud of this Government's policies. We have tackled education in an intelligent way.  In fairness to Fianna Fáil I should say their introduction of the regional technical colleges was a step forward, and I am glad to see that we in this Government are continuing that broadening of third level education. Unfortunately, the Minister, when he was appointed to Europe, <Col N="1225" /> suffered vilification from members of the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;of the problems facing higher education.  I would like to inform the Opposition, who seem to be so worried about money, that up to 1970-71 the total higher education grant for students living in non-adjacent areas, that is outside university towns, including fee and maintenance, was £300.  This was increased in the academic year 1972-73 and divided into two elements, a lecture fee of up to £156 and a maintenance grant for students not living in a university town of £250, making a total of £406.  That was a step forward.</P>
      <P>The grant was further increased by this Government up to the present maximum maintenance level of £300 for the academic year 1974-75 and the maximum for lecture fees has been raised to £247, giving a total of £547 for a non-adjacent area student.</P>
      <P>That is progress.  The Minister and every Deputy here would like to see that increased, but the limiting factor is finance.  Not only that, but the moneys at the disposal of the Minister for Education must cover national school education, secondary and vocational and also other third level aspects apart from the university which are quite broad, for instance, the various training colleges.  All these are competing and someone has to make an evaluation as to which is the most important.  Some will say that a solid national education is the most important; others will say more emphasis should be placed on vocational and secondary education in order to give a good grounding.  My personal opinion is that university education as such has been grossly over-rated and that perhaps we are turning out too many graduates who cannot find employment in Ireland.  The profession they wish to enter will not bear more entrants and subsequently if they do enter it, their income will be decreased.  They may not be able to enter their chosen profession.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to see higher education grants being made more available to courses in regional technical colleges and colleges of technology.  I am <Col N="1227" /> delighted that this Government of Fine Gael and Labour were the first to see the value of higher education grants being made available in regional technical colleges and in colleges of technology.  That is a solid step forward. I am very much aware, as chairman of the board of management of the Waterford Regional Technical Colleges, of the care being taken to ensure that the standard of the courses and the standard of the teachers and lecturers in the various colleges are at such a high level that, with time, the national certificates and diplomas which will become available and are already available will be recognised not only in Ireland but in England, Europe and America.  I see the facilities in the regional technical colleges as being a very important breakthrough in education in Ireland and one which I have acknowledged was helped along by Fianna Fáil and has been expanded in no small way by this Government.  The courses concerned are solid courses in business, in technology and in science&mdash;subjects which have not been catered for in the universities but which are of much more use and of much more relevance to many children leaving secondary schools as well as to the needs of industry, commerce, science and technology in today's world.</P>
    <P>I look forward to a time, hopefully in the near future, when greater emphasis will be placed on the question of grants by the relevant authorities, not only by the local authorities but by way also of an increase in the responsibility of the VECs in this regard.  I trust that in the future these authorities will be given more control in relation to the moneys that they can allocate for scholarships that would be tenable not only in respect of courses at university level but also in respect of other courses which are just as important to our society as are degree courses.  This is an interesting point of view but it is a very important aspect.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see a reference in the Minister's speech to a statement made on September 10th last when it was stated that it was proposed to have a <Col N="1228" /> fundamental review of the terms of schemes that would apply as and from the academic year, 1977-78.  I am not aware of what changes are to be made but I trust that greater emphasis will be placed in the area of higher education on the role of the regional technical colleges and of colleges of technology.</P>
    <P>The question of the equality of opportunity in this regard has been referred to by Fianna Fáil.  This is a matter which has become as relevant to the field of higher education as is the question of the value of grants. There is a case to be made for having a graduated scale of maintenance grants related directly to the distance that a person lives from a university or from a college of technology.  What is more important, though, is that the level of the grants should vary according to the number of children from each family attending higher education courses.  The situation for a parent who has one child attending a university, on the basis of a grant, is not likely to be very difficult in terms of the burden on the parent but the situation is different where there may be two, three or even four children engaged in higher education at the same time.  In those circumstances there would be great hardship on the family unless they happened to be wealthy.  Even for a man earning between £6,000 and £10,000 per year the burden would be great in respect of two or more children attending an institute of higher education on the basis of grants.  Therefore, I ask the Minister to have regard to this aspect of the situation and to consider increasing the grant, especially in relation to maintenance.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of the matter that is causing concern and about which a number of people have approached me is in relation to the income tax situation in so far as claims for expenditure in respect of children at university are concerned.  Although the tax-payer can claim in respect of the child engaged in studies at this level, it would help a lot if expenses in that regard could be deductible from income tax liability.  A move in this direction would be very constructive.  It would not be beyond the ability of an inspector of taxes to estimate such <Col N="1229" /> expenses and the relief given in this way would be of much benefit to the parents concerned.  I am thinking in terms of the expenditure by way of expense in excess of the value of the grant being taken into account in the assessment of income tax liability.  Such a move would not be likely to cost the Exchequer a large amount of money. Perhaps the figure would be in the region of not more than £2 million or £3 million.  A change of this kind would benefit greatly many middle-class people such as managers, teachers and so on who wished to send a second or subsequent child to an institute of higher education.</P>
    <P>The number of people attending universities and other institutes of third level education as well as the number in receipt of grants for this purpose has increased rapidly.  While Deputy Wilson was speaking on this matter I was asking myself what really is the present situation.  Since we came to office there has not been any student unrest.</P>

This Government have shown a greater commitment to social and educational needs than Fianna Fáil showed in their term of office.  The need for commitment to education is obvious to all.  The need for the education of handicapped children is being tackled. I hope that there will be more commitment to this type of education in the future when we are re-elected after the general election.

      <P>The money available to the Minister for higher education or for any other aspect of education must be balanced between priority and needs.  Those priorities extend from the national schools, right through to helping handicapped people, secondary, vocational and higher education. These needs must be balanced skilfully and we have done this.  We have widened the availability of higher education grants outside the university and this was a great step forward which I hope will be expanded more in the future.  One must remember that money committed to higher education grants and financing our institutions will deprive other fields of education including slow learners.  I would give a higher degree of importance to having teachers available for slow learners and for mentally and physically handicapped schools, than to higher education grants.  I am sorry that the content of the motion on the Order Paper is too narrow.  It is trying to take one aspect of education and isolate it.  We all agree that there should be more money for education. I am sure the Minister would love to give more money for grants.  It is a politically favourable thing to do in an election year.</P>

      <P>One aspect of education cannot be discussed in isolation, the whole spectrum should be looked at and within that spectrum there are sections of equal and in many cases of greater importance than higher education.  I am disappointed <Col N="1233" /> that the Opposition did not in their wisdom see the need and the importance of the broader spectrum of the problems facing education.  They should not have taken the grants level and tried to isolate it.  That was wrong and showed a lack of maturity.  With the passage of years I am sure Deputy Wilson and the Fianna Fáil Party in Opposition will understand these problems as they arise, and perhaps the next time they are putting down a motion for discussion they may in their wisdom understand even greater problems facing the Minister for Education and any Government.</P>

      <P>In my contribution I propose to treat all aspects of education and then relate the terms of the motion specifically to them.  I disagree with Deputy Collins when he suggests that this is about higher education.  This is about social justice in the matter of higher education.  For some time now it has been popular and commonplace to talk about equality in higher education and to give the impression that the system is such that everybody can benefit from it to the same extent.  I would say that if education is about anything, it is about speaking the truth.  Over the years education has enjoyed, and perhaps more recently has suffered, from many interpretations.  It has moved a long way from the time when scholars were prepared to subject themselves to deprivation and self-sacrifice in the pursuit of what they regarded as education.  It has moved a long way from the time when education was structured so that it provided personnel for the legal profession, the medical profession and the diplomatic corps.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is true that education has lost much of its ancient glory.  Education as I see it today benefits very little from what might be called idealism. One need not be accused of being cynical if one were to say that education <Col N="1234" /> today is about money.  The proof of that can be seen in many areas but perhaps more especially in the higher branches of education in what are regarded as the higher professions when we see how they have, for reasons best known to themselves, congregated in bodies of corporate power to extract the last penny for their services.  It is true to say that today education is practical in approach rather than philosophical.</P>
    <P>I have stated already and I repeat that to some extent education may be equated with the old much-criticised capitalist system.  People are concerned with what they can get out of education and there is more emphasis on the material than on the spiritual.  I am not saying that is an offence although it might be regarded as a pity.  I am disappointed because I do not see evidence of the benefits that should attach to university or third level education visible in the products of the system, if I might call them that. The situation has moved a long way from the time when, in my innocence, I was attracted to and believed in what Cardinal Newman said about universities and university education.  What has happened is unfortunate but we must accept the situation.  We can establish that today education is about achieving something that may guarantee a certain mental and intellectual satisfaction but which more especially guarantees economic security and wellbeing for the individual concerned.</P>
    <P>I do not like to talk about education in this way but I do so because all around me there is evidence that the situation is as I have set out. Equality of education may exist to the extent that some 750,000 young students in primary schools will be exposed and treated to the same course but that is not equality of opportunity when we consider the economic and social pressures that exist in certain abodes as against others.  It is a fallacy, a myth and a deception to say that there is equality of opportunity in education.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Minister agrees with me that the areas that require the most attention are the primary and secondary levels although I agree that <Col N="1235" /> we must always have a tertiary or higher level.  I am anxious that we have a situation where, irrespective of the economic or social conditions existing in any home, the boy or girl from that home will have an opportunity if desired to pursue education into the third level.  That is not the position that obtains now.  It did not obtain when Fianna Fáil were in power.  It has never been the position but for me it must be our goal and in that regard the motion in the name of our spokesman on Education and in the names of other members of our party is relevant.  It is not a narrow approach, as Deputy Collins said.  It refers to our whole approach to the wide area of education, making it available to people without attaching conditions so that the people generally will benefit from the aggregate IQ of the nation, not the IQ of those who are fortunate enough to be able to pay for education. There is a loss to the individual and to the nation which must be corrected. So far as I am concerned, at the moment the courses at primary and secondary level are geared towards the middle and upper middle classes.  There is a supposition that every child comes from a home where the education he gets at school will be complemented in the home but that is not true.</P>
    <P>I hope I will not be regarded as parochial if I refer to the situation in Dublin city and county.  Notwithstanding all the difficulties obtaining throughout 1976, some 8,700 students in the area passed their leaving certificate.  I am not saying that all of them had credits or qualifications that would entitle them to enter university.  Let us assume that of that number 6,000 children lived in the Dublin city area; I think that is an under-estimate but it will suffice for the purpose of my argument.  I am assuming that half of that number, 3,000, had qualifications that would enable them to enter university.  I do not want to talk about examinations.  The sooner the present system is changed the happier I shall be but I am not going to develop that point now.  I am making the further assumption that 1,000 came from what is <Col N="1236" /> commonly, and incorrectly, called working class areas, and were the children of parents who could not afford to pay for third level education. Let us consider the situation of a boy or girl in that category.  He or she has passed the leaving certificate examination with two, three or four honours, and he or she is anxious, for the same reason as other people, for the satisfaction of his motivation towards material gain, which he is entitled to have in the same way as everybody else, to pursue education at university level but his parents cannot afford it.</P>
    <P>University education at the moment is a wholetime occupation.  He has no money.  He cannot go to university. He cannot go unless he gets some form of assistance to which I believe he is entitled from society.  Assuming there are 1,000 students in Dublin for whom the third level education grant allegedly caters, what do we find?  Of 7,000 leaving certificate students last year of whom, I submit, 1,000 were qualified for university, the position was that that 1,000 could not go to university because they did not have the money.  Dublin Corporation offered 72 third level education grants to the totality of students dependent upon financial aid in pursuing third level education.</P>
    <P>Deputy Collins expects me to offer to the former Minister for Education the compliments of this party and of the nation for what he did for education. I have never made political capital out of education but, as a politician, I am entitled to say to Deputy Collins that after we left office in 1973 there were moneys available, moneys which had arisen as a result of our thrift, and the number then out of a lower total of students was 195.  The Minister was lauded by Deputy Collins and yet we have a situation in Dublin where the number dropped from 200 beneficiaries to a meagre 72.  Those figures cannot be contradicted.</P>
    <P>Do they not tell a story?  I submit they do and the story is that eligibility for these grants is totally and utterly unrealistic.  Equality of opportunity. In 1976 a student with two honours in <Col N="1237" /> his leaving certificate whose parents could afford to pay for him in university could be accommodated in university. The poor man's child must have four honours but even with those four honours he cannot avail of university education unless he gets financial assistance.  Is that the great equality of opportunity Deputy Collins talked about which occurred under his great Minister?  If it is it is certainly not as attractive to me as it would appear to be to Deputy Collins.</P>
    <P>I am not saying the present holder of the office shares the satisfaction expressed by Deputy Collins but I would hope that he would accept that, if we are making any attempt at all at introducing social justice into third level education, we must move away from the situation where the child of a family who qualify for a medical card does not qualify for a third level education grant.  The new guidelines in respect of medical cards for a husband, wife and one child allows earnings of £1,929 per annum.  There are certain allowances made.  A man with a wife and one child with earnings of more than £1,735 is at a disadvantage because his child will qualify only for the fee and part of the grant. What an appalling situation!  I do not say that situation derives from the fact that there is a Coalition Government in office but the Government must carry responsibility for it and I am hoping that the Minister is now being alerted to the situation and that he will take a different approach from that of his immediate predecessor.  I hope that the case made here can to some extent be used by him at Cabinet level to lever additional moneys for education.</P>
    <P>I can only speak for myself but I think I know our spokesman on Education well enough to know that his attitude is probably identical with mine but possibly more idealistic.  His concern is primarily with the students and their welfare.  He is also concerned for education generally.  I am not happy&mdash; I make no apology whatever for saying this and some of my former colleagues at UCD may say that Tunney is going anti-university and anti-intellectual&mdash;with the position.  Neither am I concerned with superficial comments <Col N="1238" /> or criticisms made on or of me. The position today is that especially at university level we have a continuation of the educational élitism which obtained down through the decades. That is manifest in every profession especially in what are regarded as the higher professions.</P>
    <P>I am not opposed to any person getting that which he is able to pay for and if these are people who can afford to keep their children an additional year at secondary education so they will get the number of points which will entitle them to get into medicine, law, accountancy or engineering, more power to them.  At the same time, there should be recognition of the situation that we all know obtains where the intellectual flowers are blooming unseen and where Dublin city and other urban areas and rural areas have students with an IQ comparable to or even higher than that of others, who have everything that is required to benefit from third level education except the money.  There is an obligation on society at least to make some provision for them and I can see many benefits apart from those which would accrue to the particular student.</P>
    <P>It would be no harm if the jaded arteries of the legal, medical and other professions would enjoy the vibrant, sympathetic and refreshing blood of the children from what are called working class areas.  Are we happy here to continue to look at the situation where in areas of highest population density in Dublin&mdash;Ballyfermot, Inchicore, Finglas, Coolock, you have people as good as the best in this or any other nation who have given to their children a first-class upbringing and who have a respectability and intelligence comparable to that in any area except that they are in this category called the working class?  Is it fair that those areas should not be in a position to contribute to all the professions? If we think that that is their entitlement, we must make financial assistance available to them and I do not think it has to be in the matter of grants.</P>
    <P>For far too long we have tied ourselves to the grant system.  Other countries <Col N="1239" /> like England, the Scandinavian countries and Canada have a system of loans.  Loans could and should be made available and in the system of loans there would be attractions superior to the other system.  I would hope that anybody who benefits from third level education&mdash;and this applies to the student who pays his fees but does not pay for the service he gets, who at the same time enjoys subsistence of about £1,000 a year&mdash;should pay back something to society, to the rest of the community who have helped him to enjoy this service.  I suggest to the Minister, knowing that he would, perhaps, in his newness be open to suggestions more than somebody who might be sitting there for years and hold conservative views, that he might consider the introduction of loans.  He and his officers could negotiate with other countries and the precedent would be there of how the system works. There would be the advantage of making third level education available to people who were anxious but not qualified to benefit from it and it would also mean that they would be required to pay back to society that financial assistance.  I am not saying that the Minister should act as a banker and charge the last £ for interest.  I would hope that the loans could be made at a very small interest rate.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to accept the motion and make news by accepting a motion coming from the Opposition when he knows the merit attaching to it.  I know he accepts, as I do, that there is urgent need at the moment for making financial assistance available to the number of students in this country who are anxious for and capable of third level education but who, unfortunately, for one reason or another have not the wherewithal to pay for it.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom cúpla focal a rá.  I think I should congratulate the Minister somewhat belatedly and wish him well in his relatively new appointment and I extend the hope that education in all spheres will develop under his guidance.  I do not envy him his especially difficult task in <Col N="1240" /> so broad a field but I am sure his personality and ability will hold the people to the immense challenge.</P>
      <P>This motion calls on the Government to increase the money bill of third level grants and scholarships and to update the eligibility limits.  It calls into focus the whole sphere of education and in particular third level education, its relevance, importance, potential and development and it indicates what priority it holds and should hold in our society.  Third level education used to be the domain of the few. University education in days gone by was somewhat limited.  Third level education today is inundated with willing applicants from many different spheres of life and from different economic and geographical backgrounds.</P>
      <P>The motion is selective and the discussion should be broadened in view of the fact that this very motion is being examined and will shortly be reported on, particularly in relation to the terms of the scheme as it operates. Education in general, admittedly, did fall in recent years in priority ratings regarding the amount of finance expended therein in relation to other spheres of activity but this was done with a genuine concern for what were considered and, indeed, were greater priorities at the time.  Education, as can be seen from the figures in the recent budget statement, has increased in these ratings and is gradually turning to its rightful place.  I am sure this trend will continue under the new Minister.  I will not read out these statistics as they are there for those who wish to examine them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The late Donogh O'Malley was an excellent Minister and a generous and great one but the results of his ideas are only now becoming visible in the advanced numbers attending universities and higher level institutes.  The number of grant holders in 1968-69 was 1,419 with a value of £252,185. In the 1972-73 period the number of grant holders was 4,954 with a value of £1,524,371.  For the 1975-76 period the number of grant holders was 6,168 with a total value of £2,401,000. Admittedly, some of these were <Col N="1241" /> attending regional and technical colleges. I want to ask: where are we going?  I am sure Opposition Deputies would ask that question also.</P>
    <P>It appears to me that the motion is too narrow.  We would need a much broader discussion on the whole trend of education.  As we have many thousands of students attending university, it seems ridiculous that they should obtain a degree and then find that their field of ability is somewhat limited after they acquire their degree.  In other words, jobs are not available for those with degrees.  This is why I say the whole subject needs to be rediscussed. To offset this, in 1974 the Government extended the grants and scholarships to regional and technical colleges.  This was a major step and provided an incentive to certain students to follow courses for which they were suited. Regional and technical colleges have greatly increased their capacity and their intake of students in recent times, and this has satisfied many students and enabled them to find their true role and their true position in life.</P>
    <P>It is well-known that in every university there are students who should not be there at all.  This may not be their fault.  During their secondary education it may appear that they have a certain bent for a certain subject but, on reaching university level and having spent a certain amount of time at university, they find this is not the case.  The Government and the Minister have this very important factor under consideration. They have provided a greater range and a greater variety of courses in the different institutions.  The range of subjects followed in technical and regional colleges is wide, varied, practical and successful.  I, for one, want this to continue, if at all possible.</P>
    <P>What we should be discussing is not really the importance of grants and scholarships.  We must ask: are we getting value for the amount of money being expended on education?  If we are not, something must be done about that.  For instance, I understand it costs the State something like £1,600 per year to keep a student in Trinity College.  There are parents of students attending Trinity College who could well afford to pay that £1,600, thus <Col N="1242" /> allowing that money to be allocated elsewhere.  On the other hand, there are parents of students attending that college who are not able to pay that £1,600.  This is a question worth looking at.</P>
    <P>I had intended to mention the system of loans mentioned by Deputy Tunney. This system which operates in some other countries is well worth looking at.  If a student in a particular faculty knows he can acquire a long term low interest loan this provides him with an incentive to attain his goal in that faculty.  This has undoubted potential in the easing of financial stress.</P>
    <P>I know a young person whose mother is a widow.  Presumably he will qualify for a university grant on completion of the leaving certificate course.  His mother is by no means well off and the grant may not cover his expenses.  He lives in a rather remote area.  The local people are willing to subsidise him to a certain extent over and above the grant.  If a business man were willing to put up £100 to help him, would that fact be recognised by the Revenue Commissioners? That point is worth looking at.  Covenants of many types are drawn up in other countries.  I am sure suggestions such as this will receive consideration by the Minister.</P>
    <P>The question of how student grants are spent also needs to be raised.  In my own student days I saw many education grants wasted, to put it mildly.  Many young students travel abroad to get work to subsidise their income for the year and to enable them to engage in leisurely and social activities.  These opportunities in other countries are now somewhat limited and students must learn to balance their budgets.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Deputy opposite in giving priority to primary and secondary education.  To me primary education is one of the bedrocks of our society.  In primary schools pupils learn attitudes to life which are carried on through secondary education into adulthood.  There are more important priorities in our educational system than the grants and eligibility limits. It is fair to say any Minister for Education is strictly bound by <Col N="1243" /> financial limitations.  It is quite easy to allocate millions of pounds without achieving any worthwhile results.</P>
    <P>One of the problems which is much more important than the amount of the grant is the transition from primary school to secondary school. When the new curriculum was introduced in the primary schools some years ago it was accepted with a fair deal of comment by the teachers.  It is not difficult to find secondary teachers who will tell you quite adamantly that primary school pupils are not up to the standard of some years ago. The root cause of this is the method of teaching.  In primary schools that emphasis has changed from being teacher-centred to pupil-centred.  A major problem arises in the pupil-teacher ratio.  This is currently being tackled by the Minister for Education. In my book it is much more important than grants and eligibility limits.</P>
    <P>Our teachers have immense responsibility. It is not easy to stand before 40, 50 or 60 pupils and allow each intellect to develop at its own rate in its own way.  That is a major problem.  In the schools for the handicapped are children who may never see any intellectual light and who may need to be helped all through their lives.  The Minister is concerned with the building of centres for the education of these children and that is of greater importance than the size of grants and eligibility for these grants.</P>
    <P>In the budget speech the Minister for Finance said that with effect from the 1977-78 academic year national maintenance grants would be increased from £300 to £350 for university students whose normal family residence is outside the university town, and from £120 to £140 in the case of other students. Corresponding increases are to be paid in the case of scholarships provided by the vocational education committees. These increases are over and above increases in fee grants which have kept pace with rises in fees generally.</P>
    <P>The motion before us is too confined, particularly when the former Minister announced on 10th September, 1976 that it was proposed to make <Col N="1244" /> a fundamental review of the terms of the scheme which would apply in coming years as and from the academic year 1977-78.  To acquire information on this matter, local authorities were contacted.  This information is being or will be processed and I am sure that in the report on that information there will be reference to some concessions or some innovations in regard to financing higher institutional education for students.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Kitt Mr. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I appeal to the Minister to accept the motion.  The only argument he has made against it is in regard to timing and I do not think that argument stands up when one considers the number of requests made to his predecessor by the various local authorities and by Members on this side of the House.  There is a good deal of hypocrisy about it because we will see that some of the Deputies who are members of local authorities will vote against this motion even though they supported it at their local authority meetings.  It is obvious that a country student who wants to get accommodation in the university town, and buy text books will find it very difficult to get education when that student is not eligible for a grant.  The grant itself is not adequate for third level education. If the sick and unemployed were completely neglected there would be an outcry but it seems that very little attention is being given to those who cannot get third level education.  I believe the Minister's priorities are right and I would ask him to consider seriously the matter of third level education. I point out particularly that the £1,600 income limit of 1973 should now be £2,944 to keep in line with the 85 per cent inflation which has occurred in the meantime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's speech was mainly descriptive.  He spent much time describing the schemes that exist, the grants and the various scholarships.  He said he thought this motion was not put down at the right time.  He went on to a third point, that higher education had to compete for money with all other sectors of education. Those were his three main points.  There is no onus on me to deal <Col N="1245" /> with the long descriptive passages in his speech stating what was available. It was more historic than creative.  He said this was not an opportune time to have this motion because a fundamental review was taking place of the whole question of grants and scholarships for third level education.  I found that very hard to stomach.</P>
      <P>We heard of this fundamental review in September.  On Saturday, 11th September the papers carried one or two lines about this review and the refusal to increase the maintenance part of the third level grant.  The then Minister simply stated that there would be a fundamental review.  We heard nothing about that review in October, November, December or January but in February it was resurrected.  It was worthwhile putting down this motion even to find out what was happening to this fundamental review.  The Minister said that the submissions had all come in and that he would probably soon be getting a document with policy options and that he would have to make decisions on it.  I contend that the fundamental review could have been done in a week or a month at most and that the whole purpose of declaring the fundamental review in September was to delay action in raising the grants and the eligibility limits. This is a typical way of putting off action.  As the Minister said, these are uniform schemes.  It would not require any great, analytic mind to consider them and come up with suggestions for improvement within a week or a month at most.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They say that a camel is a horse designed by a committee and this has a certain amount of truth.  The Minister, after a couple of hours study, could see the weaknesses that we have pointed out to him from this side of the House in the course of the debate in the third level grants scheme.  He could remedy those weaknesses by raising the amount of money for the grants&mdash;and that is the more important point&mdash;and raising the income eligibility limits.  One hears about reviews of that kind and then the thing fades out but when a motion is put down the review is resurrected.  I hope that as a result of this motion the rearguard <Col N="1246" /> action will end and that we shall have an announcement in the near future about high income limits and higher grants.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that from the Opposition's point of view the timing of the motion was wrong.  I suggest that from the Government's point of view the timing of the motion is wrong because it is time the results of this fundamental review saw the light of day and I am hoping that within the next couple of weeks we will have a statement from the Minister on it.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of the Minister's speech struck me as being familiar. From going to the Department on trade union missions, the Department officials have acquired an old technique and it was worked by the Minister in his speech.  I used to call it the pull-the-stool-from-under-you technique. There would be two or three officers of the Department there; one would give way on something and the other would pull the stool from under you immediately.  The Minister used this technique in his speech when he said &ldquo;I cannot give it to higher education because if I do I will be taking it away from primary education&rdquo;. Some speakers fell for this, including Deputy Collins and Deputy Kenny.</P>
    <P>These different levels, as we choose to call them for administrative convenience and ease of identification, the Minister says &ldquo;are, however, in reality so interdependent and inter-related that any alteration at any level must disturb the existing equilibrium and influence all other levels&rdquo;.  I take it that this is the old pull-the-stool-from-under-you technique still working.  Of course, all sections are competing for funds.  Of course, the Minister's job is that of the conductor of the orchestra but he will not have good results conducting his orchestra if he leaves a whole section silent and does not call them into play at all.</P>
    <P>This is what is happening, particularly with regard to the eligibility limits.  I want to make a plea for an individual student about whom I wrote to the Minister.  I am making the plea in the context of a claim for more <Col N="1247" /> flexibility and more humanity in the grants scheme.  When this student did his leaving certificate his parents' income was too high to allow him get a third level grant.  He started an engineering course and is very successful. He is now in his third year.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, he got married and, consequently, his income is well below the eligibility limit.  I appealed to the Minister, and to his predecessor, that this student be allotted an en route grant.  This is not part of the present scheme.  I will not delay the House much longer on this.  I wanted to make the point that he is a serious student delivering the goods, passing his examinations in engineering and is fully qualified academically for the grant. When he first applied he was ineligible for it but now he is in poor circumstances financially and should be entitled to it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Collins spoke about everything. I was expecting to hear the story of the three bears.  He talked about popularity polls and the Minister's predecessor.  I decried a lot of the abuse to which he was subjected. When he was appointed commissioner in Europe, at the first opportunity in St. Patrick's College, Drumcondra, I paid him a tribute that he was no longer a Fine Gael man or an Irish commissioner, he was a European commissioner and this is the proper approach.  Deputy Collins' remarks were irrelevant and I do not know why he had to make them.</P>
    <P>He said more money was required in education.  It has been our contention that the most serious obligation on the Government is to create wealth out of which money for education, the most important social service, should come. The Government have fallen down on this.  It is as fundamental as that.  They have not set about creating wealth, maintaining employment and it is out of this wealth that money can come to fund education at all levels, and in particular the one we are talking about in this motion.</P>
    <P>I refute the Minister's suggestion that this is not an opportune time to put down this motion.  I refute it because the grants are out of line.  I <Col N="1248" /> gave facts and figures, not airy fairy ones.  I gave lodgings charges, fares to college, charges for meals in Belfield. I took a case in University College Dublin and the same would hold in regard to Galway, Cork, Maynooth or Trinity.  The maintenance section of the grants is completely out of line. The eligibility limits are also completely out of line.  There has been a rate of 84 per cent inflation since 1973. No one could be happy about the results of this neglect to raise these limits.</P>
    <P>I pointed out that a messenger or paperkeeper in a Government Department or an agricultural labourer with one child who had got four honours in the leaving certificate would be disqualified from holding a grant under this system.  This is a most ridiculous position to find ourselves in.  The basic purpose of this grant was to make available a third level education to the person who could not otherwise have afforded it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tunney referred to the parlous position in Dublin city.  So many hard working people who are anxious for the social mobility that comes with this type of education are excluded because the income limits which are ridiculously low have been allowed to get out of touch completely with reality.  It is on the strength of this that I claim I could not have put down this motion at a more opportune time.</P>
    <P>I want to congratulate the Deputy from Limerick who has arrived in the House.  He is the first Labour man we saw since this motion started.  There was no Labour Minister or Deputy to speak on this motion.  Where is the conscience of the Labour Party?  Surely they are not out of touch with the needs of the working man at the lowest levels in our society.  They have forgotten the people they are supposed to look after in this House.</P>

    <P>I included scholarships to RTCs in my original speech, despite what Deputy Collins said.

I still have hopes that the Labour members will follow us into the lobby.</P>
    <P>The Minister said figures could not be taken out of the air.  In my opening speech I suggested that he had what we called a quasi-scientific basis but I would call it a fully scientific basis as far as the maintenance part of the grant is concerned, in the consumer price index.  Let him relate the maintenance grants to the consumer price index and he will be doing a good job.</P>
