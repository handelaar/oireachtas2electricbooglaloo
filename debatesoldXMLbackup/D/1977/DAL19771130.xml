    <Title>Finance (Excise Duty on Tobacco Products) Bill, 1977: Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="MartinODonoghue" hpid="Minister for Economic Planning and Development (Professor O'Donoghue) Martin O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Economic Planning and Development (Professor O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to meet Ireland's obligation, as a member of the European Communities, to introduce with effect from 1st January, 1978, the Community system of levying excise duty on cigarettes.  The Community system was introduced in 1973 in all member states except this country and Britain who during the accession negotiations were given until 1st January, 1978, to change from their traditional system.  This postponement was allowed because of what was involved in changing to the Community system. Both countries have been taxing by weight of the raw tobacco, whereas the Community system involves charging on the manufactured cigarettes an excise duty which combines a specific element calculated at a flat-rate per cigarette, and, secondly, with an <i>ad valorem</i> element proportionate to the retail price of the product.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Each member state is free to decide, within upper and lower limits, the precise combination of flat-rate and of proportional duty it will apply.  It is, of course, free to determine the actual rates under each of these elements.  The Community, however, aims at progressively narrowing the gap between the upper and lower limits so as to achieve, in the interest of facilitating trade within the Community, a larger degree of harmonisation of the structure and basis of charge to the duty in all member states.  The first stage of harmonisation which commenced in 1973 provided upper and lower limits on the <Col N="324" /> specific element to be applied by the member states of 75 per cent and 5 per cent of total excise duty.  Discussions are at present proceeding with a view to setting narrower limits for the second stage which will probably commence in July next year.</P>
    <P>The structural change required to comply with EEC obligations will of itself change the relative impact of taxation in Ireland on different sizes and qualities of cigarettes and so will affect to some extent the market pattern and consumer choices.  The flat-rate element in the Community system, because it is the same on all cigarettes, has the effect of narrowing the spread of cigarette retail prices, while the <i>ad valorem</i> element increases with higher prices and consequently facilitates a wider retail price spread.  For the reasons I will now indicate, we will be applying a relatively high flat-rate element and this will result in a narrower price spread on our market.</P>
    <P>In implementing this new excise duty system, it is necessary to achieve a combination of the tax elements which will meet the interests not only of revenue, but also take account of the position of the Irish industry.  The Irish tobacco manufacturing industry, which currently employs some 2,200 people, has been influenced by the form of tobacco duty prevalent over many years.  The impact of the essentially different composite taxation system required by the EEC will inevitably cause significant changes in the market pattern, and it is important that, at least in the initial stages, the resultant difficulties should not be compounded for the Irish industry by the adoption of such combination of the flat rate and proportional elements as could be prejudicial to their competitiveness. With this consideration in mind Ireland has, during the discussions in the EEC on the proposals for a second stage of tobacco tax harmonisation, indicated unwillingness to agree to any appreciable lowering of the upper limit for the percentage of total taxation to be attributed to the flat-rate element.</P>
    <P>The precise combination of the elements will be applied here from 1st January, 1978, is at present being considered <Col N="325" /> and an announcement will be made shortly.  The rates for each element will be calculated in such a way as to preserve the revenue yield. Our Community obligations in regard to the structural harmonisation of excise duty on tobacco products extend only to cigarettes.  However, as it would be inconvenient both to manufacturers and to the Revenue administration to maintain, in conjunction with a post-manufacture excise on cigarettes the existing pre-manufacture excise arrangements on tobacco for manufacture of other products, the Bill provides for the levying of an end-product duty, which will be proportionate to the weight, on pipe tobacco, cigars, &ldquo;roll-your-own' tobacco and chewing tobacco.  This change, which is essentially an administrative one, should not result in any price increases.</P>
    <P>Deputies will notice that snuff is not included in the scope of the Bill and, accordingly, it will not be excisable with effect from 1st January, 1978. My concern in exempting snuff from duty is to protect Irish manufacturers from possible effects of the decision that, from that same date, the duty on snuff in Britain and Northern Ireland will cease.  If the British decision were not reciprocated here, a large price differential would result, which would expose our manufacturers to risk.</P>
    <P>Under the new system, excise duty will be levied at the point where the manufactured goods are invoiced to traders; at present the duty is levied on the unmanufactured tobacco leaf at the point where it leaves the bonded warehouse for the factory.  Following from this change, section 3 of the Bill provides that the period of deferment allowed to manufacturers for payment of duty will run from the new point of charge of the duty, but in order to minimise the revenue shortfall over the financial year as a whole a &ldquo;catch-up&rdquo; mechanism will apply which curtails deferment arrangements for the final month, making due before the end of December half of the payment in respect of goods released from bond in that month.</P>
    <P>Deputies may also be interested in the provisions of section 6 which <Col N="326" /> deals with duty-paid tobacco stocks held by tobacco manufacturers on 1st January, 1978.  In order to avoid double duty payment on these stocks, it is proposed that the duty charged on the stock then held be offset against the duty payments due from the manufacturer at the end of January.  This will enable the new system to operate fully from 1st January, 1978, establishing a clean break from the existing system.</P>
    <P>The provisions of the Bill are described in some detail in the accompanying explanatory memorandum.  I shall be glad, however, in the course of this debate to reply to any points on which Deputies may wish to have further clarification.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>We accept this Bill as part of our obligations under the EEC.  As the Minister said, it is a first step towards the harmonisation of duties on tobacco and the Minister is including pipe tobacco and cigars.  It is important to ensure that Irish manufacturers are not exposed to outside competition which would damage their interests and interfere with their employment prospects.  I understand the trade here is worth something in the region of £150 million and, as the Minister said, over 2,000 people are employed.</P>
      <P>A matter which should be discussed between the officials of the Department of Finance and the officials of the Treasury in England is that a reasonably sizeable proportion of the cigarettes manufactured here are manufactured under licence for houses in England and become part of the British market.  If the balance between the rates of <i>ad valorem</i> and flat rate-duty in England interferes with the competitiveness of British industry and allows imports from the mainland of Europe which would undercut British manufactured cigarettes, the effect will be felt here also.  This may have an adverse effect on employment here. That is a point the Minister should watch.</P>
      <P>The Minister said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For the reasons I will now indicate, we will be applying a relatively <Col N="327" /> high flat-rate element and this will result in a narrower price spread on our market.</P>
    <P>This is one effort to reduce the element of competition between manufacturers throughout the Community.  There are other elements which the Minister should look at also.  I believe the Dutch give three months credit on duty.  The last paragraphs of the Minister's speech suggest he intends to collect the duty on the last day of January for January.</P>
    <P>Some years ago, the cheque for tobacco released from bond had to be paid to the Government before the tobacco could be released.  I believe in recent times there has been some change.  I am not sure what it is, but there is an element of credit.  As opposed to our Dutch competitors, we are at some disadvantage.  The greater proportion of the investment in tobacco is in the duty element so that a two months' differential between Dutch manufacturers and Irish manufacturers, in conjunction with a number of other elements, might put us at a disadvantage.</P>
    <P>Our manufacturers are probably at a little disadvantage anyway, because of the fact that the quality of the tobacco smoked or consumed, whichever is the correct word, here is higher and more expensive than on the Continent.  Some countries on the Continent grow their own tobacco.  There are State monopolies in France and Italy at the manufacturing and retail levels, which could operate in the future to the detriment of Irish manufacturers.</P>
    <P>It is important to ensure that the harmonisation of our laws with the EEC will not affect employment here. We all agree the most important problem we have to face is unemployment, and it is a problem which has to be faced by the whole of Europe in the years ahead.  With six million people unemployed in the EEC, it will not be easy to lower that figure.  Every other country will be adopting an attitude somewhat similar to ours in an effort to improve their competitiveness and open export markets which will allow them to increase the number of people in employment in their own countries. <Col N="328" /> We must be watchful to ensure that what they do to increase their employment is not done at the expense of people at work here.</P>
    <P>The levels between the two rates of tax to which the Minister referred are very important from the manufacturers' point of view.  The Minister might have indicated what precisely the levels will be on 1st January.  I endeavoured to find out this morning from the Taoiseach when the budget will be introduced.  It will probably be at the end of January.  Judging by the emphasis put on the harmful effects of smoking and drinking on health in the campaign conducted by the Government over the past month, it would seem they intend to raise the excise duty on alcohol and tobacco in the budget.</P>
    <P>In fairness to the manufacturers who will have to cope with the situation between 1st January and the date of the budget, if these increased duties are being brought in, they should be told as soon as possible exactly on what basis they will be charged for the month of January.  The Christmas tobacco trade is more than 8½ per cent of their turnover.  I understand they will be paying the duty in the middle of December which should have been paid on 1st December.  I am not absolutely sure of that.  Is it 1st January? It is not clear from the Minister's speech exactly how this will be operated for the manufacturers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is cutting the amount of credit they are receiving on the duty they are paying on the tobacco.  Is that correct?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinODonoghue" hpid="Professor O'Donoghue Professor O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said, at the moment they pay the duty on the tobacco.  Now they will not have to <Col N="329" /> pay the duty until they have a manufactured product.  We simply switched the point at which the duty is levied. There will be a very substantial lengthening in the period of credit for the manufacturer and, therefore, there would be a substantial once and for all fall in the Exchequer revenue which is why we are providing the &ldquo;catch-up&rdquo; mechanism.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinODonoghue" hpid="Professor O'Donoghue Professor O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  On balance, there will be some net gain for the manufacturers.  We are providing a catch-up mechanism which, on balance, still may result in some shortfall to the Exchequer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The intention is that the Government will suffer a once and for all loss, and the manufacturer will gain a fortnight's credit, or half a month depending on when he pays.  He has to pay the duty when the manufactured product leaves his premises. In turn, he gives credit to the retailer which means he is out of his money for that period of time, money which he has already paid to the Government. As I pointed out earlier, in comparison with his Dutch competitor he is at a disadvantage.  I am not sure what the consumer purchase of the product will be but it is probably considerably less than three months so that the Dutch manufacturer has a very favourable cash flow situation as compared with the Irish manufacturer.  It is probably not a point of great significance; I am not sure how many Dutch cigarettes are sold or how many it is possible to sell in this market.  The Minister will have to watch continuously to see that other Governments do not seek this method of undercutting (a) the Irish manufacturer in this market and (b) the United Kingdom manufacturer for the reasons I have explained, that we export perhaps 10 per cent of our manufactures to England.  If we are undercut there, naturally the home companies of the manufacturer here will take up the slack in their own factories in England and stop the importation of cigarettes from Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tomorrow is the first day of December and this is coming into <Col N="330" /> effect on 1st January.  I think at this stage the Government should know what the breakdown between the two rates of tax will be and the manufacturers and this House should be told that as soon as possible, since the Bill comes into effect in a month's time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Our first concern should be with the interests of the people employed in the industry to ensure that any changes necessary, any harmonisation or structural changes in the taxation levying system here would not adversely affect employment in the industry.  The Minister for Health and other Members of the House have spoken against the incidence of cigarette smoking.  The fact is that at this time of high unemployment, changes brought about by us, especially in the taxation sphere, must be such as to maintain the employment position of the industry.  Apparently, this change will alter the taxation system relatively and it is admitted that it will affect the market pattern of the industry.  Perhaps he has already done so but it is necessary that the Minister should make the position clear.  Obviously, there are consequences arising for the retail end of the industry from this legislation.  If our first concern is the maintenance of employment I should hope that there would be full consultation with the manufacturers to ensure that the changing market pattern or any changes brought about by us as a result of our EEC obligations will not drastically affect the industry with the long-term effect of, perhaps, curtailing employment opportunities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like the Minister to let us know as soon as possible what changes he proposes will be introduced from January, 1978, the precise combination of elements that will apply here. If I understand correctly, he has indicated a preference for heavier reliance on a flat rate contribution in the composition of the new tax so as to have a more uniform price structure and meet the demands of our own industry. I should like him to elaborate on this, and say if it is the reason for his seeming support for greater reliance on the flat rate in the new structure. <Col N="331" /> The new obligations relate only to cigarettes and the Minister explains that it would be inconvenient to manufacturers and to the Revenue administration to confine the changes to cigarettes.  Therefore, the Bill provides for the levying of an end product duty, proportionate to the weight, on pipe tobacco, cigars, roll-your-own tobacco and chewing tobacco.  He does not say whether the inconvenience would be greater for the Revenue administration than the manufacturers.  In fact, it would be more inconvenient for the Revenue people but I would like an assurance that the change will not result in any price increase.  The Minister says this but I would like to have this assurance categorically, that it will not lead to any price increase in relation to pipe tobacco because, while the industry does not have a high employment content and the manufacturers have been maintaining for years that the industry is in decline, it has very old traditional roots in the country and I think that nothing we do here to comply with EEC regulations should be such as, perhaps, would do further damage to that old industry based in a part of the country that in the main has suffered tragic industrial loss over the last few days. I should like reassurance in that regard and in the other respects I have mentioned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Economic Planning and Development (Professor O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards making an announcement about the precise rates, I can only say at this stage that it will be made as soon as possible and I anticipate that will not be very long.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MartinODonoghue" hpid="Professor O'Donoghue Professor O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree, but I do not wish to indicate the precise rates at this time.  I can assure the House the announcement will be made in adequate time for the industry's needs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To take the points in reverse order, the question of the impact of retail prices because of the effect of this change over was raised.  As has been <Col N="332" /> indicated, on balance it will have the effect of somewhat raising the price of cheaper cigarettes and somewhat lowering the price of dearer cigarettes. Middle grade, on balance, should be unchanged.  Therefore, while it is not possible to say precisely what the combined effect of all these changes will be because we do not know to what extent consumer preference will shift and consequently sales, there is no reason as of today to believe that there will be any overall, noticeable effect on revenue.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barry spoke about the effect on imported cigarettes and so on, and the effect on our exports, primarily into Britain.  Perhaps I should mention that there is a possibility of an effect on imports here also in the sense that under the present arrangement the duty it levies on leaf tobacco which has a somewhat lower moisture content than that of finished cigarettes and their tobacco products.  I understand that the net effect of this would be that, since we would not be able to distinguish in future between domestically manufactured products and products from other EEC member states, or certainly, to discriminate between them.  The sensible thing is to apply the same rate to both in order not to have any net effect on the Irish industry or to increase prices, there would be on balance a net reduction in the effective duty being levied on imports of tobacco products from other EEC states.  I do not regard this as being a substantial effect.</P>
    <P>In reply to Deputy O'Leary's query about whether the switchover in the arrangements for products other than cigarettes was for the convenience of the Revenue Commissioners or the convenience of the industry&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;the industry prefers the changeover.  They would be happier to operate a single system and to have the same arrangements applied to all products.  The effect of this duty credit was also raised.  This is slightly more complex. I will have the Dutch situation looked at in some detail but I do not have <Col N="333" /> precise information on it at the moment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinODonoghue" hpid="Professor O'Donoghue Professor O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  At the moment the duty becomes payable during a month but, in practice, is paid by the end of the following month.  With the changeover to the new system the same time scale will operate so that the simple switch to the new system will result in a significant lengthening of credit to the manufacturer by comparison with the present system.</P>

      <P>It will put the Irish manufacturer in a stronger position to meet increased competition in home and export markets.  The catchup mechanism to which I referred applies to the month of December.  It will ensure that for the financial year as a whole there will be no substantial loss in revenue to the Exchequer, but in cash flow terms there is a running balance for the bulk of the financial year, which significantly benefits the industry. Even in December the catchup mechanism does not wipe out the advantage completely.</P>

      <P>We are thinking in terms of December, 1978, of December, 1979.  That is when the catchup mechanism will apply.  For <Col N="334" /> this year we deal with stocks of duty paid tobacco held by tobacco manufacturers on Ist January, 1978.  In order to avoid double duty payment on these stocks it is proposed that the duty charged on stocks then held be offset against the duty payments due from the manufacturers at the end of January and since the manufacturer can offset them against these payments this should not affect this financial year.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The main purpose of this Bill is to provide for the remuneration and superannuation of Ministers of State who will be appointed when the Ministers and Secretaries (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill, 1977, has been enacted. I am also availing of the opportunity afforded by the Bill to introduce a change simplifying the procedure governing the making of orders increasing the remuneration of parliamentarians and the Judiciary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Ministers and Secretaries Bill was under discussion the increased volume and complexity of the duties falling on Government Ministers was recognised in a debate which traced successive developments back to the foundation of the State and there was general agreement on the urgent need for remedial action.  Deputies are already aware from the debate in question that it is proposed to appoint <Col N="337" /> ten Ministers of State as compared with seven Parliamentary Secretaries. This should make an important contribution towards alleviating the problem of the greatly increased volume of work, but I also made it clear in the course of the debate that the level of duties envisaged for the new Ministers of State would be significantly higher than that at present being discharged by the Parliamentary Secretaries. It is envisaged that they will relieve Government Ministers of an important range of duties.  Their standing as Ministers of State should help them to operate more effectively and with greater acceptance at international meetings and in the discharge of ministerial functions.  The object of section 6 (b) of the present Bill is to obtain the necessary authority to pay salaries to up to ten Ministers of State as compared with the seven Parliamentary Secretaries covered in this respect by existing legislation.</P>
    <P>The rate of remuneration for the Ministers of State must of course reflect the increased scope and importance of the duties involved.  At present a Minister of the Government is paid a salary of £7,354 in addition to his allowance of £6,273 as a TD, giving him a total annual remuneration of £13,627.  A Parliamentary Secretary is paid a total of £9,993, made up of a salary as office holder of £3,720 and his TD's allowance of £6,273.  Within this framework and taking due account of the duties envisaged, the Government decided that total pay of £11,000 for Minister of State would be appropriate, made up of a salary of £4,727&mdash;as set out in section 6 (a) of the Bill&mdash;in addition to the allowance of £6,273 as a TD.</P>
    <P>As Members of the House are aware, the procedures involved in revising the rates of pay of parliamentarians are complicated and give rise to unnecessary duplication.  I am taking the opportunity of this Bill to make a small but, I hope, desirable change in the legislation. Existing legislation provides that when it is proposed to make an order increasing the pay of parliamentarians a draft of the order shall be laid before Dáil Éireann and, if a resolution disapproving of the draft is passed by the <Col N="338" /> Dáil within the next subsequent 21 days on which it has sat after the draft is laid before it, the order shall not be made.  If no resolution is passed the Government may make the order and again present it to Dáil Éireann.  This procedure involves laying two separate documents on the same matter before Dáil Éireann with an interval of between two and six months&mdash;if a recess intervenes&mdash;between the laying of the documents.  Apart from the unnecessary duplication, this situation can give the mistaken impression that parliamentarians are getting pay increases on the double.  It is proposed to change the procedure so as to eliminate this double submission of documents to Dáil Éireann but leaving unchanged the powers of the Dáil in relation to orders.  Sections 4 and 7 (b) of the Bill provide that orders dealing with the pay of parliamentarians will be made by the Government and presented to Dáil Éireann.  The orders will automatically come into effect after 21 sitting days unless resolutions annulling them are passed by the Dáil within that period.</P>
    <P>Sections 8 and 9 (1) of the Bill enable pensions to be paid to Ministers of State on the basis applicable to former Parliamentary Secretaries and by reference to the salary for a Minister of State.</P>
    <P>Section 6 of the Ministers and Secretaries (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill will have the effect of abolishing the Office of Parliamentary Secretary.  Section 9 (2) of the present Bill enables an hypothetical Parliamentary Secretary salary rate to be determined so as to enable the pensions payable to or in respect of former Parliamentary Secretaries to be revised, as appropriate, from time to time in conjunction with the revision of the pensions of other office holders.</P>
    <P>Over the years the legislative provisions for the revision of the remuneration of the Judiciary have been kept in line with those applicable to parliamentarians. In view of this it is proposed, in section 11, to amend the legislative procedures in relation to the making of orders increasing judicial remuneration in exactly the same way as is proposed for parliamentarians in sections 4 and 7 (b).</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="339" /> Essentially the Bill is complementary to the measure for the appointment of new Ministers of State which has already been passed by the House.  I recommend it to Dáil Éireann for speedy and favourable consideration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>We have dealt with the proposal to appoint new Ministers of State under the Ministers and Secretaries Bill which passed this House about a fortnight ago.  We are now dealing with the remuneration of these Ministers of State.  I suppose politicians anywhere in the world are as sensitive as we are of the rate at which they are paid.  There is a feeling shared by some politicians, and certainly by the general public who have the impression that this is not really a job for which somebody should be paid, that it is on the level of a vocation or calling which does not necessitate remuneration at the same rate as comparable jobs outside this building.  Of course, Ministers, TDs and Senators have families, obligations, hopes for the future, and they have no assurance of continuance in office.  Anybody coming in here, say, in his mid-twenties cannot look forward to being here until he is 65.  He might lose his seat after a few years. The situation is totally unsatisfactory in regard to the method of determining the salaries of Ministers and TDs. From my observations both as a Minister and as an ordinary TD I would suggest that Members of this House would do well to join a trade union in order that they would be represented properly and that their rates of pay would be negotiated properly.  Of course it is necessary that there be public accountability, that the public be aware of our salary structure but there must be some way of arranging our pay fairly without putting us through the embarrassment of appearing to arrange our own rates of pay. I am glad to note that the Minister has made a sensible amendment to the existing method.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not pretending to have a solution to the problem of our having to debate our rates of pay at regular intervals but would it not be better to have a system whereby the rates of pay would be determined by the <Col N="340" /> Leaders of the three parties or, perhaps, by a number of members from each of the parties in both Houses as well as a representative of the independents?</P>
    <P>It is not possible to live wildly on a salary of £6,273.  The rural Deputy, in particular, clocks up a very high mileage in his car.  All of us must attend many functions and must be seen to be generous to the various calls made on us.  In addition politicians have the ordinary expenses that other people have.  Apart from the money factor there are great rewards for being in politics.  There is, for instance, a sense of contributing in some way to the building of the State, regardless of which side of the House one is on. There is, too, a great sense of fulfilment in being a politician but I do not think these rewards should be regarded as being sufficient reason for depriving some Members of the House of a proper standard of living.  I am endeavouring to choose words carefully while suffering from the embarrassment of having to talk of these matters.</P>
    <P>The argument is put forward from time to time that most TDs have occupations other than their political careers.  That is true in many cases.  It is true of myself but there are perhaps 25 per cent or more of the Members who depend entirely on their salaries as TDs.  In the last Seanad there was an unusually high number of Senators who were endeavouring to live solely on their Seanad salaries.  They were full-time politicians.  No doubt many Members of the present Seanad are in the same position.</P>
    <P>We must find a balance between overpaying parliamentarians and paying them inadequately especially having regard to the debate going on regarding the levels of pay that will apply to those Members who will be elected to the European Parliament. Nobody is suggesting that we should be paid a salary that is anywhere near that paid to German parliamentarians, for instance, but at the same time it is in the interest of the public that there be as many full-time politicians as possible, people who have a sense of duty in regard to contributing to the building of the nation but who will not <Col N="341" /> be deterred from coming forward by reason of fear of the financial consequences that might result to themselves and their families.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will discuss with the Cabinet the possibility of some outside body being asked to assess proper rates of remuneration for TDs and Ministers.  Whatever would be agreed would have to be made an order of this House so that there would be an opportunity of debating it here.  Such a system would relieve us of the embarrassment of appearing to give ourselves extra money.  If we could find a basis on which all Members of the House could be paid, the salary structure could then be tied into a national wage agreement or some such formula.</P>
    <P>It is proposed to pay the new Ministers of State a gross salary of £11,000 a year.  That includes their salaries as ordinary Members of the House.  The Minister assures us that these people will be undertaking extra duties.  We have not been told though to which areas the three extra people will be allocated.  I am assuming that the seven Parliamentary Secretaries will remain in their present positions although that is not necessarily so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Regarding the other three, I suggest to the Taoiseach that one of them be made responsible solely for all matters appertaining to the EEC.  The work in this regard has become very complex.  It occupies the time of a number of Ministers but we need one expert who can oversee the whole field and ensure that what is happening in one Department is not infringing on or overlapping something in another Department.  That is why I am suggesting that one of the new Ministers of State be appointed a &ldquo;Mr. Europe&rdquo; who would be in a position to oversee the inputs from various Departments in EEC terms. This situation would make for the smooth running not only of the Departments but of the Government as a whole.  I agree with the Bill.  Obviously, extra remuneration should be made in respect of extra duties.  A Parliamentary Secretary up to now <Col N="342" /> has been in a kind of limbo, somewhere between being a backbench TD but not quite a Minister and who was presumed not to be occupied for five days a week although he was frequently occupied seven days a week.  I agree with the salary suggested for the new Ministers of State.</P>

      <P>The Minister said that he will be availing of the passage of this measure to ensure a simpler formula in future for the payment of salaries to Members of the Oireachtas.  I support what Deputy P. Barry said, namely, that in this House we should try to arrange a salary structure for Members so that they need not depend on other occupations or second incomes to maintain a standard of living while serving in the House.  I support the Bill.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputies for their approach to this Bill.  It is clear that it has the support of all sides of the House.  There are, perhaps, one or two points which I should mention arising out of some of the points made by Deputies P. Barry and M. O'Leary. First of all, I cannot dispute Deputy Barry's contention that there is a great deal of embarrassment felt in this House when it comes to the question of discussing the remuneration of Deputies, Ministers, Parliamentary Secretaries and, now, Ministers of State. That is a fact; I cannot deny it.  As far as I am concerned, however, I do not feel in the least embarrassed.  Having regard to the volume and level of work I perform I feel I am not overpaid and I am not ashamed to say that.  I know everybody does not take that view.  The nature of the embarrassment that arises here is because, as was pointed out, in effect, the House has to decide the remuneration&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what I meant. I felt I was underpaid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="343" />
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I would point out&mdash; because it may have slipped Deputies' memories&mdash;that there was an independent review of the remuneration of Deputies, Senators and office-holders in 1972, conducted by the Devlin Group.  One of the findings of that group which was of interest was that on average a Deputy spent 72 hours a week performing his duties as a TD. We know&mdash;but perhaps many members of the public do not&mdash;that the amount of time spent on parliamentary duties is a relatively small proportion only of the time spent by a Deputy on his duties as a TD.  The fact is that there was an independent assessment and certain recommendations were made which were referred to the Employer-Labour Conference.  Unfortunately&mdash;I do not want to go back over this or the reasons for it&mdash;the recommendations of the Employer-Labour Conference were not fully accepted by the previous Government who received the report just after they went into office, or just before they came into office; anyway it was one of the first matters with which they had to deal.  Had they been in office longer perhaps they might have dealt with it differently.  But the full amounts recommended by the Employer-Labour Conference were not implemented.</P>
      <P>Since then what has happened is that national pay agreement awards have been applied to the remuneration of Deputies and Senators.  But it might also be no harm to point out that national pay agreement awards have not been applied to the remuneration of office-holders as such, that is, Ministers, Parliamentary Secretaries, the Ceann Comhairle, Leas-Cheann Comhairle of the Dáil and Cathaoirleach and Leas-Chathaoirleach of the Seanad.  Since December, 1975, the national pay agreements have not been applied to their remuneration, only to that portion of it that they receive as a Deputy or Senator.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the point raised by Deputy P. Barry about the appointment of a Minister of State as a &ldquo;Mr. Europe&rdquo;, this is a matter which is being considered.  At this stage I am not in a position to indicate the allocation of duty that will occur as between the Ministers of State.  Leaving aside <Col N="344" /> the increased level of duties that will be involved it is possible there may be a re-allocation as between different Departments, as compared with the present arrangement of Parliamentary Secretaries; that is certainly conceivable. The role of Ministers of State in relation to Europe will certainly be increased.  Indeed, that is one of the reasons for making the change, as I explained in an earlier Bill.</P>
    <P>The whole question of the co-ordination of the Government's approach to the problems arising within the EEC is a very important one.  Deputy P. Barry touched on it.  I want merely to say that we are very concerned about this and are devising machinery to ensure that the Government can have an overall view on this.  As Deputies P. Barry and M. O'Leary will be well aware from their own experience in government, there is a grave danger that each Department will be concerned with the matters that concern it and will be deciding priorities within Departmental terms whereas the national interest would require a co-ordination of the various items arising concerning different Departments and a decision taken on the priorities in that regard.  We are very concerned about this.  We are at present devising machinery which we hope will be much more effective in enabling the Government to make decisions on national priorities, as distinct from Ministerial or Departmental ones.</P>
    <P>If one thinks about it it will be clear that the necessity for such machinery would be satisfied merely by the appointment of a Minister of State as &ldquo;Mr. Europe&rdquo;.  It would not be possible for any Minister of State, or indeed any Minister of the Government, to make the necessary decisions on priorities.  It is a matter that would have to be decided by the Government. Perhaps, in many cases, it could be done by a Cabinet Sub-Committee but, in certain cases, it would have to go to the whole Government.  Having said that, I am not ruling out the possibility of an approach something on the lines suggested by Deputy P. Barry in regard to one Minister of State. That is one possibility that is being examined.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="345" /> I do not think there was any other point raised with which I need to deal and I thank Deputies for their approach to the Bill.</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a second Time&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The need for this Bill arises from the adoption by the Council of Ministers of the European Communities of a Sixth Directive on the harmonisation of the laws of the member states relating to value-added tax.</P>
      <P>The first two directives in this fiscal area, which were adopted in 1967, fixed the basic principles and main features of member countries' systems of value-added tax&mdash;or VAT as it is generally called in this country.  Those First and Second Directives on VAT applied to Ireland as from 1st January, 1974.  The Third, Fourth and Fifth Directives were merely of ephemeral significance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Sixth Directive was adopted in May of this year, after nearly four years of detailed discussions between member states&mdash;first at the level of a working party of fiscal experts, subsequently at the Committee of Permanent Representatives of member states and, finally, outstanding points of difference were resolved at meetings of the Council of Ministers.  The new directive advances considerably the process <Col N="346" /> of harmonisation of the VAT systems of the nine countries.  While it restricts the exemptions allowable it does not attempt to harmonise the rates of value-added tax applied in the various countries.  Harmonisation of rates remains of course a long-term objective of the Community which looks forward to the eventual abolition of tax frontiers between the states.</P>
    <P>A more immediate Community objective is to complete the &ldquo;own resources&rdquo; arrangements for financing the budget of the Communities.  This aim will be achieved when member states implement the Sixth Directive and adopt financial regulations about the mechanism of collecting own resources.  The decision to replace member states' financial contributions by an &ldquo;own resources&rdquo; system was taken by the then Community of the Six in 1970 and was accepted by the three countries which subsequently acceded.  Two of the three constituent parts of &ldquo;own resources&rdquo; have already been flowing to the Communities&mdash;subject, in the case of the three new members, to certain ceilings agreed at accession; these two are the agricultural levies and the common customs duties on imports from countries outside the EEC.  The third part will derive from the common VAT base of assessment now to be established and will be equal to the produce of a rate not exceeding 1 per cent applied to that base.  There is, of course, no question of member states having to levy two VAT taxes&mdash;EEC and national&mdash;as distinct entities from VAT &ldquo;own resources&rdquo; purposes.  The position is that member states will continue to apply their own VAT rates and out of the revenue from those VAT rates will pay over to the Communities the required sum in respect of VAT &ldquo;own resources&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned the implications of VAT for the completion of &ldquo;own resources&rdquo; arrangements for financing the budget of the Communities.  That budget has, of course, a central importance for the future development of the Communities.  The establishment of an autonomous revenue should help the Communities's efforts to be directed more effectively.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="347" /> I should now like to mention a few points in relation to the provisions of the Sixth Directive.  The directive prescribes common rules as regards the various matters which could affect the amount of own resources.  Examples are the definition of taxable transactions; the taxable amount; the place of taxable transactions; certain deductions from liabilities; exempted transactions; special arrangements for farming.  As will be appreciated, several of the provisions are obviously the result of compromises.</P>
    <P>Certain specific derogations are allowed by the directive subject to review; these are designed to meet particular difficulties for some or other of the member states by allowing time for them to align with the full requirements of the harmonised base of assessment. For example, those zero ratings which were in existence in member states on 31st December, 1975, and which fulfil specified conditions can be retained until fiscal frontiers are abolished within the Community but will be subject to review every five years up to that time.</P>
    <P>For other derogations a transitional period is to last initially for five years. Among the activities in the latter category, which qualify for continued temporary exemption, are telecommunications services supplied by the public postal services; the services of solicitors, barristers, accountants and actuaries; the services of travel agents; the services supplied by undertakers; the supply of greyhounds and horses; domestic passenger transport; and admission charges to sporting events.</P>
    <P>Unanimous Council decisions will be required before any of the derogations referred to can be abolished.  However, I should mention that member states availing of these continued exemptions will have to provide financial compensation to the Communities's budget equivalent to the loss of VAT &ldquo;own resources&rdquo; resulting from this non-taxation.</P>
    <P>I might also mention that the directive makes provision for the establishment of a VAT Advisory Committee on which the member states will be represented, the chairman to be a <Col N="348" /> representative of the EEC Commission. The Committee are to examine questions arising from time to time in regard to the application of the Community provisions on value-added tax.</P>
    <P>I now turn to the implications for the Irish VAT system of the provisions contained in the Sixth Directive.  Some services which are at present exempt from Irish VAT must be made liable to the tax.  Those businesses which render these services will have to register for VAT, where their turnover exceeds £300 in a two-month VAT accounting period, and, in those circumstances, will be liable for the tax at the appropriate rate&mdash;which is ten per cent&mdash;in respect of their charges to the public.  The main services affected are: the services of auctioneers and house agents; non-academic teaching&mdash;for example in driving schools; the valuation services of chartered surveyors; certain agency services but excluding agency transactions in relation to banking, insurance and finance which will continue to be exempt; admission to agricultural, commercial and industrial shows, fairs and exhibitions as well as to zoological gardens; and the natural or artificial insemination of livestock.  The traders providing those services will be entitled to claim from the Revenue credit for input VAT&mdash;borne on their purchases &mdash;which at present they have to bear without recovery from the Revenue. They can also charge VAT to their customers who, if VAT-registered, may claim credit from the Revenue for such input VAT.</P>
    <P>As regards the ending of certain exemptions, these result effectively from the fact that the directive affords authority only for a limited number of specified exemptions, temporary or permanent.  In order to come into line with the directive we have therefore to terminate those I have mentioned. There can be no question, at this stage, of our picking out exemptions which we might desire for one reason or another.  We are constrained by the directive as are our eight fellow-member states.  As I mentioned earlier the directive results effectively from many compromises.</P>
    <P>There should be no significant <Col N="349" /> difficulties or hardship.  Reference has been made in the media to the position of cattle marts.  Their position under VAT will not differ from that of the 50,000 or so other VAT-registered traders of widely-varying turnovers. All such registered traders must keep full records of their business transactions which affect their VAT liability. The requirements are those which have been deemed necessary for VAT purposes since 1972.  There can of course be no question of abridging VAT records requirements for those now coming into the system of the tax.</P>
    <P>Still less could there be any question of devising a special VAT code in order to avoid any embarrassment for would-be evaders of any tax&mdash;whether VAT, income tax or other taxes.  As Deputies will be aware the income tax code provides separately for Revenue powers of examination of records.</P>
    <P>As regards the effect of the application of the tax to marts' fees, the size of the effect can be gauged from the facts that the rate of tax applicable will be 10 per cent and this will be levied on fees representing 1 per cent or 2 per cent of the value of the through-put at marts.  Thus on £10,000 worth of stock sold at a mart the amount of VAT arising in respect of the auction fees would be of the order of £10 to £20.</P>
    <P>A list of the categories of services which will qualify for exemption in future, and which does not of course include those I have mentioned, will be found in section 19 of the Bill. Another activity which will become liable to VAT under the Bill is the provision of services by agricultural contractors.  This change results from a revised definition of &ldquo;farmer&rdquo; which is in section 6.</P>
    <P>Farmers, as now defined, will of course retain the right to opt out of the VAT system, that is to refrain from registering for the tax and they may also render agricultural services which are incidental to their activity of farming without incurring an obligation to register for VAT.  Another change required in order to conform to the basis of assessment prescribed by the directive is the replacement of the two-tier VAT which applies to <Col N="350" /> certain goods under our existing arrangements.</P>
    <P>Two-tier VAT rates apply to cars and motorcycles, television sets, radio sets, gramophones and records and some other goods.  The arrangement can best be described by an example. In the case of television sets, for example, a rate of 40 per cent VAT is levied on a sale by a manufacturer to a wholesaler.  The latter when he subsequently sells the set becomes liable for VAT at 10 per cent of the price charged by him to his customer; normally he would be entitled to set-off against that liability on his sales the full amount of input VAT borne by him on his trade purchases; however through a special restriction applying to these two-tier goods he is allowed credit for input VAT at 10 per cent only.  This has the result that VAT at 30 per cent of the manufacturer's price is effectively &ldquo;trapped&rdquo; in the price of goods.  The system is therefore commonly referred to as &ldquo;two-tier VAT&rdquo;. The first tier is the element of tax which is trapped, on a sale by a manufacturer to a non-manufacturer; this tier is 25 per cent for cars and motorcycles and 30 per cent for the other goods.  The second tier, for all the goods, is 10 per cent and this is levied at all subsequent stages of distribution. Both tiers are ultimately borne by the consumer.</P>
    <P>Under the directive a single VAT rate must apply at all stages of distribution of goods, and, in general, traders must have the right to deduct input VAT in full.  The VAT rate which it is proposed to apply in future to the cars, televisions and the other goods referred to is the 10 per cent rate&mdash;which of course applies already to a wide range of goods.</P>
    <P>I might perhaps mention that some existing restrictions on deductibility by traders of input VAT borne by them will continue as heretofore.  They are applied for anti-evasion purposes and are allowable under the directive. Examples are the non-deductibility of input VAT borne in respect of cars and petrol where these are not stock-in-trade.</P>
    <P>It will be apparent that a reduction in VAT revenue will be caused by the <Col N="351" /> abolition of the first-tier of the special two-tier VAT arrangement.  The revenue thus forgone is to be made good by appropriate excise duties in relation to the goods now in question; the excise changes will be designed to match the incidence of the existing first-tier of VAT on these goods.  Provision of the Bill relating to the replacement of the two-tier VAT are contained in sections 9, 1 and 24.</P>
    <P>I now turn to the position of public authorities in relation to the VAT system.  At present, Irish law provides a general exemption for services provided by the State or a local authority. The construction, repair and maintenance of roads, harbours and sewerage works by public authorities are zero-rated activities so that local authorities can recover VAT borne on their purchases of inputs for these services.</P>
    <P>The Sixth Directive provides that public authorities are not to be considered as taxable persons when they perform services of a governmental nature, except where exclusion from taxability would lead to distortion of competition.  In any case, they are to be considered taxable in relation to a number of specified services listed in the directive, subject, however, to some transitional derogations.</P>
    <P>The overall effect is that very few services currently provided by the State or by local authorities would fall to be taxed.  Accordingly, it is proposed to exclude these bodies from accountability for tax, except in those cases where the Minister for Finance, after appropriate consultations, by order otherwise provides.  It is the intention that such orders would be made only where demonstrable competitive distortions would otherwise arise.  Section 6 provides for the making of such orders.</P>
    <P>Ae regards the present Irish zero-rating of the construction, repair, maintenance, and so on of roads, harbours and sewerage works provided by the State, local authorities or harbour authorities, the retention of these provisions would be incompatible with the directive.  Accordingly, the Bill proposes to end these zero-ratings. The result would be to impose <Col N="352" /> some extra costs, due to VAT, on local authorities' road and sewerage works with a corresponding benefit to the Exchequer.  There would be little or no effect on the outlay of harbour authorities because most of their turnover is zero-rated and will continue to be so.  The question whether any compensatory adjustment should be made as between the Exchequer and local authority finances will be considered as a separate issue.</P>
    <P>Under section 11 of the Bill provision can be made in regulations for remissions or refunds of VAT in certain circumstances.  For example, while in the ordinary way the zero-rate for exports may be claimed only where the goods involved have been exported by the seller, cases may arise which do not meet these requirements but in which it would be desirable to remit VAT.  Accordingly, the section provides for regulations to be made to allow remission or repayment, subject to conditions to be specified, in cases where the Revenue Commissioners are satisfied that the goods have been exported or are to be exported.</P>
    <P>The Bill also restates, in conformity with terms used in the directive, the existing Irish provisions relating to VAT rates.  This is done in section 9.  That section also brings together existing provisions for reliefs in relation to certain cases of mixed goods.  In general when different goods are sold as one package, the VAT rates for the package is the highest rate applicable to any of the constituent parts.  This is necessary to counter evasion.  However, there are reliefs from this rule for certain cases.</P>
    <P>The various other provisions of the Bill, which are mostly of a technical nature not involving any significant change, are indicated in the explanatory memorandum circulated with the Bill.</P>
    <P>As regards commencement, section 26 provides that the Bill when enacted shall come into operation on such day as the Minister may by order appoint. It is the intention to specify a date which shall be the first day of a two-month VAT accounting period.  The <Col N="353" /> House will appreciate that businesses affected by the Bill will have certain preparations to make for complying with the requirements for VAT; it is of course desirable that they should have adequate time to familiarise themselves with any changes which will affect them and have preparations put in hand.</P>
    <P>The Sixth Directive as adopted prescribes 1st January, 1978, as the latest date for its implementation by member states; however the practical position as it is developing is that few of the member states may be implementing the directive promptly at the start of 1978.</P>
    <P>In all the circumstances I think it is necessary to keep the matter under review for the present.  Our starting date cannot be earlier than 1st March, 1978, therefore, and may be later; adequate notice will be given to enable traders affected to finalise any preparations necessary in their circumstances.</P>
    <P>I think that is all I need say now about the provisions of the Bill which I commend to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>This is another Bill similar to the one we had earlier this morning necessitated by the Sixth Directive.  It is a very difficult, complex Bill and, as far as I can judge, is bringing within the scope of VAT a huge range of people who were previously not eligible at all&mdash;auctioneers, house agents, driving school instructors, presumably dance school instructors, a lot of people who have no conception at the moment that they will be liable to and registered for the payment of VAT, possibly from the 1st March, 1978.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understood that directives of this nature were, first of all, discussed in the Committee on Secondary Legislation. As far as I know this has not been discussed there.  I presume it was because the Committee have not met for the last six months.  A Bill like this, which affects such a large section of the community, should be discussed there and should come in here after they have had a chance to chew it over.  They had done that in relation to the earlier Bill.  After discussing the Tobacco Bill with members of that <Col N="354" /> Committee I was able to get a much better idea exactly what it was about and I had a greater appreciation of the work they are doing in that Committee.</P>
    <P>This Bill should have gone to that Committee.  Before the Minister contemplated bringing it here, it should have been in that Committee for a considerable length of time.  It is a lengthy Bill and parts of it are very technical. A lot of people will be affected by it. It was introduced first here a fortnight ago and then the Minister indicated he wanted to take it the following Thursday.  It is unreasonable to the Minister and it is certainly unreasonable to the House to expect the House to deal with that type of legislation in that short period of time.  It gives no chance to people affected by the legislation to make the normal representations to Members of the Opposition about points they wished to have brought up here.</P>

      <P>There is a different wording in section 8 and another section. It is more clear in the explanatory memorandum which states:</P>
      <P>Section 8 contains provisions in relation to the amount on which VAT is chargeable.  Some of them re-enact the existing provisions.</P>
      <P>The explanatory memorandum states in relation to section 16:</P>
      <P>Under the Directive VAT registered traders must in future record details of importations in their regular VAT returns...</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="355" /> Is the inclusion of goods exchanged for trading stamps something which the Government are doing themselves or does it come under the directive? This, in my estimation, will at least double the amount of VAT available to the Government from this one activity alone.  The original position was that VAT was charged at the cost price to the trading company but now it will be charged at the value represented by the stamps for which the goods are exchanged.  There could be 100 per cent difference between those two charges.</P>
    <P>With the new people being brought in and the changes envisaged, vastly increased sums of money will go to Revenue under VAT.  There is no indication from the Minister exactly the amount of money involved and how much it is proposed to collect, except in the case of the marts.  The Minister said in his speech:</P>
    <P>Thus on £10,000 worth of stock sold at a mart the amount of VAT arising in respect of the auction fees would be of the order of £10 to £20.</P>
    <P>Marts are held on five days a week in different parts of the country.  The turnover of each individual mart is considerably greater than the amount stated by the Minister.  I estimate that from this item alone approximately £500,000 will go into the Exchequer. I calculate that under section 8 double the amount of the tax previously collected on goods in exchange for trading stamps will go to the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>The inclusion under another section of a new category of people such as auctioneers, estate agents, hirers of cars, driving school instructors and many other people will mean that vast sums of money will go to the Exchequer. I cannot assess the amount here because I do not know how much money they will all collect.  The smallest trade is still being caught at £300 in a two-month period.  Small traders with a turnover of £1,800 a year are being brought in and made register for tax.  I am surprised that the Minister did not take this opportunity to increase the very low rate for registration of tax.  He will probably say <Col N="356" /> with the budget early in the New Year that it is inappropriate to make changes in the rate at the moment.</P>
    <P>The Minister is writing into another Bill the same rates which applied since 1972.  Those rates should now be adjusted upwards because the £1,800 of 1972 is probably worth about £900 now or maybe less.  I will be putting down amendments on the Committee Stage to raise these significantly.</P>
    <P>By the way, what is the turnover for travel agents?  I know a little about them and a travel agent could be at the back of a food store and, because food is not liable to VAT, and the travel agency turns in £1,000 a year, does that mean that, because the rest of the turnover is made up of groceries and so on, he will have to register and pay VAT on the £1,000 a year or would it be just £1,800 a year on the turnover in the travel agency?  There are many anomalies like that.</P>
    <P>House agents are another category. The big agencies in the cities have an enormous turnover.  They also have very big staffs with all the essential secretarial and accountancy backup and they can easily assess for how much the customer is liable.  If VAT is at 10 per cent and a three bedroomed semi-detached house changes hands here in Dublin the customer must be charged 10 per cent of the 5 per cent and 5 per cent of £15,000 is £750 and that means an extra £75 in VAT.  With something in the region of 16,000 or 17,000 houses coming on the market every year will each one be liable for an extra £75, which will be a considerable sum of money, or is it only those going through estate agents which will be liable?  The vast majority go through estate agents.  In rural areas it is as often as not a once-off sale. Each one of these will be liable for VAT because the auctioneer will pass it on to a customer.  VAT is consumer based.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned local authorities and certain local authority works which will not be liable for VAT.  As far as I can judge, the Minister could zero rate all local authority works under the directive, except possibly houses built by direct labour. They may be subject to VAT.  Now <Col N="357" /> the very works mentioned by the Minister will now be subject to VAT.  His colleague, the Minister for the Environment, has told local authorities they may not raise their rates above a certain amount and the Exchequer will recoup only 11 per cent of the expenditure.  Where will the difference come from?  The Minister should explain exactly how local authorities will pay VAT on certain of their undertakings if the Exchequer will not recoup them.</P>
    <P>I referred earlier to trading stamps. These are given to customers as a proportion of the amount of money the customer spends.  Ultimately the customer goes to the company and changes the stamps at a rate previously designated.  Up to now VAT was charged on what the trading stamp company paid for the goods.  It will now be charged on the value of the stamps, as represented by the amount of goods, as a percentage of the proportion of the amount of money spent by the customer in order to collect these goods.  That will be a difference of 100 per cent.  Within the last 48 hours the GAA announced the launching of a trading stamp venture to pay for a pitch in Cork and, hopefully, if the venture is a success, it will be extended to other things.  What will be the effect of this legislation?  Will this be treated as a sporting fixture? According to the section, sports fixtures will be exempt.  In this new venture the stamps will be exchanged for money.  No goods will be involved. If trading stamp companies will now have to pay VAT will 10 per cent be charged on this GAA venture?  If it is it will upset all their plans and ruin their chances of paying for their pitches.</P>
    <P>VAT will now be charged on entrance to fairs and exhibitions but not on entrance to sporting events. Does that mean the Dublin Spring Show will be charged VAT but the Horse Show will not?  These points have probably occurred to those responsible for drafting this legislation and I am sure the Minister will be able to deal with them.  As I said, many thousands will be affected by this legislation and it needs to be very carefully considered.  People will be <Col N="358" /> brought in who have no idea today, 30th November, that from 1st March next they will be liable to VAT and their activities likewise.  This should all have been discussed with the different trade associations, who probably have no realisation that their members will be liable.  It should all have been discussed in the Committee on EEC Secondary Legislation.  It will certainly have to be thrashed out here.  I doubt if there will be time to do that before the Adjournment.  Perhaps the Minister might arrange a special sitting.</P>
    <P>Each section will have to be examined very carefully to ensure that those affected will not be severely damaged.  I will be proposing amendments to raise the levels of the taxes. I should like to get an assurance from the Minister that the new-stamp-trading scheme to be operated by the GAA will not be affected by this and that their sums will not be put out of kilter by this legislation thereby ruining chances of paying off their grounds in various parts of the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has indicated to the House that he accepts that the changes envisaged in this measure may come as a shock to those services which for the first time will be obliged to pay VAT.  The list given is not exclusive and services indicated by the Minister include auctioneers and house agents and valuation services of chartered surveyors.  The exemptions given in Directive 6, which this Bill is based on, suggest that one may have exemption for tuition given privately by teachers and covering school or university education.  Another exemption suggested is in relation to certain services closely linked to sport or physical education supplied by non-profit making organisations to persons taking part in sport or physical education. Since the effects of this measure are far-reaching and since it is suggested that March, 1978, may not be the final date for implementation of it in the other new Community countries I enjoin the Minister&mdash;he indicated his agreement to this to the House&mdash;to accept that this is a case where we should hasten slowly.  If our membership forces extension of VAT to businesses not already covered by <Col N="359" /> such purposes, then a necessary preliminary, I suggest, is that discussions be held with groups who might be affected to ensure that there is full understanding of their obligations under the measure.  Such discussions would also permit the Minister to fully avail of the allowances under the directive.  There is machinery under that directive, in Article 27, allowing a member state to introduce special measures for derogation from the provisions of the directive.  Admittedly, the derogation can only take place in order to simplify the procedure for charging the tax or to prevent certain types of tax evasion or avoidance but there is the possibility there of derogation from the provisions of this directive.</P>
      <P>The provision of a committee to examine all the difficulties arising from the introduction of this tax in member states not already having it suggests to me that the March, 1978, date will not be the final one for implementation of the tax in certain member states affected.  The Minister suggested that even though the directive prescribes 1st January, 1978, as the latest date for its implementation by member states, the practical position as it is developing is that few of the member states may be implementing it promptly at the start of 1978.  I do not think the implementation date will be 1st March, 1978.  It may, in fact, be considerably later and, therefore, I suggest that we should hasten slowly and that there should be full consultation with all interests concerned so that the full implications of this measure can be teased out and understood and that the exemptions listed can be gained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This &ldquo;own resources&rdquo; discussion has been going on for some time at Community level.  This matter has been discussed frequently since the sixties, especially with the original members of the Community, and it has always been linked with an increase in the budgetary powers of the European Parliament. In other words, the element of accountability as we have it in this Parliament would seem to be a necessary consequence of the provision of own resources for the Community in <Col N="360" /> its own operations.  In general, the State has gone along in supporting the movement of own resources in the Community.  We have gone along with the principle, since we accepted the obligations of membership of the Community, that the replacement of separate financial contributions from member states by a system of own resources necessitates a redistribution of budgetary powers between the institutions and necessitates, in particular, the strengthening of the powers of the European Parliament.  The sad fact is that although we are now taking another step on the way to the provision of own resources for the Community, the European Parliament has no real authority over the disposal of the increased budget being given to the Community. It is true that the Parliament has some slight powers over the operation of that part of the Community budget dealing with the operations of the Community but it is a very slight power and there is a good deal of ambiguity surrounding the exercise of that power.</P>
    <P>We are now taking a step from the system of contributions by member states from national taxation in which we enjoy sole competence to a system in which contributions, known as Community resources, which member states will levy will be paid over to the Community without any control by the national parliaments.  While one might accept this movement away from control by the national parliaments over such sums, the fact is that we are doing it in a situation where the European Parliament lacks any real power in the matter of decision or the European budget.  We are obliging this Parliament to grant to the Community undefined instruments of fiscal sovereignty which will escape any form of control at Community level.  We give the 1 per cent VAT and it joins the agricultural levies and the customs tariffs but over these sums the Community has very little control.  I am talking about the Community in a democratic sense, at parliamentary level. Therefore, we are giving powers to a structure which is at present antidemocratic at Community level, a structure which is dominated by the</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="361" /> Council of Ministers which is, in effect, an executive board and which is under no obligation to conduct its proceedings in public and escapes any form of direct control.  It exercises a full range of legislative powers at Council of Ministers level and will, in future, as this trend of own resources is strengthened, have at its disposal its own resources enabling it to by-pass the control which national parliaments have so far been able to exercise, if only indirectly.  So far national parliaments have been able to exercise some control over resources going to the Community because at least they have the power and the right to discuss the national contribution to the Community.</P>
    <P>The discussion on own resources at Community level has always linked the development of own resources strategy with greater control by the European Parliament, ensuring that there is some accountable institution.  It has always been held that if direct elections to the European Parliament developed, budgetary powers should accompany that development.  Here we are taking the step on the own resources role of the Community in a situation in which the Community institutions have become increasingly authoritarian.</P>
    <P>The Commission, who, by virtue of the Treaty, should act independently of member states and have a duty to initiate, have now reached a stage at which more often than not they simply enter into preliminary negotiations with governments, so that instead of there being an independent expression of opinion at Community level the views given are increasingly coloured by the atmosphere and balance of forces within the Council of Ministers.  Since the development of meetings of prime ministers at European Council level, it increasingly means for a small country that decisions are taken by the small club of the larger states within the Community.  This is a grave consequence of this development.  In present circumstances the Commission have tended to become mediators and assume more and more the characteristics of a secretariat rather than the body originally envisaged in the Treaty.  The Council of Ministers is the dominant body and the most dominant <Col N="362" /> members are the representatives of the larger states.  Increasingly decisions are being taken by the even more exclusive club of prime ministers and the representatives of the smaller countries like Belgium, Denmark and ourselves must follow the decisions taken at that level.</P>
    <P>We have a Parliament which has some control but only over the administrative expenditure and that represents only about 4 per cent of the budget of the whole Community.  This is an unsatisfactory state of affairs, though I do not know if the Minister for Finance would agree that it is so.  I mention the matter because all the debate at Community level on the own resources strategy has linked it with democratic control by the European Parliament.  Those powers of control are still absent.  It is not the fault of this Parliament.  We are marking today a significant point on the road to the provision of autonomous budgetary resources to the Community, when the European Parliament lacks any real power.  When he was Chancellor, Mr. Brandt explained that the Community's resources are in themselves a component of a federal order.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barry referred to the implications of this for taxpayers at home. New categories of businesses may be taken in and may find themselves under an obligation for levying purposes under this tax.  That is one consequence. Another consequence is that we are handing over to the Community moneys that they can, by virtue of this measure, levy directly in our territory. Yet the Community lacks an institution which can exercise any democratic control over the spending of the budget given to the Community.  We are preparing for direct elections to the European Parliament when there is no evidence that the Parliament has any real control over the disposal of resources now given to the Community, an undemocratic Community whose institutions, apparently, are not answerable to anybody.  That is the significance at Community level.</P>
    <P>The significance at home, on which more interest will be focused, is for the new categories of people who may be covered under the new tax measures. I would suggest to the Minister <Col N="363" /> that it is one measure on which there should not be undue hurry.  It is possible that this measure will not be implemented in the first six months of next year and we should allow before the next stage of this Bill full discussions with all the interests involved, so that we may seek derogation for certain businesses where there is such a possibility.  Under Article 26 of the directive, there is provision for a possible exemption for travel agents.  It is admittedly a very confined possibility of exemption.  It is provided that the article shall not apply to travel agents who are acting only as intermediaries. I know that the matter has been discussed here by the Dáil Committee on Secondary Legislation, but the implications of this measure would come as a surprise and shock to many categories who up to now have not been covered.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be very brief indeed.  This is the type of legislation on which I have commented in this House on many occasions.  It is sent by the EEC and it seems that the Minister has no option but to bring our tax measures into line with those of the other countries within the Community. I believe that the provisions of these directives should be debated in this Parliament before the directives become law in Europe.  During the last four years I have frequently commented on the irrelevance of this Parliament concerning EEC directives. The Minister is simply putting forward a document which has already been sanctioned by the EEC and which must be passed by this Parliament if we are to remain members of the Community.  There is little we can do about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am particularly worried about how this legislation will affect people who are not already within the VAT tax net.  There are very few people here who know much about farming.  We produce store cattle in the west and they are finished in the east.  We sell very few cattle to the factories because they are not finished, therefore all our cattle are sold through the marts.  There are no longer fairs.  These are hard facts at the moment.  We set up this <Col N="364" /> system ourselves in order to introduce a more modern system of selling cattle. This VAT will be passed on to the seller and will make things very difficult for the small marts.  The larger marts will be in a position to go into competition and will be able to reduce commission in order to avoid passing on VAT.</P>
    <P>I was very closely associated with the introduction of the marts system and I know that these smaller marts are struggling for existence.  We knew there was going to be a change anyway and we were not going to allow foreigners to come here and set up marts and put themselves on both sides of the counter.  We did it ourselves but many of the smaller marts are still struggling and I cannot see how they will be able to afford to pay this tax. It will be one hell of a burden of taxation for the seller of livestock, particularly the seller of store cattle.  It may be the cause of reviving private sales which would be detrimental to our livestock marts.  Many people are presently employed in our livestock marts.</P>
    <P>According to the Bill, all kinds of agricultural and educational shows are subject to VAT.  Deputy Barry said the Spring Show would be taxed and that the Horse Show would be exempted.  How will this affect the show-jumping horses?  Another point is that auctioneers will not pay VAT themselves but will pass the charge to their customers.  I understand that farm contractors will have to pay VAT.  If I have not interpreted the brief correctly I apologise to the Minister, but my understanding of it is that small contractors who are not themselves farmers will have to register for VAT.  There are many of these small contractors in the west and they will pass the charge to the small farmers for whom they mainly work.</P>
    <P>Any man who does not give his true opinion of this Bill should not be in the House.  I have no hesitation in giving my opinion because I am worried about the number of people who will be affected by this Bill.</P>
    <P>Sport has been excluded but I should like the Minister to consider the VAT situation in relation to the GAA.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="365" /> It is deplorable that member states are not given prior notice of EEC directives and sufficient time to debate them.  At present we are rubber-stamping EEC directives.  If the Council of Ministers want to change the taxation system they should give us time to discuss the matter in this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesWhile" hpid="Mr. White Mr. White">
      <NameTxt>Mr. White</NameTxt>
      <P>I have never been in favour of this type of tax.  I was against turnover tax, particularly when it was applied to food as it was when Fianna Fáil introduced it many years ago.  If there is a blessing in this Bill it must surely be that Fianna Fáil have not put VAT on food.  When we first heard of this Bill our one fear was that Fianna Fáil would resort to their earlier tactics.  At this late stage I would ask the Minister if it would be possible to set up a special committee to deal with this complicated Bill, which will affect many people.  There will be many amendments to the Bill on Committee Stage.  If people like Deputy Barry and Deputy Callanan were allowed to discuss the Bill in Committee with the Minister there would be less friction and a better consensus.</P>
      <P>This is a great opportunity for the Minister to show his flair, particularly in regard to the different rates of taxes in Northern Ireland and here.  One of the greatest difficulties in Border areas is the difference in the price of such goods as motor cars, television sets and so on.  If this Bill was introduced to harmonise price structures&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesWhile" hpid="Mr. White Mr. White">
      <NameTxt>Mr. White</NameTxt>
      <P>When we entered the EEC we believed that all taxes would eventually be the same.  Every day hundreds of people cross the Border to buy goods.  This Bill provides us with the opportunity to harmonise price structures.  In the case of petrol, there is a difference of about 10p a gallon. Barley is being smuggled right, left and centre because of the difference of about £20 a ton.  The Minister should take a much more solid stand on this instead of getting bogged down in the Department with a lot of civil servants telling him what to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="366" /> There are many anomalies.  For instance, why are day-old chicks subject to VAT while poultry and eggs are not because they are classed as food?  We hear the cattle marts are to be subject to VAT.  That is all right, but an animal put up in a mart may be sold ten times and it will be subject to VAT each time.</P>
    <P>Section 10 (2) also discloses an anomaly as far as fishing boats are concerned.  It is an improvement on the existing situation, but I do not think it goes far enough.  For instance, if a fisherman buys a boat outside the country and brings it in here, if he is not qualified for a grant or a loan from BIM, the vessel will be treated as a pleasure cruiser and it is subject to VAT.  The fisherman may be genuine but is subjected to VAT while his colleague who gets a grant from BIM gets a rebate of VAT.  That is another anomaly.</P>
    <P>I have been reading the Bill in the past few days and the more I read it the more complicated it becomes.  I suggest, therefore, that an all-party committee be established to go into the Bill and discuss it through the eyes of businessmen with the hope of coming to some common-sense consensus before we come to blows across the House on it.</P>

      <P>There seems to be some misunderstanding in regard to the procedure whereby this Bill came before us.  There is some misunderstanding on the part of Deputy Barry in regard to the factual situation, and on the part of Deputy O'Leary and, to a lesser extent, on the part of Deputy Callanan in regard to the procedures followed and available to us to deal with directive of this kind.  The Joint Oireachtas Committee on EC Secondary Legislation examined and reported on the original draft directive in 1974, and in March of this year a memorandum was sent to them by the Minister <Col N="367" /> for Finance.  At that time the directive had been practically finalised and the memorandum was sent at the request of the Committee.  So there have been consultations with representatives of this Parliament during a number of years in regard to the evolution of the directive.</P>
      <P>It is also important to understand in regard to some points made by Deputies O'Leary and Callanan that it is not a matter of a directive of this kind simply being produced by the EEC and rammed through this Parliament which has to rubber-stamp it.  In this case negotiations went on during a number of years at different levels and the final difficulties were sorted out by the Council of Ministers. Eventually, the Council of Ministers approved of it on 17th May this year.</P>
      <P>I want to make another point clear. It is that at any stage, particularly at the Council of Minister stage, it is open to each Government to make their position clear and to make a stand on certain issues if they feel it is important that that should be done. I am not to be taken as saying that on every issue that comes up when we do not like it our representatives will say &ldquo;We will not have it and that is the end of it&rdquo;.  If that were the position it would be the end of the Community. On the other hand, it would be wrong to think that these matters are forced through whether a government or parliament are willing to accept them. That is not the way it works.  I should not like people to think that the EEC simply want us to rubber-stamp such things.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been some apprehension that the operation of the Bill will result in vastly increased payments of VAT and increased revenue for the Exchequer.  That is not so.  It will be appreciated that one must take an overall view of it.  Some items will become liable to VAT which were not liable heretofore and others which have been included will be excluded.  In the case of items that will be brought in, traders can claim a greater refund from the Revenue Commissioners in respect of the VAT they have been charged.  Taking an overall view, it is <Col N="368" /> estimated that the gains in revenue to the Exchequer will be in the region of £1 million, perhaps a little more but, if it is more, not very much more.  That is in the context of a total VAT yield of £320 million.  It will be seen that the overall effect will not be a major one in relation to the existing operation of the VAT system.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barry raised a query on section 8.  Under the directive, we are obliged to make the provisions contained in section 8.  I think Deputy Barry asked if we had a choice.  We did not.  The Revenue Commissioners have discussions in progress with the trading stamp interests about the details of the application of these new arrangements to their operations.  In that connection, I should say with regard to the point put about the new trading stamp scheme being introduced by the GAA in Cork, it would appear on the face of the scheme as described by Deputy Barry&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Deputy Barry also mentioned travel agents.  This Bill will not bring travel agents into the tax net in the forseeable future.  It is true the directive envisages that travel agents will be taxed eventually after the end of the period of transition, which will be five years initially but which is almost certain to be extended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Is this using the exemption section of the directive?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand it is article 28 of the directive.  There is a derogation under which travel agents may continue to be exempt for the present.  This is likely to be continued for a very considerable time.  I should say the Irish Association for Travel Agents have been consulted and are aware of the position as it stands.</P>
      <P>A question was raised, too, about the effect of this on house prices.  It is not thought it will affect the price of houses to any notable degree certainly.  On the question of new houses, to the extent that builders avail of the services of auctioneers and estate agents in the selling of new houses, as VAT registered persons they will be entitled to recover from the Revenue any VAT arising on the auctioneers' fees.  There is no reason why they should add it on to the price of the houses.</P>
      <P>As regards second-hand houses, VAT on auctioneers' fees, which would be the 10 per cent VAT rate, would be payable by the vendor.  This would represent about one quarter of 1 per cent on the price of the house&mdash;for example, £25 on a £10,000 house where the auctioneer's fee was 2½ per cent as it is in Dublin city, Cork and Limerick. I think it is 3½ per cent outside those areas.  An additional liability of £25 on a £10,000 second-hand house is unlikely to cause the vendor to hold out for that much higher a price.  It is unlikely that there will be any effect on the price of houses as a result of the impositions contained in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the general question of derogations&mdash;and <Col N="370" /> this point was raised by Deputy O'Leary in particular&mdash;the approach adopted has been to try to have the minimum amount of change in our existing system and to avail ourselves fully of the possibilities of derogation under the directive.  That is the general approach which has been adopted.</P>
    <P>On this whole question of own resources system for the EEC there may be some substance in what Deputy O'Leary said, but I think he exaggerated one aspect and ignored another aspect.  The fact is that the adoption of the own resources system in the EEC is reducing the power of the Council of Ministers and, for that reason, the European Parliament has called repeatedly for the expedition of the own resources system.  This will be obvious if one thinks about the fact that the basis of the own resources system is that there would be an autonomous source of revenue to the EEC, autonomous of the Council of Ministers, not determined by the Council of Ministers, who would thereby be able perhaps to dictate certain aspects of policy.  It would mean that the Community, and the Commission administering the various affairs of the Community, would have revenue independently of the Council of Ministers and, to that extent, it would reduce the power of the Council of Ministers.</P>
    <P>It is also true that the European Parliament have some control over the budget.  I freely admit it is limited, but some changes which have been made fairly recently have tended to increase the power of the Parliament in this regard.  I have also noted that there appears to be a particular concern on the part not only of the Commission but also of the Council of Ministers to try to reach an understanding with the European Parliament in regard to the budget.  There are provisions which have been used for meetings between representatives of the Council and of the Parliament to try to sort out disagreements which may have arisen between them with regard to the budget.  I do not say the European Parliament have substantial control over the budget, but I do say they have some control.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="371" /> Furthermore, the lessons of history would suggest that, when the Parliament are a directly elected Assembly, they will almost certainly have an evolution of powers particularly in regard to the budget.  If that does not happen, it will be contrary to the lessons of history in democratically elected parliaments in general in various countries.  The system of own resources was laid down in 1970 and was accepted by the then member states, the Six.  Acceptance of it was a condition of our accession and that of Britain and Denmark.  As I am sure Deputies are aware, the Treaty of Accession provides for a progression towards the full own resources system by the new member states.  It is envisaged that the full own resources system will operate for all member states from 1980 onwards.  Certain limitations are laid down as to the contributions to be made by the three acceding member states over that period up to 1980. The article dealing with that limitation, article 131, has been forming the basis for the arguments which have been going on for some time between the member states in regard to the contributions to be made by them.  It is a matter that is of particular concern to us.  It is not directly applicable to the present Bill but it is very much tied in with the whole &ldquo;own resources&rdquo; system to which reference has been made.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Leary also raised the question of the implementation of the directive by other member states.  I understand that in Britatin legislation has been passed but they can bring it into operation by order whenever they think it is appropriate.  I understand that in other parliaments the necessary legislation will shortly be introduced but it seems unlikely that many of the other countries will be in a position to implement this directive in the time laid down, to operate from 1st January next.  It seems that we are all more or less in the one boat and, as I indicated in my opening remarks, I intend to keep the matter under review. We are anxious to have a system of &ldquo;own resources&rdquo; operating but we are not anxious to rush ahead of our fellow members in implementing these <Col N="372" /> provisions.  So, I propose to keep the matter under review and the provision in the Bill whereby it can be brought into operation by order would enable us to do that.</P>
    <P>Deputy White suggested that this Bill should be referred to a special committee. I have no objection in principle to that.  It is a technical Bill and contains some very highly technical sections but I should like to make it clear&mdash;in view of something he said, he may be under a misapprehension&mdash; that the Press are admitted to the hearings of special committees in this House unless there is a specific decision to the contrary.  There are certain advantages in special committees on Bills of this kind but I should like to examine that a little more closely.  The Deputy may take it that there is no objection in principle to it but whether, in relation to the parliamentary programme at the time when we will be dealing with Committee Stage, it will be feasible is another matter.  It will certainly be considered.</P>
    <P>The Deputy also raised the question of differing rates of VAT operating in the North from those operating here. It is true that this is unfortunate and in some cases there can be unfortunate consequences but it should be realised that unless there were agreed rates of VAT on various items, operated as a result of negotiation and agreement between the two Governments, we will have these consequences.  The alternative is that the Irish Government would simply follow what the British Government does.  That is an unacceptable approach and I do not think the Deputy is advocating that.  It would be unacceptable from the point of view of national sovereignty and also on practical grounds.  The economic and social reasons which dictate particular rates of VAT are different here and in Britain and to achieve the kind of situation the Deputy would like to see in effect would require not only negotiations between the Irish and British Governments and agreement on the different rates of VAT but would require the British Government to apply different rates of VAT in Northern Ireland from those applying in Britain. I have not discussed this with any <Col N="373" /> member of the British Government but I would be rather doubtful that they would agree easily to that proposition. It is not a proposition to which we would raise any objection; on the contrary, it is one that I would favour but the practicability of it is another matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not ruling it out. I agree with the proposal if it could be implemented.  In my opening speech I dealt with the question of VAT as it would apply to the marts.  Perhaps there is undue apprehension as to the effect it would have.  Certainly there is no estimate available to me that would suggest that a vast revenue would be received from applying VAT to marts.  It is important to bear in mind that marts are very big business and if other businesses, large and small, are subjected to VAT it is difficult to understand why marts should be excluded.  This is a situation in which we really have no choice, given that agreement was previously reached on the terms of the directive, and so it is a question of trying to ensure that it operates as smoothly as possible and to the least possible detriment of all involved in the operation of the marts, including the farmers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If there are problems arising or envisaged which could be overcome to make the operation smoother and less difficult for those involved I would be quite willing to consider any representations made in that respect but I would urge people not to exaggerate the consequences.  They should not, perhaps, be led to believe that the consequence of applying VAT of 10 per cent to the commission <Col N="374" /> in the marts&mdash;that is what is involved &mdash;will be a disaster for our livestock industry or for the farmers who are selling their cattle in the marts.  If there are any persons who wish to make representations on the operation in relation to the marts or any other matter affected by the Bill where they feel improvements could be made, I will only be too glad to give serious and sympathetic consideration to them. Other detailed points were raised in the discussion but it would probably be more appropriate that they be dealt with on Committee Stage.  As was said earlier in the debate, this is very much a Committee Stage Bill.</P>

I also made the point that the final decisions were made by the Council of Ministers in May of this year.  It would not be true to say in these circumstances that this Bill simply came before the House to be rubber-stamped.

    <P>&ldquo;(4)  The local returning officer shall appoint a place within or convenient to the constituency as the place at which he will open the ballot boxes and arrange the ballot papers in parcels as hereinafter provided and shall at that place so appointed provide suitable accommodation and all furniture and equipment necessary for opening the ballot boxes and arranging of the ballot papers in parcels as aforesaid.&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Barrett)</NameTxt>
      <P>We debated this in great detail on Committee Stage and we went through the arguments of both sides of the House.  I am not accepting Deputy Fitzpatrick's amendment on this matter.  The feasibility of the arrangements proposed in the Bill have never been in any doubt, and Deputy Fitzpatrick's <Col N="376" /> proposal is workable too.  It would be difficult to say otherwise in view of the examples given of the successful manner in which operations such as the one proposed in the Bill has been carried out over a number of years.  One example given was a general election in the Dublin area involving nine constituencies and an electorate of 100,000 people.  Another example was the poll on Northern Ireland on the Border which involved an electorate of over 1,000,000 people and 600 polling stations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Over 1,000,000 people.  On the arguments in relation to transport and security, one way or another every ballot paper will have to be transported to a central polling station even when the first count has taken place at local counting areas. That point had to be accepted, as it was conceded that the main point was in relation to the size of the load involved.</P>
      <P>In relation to security I made the point that common-sense dictated that it would be far easier to provide security for a few days at one central point in the constituencies, as is proposed, rather than at possibly 11 different centres throughout the country over the same number of days.</P>

      <P>The expenditure proposals for 1978, which were recently submitted to my Department by An Chomhairle Ealaíon, are under consideration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>In the proposals that the Taoiseach's Department received from the Arts Council I believe a request was made for a commitment from the Government to cover a period of three years.  May I ask the Taoiseach if his Government are prepared to give a commitment to cover a three-year period to help reduce the high level of borrowing by the Arts Council?  Is the Taoiseach prepared to give such an undertaking to the Arts Council?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is normal for organisations like the Arts Council, whether they be voluntary or semi-State, to make representations to the Government or to the Minister responsible for their activities seeking increased allocations in respect of the forthcoming financial year, but it is not the practice to indicate in advance publicly what will be contained in the Book of Estimates.  I assure the Deputy that the Arts Council have made representations to have their allocation for the next year increased, and as far as I am concerned that is being considered sympathetically.  I cannot say at this stage that I can possibly give the undertaking to cover that expenditure for a three-year period.  That has not been the normal practice.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the Taoiseach's very helpful reply may I ask him if, in view of the fact that an increase was given to the Arts Council last year on the previous year, he is aware that there has been a reduction in the number of festivals that come under the jurisdiction of the Arts Council because they are heavily reliant on borrowing&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Would the Taoiseach consider meeting some people and, after considering the proposals, try to ensure that adequate arrangements are made to cover a longer period than one year?  The one-year period is not sufficient because of their very high outlay and costs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have indicated already that the organisations which receive subventions from Government sources are active about this time every year in relation to their own expenditure and the estimates they hope to receive to cover that expenditure. It is not very helpful that we should debate their representations or aspirations in public in advance of the allocations being made.  However, I assure the Deputy that I, in common with my colleagues, am anxious to procure as much as possible for those organisations which come under the aegis of our respective Departments.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I certainly am but unfortunately our public finances have not been so organised in this respect as to allow for firm commitments to be made longer than one year in advance.

In the report from the Arts Council the chairman pointed out that there was a serious danger of decline in the standards of the Arts Council and the bodies which come under them, and because of this what is outlined in regard to planning ahead is essential.

      <P>The health boards under the provisions of sections 68 and 69 of the Health Act, 1970, operate a rehabilitation service for handicapped persons, mainly through voluntary organisations. The health boards pay grants to the agencies in respect of training and so on, and persons living away from home while training are paid maintenance allowances.</P>

      <P>I propose, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, to take Questions Nos. 6 to 10 together.</P>
      <P>Venereal disease is compulsorily notifiable and in 1976, 2,081 cases were notified to my Department as compared with 1,283 in 1971.  The figures do not, in my view, reflect the real incidence of venereal disease in the community.</P>
      <P>There are nine centres at which treatment is provided; I propose, with your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, to circulate a list of the centres with the Official Report.  In general, health boards in whose areas the centres are located, include reference to them in their information leaflets.  These leaflets indicate that treatment for compulsorily notifiable infectious diseases is free.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not satisfied that the present system of notification is satisfactory. There are a number of factors which militate against effective notification under the Infectious Diseases Regulations 1948.  In an effort to improve this situation, my Department have prepared a comprehensive redraft of <Col N="384" /> the Regulations and they are at present the subject of consultation with the Society of Medical Officers of Health.</P>
    <P>My Department have also initiated an inquiry involving directors of community care and medical officers of health in liaison with general practitioners in their areas in an endeavour to get some idea of the true incidence of venereal disease in the community.</P>
    <P>I am not, I should say, fully satisfied that the facilities available for the treatment of venereal disease, are on a country-wide basis, sufficiently well known and in the context of education in relation to sexually transmitted diseases generally I am considering what are the best options open to me to improve the situation.  To an extent what I will do will depend upon the information which is gained from the survey to which I have referred.</P>
    <P>There is no provision for compulsory treatment in the Health Acts under which the infectious diseases services are provided.</P>

Whilst there is provision for statement that treatment of infectious diseases is available free, it does not specifically state venereal disease.  Would the Minister not agree that the Health Acts fall down in this regard?  Secondly, would he not consider that established contacts should <Col N="385" /> be treated compulsorily in the interests of the community?  I think the Minister knows to what I am referring.</P>

      <P>In reply to the first part of the Deputy's question, as I have already indicated, we propose to redraft the regulations.  These are at present the subject of consultation with the medical officers concerned. I would not be prepared to agree about the compulsory aspect as suggested by the Deputy.</P>

      <P>Supposing a smallpox case came to the country would the Minister consider it desirable that compulsory treatment be available in that case?  Is it not provided for in the Act that there should be compulsory treatment of infectious diseases?  It should be compulsory, especially with regard to venereal disease which can have such serious consequences.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">

    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>But first there must be a political willingness on the part of a Minister to have a statute brought in.  That is what we are talking about &mdash;compulsory treatment of established contacts.  These people are allowed go free in the community, transmitting the disease from one to another.  I, and I think the Minister should, consider it desirable, indeed very important, that they be treated compulsorily, as they are in other countries.  This is the only country that has not got compulsory treatment.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that there are precedents for the establishment of this kind of facility for disadvantaged persons and that it does act as a disincentive to somebody who is unemployed to go round looking for work if he is going to have to pay what is an increasing amount of his relatively small allowance on bus fares?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, there are two aspects of it which I am sure the Deputy will appreciate.  The first is the simple matter of cost.  The next question is one of priorities.  The free travel scheme, as the Deputy knows, has been extended from time to time to new categories of person; whether the unemployed category would be the next in line of priority I would not like to say at this stage but it would be a very expensive extension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure it would be a very expensive scheme.  The fact that it is expensive is due largely to successive Governments' inability to find work for these people.  Would the Minister not agree that these people are disadvantaged through no fault of their own and primarily because successive Governments have left so many of them unemployed and in this very vulnerable position in our society?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">

      <P>Would the Minister be agreeable to providing this transport if it were financially feasible and would he ask CIE the times at which such <Col N="387" /> transport would be available because of buses being relatively empty in off-peak hours during which time the unemployed could be facilitated without undue expense?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the main thinking behind the existing free transport scheme.  It is available to persons who can travel during off-peak periods and is, therefore, less expensive.  As I said, from the point of view of the unemployed the two questions are whether we can afford it at any given time and, secondly, whether it should be extended to the unemployed in preference to other categories.  I am sure every Deputy would have his own particular preference as to what section of the community it should be extended.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister even consider this on the limited scale? If a person is <i>bona fide</i> unemployed and goes to the exchange or the Garda station could he be given a voucher there which would recoup him, even if he is travelling to collect?

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The criteria for entitlement to unemployment benefit, which apply to all applicants including week-end workers, are to be found in the Social Welfare Acts, 1952 to 1977, and are in general that benefit is payable to a claimant in respect of days of unemployment if on those days he is under pensionable age, is capable of work and available for work, satisfies the relevant contribution conditions and is free from certain statutory disqualifications. The disqualifications apply to a range of circumstances among which are situations where persons are involved in trade disputes, persons leave their employment voluntarily without just cause or refuse suitable <Col N="390" /> offers of employment or have not taken advantage of any reasonable opportunity of obtaining suitable employment. Each case is decided on its merits by a deciding officer of my Department in the light of the particular circumstances.</P>
      <P>Weekend workers claiming benefit in respect of the days on which they are not working have to satisfy the same conditions as other claimants.  In their cases, however, particular attention would naturally be paid to the question of their availability for work on the days involved and the decision on this aspect would be given in the light of a number of relevant circumstances such as their efforts to seek full-time employment and whether they would genuinely avail of employment on the days in question if it were offered to them.</P>

      <P>I am not satisfied that the arrangements for the payment of disability benefit under the Social Welfare Acts would be improved by decentralisation.  Under the present arrangements, payments are made by cheque delivered by post to the beneficiaries' addresses.  These claimants are ill and it would not be possible for the majority of them to attend at local offices for payment.  With centralised <Col N="393" /> administration, the most modern office equipment and up-to-date techniques can be utilised to the maximum advantage in the determination of claims and the preparation and issue of benefit cheques.

      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if he will consider discontinuing the present archaic system of summoning people who are in receipt of disability benefit to appear before a departmental referee when the person concerned is, in fact, the holder of a certificate which clearly sets out his or her illness and incapacity to work.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>In the administration of disability benefit, medical control is necessary to ensure that only genuinely sick persons are paid benefit.  This control is exercised through medical referees to whom claimants are from time to time referred for examination for the purpose of obtaining independent second medical opinions as to incapacity for work.  The claimant's medical certifier in all cases is notified of the date and place of the proposed examination and invited to attend if he so desires.  He is also requested to furnish particulars of the claimant's medical history and present condition, and to say whether the claimant is in a fit state of health to attend.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">

I do recognise that the cheap fuel scheme constantly gives rise to complaints and anomalies and I intend to review it during this season to see what could or should be done.  There is also the question of deliveries and a number of other things which are unsatisfactory.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Claims for unemployment benefit from seasonal employees who had been employed in Butlin's Holiday Camp were submitted to deciding officers of my Department who held in the majority of cases that the claimants were not available for employment other than as seasonal workers with the said employer and were thereby not entitled to unemployment benefit.  As deciding officers are independent in the exercise of their statutory functions it would not be proper for me to comment on these decisions.  However, the decision in each case was taken, as is required, in the light of the claimant's circumstances with particular reference to the efforts which the claimant had made to seek employment.  In general, it can be said that those whose claims were disallowed had confined their employment experience over a number of years to the particular employment in question for a limited period each year and there was insufficient evidence to show to the satisfaction of the deciding officers that the claimants were interested in securing employment outside those periods or with any other employers.  Those who did show such evidence were in general allowed benefit.</P>

Would the Minister explain how that has happened?  Is this the idea behind the Fianna Fáil promise in their manifesto when they proposed to give equal rights to female recipients of social welfare benefits or has this been done on the recommendation of the <Col N="402" /> Minister for Economic Planning and Development who said last January that £30 million would be saved on social welfare?</P>

      <P>The system of social welfare payments is based on payment being made to the person who is legally entitled to it, whether or not the payment includes an amount in respect of <Col N="409" /> a dependant or dependants.  Where a payment includes such an amount, there is power under regulations to enable payment of that amount to be made to some person other than the payee where it appears to the Minister that the circumstances so warrant. These powers are exercised to ensure that in such cases as family dissension or neglect, the amount payable in respect of the wife and children, if there are any, is paid to her directly.

    <P>In page 29, to delete lines 43 to 45, and substitute the following paragraph:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(4)  The local returning officer shall appoint a place within or convenient to the constituency as the place at which he will open the ballot boxes and arrange the ballot papers in parcels as hereinafter provided and shall at that place so appointed provide suitable accommodation and all furniture and equipment necessary for opening the ballot boxes and arranging of <Col N="426" /> the ballot papers in parcels as aforesaid.&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Barrett)</NameTxt>
      <P>Before moving the adjournment on this debate I dealt with the security element involved.  I do not think there is any dispute there.  On the question of ruling on doubtful voters, I indicated that this could be done by the returning officer's staff under his supervision and drew attention to the fact that the returning officer could ask the local returning officers to assist him in this task at the central counting station.  Deputy Fitzpatrick did not accept my view on that.  He maintained that the returning officer should rule personally on every doubtful vote.  He said that all these have to be scrutinised by the returning officer and not for a moment did he accept that as a matter of practice this is delegated by the returning officer or, indeed, that it would be possible to delegate it.  It is possible to do so.  Surely this is an odd argument for the Deputy to use when one considers that under his proposal the doubtful votes would be ruled on by 11 different people in 11 different places without any reference whatsoever to the returning officer.  There is no reason why this duty could not be delegated to some of the local returning officers at the central counting station.</P>
      <P>I raised the question of who could be responsible in the event of a discrepancy arising between the number of ballot papers alleged to have been despatched by a local returning officer and the number alleged to have been received by the returning officer.  Nobody has seen fit to attempt to answer this question.  Nor has anybody dealt with the bias that could arise in the distribution of a surplus if the first count were carried out on a county by county basis.  Obviously if ballot papers are kept in county order it could make a very big difference if a surplus consists entirely of Clare votes or Cork votes or Limerick votes, in the event of a distribution of the surplus.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From the point of view of the time <Col N="427" /> factor&mdash;this is a very important factor &mdash;the case for a central count is overwhelming. I mentioned that the question of the polling day had not been decided but that it seems reasonable to expect that it will be on a Thursday as far as we are concerned.  Under the European rules which govern the Assembly elections ballot boxes cannot be opened until the Monday morning &mdash;the final vote in some of the member states takes place on a Sunday.  We should utilise those days to get the ballot boxes to the central counting station.  If that is done we will be able to start on Monday morning and proceed continuously until the results are ascertained.  In my view it is in the interests of candidates that the count be over as quickly as possible.  It is also important from the European point of view to have the elections over and the result declared in the shortest possible time because many member states have a more efficient system, through the use of computers and so on, of counting.  A comparison has been made between the counting arrangements proposed in the Bill and the system used at presidential elections here.  There are a number of differences between the two situations.</P>
    <P>A presidential election is held on the basis of one constituency for the whole country, whereas the Assembly elections will be based on four separate constituencies.  Therefore, there is no direct relationship between the two.  At a presidential election there is only one seat to be filled and, consequently, there is no question of a transfer if there is a surplus.  The most that can happen at the end of the first count is the elimination of a candidate or candidates.  On the other hand, the count at the Assembly elections will follow the same lines as in a general election and will require a much wider range of operations because of this.</P>
    <P>The result of a presidential election is usually known at the end of the first count.  A second count has been necessary on one occasion only.  At Assembly elections, it can be reasonably expected that a number of counts will be necessary before the results can be declared. A presidential election returning officer <Col N="428" /> is obliged to check the ballot papers received from the local returning officers to satisfy himself about the first count.  This process usually takes the best part of an afternoon.  A similar check will have to be carried out by the returning officer at Assembly elections.  If the first count were conducted locally this could result in considerable loss of valuable time and a further delay.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied there is no valid comparison between the two systems, namely, the presidential and the Assembly elections, and that the counting arrangements used in the presidential election would not be appropriate to the Assembly elections. The arrangements I am proposing in the Bill were given careful and specific consideration by both my predecessor and myself.  I am quite satisfied it is the more feasible of the two.  I admit the two are feasible.  It will be more convenient for the candidates who will be important people in this issue.  The saving in time and the continuity will give an earlier result than the proposal in Deputy Fitzpatrick's amendments. We are saving valuable time.  We will be able to declare the result of the elections much more quickly than if we held the first count locally.  This is in the interests of all concerned, the candidates and the parties.  It is also helpful to the media whose responsibility it will be to let the people know the results as quickly as possible. I cannot agree to the amendments put down by Deputy Fitzpatrick.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): Listening to the Minister's reply I could not help remarking to myself that he went through his reply dealing with every argument which was put up, dealing with time, and trying to refute the arguments I put up by copy book arguments or mechanical arguments, if I might say so.  Never once did he refer to the local element in it.  Never once did he refer to the argument put forward by Deputy Kavanagh and myself that, if the count is to be centralised, the whole election will be centralised, and local interests will be taken out of it to a large extent.  Therefore, the result is likely to be a reduced poll and a less <Col N="429" /> democratic election than would otherwise be held.  That is the essence of the whole thing.</P>
      <P>I am dealing with this argument first because it was apparent from the Minister's argument that he was interested in mechanics and in time, and that he did not consider the human element, the local element or the local interest which a count in 11 centres would generate rather than one central count.  The Minister said his arrangement had worked well and no argument could be put up against it because experience had shown that his proposal for a central counting place was the ideal.  The only example he could give was the city of Dublin.  Try to compare the city of Dublin with the Province of Munster or the Province of Connacht and what is left to us of Ulster.  There is no comparison.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>And Belfast.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): We are hard put to it when we have to seek precedents from that quarter because, in recent times, they have been forced to do things there which one would not think of doing in normal circumstances.</P>
      <P>At any rate, Dublin is no comparison. In Dublin, the average man could not separate the constituencies. People living and voting in Dublin between one election and another could not define the nine constituencies the Minister tells us are in Dublin. Dublin is taken as a city and, to a lesser extent, a county, and the question of local interest does not arise to the same extent as it does in provincial and rural Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, I would not accept that as any argument in favour of the Minister's contention that the central count has worked well in the past and has no shortcomings so far as local interest, or transport, or security is concerned.  Everybody knows there are a number of military barracks and a very large section of the Garda in Dublin.  Everybody knows it is only a matter of a few miles from any given point in Dublin to another.  I do not think anyone would expect me to spend much time in refuting the Minister's <Col N="430" /> suggestion that the fact that the central count has worked reasonably well in Dublin is evidence that it will work equally well in provincial Ireland.</P>
    <P>As I said time and again, the Minister concedes that both systems can work.  He also went to Northern Ireland, to the referendum held there a few years ago, and pointed that out as an example of how the central count could work here.  Presumably, if he gave it any thought at all, he meant to argue that, because there was no lack of interest in Northern Ireland in the referendum, there would be no lack of local interest throughout the Republic in the Assembly elections. Again there is no comparison whatever between a referendum where you are talking about an inanimate thing dealing with &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo; and dozens of candidates from various parts of Ireland.  The Minister did not do his case any good by leaning on that example to show that the central system worked.  Nobody could reasonably accept that, because something was done in Northern Ireland in the past seven or eight years, that is the proper thing to do.  We have completely abnormal conditions in Northern Ireland.  I suggest that what is done in Northern Ireland at present is the abnormal; practically everything done there from any angle of democracy is the abnormal rather than the normal thing at present.</P>
    <P>I shall not drag out this debate unduly.  The Minister has failed to answer the argument based on the human element, on local interest and on the element of interest necessary to get out the electorate.  The fact that he has not dealt with that and that he gives the city of Dublin as an example of how the provinces of Connaught and Ulster and the large province of Munster will work, is, I think, going very far and shows how hard put the Minister is for an argument to refute the arguments put from this side of the House.</P>
    <P>As regards transport of votes, I concede that every ballot paper will have to be transported from the various local counties to the central counting place somehow but it is one matter to transfer all the votes in seven or eight <Col N="431" /> boxes and another to transfer the same votes in a couple of thousand boxes. Transferring thousands of boxes is a far more dangerous operation, far more vulnerable to accident, sabotage or attack.</P>
    <P>The Minister did not deal with the question of recruiting staff into the proposed central counting centre.  They will have to come from all over the place and without doubt they must have a dress rehearsal and a lecture on the way the particular returning officer works.  That will cost money and cause inconvenience.</P>
    <P>I do not necessarily take the Minister's points in the order in which he dealt with them but apparently he has decided that the count here will take place on a Thursday and the count in the remainder of the Community will not have been completed until Sunday night and the boxes therefore cannot be opened&mdash;I think the Minister said&mdash;until Monday.  If that is so, I can see no reason for the election here not being held on a Saturday. There is a growing volume of opinion in favour of a weekend election and were it not for the religious and conscientious reservations of some people about violation of the Sabbath the vast majority would favour a Sunday election. If that is the climate here, why not have a Saturday election?  Then there is no reason why the count could not proceed on a Monday as it would have to go on locally and no reason why the ballot boxes could not be at the central place to have the count continue on Tuesday morning. I cannot see why the Minister would not do that; it seems reasonable.</P>
    <P>He has been arguing that if there were two elections on the one day the local politicians would not wait a minute longer than was necessary.  I do not think that is so.  If they realised that there was a real danger of getting a wrong result&mdash;as there would be through ballot papers finding their way into the wrong box&mdash;they would certainly wait the extra day or two.</P>
    <P>We have a difference of opinion about the doubtful votes.  My information is that each returning officer <Col N="432" /> adjudicates personally on the doubtful votes.  If that is so I concede that you would have an adjudication in each place but that would be according to criteria established in each place and probably would lead to consultation between various returning officers.  But the point is that to go through thousands of doubtful papers in the same place would entail a lot of unnecessary delay.</P>
    <P>The Minister asks who will resolve the discrepancy, if there is one, between the number of votes alleged to have been despatched from the local area and the number received in the central counting house.  This has been dealt with in presidential election after presidential election and no difficulty has arisen.  Presumably, the votes are counted at a local centre in the presence of the agents.  The count is announced and agreed upon and a certificate is made out by the local returning officer and that is despatched to the central counting office and presumably if there is a discrepancy when it reaches there, there will be a recount. Recounts have resolved many things; they have ended up showing a difference and showing no difference.</P>
    <P>The Minister made the point that if the surplus were taken from a particular county it might be unfair to one candidate or another.  This is one of the inherent weaknesses in proportional representation, the only weakness of which I know, in that there is no certainty as to what bundle of votes will be taken from the candidate with the surplus and passed on.  But the Minister knows as well as I do that there is a provision in the Schedule to the Bill and in the rules for all elections that the ballot papers must be mixed before the count begins.  When the ballot papers are taken out of their boxes they are mixed, put into a huge cantainer and then find their way to pigeonholes. That is the theory and the practice of it.  If there is any substance in the Minister's argument&mdash;I do not accept that there is&mdash;the same argument arises in each Dáil election as to where the surplus votes will come from.  They might favour one candidate more than <Col N="433" /> another.  The answer is that the rules provide for mixing.</P>
    <P>In regard to time the Minister seems to think that his method will be speedier than mine.  I do not accept that.  It would take far longer to transport votes in thousands of boxes to each centre than to transport a dozen boxes.  Furthermore, a mixed staff from County Galway and County Cavan will not work as quickly as the staff of one county who are accustomed to working together and who would be doing the breakdown of the work in the first instance.  One system will not be speedier than another to any great degree.  This should not be a stop watch situation.  The advantage in gaining a few metaphorical seconds by using one system will be lost by taking away from the local interest and departing from true democracy.</P>
    <P>The Minister made the case that there is some difference between the presidential election and the Assembly elections.  I cannot see any real difference.  It is true that normally there are only two or three candidates in a presidential election and that is all the difference there is.  The ballot boxes in each case have to be opened, the ballot papers have to be reconciled with the ballot paper accounts, the ballot papers have to be sorted under the names of the candidates and they have to be counted.  If there are three candidates and nobody reaches the quota on the first count there has to be an elimination and a distribution of votes.  In general practice there is no difference and I do not accept the Minister's argument as valid.</P>
    <P>The Minister for some reason or another is in a hurry with this Bill. The Minister need not be in a hurry because we will not have European elections this year or next May.  June or autumn, but they will be held the year after.  That seems to be the news from across the water.  I agree that if the Minister were to accept my amendment he could not just simply accept the amendment but would have to take the Bill away and throw the Schedule back to the parliamentary draftsman, his Department would have to work on it and there would be a <Col N="434" /> good deal of inconvenience.  It would not be a case of just rearranging the Schedule.  I suggest that the whole Bill would have to be redrafted.  The Minister would have to look at the Schedule to the presidential election and that Schedule would have to be modified to meet this case.  All that inconvenience would be worth it because we would have a more efficient system at the end of it.</P>
    <P>The Minister agreed that the two systems will work.  I argued strongly that my system is the more efficient and the Minister believes that his is. To have the tried and proved system the Bill will have to be completely redrafted. Some people in the House believe that the Minister has a political feeling about this matter and thinks that his organisation is stronger and more able to get out voters and that any lack of local interest will favour his party more than other parties in the House.  I have argued strongly and convincingly from the very beginning that we should have the local count up to and including the first count. With all due respect, the Minister's last contribution on this amendment was the weakest contribution he made yet. There was no human touch about it and it was devoid of any political approach except, perhaps, the one just mentioned which did not come very much to the surface.  We are political beings here and we know that it is necessary to instil local interest to get the biggest possible vote.  I concede to the Minister that the system I am advocating is a system which was prepared by his predecessor.  That is no reason why, if there is a better system, we should not go for the better system. If it were a matter of arranging constituencies I could understand the Minister holding out so strongly, but this is a question of finding an efficient and acceptable system that will appeal to the people, that will work and that will not have any pitfalls in it.  There are pitfalls in the Minister's proposal.  There is lack of local interest and the system I am proposing has been tried and has proved acceptable.</P>

      <P>Rule 91 of the First Schedule sets out the maximum penalties for the various offences proposed to be created in this Bill.  For convenience the rule divides the offences into two categories, the serious and the less serious offences.  In the category of serious offences attracting heavier penalties are included offences such as double voting, personation, undue influence, breach of secrecy and so on. The rules treat three offences as relatively less serious.  Those offences are, the omission of the name and address of the publisher and printer from posters, handbills and similar documents circulated at Assembly elections, the handling of ballot papers at the count by candidates or their agents and the unlawful marking of ballot papers by a companion.  The last mentioned offence, the unlawful marking of ballot papers by a companion can arise in two ways.  It arises if a person acts as companion for more than two incapacitated electors or if a candidate or agent acts as the companion of an incapacitated elector.  On Committee Stage the view was expressed that this ought to be treated as a major offence carrying the same penalty as personation.  I am not sure that this view would be generally acceptable.  However, the rule specifies maximum penalties only and it would be a matter for the court within this limit to consider the appropriate penalty in each individual case.  In these circumstances there is no practical objection to specifying the higher penalties in the case of this offence and amendment No. 22 provides accordingly.</P>

      <P> In page 45, line 44, to delete &ldquo;£200&rdquo; and to insert &ldquo;£250&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I put down this amendment purely for the purpose of asking a question. I raised this matter on the last occasion when I told the Minister that I feared that the proposal in Rule 92 would not stand up in court on the grounds that it was asking a court in a criminal matter to adjudicate on civil damages.  I said that I thought that a similar provision in the Road Traffic Act, 1961, had run into trouble or was <i>sub judice</i> at the moment.  I admit that although I raised this point early enough I did not do any further research on it.  I wonder whether the Minister has done any research and whether he is satisfied that this rule is constitutional and enforceable in the courts.  If it is I have no further point to make on it.

    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>In the High Court the case in question arose out of a prosecution under section 56 of the Road Traffic Act, 1961, for driving a car without insurance.  Section 56 lays down that the penalty for the offence shall be a fine not exceeding £100 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months.  Section 57 of the Road Traffic Act provides that if the uninsured driver causes injury to another person or to property the court in addition to imposing the appropriate penalty under section 56 may inflict on the convicted person a fine not exceeding the damages which in the opinion of the court the injured party would be entitled to recover in a civil action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="437" /> In a judgment delivered on 7th July, 1977, Mr. Justice Hamilton indicated that section 57 of the Act purported to increase the penalty which the court could inflict to such an extent as would in his opinion not permit an offence under section 56 of the Road Traffic Act, 1961, to be regarded as a minor offence properly triable by the District Justice.  The nub of the matter of the road traffic case, there-fore, was the size of the total penalty which the court could impose.</P>
    <P>Under Rule 92 of this Bill the amount which the court may require the personation agent to pay is £200 and this sum is well within the ordinary limits applicable to the District Court.  In any event, under this Bill personation and double voting are offences which may be prosecuted summarily in the District Court or on indictment in the Circuit Court.  The financial limits of the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court are, of course, much higher than in the case of the District Court and the damages provided for in Rule 92 may be awarded only at the request of the person against whom the charge of personation or double voting was made.  There is nothing in the rule to prevent a person charged from seeking remedies under the ordinary law in respect of wrongful arrest, false prosecution and so on. Rule 92 merely provides a convenient method under which if he wishes he may recover limited damages without the necessity of taking separate civil action.</P>
    <P>The amendment proposes to increase the maximum amount which may be granted by way of damages from £200 to £250.  There is no objection to this because what is being laid down is the maximum.  It would be up to the court to fix the exact amount in each individual case and it is understood that the significance of the figure of £250 is that this represents the limit of the jurisdiction of the District Court in a civil case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): I move amendment No. 24:</P>
      <P> In page 46, line 43, after &ldquo;officer&rdquo; to add &ldquo;and local returning officers&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Rule 98 deals with a petition to the High Court, arising out of an election, to have the election declared null and void or to attack the election in some way.  The petition, of course, sets out the grounds on which the petitioner is moving and the petitioner may be the Director of Public Prosecutions or he may not.</P>
      <P>Rule 98 (4) provides:</P>
      <P> (4)  Where a petition has been lodged with the court, as soon as may be the petitioner shall give a copy of the petition&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  to any person to whose election the petition relates,</P>
      <P>(b)  to the Minister,</P>
      <P>(c)  to the chief returning officer,</P>
      <P>(d)  to the returning officer for the constituency to which the petition relates, and</P>
      <P>(e)  except in the case of a petition presented by the Director of Public Prosecutions, to the Director of Public Prosecutions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It will be noted that while there is provision in Rule 98 (4) for serving on or furnishing to the chief returning officer and the returning officer for the constituency concerned a copy of the petition, there is no provision for <Col N="439" /> serving of the petition on the local returning officer.  It is almost certain, or at any rate quite likely, that at least one local returning officer would be involved in any petition.  It is probable that the petitioner would be alleging that the local returning officer failed to do something in accordance with the Act or in accordance with the rules in connection with the Assembly election, that he was guilty of malpractice, or that something went wrong for which he was liable.  It is only reasonable that the petition should be served also on the local returning officer.  In effect, that is the substance of my amendment.  I propose to add, in line 43, after &ldquo;to the returning officer for the constituency to which the petition relates and&rdquo; the words &ldquo;the local returning officers for the constituency&rdquo;. It could be drafted a little bit better than that, but I think it is quite clear what I have in mind.</P>
    <P>That is essential.  If the Minister were to say to me that it would not be necessary to serve a copy of the petition on each of the 11 local returning officers in Leinster, I would say that each of them should be served with a copy, that it would be safer to so do. If the Minister were to say to me that perhaps only one of the local returning officers would be involved, then I would settle for serving it on any returning officer against whom any allegation was made.  But the safer thing would be to serve it on all local returning officers and I should like to hear the Minister's views on that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, there are very definite reasons why the people named&mdash;the Minister, the Director of Public Prosecutions, the chief returning officer and the returning officer for the constituency concerned&mdash;should get them.  For instance, the Minister requires official notification because if the election is upset it will be his duty to set a date for a fresh election.  The Director of Public Prosecutions must be informed, so that he may make inquiries or institute prosecution for alleged offences or irregularities.  The chief returning officer must be informed because, if the petition is successful, <Col N="440" /> he may be required to amend or withdraw the return furnished to the European Assembly.  The constituency returning officer requires notification because he has declared certain persons elected and given a return of the persons so declared elected.  The court may direct him to amend or cancel the declaration and the return he has made, or may direct him to carry out a fresh count of any or all of the votes cast at the election.</P>
      <P>No matter what the nature of the petition or the grounds on which it is based, all the people listed in Rule 98 (4) have a direct involvement.  For this reason the rule places a specific obligation on the petitioner to send a copy of the petition to each of them.</P>
      <P>The amendment would impose a requirement on the petitioner to send a copy to every local returning officer in the particular constituency and there will be several local returning officers for each Assembly constituency and 11 in one case, that being in Leinster.  If the petition is based on the action or omission of any of these, he will be named in the petition and a copy will be served on him in the normal course. If a local returning officer is in a position to give material evidence or assistance he may be summoned by the court, under Rule 101 (2) (d), or by any party to the petition.  Thus, if he has a direct involvement, either as respondent or as a witness, there is the necessary machinery in existence for notifying him.  If on the other hand he has no direct involvement it would be unjust as well as pointless to burden the petitioner in question with the obligation of sending him a copy.  The difference between the local returning officer and the persons listed in Rule 98 (4) is that they have a necessary involvement in every election petition while he has not, but the machinery is there if the local officer is named in the petition.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): I do not propose to drag out this argument but I am really surprised at the Minister's attitude.  I admit he is a layman and I have practised as a solicitor for some time. I cannot see how or why the Minister <Col N="441" /> is not prepared to make it obligatory on a petitioner to serve a local returning officer if he is involved in some error, is guilty of having made some mistake or of some malpractice.  It is elementary justice that, if a person is named, he should get a copy of the document.</P>
      <P>I could foresee a situation in which the only person at fault would be the chief returning officer; he could have done something, or indeed the Minister could have done something because he might not have made the order properly.  The only person who could really be guilty could be the Minister if he had failed to discharge his statutory function in connection with the elections.  Yet the rule provides that the chief returning officer and the constituency returning officers must be served in any case even when only the Minister is to blame.</P>
      <P>I can also see a case in which the Minister might be blameless but in which only the chief returning officer might have done something wrong in carrying out his duties.  Yet the constituency returning officer and the Minister are to be served.  If there is a fault somewhere and statutory rules and regulations have not been carried out, a new election would be necessary. That is why it has to be served on the constituency returning officer, because he would have something to do.  Of course, so would the local returning officer; he would have a lot of things to do also if there were to be a new election.  For the life of me I cannot see why he is not being served.  As a matter of fact the case made by the Minister would seem to me to strengthen my case for saying that they all should be served.  If there is to be a new election, then they are all in it&mdash;the local man, the constituency man, the chief and the Minister.</P>
      <P>I would ask the Minister to have another think about this one.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill, as amended, do now pass.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): First of all I want to repeat the welcome for the system of arranging constituencies enshrined in this Bill, which sets a precedent for all future creation or revision of constituencies. The system of handing this sensitive task over to a commission is the right one.  I want to renew my words of thanks to the learned members of the commission who did their work so well and expeditiously.</P>
      <P>This Bill provides for the election of 15 members to represent this country in the European Assembly. When these elections are being held I hope the candidates who offer will not be influenced by any consideration other than that of serving the country to the best possible advantage.  There have been suggestions in the media and elsewhere that the European Assembly is nothing short of a talking shop.  I hope that is not so.  I believe it is not so.  There have also been suggestions that the allegedly huge salaries offered are the only attraction for some people and it has been said that the beaverlike activities on the part of those interested seem to bear that out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now democracy is the best system of government that can be found.  It has its shortcomings.  There is no doubt about that, but there also is no doubt that over the ages no better system of government has emerged.  Democracy, at European and national level, will be a success so long as it is respected by the people and so long as people have confidence in it.  That places a very <Col N="443" /> heavy responsibility on politicians in general, because the day democracy ends or the day it is destroyed and some other system takes its place the people to blame will be the politicians who failed democracy because democracy will not fail them.  I hope it never will be said that people are in politics for what they can get out of them financially.  That certainly could not be said where national politics are concerned because from the foundation of the State to the present day the tendency has been to underpay rather than overpay.  Experience has shown that people in politics, instead of amassing wealth, have actually lost money and many have ended up poor. Experience has also shown that many in politics would have done better financially in private walks of life had they not gone into Parliament.</P>
    <P>The salaries are being talked about and speculated about.  In the European Parliament they are infinitely&mdash;&ldquo;infiintely&rdquo; is too extravagant a word and this is a time for moderate language&mdash; a few times more substantial than the salaries paid in the national Parliament. The life of the politician at the moment here is a full-time job irrespective of whether he is in Government or in Opposition.  A Minister's job is certainly full time.  I do not know any politician, even in Opposition, who can discharge his duties to his constituents and to his party and engage in another job as well.  I do not think it can be done.  I do not think it is done.  I believe that national politicians are not adequately paid but I sincerely hope that our entry into Europe will not create a situation where people rush for Europe simply and solely because of £30,000 a year plus.  If that day ever dawns a severe blow will have been delivered to democracy.  Democracy will be damaged beyond repair and the end result will be an unacceptable form of government.  I hope I am making myself clear.  I notice the Chair is looking at me.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): This is the measure that provides for the £30,000 a year.  This is the measure that will enable the Europeans to look down their noses at the nationals and thereby make the nationals unhappy and dissatisfied. That would be a bad day's work.  It may be that the whole question of salaries, European and national, needs to be looked at.  These salaries are accepted in Europe.  There is criticism of them in the UK.  To me, that means that the whole basis of remuneration of politicians needs to be looked at but I hope this Bill will never be the cause of inducing people into politics for financial gain.</P>
      <P>I want to refer now to the Schedule and I hope the Minister will deal with the matter when he replies.  I did not have an opportunity of hearing him on Report Stage because my amendments were ruled out of order.  Rule 20 (1) provides:</P>
      <P>Where, not less than seventy-two hours before the latest time for the withdrawal of candidates under Rule 12 of this Schedule, the returning officer becomes satisfied that a candidate standing nominated has died, the returning officer shall immediately give public notice to that effect and the candidature of the candidate shall be deemed to have been withdrawn.</P>
      <P>That means that if, more than 72 hours before the latest time for withdrawal, the returning officer is satisfied a candidate has died, he will deem that candidate to have withdrawn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wonder why this addition to the rule has been introduced.  I have come to the conclusion that the only reason for it is that the experts thought that if a candidate died 80 hours before the election he could not himself with-draw and that the proposer could not withdraw because he could not have the permission of the dead man to <Col N="445" /> withdraw on his behalf.  The next paragraph in the rule states:</P>
    <P> Where at any time during the period beginning seventy-two hours before the latest time for the withdrawal of candidature under Rule 12 of this Schedule and ending on the commencement of the poll, the returning officer becomes satisfied that a candidate standing nominated for election has died, the following provisions shall have effect in relation to the Assembly election&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) the returning officer shall notify the Minister and the chief returning officer of the death of the candidate and at the same time, if notice of the poll has been given, he shall countermand the poll,</P>
    <P>That means a case where a candidate dies within 72 hours of the date fixed for withdrawal.  Normally speaking, 72 hours before the latest date for withdrawal would be 48 hours before the latest date for nominations.  Therefore, if a candidate died and was deemed to have been withdrawn under Rule 20 (1), his party or somebody else who wished to get on the ballot paper instead of him would have 48 hours to get into the field, but in neither 20 (1) nor (2) do the words &ldquo;as regards any excluded day&rdquo; appear.</P>
    <P>I believe the effect of that is that where there are excluded days, a candidate could die 74 hours before the latest date fixed for withdrawal, two hours before the latest date fixed for nominations, and the party of the candidate concerned would have only two hours to get around the Province of Munster, assemble their forces, get a convention held and a candidate selected.</P>
    <P>Rule 20 is not the same as the relevant rule in the Presidential Election Act, 1937.  The rule there deals only with a candidate dying after the adjournment date for the election. The Electoral Act, 1963 dealing with Dáil elections deals only with a situation where a candidate dies at any time beginning 72 hours before the adjournment, the time fixed for withdrawals. I may be wrong, and I hope the Minister <Col N="446" /> tells me I am, but it is my opinion that the new paragraph which deems a candidate to have been withdrawn creates difficulties.  A matter of a couple of hours can push the candidate from the provisions of paragraph (2) to paragraph (1) which would not give any time to have him replaced.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Sean Browne">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid the Deputy is reverting to a Committee Stage type debate.  The Fifth Stage permits only brief statements. Perhaps the Deputy could have these matters raised in the Seanad.  We have had these matters raised on Committee Stage and it is not in order to repeat them here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): I dealt with these matters in such a way on Committee Stage to warrant having them raised on Report Stage.  For instance, in this year's general election there were two excluded days.  Nominations closed on a Saturday and if a candidate had died at 10 a.m. on the Saturday, nomination day, his party would have had only two hours to get a replacement in the field.  If he had died at 11 o'clock they would have had only one hour.</P>
      <P>I will not say any more on the Bill except that our treatment of the Bill throughout its passage has unearthed some shortcomings in electoral practice since 1963.  The Minister reasonably accepted some amendments and put forward some of his own arising out of points raised by me.  He has undertaken to look into other points raised. This debate has proved that when politicians deal with something with which they are familiar, with subjects of which they have knowledge, the debates can be useful.</P>

There were not many other contributors and I cannot help wondering <Col N="447" /> if that means Deputies are not interested in going to Europe.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. V. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the debate was adjourned I had pointed to the necessity for everybody in a position to do so to work together to endeavour to bring about a solution to the employment problem or at least to ease it.  One of the primary duties of society is to create employment opportunities and this should be accepted by everyone as a national challenge and commitment.  A real injustice would be done to our people by our politicians and other leaders who would say that this problem can be solved without some sacrifice.  There are, I understand, many employers who employ part-time labour to the exclusion of full-time employment. There are also a large number of employees who hold down more than one position.  These are areas which the people involved should seriously consider. Leadership is required in this respect and trade unions particularly have a vital role in getting across to their members in a constructive way the urgency of the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is encouraging and satisfying that the IDA have already taken new measures in promoting the Dublin area as a location for large-scale and medium-type industries.  I do not say <Col N="448" /> this in a parochial way because everybody is aware that the largest unemployment problem is here in Dublin city.  Over 28,000 jobs were lost in Dublin during the past four years.  It is the only region where job losses have exceeded gains.  In my own constituency of Dublin North-Central, unemployment is running very much higher than the national average and this is without doubt a major contributory factor to the many problems, social and otherwise, in the inner city areas.</P>
    <P>Many industries of older origin which had been located on the fringe of the city centre have closed down over the years and have not been replaced or substituted in any way by alternative employment.  Many of these sites and factories are still idle and I would urge the Minister, through the IDA, urgently to investigate the possibility of converting these buildings for alternative industrial activity that would give some jobs in this socially and now industrially deprived area.</P>
    <P>Whilst the authority have achieved much, it is disappointing that the past two years have shown a substantial decline in investment from overseas.  It is accepted that the task of attracting foreign investment is becoming increasingly difficult, particularly in the face of strong international competition. Apart from financial and economic considerations, industrial labour relations must be an obvious area for consideration by any international firm before making a decision to invest. Unfortunately, we are having more than our fair share of industrial unrest. I am not concerning myself with any particular dispute or disputes, but the point must be made that the task of the IDA or any other body in enticing foreign investment is made extremely difficult due to this factor.  If we are to achieve the industrial growth necessary to accommodate those seeking jobs, better industrial relations must be evident and it is up to all those involved on all sides, employers, management, trade unions and workers, to bring about an improvement by a better understanding of each other's problems.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="449" /> I have no doubt that the new extended powers proposed for the authority should broaden the scope and opportunities for the creation of new industries.  A particularly interesting proposal is that which will give the authority the power to guarantee loans or to participate in the formation of new industrial companies.  This is a highly important new concept and will give the authority an opportunity to become more far-sighted in their quest for industrial development.  In any industry, finance, or lack of it&mdash;whatever the case may be&mdash;has generally been a very serious problem and the Irish banks normally seek gilt-edged security in return for facilities.  I, there-fore, welcome the section that will provide working capital for small industries up to a limit of £150,000 without the necessity to seek the consent of the Government.  During the past few years many small industries have taken hard knocks and some of those that went down could probably have survived if a financial injection had been available. I would hope that in future before any small industry is allowed to fold up every effort will be made to keep the company viable and jobs secure.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the proposal to establish an industrial development consortium.  This should serve a very useful function in setting job creation targets and monitoring and reviewing industrial progress in general.  The maintenance of jobs is, of course, equally important and I am particularly glad that the consortium will pay very special attention to that aspect.  It is very disquieting and frustrating for those involved in creating jobs to see an even greater number of jobs being lost.  We witnessed this between 1973 and 1976 when 74,000 jobs were lost and 71,000 new jobs were created.  The authority will find themselves in a very challenging situation.  It is hoped that this newly created freedom of movement will be wisely used.  I would also express the hope that the Minister will keep a careful watch to ensure that the additional financing guaranteed by the authority will not be taken by the short-term speculator at the expense of the worker and the taxpayer.</P>
    <P>We have many thousands of small <Col N="450" /> business people who between them are giving employment to a very large proportion of our working population and who are contributing to the economy in various ways.  Such firms were, more than likely, set up from personal resources, very often using personal possessions as security and collateral. More encouragement should be given to such small private enterprise and I would urge the Minister to give some solid recognition to this aspect, whether it concerns manufacturing or service industries.  The companies taxation system as applied to business is a disincentive and the greatest opponent to the accumulation of private capital reserves which are absolutely necessary to develop business. The average business capable of expansion will possibly tend to stand idle because of the fear of incurring corporate taxes that would, in due time, seriously affect the cash flow. There is not sufficient incentive for small business people.  The losers in such circumstances will be the economy and employment and the Government should give this matter some serious consideration.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I welcome the Bill which will.  I hope, go a long way towards creating more jobs.  The Minister should be given the support of all Members to ensure the speedy passage of the Bill through the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanGriffin" hpid="Mr. Griffin Mr. Griffin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Griffin</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill.  The support which has been given to the Bill by my colleagues and Government Deputies shows our goodwill for the IDA and our reliance on them to create employment for our youth.  If the Minister should feel that the Bill has not sufficient power to meet the challenge of the future, I urge him to come back to the House and we will give him all the freedom and power he requires for this important mission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The task facing the IDA is a Herculean one.  Our unemployment figure is 9.9 per cent as against 5.5 per cent in other EEC countries.  We are faced, luckily, with a young population. Thirty thousand young people leave our schools annually and they expect to be provided with employment. Emigration has ceased; indeed, <Col N="451" /> we have all experience of emigrants returning from England, looking for social welfare benefits or housing.  We are a small country on the periphery of Europe, completely dependent on our own energies.  We are also dependent on bigger nations.  As we cannot improve the world figures ourselves, we must depend on developments beyond our shores.</P>
    <P>In the past four years we have gone through the biggest recession in our history.  The recession has baffled economists in more sophisticated countries, such as Germany, Japan and the US.  I am glad that I belong to the party that laid the foundations for the upswing on which we can base our hopes for success in the future.</P>
    <P>In south Tipperary there has been a capital investment of more than £30 million with an employment figure of 185.  This shows that the human aspect is irrelevant in modern technology, and this is another factor which the IDA have to contend with.  Although their task is a mammoth one I wish them well in their endeavours.  There is no easy solution to the problem.  No magic wand can be waved and no fairy godmother will place industries here.  The changing of names or the setting up of new Departments is gimmickry.  No less a man than Senator Whitaker also finds fault with this type of gimmickry.  There is no substitute for forward planning in order to build a solid economy.  Our youth are looking to this House for guidance.  If they are to have faith in democracy we must not fail them.  They are our greatest asset.  They leave school full of hope and confidence but will become disillusioned and anti-social if we fail to provide employment for them.  Every Deputy has had the pitiful experience of parents seeking his help on behalf of their children. Therefore, I would urge the IDA to take immediate action to create employment.</P>
    <P>I would ask the employers to whom our young people apply for jobs to give them at least the courtesy of a reply.  Many young people have complained to me that their applications <Col N="452" /> for employment have not even been acknowledged.  I would ask industrialists to send circulars in acknowledgment of the applications for employment received by them.</P>
    <P>Some time ago an action team on youth employment was signalled in with great gusto.  Unfortunately, we have heard little of them since.  They were set up in early August and had their first meeting in September.  I hope the term is not a misnomer and that it will not go down in history as an inaction team for youth employment. I urge the team to report as often as possible to this House in order to keep us informed of their activities.</P>
    <P>I welcome the emphasis in the Bill on small and medium-sized companies because it is in the private sector that the greatest bulk of our employment is created.  Our small industries have shown a remarkable resilience, particularly during the recession.  A favourable environment must be created to encourage small industries. Their needs must be gauged and swift action taken.  A system of cheap finance or low interest loans should be made available to them for development purposes.  There should also be a reduction in the amount of red tape which they have to deal with.  Many industrialists have told me they would employ more people if they were not bedevilled by red tape as a result.  The rules and regulations relating to employment should be simplified in order to encourage small industries to employ more people.</P>
    <P>I am informed that the British temporary employment premium is creating undue competition, especially in the clothing, textile and footwear industries.  If the Government cannot devise an alternative plan, they should complain to the EEC about this hidden perk for British exporters.</P>
    <P>I recommend the new business development programme of the Irish Management Institute.  This programme is aimed at the owners and managers of small industries and is designed to identify profitable means of expanding businesses.  This can be done by import substitution or by increased export activities.  Financial production <Col N="453" /> personnel and marketing plans are necessary for the expansion of those businesses.  I recommend to the IDA that they get as many small firms as possible involved in this and that they encourage management to adopt this course.  It is in developments such as this that we can ensure that small industries stay in existence.</P>
    <P>Local communities can also play a major part in attracting industries and I hope a multiplicity of such industries develops in every regional area. Local people must be receptive to industries coming to their area.  They can play an important part by making their area more attractive to foreign industrialists by ensuring that all services are laid on.  I recommend that the unit of the IDA involved in project identification examine thoroughly the external trade figures issued by the Central Statistics Office.  The unit should examine each item imported and see if it is possible to manufacture any here.  Some items come to mind, wood and cork materials or textile yarn fabrics.  I have no doubt that if the report of that office was examined thoroughly a lot of the items at present being imported could be manufactured here by small industries.  The IDA should carry out this examination immediately because it is only by such a meticulous approach that we can survive.</P>
    <P>I commend the new enterprise development programme of the IDA to give loan guarantees and interest subsidies to first-time industrialists in respect of loans raised to provide working capital.  Many of us have had the experience of Irish people approaching us with ideas but without capital and I hope this Bill will counter that in future.  If an Irishman has an idea that is worth chasing all the resources of the IDA should be placed at his disposal to bring that idea to fruition.  I suggest that a national competition be sponsored by the IDA seeking ideas for new industries.  In Tipperary town some years ago we sponsored such a competition locally and were pleasantly amazed at the many original, constructive ideas that came to us through the competition.  A national competition, with worth-while prizes, would result in <Col N="454" /> many good ideas for new industries. Knowing Irish ingenuity I have no doubt that we would be pleased with the ideas that would emanate from such a competition.  It is not my intention to refer to the Ferenka dispute&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Anything I mentioned relates to the Bill under discussion. The present dispute at the Asahi plant is parallel to the Ferenka dispute.  I urge the unions involved to see to it that we do not have a repetition of what happened at Ferenka.  I hope they see sense and resolve their difficulties and differences soon.  In preparation for major industries going to an area I recommend a project sponsored by the regional development organisation in Mayo, with the technical assistance of the Irish Foundation for Human Development.  In my view such a project could have saved the Schering Plough plant in Clonmel.  I understand that this project involves a survey among school leavers and householders to ascertain their expectations and prepare them mentally and otherwise for the coming of a major industry to a locality.  I understand that local authorities, the health authority, those in charge of schools and factory management are interviewed and their ideas and expectations ascertained.  The environment, natural or man-made, is examined and those involved in the project try to anticipate the nature of change so that people are prepared for the coming of a major industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad that the draft proposals of the EEC to limit and co-ordinate investment incentives are favourable to Ireland at present even though we are limited to £11,700 per job for major industries and £8,500 per job for investments of less than £10 million.  If there is any departure from this by Brussels I urge the Minister to oppose it vehemently.  We know what happened when we were outbid on the incentive table by Great Britain.  They were able to attract Ford to Wales and we were left with less than we anticipated. <Col N="455" /> The Minister should insist that these incentives are allowed to Ireland.</P>
    <P>Finally, I should like to deal with some local problems&mdash;what are local problems today may be national problems tomorrow.  Generally speaking, in south Tipperary we are pleased with the workings of the IDA.  They were successful in attracting a pharmaceutical plant to Clonmel and, but for local opposition, would have gained another major chemical plant.  They grasped every opportunity available to them and were assisted by a good county development team and an efficient county development officer who is forever watchful and awaiting opportunities. In the context of South Tipperary I should like to remind the IDA that agriculture is our greatest asset and that the nine inches of top soil in Ireland is very important.  If we find oil beyond our shores or minerals under the ground they are an added bonus but our greatest wealth is the top soil on our land.  I would urge the IDA to think of that natural resource in any future development, especially in food processing or beef processing. I thoroughly commend them for what they have done in south Tipperary.  I wish them every success in the years ahead.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyKilleen" hpid="Mr. Killeen Mr. Killeen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill is welcomed by every Member of the House. Irrespective of which side of the House we sit on, each of us is committed to the provision of employment for the boys and girls and the men and women of our country.  Over the past three or four years we have seen our unemployment figure soar astronomically. We have seen industries big and small going to the wall or being forced to merge in order to survive.  There were a number of reasons for this.  It could be put down to bad management, lack of proper preparations, inability to compete with other companies producing the same type of material.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is fair to say many of these companies were forced to merge or to go to the wall because of a lack of working capital and, I am sorry to say, in some cases through the failure of our banks to maintain existing borrowings <Col N="456" /> and overdrafts which would have permitted these companies to get over the temporary bad period through which they were going and, in doing so, they would have prevented a great deal of unemployment.  Lest that statement be misunderstood, I want to make it quite clear I am not suggesting for one moment that the banks are responsible for our unemployment situation, but if they had a little more faith in Irish industrialists, and in the Irish economy, I am quite sure a great deal of employment could have been saved.</P>
    <P>In this Bill, the Minister is providing the type of money required, and he is also giving assistance to first-time industrialists who have the knowledge and skill to provide worth-while employment and for whom, up to now, no form of working capital or borrowing was available.  As a result of this infusion of money, a number of small industries will be set up very quickly. We all know the important role small industries play in providing employment. We can see what small industries have done for Germany.  The task of distributing this money is being given to the IDA.  Anybody who listened to the various contributions made by Deputies has no doubt about our confidence in the IDA's competence to distribute this money to provide the employment which is so badly needed.</P>
    <P>I am particularly happy that the IDA can now take up major shareholdings in companies in which they invest money.  While they will not be involved in the day-to-day working of the companies, they will be able to sit in at board meetings and ensure that the money invested is spent wisely. They will be able to foresee any disaster situation which may be arising within a company.  Previously this has happened and we had no knowledge of it until it was too late to do anything about it.  This is a very broad extension of the functions of the IDA.  I am quite satisfied they have the expertise and the experience to accept these powers and to administer the money wisely.</P>
    <P>There is one aspect of the IDA's role which could cause slight concern. They estimate that 50 per cent of the <Col N="457" /> jobs will have to come from foreign investment.  When one looks at the drop in foreign investment over the past few years, one must be concerned about why it happened.  It could be said there was very strong international competition but I would consider it shows a lack of confidence in our economy.  It was very interesting to note in the past week or so that one big company announced their intention to invest a very substantial amount of money in their company here.  Speaking about investment, they made it clear they were doing so because they have faith in the growth of our economy.  There is another foreign company with a substantial investment who also have faith in our economy.  That type of statement will encourage not only our own industrialists but also overseas companies to invest here when obviously a considerable growth in our economy is expected.</P>
    <P>I am very much involved with youth.  I was particularly interested in the Minister's reference to the enterprise development programme.  I would urge the IDA and the Minister to look to our youth and, if possible, to introduce some type of youth enterprise programme.  In Whitehall in Dublin in recent weeks there has been a new development in our vocational school.  It is a form of what they call young enterprise to encourage students to participate in the day-to-day running of businesses, forming imaginary companies and getting involved in the working of those companies, and even manufacturing a product for sale.  This has been sponsored by local companies.</P>
    <P>I am very happy to be indirectly involved with it.  I am very happy the companies in the area were so keen to get involved in helping our youth.  I have great confidence in our youth. They are highly educated and, over the past few years, they had very little to look forward to.  I should like to see the IDA getting them involved in some type of enterprise.  As the last speaker said, there should be an examination of imported materials within our technical and vocational schools. If they were examined closely enough, I am satisfied we could come up with <Col N="458" /> some product which could be used instead of imported products.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, when one thinks about the creation of employment, one must look at our present industrial unrest. While one does not want to get too involved in what has taken place, especially over the past few weeks, one must be conscious that industrial unrest can have a very serious effect on any job creation programme introduced by any Government.</P>
    <P>Five items are necessary for the success of this Bill as I see it.  First, we must have the determination to do the job.  That determination exists on all sides of the House.  We must have the money; in this Bill the Minister is providing it.  We need expertise, and in the IDA we have that expertise.  We need confidence in our economy and obviously, judging by recent statements and investments, this confidence is growing daily.  We can now say there is confidence both here and abroad in the Irish economy.</P>
    <P>We need also industrial harmony. No matter how much goodwill there is or how much money is invested or what expertise we have, if there is no industrial harmony all the other factors can be of no avail.  I have been involved in industrial relations for a number of years and I am satisfied that we have at management, union and worker level a tremendous number of responsible people.  Despite what has happened recently&mdash;I am hopeful that that situation will be resolved satisfactorily&mdash;I am confident that the responsible people I have mentioned will ensure that we will get the industrial harmony we require.  If we do, I believe that the targets the Minister sets in this Bill will not only be reached but exceeded.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesWhile" hpid="Mr. White Mr. White">
      <NameTxt>Mr. White</NameTxt>
      <P>I have always been very vocal about the IDA.  To me the IDA have always been one of the best semi-State bodies.  I have admired their efficiency and the way they have gone abroad to bring more factories and more work to Ireland.  They have many challenging years before them and, as a previous speaker said, the Minister has a mandate from the nation at present to ensure that as far <Col N="459" /> as we are concerned we will not agree in the EEC context to withdrawing or reducing our tax incentives or the percentage of grants we give for our plant, machinery or training of workers.  It must be realised that in order to export much of our products we have to travel further than the other countries. It would be complete madness if we agreed one iota with the EEC on this matter.  We should not be shy to use our veto to ensure that we retain the the tax reliefs that encourage many industrialists to come here.</P>
      <P>All sides of the House agree with the Bill and welcome it.  It is easy to welcome it when most of it relates to amendment of the Principal Act.  The only part of it that worries me relates to assistance by the IDA to developing countries where it says that assistance of a technical and advisory nature may be afforded to developing countries.  I would hope that the IDA would charge the appropriate cost to a developing country in respect of expenses and in respect of any technical personnel or technical knowledge they send out.  I cannot visualise much difference of opinion on the remainder of the Bill.</P>
      <P>When we get a new Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy we sometimes expect new concepts.  I am disappointed that the Minister has not introduced other new incentives that we should introduce at this time to ensure that in the long term unemployment here will fall dramatically.  The wealth of any nation is the wealth of the people living in it and by having 9.5 per cent unemployed at present we have a position which is unacceptable to both sides of the House.  I think the Minister should have introduced a new system whereby grants would be given to service industries. At present no grants are available for bakeries, laundries and other types of service industries.  This deserves consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the west, the south-west and the north-west, grants subsidising transport should have been introduced. Anybody living at a distance from centres of population such as Dublin and Cork realises that it is not enough to <Col N="460" /> give an extra percentage of grant to encourage industrialists to go far away from the population centres.  Deputy Griffin was quite right when he said that the wealth of this country lies in the nine inches of top soil we have.  But we must be realistic and realise that where you had three or four sons working a farm in bygone days, with the present highly mechanised methods of farming one man can do the work.  We should realise there-fore, that many hundreds or thousands of people have to come to the towns and cities; we hope they do not have to emigrate to get work.  If this is the thinking, we must encourage more and more small and large factories in every town, but particularly in the west and south-west where up to this there have been many ghost towns.  It would be an encouragement to offer industrialists a transport subsidy to go further from the centres of population.</P>
    <P>I also believe there should be no social welfare stamp for anybody under 21 but that such a person should get the same social benefits as if he were stamping a card.  We talk a lot about employing youth but any industrialist at present is afraid to take on new young labour in case it would not work out when it costs something over £7 for a stamp.  We expected ideas like this from a new Government.  It is very easy to rubber stamp a Bill like this which has probably been under consideration for the past five or six months.  The strength of this nation must lie in the small industries that we shall give future generations.</P>
    <P>There is another point that is omitted in the Bill and one about which we have been misled.  Even when we were the Government there were things I did not agree with.  I did not agree in the case of the Louth shoe factories that foreign shoes should be permitted to come into this country. There was no way we could stop that under EEC regulations.  Irish delegations abroad and Irish Deputies in the past have been too fearful of using our veto in the EEC.  How is it for instance that concrete products can come across the Border and be sold cheaper than many firms can manufacture them here?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="461" /> Our people need a terrific lead.  I am sorry to say that lead is not coming from a lot of our industrialists, and neither is it coming from the Government, who do not provide sufficient incentives.</P>
    <P>We all felt sorry, regardless of where we come from, about the closing of the factory in Limerick recently.  As far as the IDA are concerned, they have a hard enough job at present to encourage more industrialists to come to this country without the bad publicity that will be given to this nation because our unions cannot agree.  The root cause of industrial strife has been and still is that we have too many small unions here, and the Department of Labour should try to get amalgamation of the different unions.  The employers are not always to blame. We have a great country but over the years we have failed to put our nation first and to co-operate with each other. I hope that the IDA will attain their targets of employment.  I realise that they have a very hard job to do at present.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this Bill. Nobody will criticise this Bill as we all wish it well.  The IDA have done a great job, but unfortunately their job achievements on paper do not appear all that wonderful.  Without blame to the IDA, that is probably because they concentrated too much on multi-national companies.  They may not have given enough attention to smaller industries.  All the speakers have emphasised the importance of the smaller industries and I endorse what has been said.  If four or five people can be employed in a small industry there is a lot to be said for that industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Wood's suggestion that a venture fund should be created to encourage people to use their initiative and to take a chance.  We lost a lot of money in bringing big industries here, because when anything went wrong the industry closed down. They had no interest in staying open. I am not saying that we should not try to attract such industries, but we should place more emphasis on small industries both private and co-operative. Even if the small industries <Col N="462" /> employ only a few people, it will reduce the numbers on the employment register.  A lot of people under 25 are unemployed.  We have an exploding population, which will probably continue for the next ten years.  Unless something is done by the Government in relation to employment young people will lose confidence in democracy. Unemployment is the breeding ground of revolution and violence and in that situation the sufferers would be the people with the money and the property.</P>
    <P>Everybody with money, from the banks down, should seriously consider job creation.  The banks should be asked to plough some of their profits into industry.  Everybody with money, in his own interest if not in the interests of the country, should do everything possible to create employment. I believe that the EEC as a whole should take a serious look at the development of automation and the replacement of people by machines.  If people can do a job as efficiently as a machine, people should be used for the job.  I know there are competitive areas where computers are more efficient and in such instances computers should be used.  The question of shorter working hours and less overtime should also be considered in the interests of employing more people. When listening to a debate in relation to the unemployment situation recently a Deputy, looking very far ahead, suggested that because of the rate of automation and scientific development in years to come we would be trying to keep people's leisure time occupied.</P>
    <P>Speakers over the last four or five days mentioned industries wedded to agriculture.  When I was a younger man I dreamt of these.  We have the raw materials and we should have industries relating to agriculture.  What is happening?  We have the raw material to supply the factories, yet, if industries get into trouble they have to import raw materials.  How is it that our processing plants here are not able to pay a price for livestock comparable to that paid by those who buy it on the hoof and export it and process it abroad?  Whether they are co-operatives of private factories, they are not <Col N="463" /> able to pay it.  This is the raw material which we have at home.</P>
    <P>The State must take some control and ensure that the producers of livestock get a fair deal from the processors. Anybody who is selling cattle under the disease eradication scheme knows that the farmers have no confidence in the factories here.  We know what happened in 1974, and there is a striking example of what we get.  We cannot allow ourselves to be totally dependent on the factories here.  We are not sure that we will get what we are entitled to get from them.</P>
    <P>Speaking to another Bill today, I pointed out that in my area we have a unique situation.  We produce small cattle at our end of the country and we finish them in the east.  We do not sell them so much to factories but I hope that we will develop that.  We have not done so up to the present.  I shiver to think of the treatment that we would get regarding those store cattle if we had no way of disposing of them except to send them to some feeders in the east who will fatten them and send them into the factories.  Let nobody say that because I represent the small farmer I am against processing agricultural produce.  I have dreamt of it, but unless something is done about the processing plants here, no matter who owns them, the ordinary producer of cattle and sheep will have no confidence in them.</P>
    <P>Why is it that we cannot pay as much for the raw material here as can be paid to export and process it abroad?  I would like that question answered by somebody who knows what he is talking about, because in the words of the old saying, I did not come down in the last shower.  I am a long time dealing with farming and I know the treatment which can be meted out to people who are depending on a certain type of trade.</P>
    <P>The banks should be asked&mdash;one Deputy suggested compelled, but I would not like to compel anybody to do anything&mdash;to inject some of their profits into creating employment.  I could speak at length about various matters raised.  Practically everything we can think of has been raised in this debate and this shows that the <Col N="464" /> people are very interested in industrial development.  However, I am a firm believer in being brief and keeping to the point, and I will deal for a moment now with industrial relations without referring to anything that is happening at the moment.  I agree with Deputy White that there are probably too many unions, but there might be a reason for that.  Some of the major unions have got away from the ground floor people and are out of touch.  The people become disgruntled and they start another union.  This is a cause for unrest.</P>
    <P>On the question of management, I come from an area where there are three factories in one town.  It is one of the rules of the factories that from the executive down all the staff dine in the one canteen and if any of the executives is looking for a secretary and he is asked what type of girl he wants he will say &ldquo;We want one who will mix with the staff, who will have lunch with the staff.  Be sure we know what is going on and we are aware of anything that is wrong in that factory before it flares up&rdquo;.  They keep in touch with everything that is happening in those factories, and there are no labour disputes there, thank God.  That is good industrial relations. Deputy White mentioned the shoe factories here.  I am glad to report to him that, whereas nearly all the shoe factories were in trouble, Dubarry Shoemakers Ltd., in Ballinasloe have expanded during the recession. Good salesmanship, particularly selling abroad brought this about.  We have not developed the technique of selling our produce abroad, and this is of vital importance.  I do not mind being parochial.  A lot of people have been so here, but I will not delay the House too long.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not hold the floor too long.  In my constituency there are two towns, Loughrea and Gort, in which factories have closed down and we have no replacements for them.  I hope that we will get something <Col N="465" /> from the IDA.  The IDA find it rather difficult to get factories.  Industrial relations did not help here.  In one of the factories industrial relations were perfect but their machinery was obsolete and therefore they were not able to compete and they went by the board.  I hope that something will be done for those two towns.  A lot of people associate Loughrea with Tynagh mines.  Tynagh mines are eight miles from Loughrea and their life is expected to be about two years more. Therefore it is wrong to associate Loughrea with the mines.</P>
      <P>I will not bore the House with local details except to mention that this is really a national issue.  We can come up here and make grand speeches about it, but when we get down to practicalities I have to point out the obstacles placed in the way of the development of industries which are wedded to agriculture.  I defy anybody to say that the farmers have confidence in the way industrial produce is being processed at present.  No one who has lived on a farm for the last five years will say we have confidence that we will get fair play and the prices we are entitled to.  Nobody would believe him if he did say so.  We must ensure that there is confidence in the factories, co-operatives or private enterprise engaged in the processing of our agricultural produce.  But we have not got that confidence, and it is a pity.  Those are the industries in which there is no fear of a shortage of raw material.  But confidence is needed and it does not exist.  As far as I am concerned that is a very important point to anybody who lives on the land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will strike a note of warning to people with capital, from the banks down, that it is to their benefit and not alone that of the nation that our young people&mdash;and this imposes a grave responsibility on whatever Government may be in power&mdash;must get assistance from the people who have the money. Employment cannot be created without the necessary money.  There is a huge responsibility on the people with the money to put young people in jobs. If not, our young people will become disillusioned.  They will come along in <Col N="466" /> three or four years' time and will say: &ldquo;We have tried them all.  They give us the kick if we do not produce the goods.  We have nowhere to go now. Democracy is finished as far as we are concerned.&rdquo;  They may take the law into their own hands, and then the sufferer will be the person with a stake in the country.  It is up to those people with money to ensure that that day never comes along.</P>
    <P>I ask everybody in a position to help the IDA now to put their money behind them and to have confidence in our youth.  I have all the confidence of the world in them, although I hear people running them down.  To my mind they are the finest.  They may be better Christians than are a lot of the older generation.  I believe they have a lot of concern for their fellow men and, if given a fair chance to earn a livelihood, will respond, giving an honest day's work for an honest day's wages. It is up to us on all sides of the House&mdash;this is not a political football &mdash;to provide jobs for them because, if we do not, we will rue the consequences.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. J. Leonard Mr. J. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>In common with other Deputies I welcome the provisions of this Bill, especially that for the extension of the powers of the IDA to take up shareholdings in concerns that merit it and which meet the Authority's requirements.</P>
      <P>While we welcome it as a means of maintaining and promoting industries and of creating jobs, it would be most disturbing were it to develop into a backdoor for the nationalisation of industries.  I have no doubt that if this provision is sensibly applied it will constitute a great asset in the battle for the creation of jobs.  I would hope also that efficient management would be a major deciding factor whenever a decision was being taken to purchase shareholdings in a concern.  Certainly this method should not be used to prop up any lame ducks; good business practice should apply in the exercise of the considerable powers conferred on the authority in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While most Deputies can make a case for having more industries in their regions, I submit that there is no region that can make a stronger <Col N="467" /> case for itself as can the Border region, which requires special consideration in the provision of employment.  The North Eastern Regional Development Organisation, which covers the counties of Cavan, Monaghan and Louth, according to the last report of the Industrial Development Authority, suffered most.  Therefore one might reasonably expect that it would constitute an area warranting special consideration. I accept that the officials of the IDA are making genuine efforts to get jobs for these Border areas but I do not think that the special urgency of the problem has penetrated fully. Foreign industries are attracted here by the incentives offered them.  If industries are to be diverted to areas such as the Border there must be some additional incentives offered and in this respect also these areas are worthy of special consideration.  Merely talking about the desirability of attracting industries to such areas will not achieve results.  The only way in which results can be achieved is by hard cash.</P>
    <P>Mention was made earlier that the British Government are pumping money into the six north eastern counties.  Whichever Government are responsible, it is essential that the three Ulster counties receive like treatment. There is no doubt but that the more prosperous the counties of Cavan, Monaghan and Donegal, the better will be the case for a peaceful settlement of our national problems.  The average farm size in those counties is small and the soil type one that presents particular problems in farming.  The combined result of those two factors is that a number of the holdings there are uneconomic.  Also there is no doubt that in future the population will drop further, and every effort should be made to ensure that the drop in rural population is kept as low as possible.</P>
    <P>I believe that the only way that can be done is through the provision of small agricultural based industries in those areas.  The people's love of the land means that many thousands of them hold on to small farms even though by so doing they are condemning themselves and their families to a lower standard of living.  The only <Col N="468" /> hope of maintaining a worth-while rural population is through the provision of agricultural employment, coupled with the need to provide additional jobs in industry thereby offsetting the loss of jobs on the land and the further need for jobs to meet an increased population.  Areas with a high rural population and small farm sizes must face this problem.  There have been signs in recent months that cross-Border projects would be funded by the EEC.  The projects that appear to be in mind are concerned mostly with infrastructure.  While we in Border areas are glad of such projects&mdash; and most public representatives have been working to that end over the last few years&mdash;we know also that the services those projects are intended to provide constitute simply the framework.</P>
    <P>I do not want to devote too much time to the northeastern region but the position has been very bad in that area from the point of view of jobs for quite a number of years and an indication of that is the fact that whereas the IDA target for the period 1976-80, was 850 additional jobs per annum the number provided amounted to 76 or 3.6 per cent of the target. Those in the northeastern corner of this island will judge us on our performance but chiefly on the performance in those counties adjacent to the Border. We must sell the suitability of the area and the good relations which exist between all classes and creeds. contrary to some people's beliefs.  A bonus for potential industrialists is the adaptability of the labour force available. Most of this force comes from small farming stock and they have proven very adaptable.  The number of small industries along the Border is a good indication of the adaptability there is.  You have quality furniture, cut glass manufacture, boot and shoe production, tile manufacture, poultry processing and so on.  Industrialists intending to establish industries should be advised of the suitability of the area.  Many people have quite good suggestions to make about industries and identification should take place quickly.  A great deal of research has to be done.  It could be that semi-State <Col N="469" /> bodies are sometimes loathe to make a case for a particular industry and allow the people with the initiative to develop it.  There should be a list of industries suitable to an area available from IDA offices.</P>
    <P>With regard to advance factories, regional organisations should be more active in seeking industries before and during the erection of these.  It is sad to see factories erected and left unoccupied for many years.  That discourages people.  Reference was made to transport subsidies.  In this particular region practically all the railways have been closed and the effects of that closure are now apparent.  Most industries are now dependent on road transport and many of the roads are substandard. There should be an additional allocation from the Road Fund where there is a concentration of industry.  The existing roads in the area are actually subsiding because of heavy tankers and huge containers transporting goods.</P>
    <P>Last week I heard of two young men who are interested in manufacturing farm machinery.  They are doing it on a small scale at the moment.  They have plans for expanding but they will require three-phase power and the estimate they have got is in excess of £12,000.  They can get no subsidy.  They are producing a good product.  They are getting every assistance and encouragement from the development officer and they are hopeful of building a factory, but they cannot face a bill in excess of £12,000 for three-phase power and this looks like being the end of their hopes as industralists.</P>
    <P>Mention was made of products which could be produced here and which are at the moment being imported. In no field is this as obvious as in the field of farm machinery. EEC grant aids have had a big bearing on this.  There is intensified production. Muck and slurry, which constituted a problem, and still does to a certain extent, is now taking the place of expensive fertilisers thereby reducing the farmer's bill.  Farmers are purchasing muck spreaders and manure spreaders.  They get a fairly sizeable grant for this purpose.  The only snag is the volume of imported <Col N="470" /> machinery, an import which is completely unnecessary because we have the skill to produce this machinery ourselves.  We must get across to our people the importance of purchasing home made machinery because in many cases they think the imported product is better.  The sugar company have proved this is not so by producing beet harvesting machinery which is among the best in the world.  I hope that in future we will be able to curtail considerably the importation of machinery.</P>
    <P>I suggest that we should prepare a register of home manufactured articles.  A year or so ago an Army barracks was being erected in Monaghan and the architects and designers, on instructions from the Department and the Board of Works, were not aware that floor tiles were being manufactured in Clones, only 12 miles away.  They recommended British manufactured quarry tiles.</P>
    <P>Agriculture-based industries were mentioned by two Deputies from the other side.  We should not be content until we are processing everything that is grown and produced on the farm and in the farmyard.  In the past few years which were difficult for industry we were well served by our agriculture-based industries, our co-ops, and our pig and beef factories.  They should be developed further because it is within their capacity to process all farm products, including farm animals, so that ultimately we will not be exporting our animals on the hoof.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>This is my first time in the House.  The importance of this Bill has been exemplified by the number of Deputies who have contributed to the debate and spoken about the problems and the need for solutions.  Many words have been spoken and written on the Bill, which broadly deals with the need for improvements not alone in the work being done by the authority but by everybody engaged in the manufacturing industry or those who are considering entering that field.  I hope the Bill will get a speedy passage so that the IDA will be enabled to capitalise on the many opportunities that this Bill affords them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="471" /> Many speakers have concerned themselves with trying to assess the success of the IDA in their main field of activity, that of assisting the development of home industries and of attracting industries from abroad, industries which are badly needed if we are to solve our biggest national problem, unemployment.  I congratulate the IDA on their striking success to date. If I have any criticism of them it is that they have been too conservative in their approach.  They will have to be a little more adventurous if we are to come to grips with this great national problem.  I appreciate they are always looking over their shoulder for likely failures and they are also conscious of the condemnation they might get from this House, as has happened in the past.  It is easy to be wise in retrospect and I would hope the Members of this House will back the IDA to the hilt in their endeavour to attract new industries and to develop home industries.</P>
    <P>I should like to mention their new role in the joint venture scheme, the operation of a project identification unit, a service industries programme and a product and process development grant scheme.  These are measures which the IDA, from their expertise and the experience they have gained during the years, have found it necessary to apply in the present situation.</P>
    <P>The joint venture programme is welcome because many small industries who were not able to make the grade themselves have found partners abroad through the offices of the IDA who have helped them to strengthen their home base and to prepare them for very competitive world markets.  The operation of the project identification unit is also a welcome innovation.  I have seen evidence of research and I was horrified at some of the results thrown up.  It showed that the import bill of this agricultural country touched £200 million last year.  That is a national scandal in a country whose main asset is agriculture.</P>
    <P>If you look around to see the composition of these imports you have only to go into supermarkets in Dublin or in the country to see the <Col N="472" /> many food products that are imported. I saw in a supermarket the other day sponges for the preparation of flans which had been imported in cellophane packets from Germany.  What is wrong with us?  Where are all the bakeries which have been in trouble? Why did they not widen their horizons and develop some of these products?  In one of the industries with which I am associated, £11 to £12 million worth of cans used for processing were imported.  We do not have a can-making factory here and we have to import them from Portadown in Northern Ireland, and with the troubles up there, industries here depending on cans from there have found themselves in jeopardy, not knowing whether they would get next week's or next month's cans.  That is an area where development is badly needed.  It has been thrown up by the IDA process identification unit and it is there for some Irish enterpreneur to take up.</P>
    <P>Black and Decker in Athy manufacture a certain type of workbench, but the tops of these benches are imported.  We have small furniture industries that could diversify into this area if they saw the opportunities.  This is one of the benefits that the IDA project identification unit can bring about and I salute them in their enterprise.</P>
    <P>The service industries are labour intensive and they have suffered badly during the recent recession.  The printing industry has contracted, as have many other service industries.  As more multinational companies come here there will be opportunities in supplying the needs of those companies. I see some of those opportunities in my own constituency. Basically, this was the idea behind attracting such large industries to this country.</P>
    <P>The Bill deals with the project development scheme and this will enhance the situation.  If this had been in operation over the past few years many of the industries that have gone to the wall might not have done so. Two industries in my own area would not have gone to the wall if finance had been available for the research <Col N="473" /> and development necessary to diversify their operations.  Like many other Irish firms, they had not changed their product or their outlook for many years.  This Bill provides that necessary finance and I know that we will benefit from the results in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>I compliment the IDA.  The experience and expertise they have gained over the years in attracting industry make them one of the foremost organisations in the State.  I would say to them that they should not be so conservative in the future; they should be more adventurous.  I hope this House will back them when they have a failure because their failure rate has been very small in relation to their success. It is easy to look back and in retrospect ask why they did this or that.</P>
    <P>The big problem facing us is unemployment. We must examine the situation to see where we go from here and how to get there.  A nation consists of people and natural resources, and therein lies the key for future job creation and future prosperity. There are three primary producers today&mdash;the farmer, the fisherman and the miner.  We have all three in this small country.  We have the farmer with the best grassland in the world and, as Deputy Callanan rightly says, we have not even scratched the surface in developing the full potential of Irish agriculture.  In relation to the fisherman, some people say that we cannot do very much until we know about the fishery limits, but even as it stands we are not developing the potential of our fishing industry.  At a time when we were dumping mackerel into the sea, people in Europe were crying out for smoked mackerel in cans.</P>
    <P>When we joined the EEC four years ago, a new horizon was opened up. We have missed three or four years of development opportunities.  I cannot understand the way in which the previous Government tackled the problems that faced us during that time. Action was needed in various areas but they killed the incentive to work and made it more attractive not to work.  They killed the incentive to invest at a time when investment was needed to provide jobs.  For the second <Col N="474" /> time we saw the flight of the wild geese, but this time the wild geese were the entrepreneurs and investors whose money we needed.  Because of the capital taxation programme, the introduction of which was ill timed, we had not the wherewithal at home to tackle problems, and business confidence was shattered.  This was forcibly brought home to me in O'Connell Street when I saw a sticker on a car which read &ldquo;Will the last businessman leaving Ireland please turn off the light?&rdquo;  That was a clear message midway through the term of the previous Government and I cannot understand why they did not heed that message.  They drove away the entrepreneurs and investors who were so badly needed.</P>
    <P>Deputy Callanan referred to the fact that the development of agriculture is in its infancy and he asked someone to tell him why we still export cattle on the hoof.  I am not replying to his question but I will throw out the little knowledge I have on this subject.  We will need live exports for some time in order to keep up the price for the farmer and to keep the price competitive with the factory.  He asked why the factory cannot pay the same competitive prices that are paid abroad and why we export the raw material to create jobs abroad which are badly needed here.  I believe the answer is that our agricultural industry is still in its infancy.  While I salute the dairy industry in the strides and diversification they have undertaken in trying to supply the market that is there, I cannot say the same about the beef industry and related industries.  I happen to be involved in one of those industries.  When I started it, not that many years ago, people laughed and asked who would feed cats and dogs in Ireland.  I was not interested in feeding cats and dogs in this country; I was interested in the market abroad. The present market in Great Britain is worth £250 million.  That gives an insight into the market that is available for our various products.  I am only scraping the surface.  Until the day comes when we develop and process our own raw materials, our factories will never be in a position to pay the prices and give the return to the Irish farmer that he deserves.  We are commodity <Col N="475" /> selling abroad and this has been traditional in the beef trade because that is the easy way out.</P>
    <P>History has made us a dependent race and we always look to someone else to solve our problems.  Down the country they look to Dublin and to this House to solve the unemployment problem, and of late people are starting to look to Brussels to solve our problems.  Nobody will solve our problems for us; we must find the solution ourselves.  The world does not owe us a living.  We now have greater opportunities than ever before.  We have lost three or four years, but I know that the opportunities are there because I am out in the market and I see them. We are no longer dealing with a market of three million people or the market of 55 million people in the UK.  We have on our doorstep a consumer market of 250 million people.  There is more consumed in the Greater London area than this country could export.  That gives some insight into the opportunities for the development of our agricultural industry.  We had the necessary raw materials but our business confidence was shattered.  I look forward to the next budget when business confidence will be restored.</P>
    <P>Some speakers referred to the lack of venture capital to help the entrepreneur and I agree with them.  I know of people with skills and enterprise that would undertake new projects if they had venture capital.  Although the Irish banks are making large profits, they are not providing venture capital.  It is time for the banks to play a part in our development.  American banks back the man and the idea and our banks back assets and securities.  If they continue to behave in that fashion, private enterprise will fail.  The banks will fail if private enterprise fails, and then they will not have an answer for their share-holders. We are all on trial in this situation and must accept our responsibilities. I put it to the Irish banks that they should face up to their responsibilities and adopt the American system.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that 50 per cent of our future jobs will be provided from abroad and that the other 50 per cent <Col N="476" /> will have to be provided at home.  Our small industries will provide these jobs because they are the seeds from which bigger industries grow.  If we consider the set-up of Irish industries in the past we will see that today's big industries were once small ones.  In Longford most of our industries were started by local people who built them into the sizeable units they are today.  The remainder of our industries were imported and they are very welcome.  It is time to look after our own.  If we look after the small man, the big man will look after himself.  I welcome the provisions of this Bill which will go a long way towards encouraging small industries.</P>
    <P>Section 2 of the Bill provides for grants for the restructuring of Irish industry and nobody would deny that some of our industries need restructuring. It also provides for grants for amalgamations.  Some of the amalgamations that have taken place, particularly in the packaging industry, are not providing the right kind of service. The packaging industry was rationalised but it cannot compete with packaging from across the water.  Irish export industries that have to compete on a level footing across the water find themselves in a dilemma.  They do not know which company to buy from.  Our hearts are in the right place but that will not help us to sell our products in tough competitive markets.  When the chips are down, some of our larger industries can reduce their price.  It may be that their profits were inflated in the first instance.  To help small Irish industries compete on level terms with their co-manufacturers abroad, we must ensure that any new mergers or takeovers do no wreck their chances in this regard.</P>
    <P>In his speech the Minister said:</P>
    <P>In Ireland the volume of new projects promoted by first-time industrialists has been disappointingly small, even though as a country I am sure we have our due proportion of people with the necessary knowledge and skills.  It is clear that in many cases one of the causes of this apparent lack of enterprise has been the inability of the enterpreneur to raise the necessary finance....</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="477" /> There are many skilled and enterprising men but they cannot set up new business without capital.  I know some companies would be prepared to help entrepreneurs by investing capital. What does our taxation system do for them in return?  We know the risks involved in setting up new companies, and if some of our industries are prepared to invest in new industry they are entitled to a fair return for their money.  Some of us go to race meetings and back favourites at short odds.  If we back a long shot we are entitled to a return on our investment.  Many of the long shots that have to be backed in future will have to make a good return to the people who invested their money.  Deputy Callanan called for people to put their money where their mouths are.  I believe that there are many people who would put their money where their mouths are but they should be given a fair return on their investment.  At present our capital gains tax system would deter people from investing in industry.  When the Minister for Finance sits down to work on his budget, he should remember that it is our responsibility to provide the right climate for venture capital.</P>
    <P>We have the resources and can solve our problems if we have the will to do so.  We have a growing and educated population on which many mothers and fathers have spent hard-earned money, but what are they educating them for?  Some months ago I talked to 90 vocational students.  When I asked them what they intended to do when they left school, 85 per cent of them said they wanted office jobs.  We all know that the market for office jobs is poor.  The blame for the emphasis on office jobs must lie with our educational system and the stigma that is attached to the technical school.  The reasons given for sending boys and girls to technical schools was that they were not sufficiently bright to be sent to secondary schools.  To the mother and fathers of Ireland I say that the future is in industry, not in office jobs. I started work as a pen pusher during a recession and I was prepared to take whatever was available at that time. There is nothing more frustrating for young people than sitting around doing nothing.  After a year of idleness <Col N="478" /> they will have chips on their shoulders and will be easily lured into subversive organisations.  As Deputy Callanan remarked in his speech, if we do not solve the problems for these young people who are now educated and who are not prepared to emigrate&mdash;and that I admire them for&mdash;we will be seen to have failed.  The system will be seen to have failed and they will rebel against society.  Revolutions do not grow; they just happen.  The problem is there for us to solve, but we are not helped by the climate under which we came into Government.  However, we have the determination and the will to tackle those problems as they should be tackled.</P>
    <P>I should like to congratulate the Minister and his Parliamentary Secretary on their appointments.  The Minister has spent a lot of time since he took office trying to attract industries here.  He made many trips abroad in an effort to solve some of our problems and, in particular, to the US. The Minister was also quick off the mark in flying to Brussels to try to kill that malicious statement that leaked from that city some months ago to the effect that our tax free incentives would be taken away.  We need those tax free incentives up to 1990.  We need every instrument available to us to try to get around the massive problem we face.  That tax incentive is one of the best ways we have to attract foreign industries.  It is also a fine incentive to encourage young Irishmen into industry to try to capture for themselves a slice of that great market that is abroad.</P>
    <P>The consumer market abroad is huge and I have no doubt that in years to come, as our people move out more, more markets and opportunities will be seized.  Because of the limited amount of time at my disposal I have only seen a few of those markets.  The national problem could not be solved by the Minister or any Government because Governments cannot solve such problems.  Enterprise and markets create jobs.  In their own way the Government can solve some of the problems, as they have done since June.  They created 5,000 new jobs in the only area they could, by adding to the strength of the Garda <Col N="479" /> Síochána, the Prison Service and the health services.  I have no doubt that the Government are encouraging the semi-State agencies to expand as they will have to as the economy grows. However, expanding the economy is no use unless we can maintain the impetus that will carry us right into the eighties to provide jobs.  Many Members, and outside surveys, have made us all aware of the extent of the problem: we must provide 23,000 to 28,000 jobs annually over the next ten years.</P>
    <P>The Government will make their contribution and it is up to private enterprise to make theirs.  Private enterprise is on trial here from now on. Because of their commitment and determination in tackling this problem the Government have thrown the ball into the court of private enterprise, which must now play its part in helping to solve this problem.  I hope the people have the will to solve the problem, because if they do not none of us can do anything to solve it.  Because of the tragedy we witnessed in the last week I hope the national malaise has been cured.  I hope it is recognised that it is good to have a job.  We can all learn a lesson from that situation.  I learned that lesson the hard way because when I went into industry I had to learn it. We must always keep in close contact with the feelings on the shop floor: a sore there should never be allowed fester.  It should never fester into the situation we have seen many times or into the number of unofficial disputes we witnessed in the last 12 months.  Management have their responsibilities as have the workers.</P>
    <P>I hope to see a national commitment to solving this problem by management, unions and workers.  The Government have already displayed their concern.  If we can get this national commitment going together we can make this country a better place to live in for our people and future generations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to congratulate the Minister and his Parliamentary Secretary on their appointments.  People in my constituency <Col N="480" /> are well aware of the abilities of those Members.  I wish them every success in the daunting task of trying to re-establish confidence in industrial development here after the four disastrous years of the National Coalition.  I welcome the provisions in the Bill to introduce new development and I am glad a new enterprise development programme is to be launched.  A lot of work can be done in this field.  In my region a new organisation has been established known as YES, Youth Enterprise of Shannon.  Young people in that region with the help of the development company in Shannon, AnCO, the schools in the area and the banking institutions, will set up a new development programme in Ballycaseymore House near Shannon giving employment to 50 people in the coming year.  I hope any new enterprise development programme the Minister establishes will give attention to the problem of youth unemployment. It is a serious problem here and in the EEC where there are two million young people unemployed.</P>
      <P>In the creation of employment and employment opportunities enterprising young people can play a major role.  In the field of research and development over the last few years we have not had much success. The former Minister for the Gaeltacht, Deputy O'Donnell, speaking on Second Stage, as reported at column 937 of the Official Report of 15th November, stated:</P>
      <P>I believe that science and technology and research and development have failed in the creation of industrial jobs</P>
      <P>I should like to ask that Deputy to outline the record of his Government in the field of research development and in the allocation of funds for such activity.</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="481" /> That Dáil Éireann calls on the Minister for Health to devise a system of differential grants for the mentally handicapped which will take account of the degree of handicap and the extent of home care required; that powers of admission to and discharge from all institutions for the mentally handicapped be under the control of a panel of public health psychiatrists and social workers employed by the Health Boards; that an approved points system be established to decide priorities for admission to residential and day centres for the handicapped, such a points system to take into account (a) the degree of handicap (b) behaviour difficulty (c) disruption of family life (d) family circumstances; and that Health Boards be instructed to undertake their statutory obligations for the care of the mentally handicapped by providing a special annual budget for this purpose.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Haughey)</NameTxt>
      <P>In moving this motion Deputy O'Connell made it clear that he was not seeking a system of differential grants in respect of handicapped children as the words of the motion seem to imply.  For that reason I do not consider it necessary to deal with that particular issue.</P>
      <P>Both Deputy O'Connell and Deputy Boland, however, felt that the present allowance was inadequate.  I am aware that there is some dissatisfaction among parents that the rate of the allowance has not increased since it was introduced in 1973.  I have had representations about this from various groups and individuals including the National Association for the Mentally Handicapped.  I am sympathetic, but any increases in allowances of this sort have to be considered in the context of the budgetary situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The motion proposes a more formal method of admission to and discharge from centres for the mentally handicapped. <Col N="482" /> The suggested procedure would involve a panel of health board personnel and the creation of a points system which, it is argued, would ensure a more equitable filling of places in the various centres.</P>
    <P>I think I should first explain briefly to the House the manner in which the services for mentally handicapped persons are provided.  We have now about 5,000 places in special residential centres and 5,700 in the different day care units throughout the country.  All but a few hundred of these places are in centres owned and operated by religious orders and voluntary organisations.  The right to take the final decisions as to the patients to be admitted to and discharged from these centres has always rested with the management authorities of the different institutions.</P>
    <P>Obviously if the new procedures of the type put forward in the motion were to be implemented, then that right would be taken from these bodies. This would be a serious step with serious implications.  It would represent a complete change of approach and, in my view, would be more likely to bring about a disimprovement in the situation rather than an improvement.</P>
    <P>An essential element in the general running of most institutions is the capacity of the authorities of a particular institution to decide on who should be admitted to it.  It is not very difficult to envisage the effect on the morale and the atmosphere of an institution if that capacity were withdrawn.  It would also suggest that the present arrangements are inequitable and that the authorities of the different centres are being unduly selective in their admission and discharge policies.  I would question whether that is so.</P>
    <P>I am sure that, if there were a general feeling of dissatisfaction among parents and friends of the mentally handicapped about present procedures for admission and discharge, my Department would be aware of it.  They are not so aware.  Furthermore, I have had inquiries made from the health board officers since the Deputies in question tabled this motion and I find that none of them wishes to have the present position changed.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="483" /> At present when a centre receives an application for admission either from a health board or direct from a family, the normal procedure is that the authorities of the centre will arrange for an assessment report.  This assessment is usually carried out by an assessment team employed by the authorities of the centre.  If, on the basis of the assessment, the authorities are satisfied that the patient is suitable for admission his or her name is placed on a waiting list.  Admissions are arranged as suitable vacancies occur.</P>
    <P>I understand that selections from the waiting lists are made on the basis of the greatest need and not necessarily on the length of time on the waiting list.  Obviously, there will be cases in which one person's view of the greatest need will not be another person's.  I would not claim that, in every instance, the right decision is made. It is not always easy to balance one family's anxiety against another's and to say dogmatically where the priority should lie.</P>
    <P>I know that theoretically a good case can be argued for a points system and Deputy O'Connell and Deputy Boland have done so.  However, I feel that, allocating the right priority to a mental handicap person and finding the most suitable and convenient place for him or her, is a much more complex task than the allocation of a house, as some Deputies adverted to yesterday.  I agree that the present method is an unsystematic one but I think it works better than a formalised one would.</P>
    <P>What is important is that the system of selection should not be snarled up by complicated rules and regulations, by the calculation of points or by notional concepts of what constitutes hardship.  It should be flexible, family and personal considerations involved, and the decision should be taken by experienced and compassionate people.  That is what is happening at the moment and I have no evidence to justify interfering with that arrangement.</P>
    <P>As I have said, the health boards are not dissatisfied with the present admission and discharge policies of the <Col N="484" /> voluntary organisations.  In every health board area there is an informal committee consisting of representatives of the health board and of the voluntary agencies providing for the mentally handicapped.  These committees meet from time to time and I understand they are a valuable medium for ensuring close co-operation and coordination between the statutory and voluntary agencies.  They help to remove problems.  They provide a forum for discussing complaints made by the public about the services, including issues about admissions and discharges.</P>
    <P>I might mention here that I plan after Christmas to convene a meeting of senior administrative and professional personnel in the mental handicap services, both voluntary and health board.  This seminar will provide an occasion for a review of our mental handicap needs and our policies and certainly one of the matters for discussion will be our admission arrangements.</P>
    <P>The local committees and conferences of this sort are a better way to iron out any inconsistencies in the policies of the voluntary organisations than waving the big stick at them.  I am not claiming that every decision taken by the voluntary bodies is the correct one.  While there appears to be general satisfaction with the present arrangements, I have no doubt that it will be possible to point to individual instances when a handicapped person has had considerable difficulty in securing admission or has been discharged contrary to the wishes of his family.  I know this happens from time to time.</P>
    <P>When Deputy Boland concluded, I asked him a question but time did not permit him to answer it.  He was talking about a points system and he indicated that he would favour a points system if he could be assured that it would work.  I posed the question whether the points system he had in mind would be of national application, or whether each individual centre would have its own points system. These are important issues.  I could not see a national points system working because then children could be allocated from the convenience point of view to most unsuitable centres.</P>

      <P>I see.  Sometimes a centre will feel it has not got the staff or facilities to cope with a handicapped child or an adult who is very disturbed. Or it may be found in regard to a child in a children's centre that, when he reaches a certain age, the problems of caring for him are so great that it may be in his interest and that of the other patients that he should be discharged.  I am aware that there are difficulties of this sort but I think, in general, decisions are taken in a fair and humane way.  If I had evidence that the position were otherwise, of course I would have to intervene.</P>
      <P>In that connection it is important to try to decide what we are really after in this area.  Surely the primary objective must be satisfactory homes rather than some mathematically accurate points admission system.  If some points system or other system would result in the destruction of a home or interfere with the management's guidance and control of the home, I do not think any of us would wish for that.  It is the atmosphere and the quality of the centre which is important. That should be our primary consideration. The capacity to determine admissions in particular is very important from that point of view.</P>
      <P>One of the main factors which gives rise to suspicion is that when a vacancy occurs in a centre the authorities are often forced to choose a patient of a particular sex, age, or degree of handicap who will fit into the ward or unit where the vacancy has arisen.  This could, for example, give rise to a situation where a moderately handicapped child would have to be given preference over a severely handicapped child, but I think that is inevitable in any system.  We must keep in mind the situation prevailing in the centre.  The authorities of the centre must have the right to take certain decisions in that regard and sometimes, because of the different factors involved, this may result in taking a moderately handicapped child before a severely handicapped one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would hope that nothing said <Col N="486" /> during this debate will give rise to the impression that we are not conscious of our great debt to the religious and lay organisations working in the field of mental handicap.  Previous speakers have all been at pains to emphasise that we are greatly in debt to these organisations.  Voluntary organisations take a notable part in many aspects of our health services but their role in mental handicap is outstanding.  I do not have to remind the House that the task of caring for the mentally handicapped, particularly those who are severely handicapped, calls for very special personal qualities.  It is difficult work and calls for a very high degree of commitment.  It requires a great deal of patience, endurance and compassion if the patient is to be well cared for.</P>
    <P>The voluntary bodies, and particularly the religious orders, have set standards in this field which make our services the envy of other countries. It is well to appreciate and understand that.  Long before the State began taking an interest in the handicapped there were voluntary bodies with staff working interminable hours on limited resources providing the nucleus of the service.  We have built on that service and on the knowledge and experience which these bodies established.  We must not forget what they have done and are doing.  I share what I think was the unanimous view of the Deputies who have contributed to this debate that we are greatly indebted to the voluntary organisations.  I do not agree, however, that we have been unfair or ungenerous to them.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Connell appears to have the impression that the State is, to some extent, prepared to leave to these voluntary and religious organisations the job of providing this difficult, demanding service and that it is not prepared to make adequate financial provision for them.  Clearly, an impartial examination of existing services would readily indicate this is not so. Almost all the capital projects undertaken by the religious orders and lay bodies in this field of mental handicap are financed 100 per cent by the State. Where running costs are concerned, the larger residential centres have their <Col N="487" /> total expenditure recouped direct by my Department on the basis of annual estimates submitted by them.  Sometimes there may be minor disagreements as to what is recoupable but I understand that the voluntary bodies in general are satisfied with the way they are being treated.  Some of the smaller residential centres and many of the day centres receive their grants from the health boards and again I am not aware of any general dissatisfaction with their treatment.</P>
    <P>It is possible that similar sized centres may get different grants. Deputy Boland has referred to this and very rightly indicated that there is sometimes confusion in the public mind as to why this should be.  I assure the House that there is nothing discriminatory in this.  Grants are related to running costs and these vary for a number of reasons.  It may arise from the nature of the buildings, the particular category of handicapped person maintained, the proportion of patients who attend on a day basis, or various other considerations.  But we try to be as fair as we can and we certainly would not wish that any voluntary body should feel that it was being discriminated against.  While the State provides a large part of the cost of running centres for the mentally handicapped today, the religious orders and other voluntary bodies make their own special contribution in the quality of services, in commitment and dedication and in my view that contribution is beyond price and something for which the State could never substitute.  It is important that that should be clearly said and understood by all concerned.  The commitment, the service, the dedication, the compassion and the humanity of the orders and voluntary bodies is beyond price.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Connell referred to &ldquo;50 odd years of indifference to the mentally handicapped&rdquo; and he spoke about an attitude of &ldquo;benign neglect&rdquo; which he said had governed the State's attitude to the problem.  In fairness to my predecessors as Minister for Health I cannot accept that this was the case. Neither can it be said that, because <Col N="488" /> the voluntary organisations have provided the bulk of the services, the State has reneged on its responsibilities in this vital area.  The State has allocated an increasing amount of resources over the years to the voluntary bodies in this field.  Their involvement has been consistently encouraged by the State which felt the special needs of the mentally handicapped would best be met in voluntary-run institutions.  There are many who would rightly maintain that this marriage of State and voluntary organisations is probably the best possible approach to this very difficult and sensitive area of caring for the mentally handicapped.</P>
    <P>The commitment of the State to the development of the mental handicap services can be clearly seen in the substantial build-up over the years of places in residential and day centres. For instance, in 1950 there were less than 1,200 places in residential centres and only a few hundred places in day centres and day schools.  Today we have about 5,000 places in residential centres and about 5,700 places in day centres and day schools.  Few areas in our health services have developed in such a rapid way over the years but in saying this I do not wish to appear or to sound complacent because I recognise as well as any Deputy that a great deal remains to be done.  We have a big problem and it must be overcome.  It will demand a real, positive and definite effort to reach a satisfactory position in this area.  If I outline what has been achieved and the number of places available at present I do so only to rebut the argument that nothing has been done, that there has been what Deputy O'Connell described as &ldquo;benign neglect&rdquo;.  I admit that for many years there was neglect but I also feel that the efforts of a number of my predecessors in this area should be recognised.  Now, it is a matter of going on from there and trying to achieve as near perfection as we can as soon as we can.</P>
    <P>A lot of disappointment, frustration and anger that arises over admission policies is because there are not enough places.  Probably a great deal of the irritation and frustration about <Col N="489" /> admissions will disappear if we have a completely adequate number of places.  I understand that some families could feel annoyed and impatient at the delay in finding places for handicapped persons.  We have not enough places, particularly adult places, in residential institutions.  Deputy Boland spoke very cogently about the necessity in some centres to retain young mentally handicapped persons long after they should be passed on to other institutions.  That is undoubtedly a bottleneck in a number of areas.  I assure the House that this Government have committed themselves to improving the situation and I hope that we will be successful in honouring that promise.  This year about 490 additional day and residential places have become or are becoming available. Almost 900 other places are in planning or at the building stage. Furthermore I have under consideration new schemes which will provide over 1,000 further places and I shall be giving very sympathetic consideration to starting the planning of as many as possible of these schemes next year. The House must realise however that the capital resources at my disposal are limited and there are very great demands on them.  Nevertheless I intend to ensure that there will be a steady improvement in the availability of places for the mentally handicapped, especially for the adult mentally handicapped.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Connell has been critical of the number of mildly handicapped children in residential care and has suggested that they are occupying valuable places unnecessarily.  It is general policy to look after mildly handicapped children in a community setting and this is being done in the vast majority of cases.  Nevertheless there are mildly handicapped children from broken homes who live in the harshest conditions. Their environment and the lack of love and care has created their handicap as much as anything else, and there is no choice but to remove them from that environment.  I am sure that Deputy O'Connell would not wish it otherwise.  There are other mildly handicapped children from remote areas for whom attendance at day centres is not practicable.  Like <Col N="490" /> practically everything else in this area, this is not an open and shut case. Quite a number of mildly handicapped children are maintained in residential centres, but there is no other solution. People involved in this area will explain that very often these mildly handicapped children are the most harshly treated and that they are the children who need the most attention and care because of their family backgrounds, environment and so on.</P>
    <P>The motion asks that health boards be instructed to undertake their statutory requirements for the mentally handicapped by providing a special annual budget for them.  The boards at present set aside a certain amount each year in their budgets to cover the running costs of services for the mentally handicapped.  They also decide what priority to give to new buildings for the mentally handicapped in the allocation of their limited capital resources.  Since the cost of the health services is now met entirely from central funds the boards themselves are not the final arbiters of what should be spent on a particular service.  Decisions in that regard lie with the Minister for Health.  This year about £13½ million will be spent on the operation of special residential and day care centres for the mentally handicapped. It is estimated that about £8.3 million of the expenditure on mental hospitals is in regard to mentally handicapped persons in those hospitals.  An additional sum of £4.3 million will be paid to mentally handicapped holders of the disabled persons allowance and to mothers of mentally handicapped children who are eligible for the domiciliary care allowance.  This brings the total estimate of expenditure this year on mental handicap service to £26 million. Last year it was £21.23 million and in 1975 it was £17.93 million approximately. During the past year hundreds of additional new posts were created in the mental handicap services which will provide additional doctors, nurses, physiotherapists, occupational therapists and others.  The full financial impact of those jobs created in 1977 will not be apparent until next year when they are likely to give rise to increased expenditure of about £2 million.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="491" /> The policy of establishing community workshops for the handicapped in general will also serve to alleviate the pressures for mental handicap places.  I fully support the concept of community workshops.  They are, as Deputies know local based workshops providing a range of work for various categories of handicapped persons.  The aim of these workshops is to fit as many handicapped persons as possible for a working life either in open employment or in continuing sheltered work.  The workshop will provide the sheltered work for those who are suitable for it and for whom open employment is not a realistic alternative. Such a local centre will contribute in an important way to our mental handicap needs.  It will help to maintain some of our mentally handicapped in the community and give them some degree of independence.  I recently had the very rewarding experience of opening such a workshop in Clonmel and I have no hesitation in telling the House that I was very impressed with everything about that workshop.  There are many more like it throughout the country.  I intend to set aside some of the capital resources at my disposal for this type of development.  By so doing I hope to get increased support from the European Social Fund, which is now making substantial grants available towards our handicap services.  It is always very encouraging to know of the number of people in the different local areas throughout the country who are prepared to give their time to this work.  Indeed, it is one of the most encouraging features of this whole problem area.</P>
    <P>I again assure the House that I am very conscious of the needs of the mentally handicapped and I fully realise that there is a major job to be tackled in this regard.  I am glad that Deputy O'Connell and the Labour Party put down this motion because, while I do not agree with what they are suggesting in a number of respects and while we will have to vote against the motion, this discussion has been worthwhile.  It has helped to focus attention on this area.  I hope it will encourage many more people throughout the country to take an interest and <Col N="492" /> to give of their time and energy and join those very dedicated committed people who are already engaged in this area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with my colleague Deputy O'Connell in initiating this debate.  I appreciate the points made by the Minister for Health.  We had a discussion within the parliamentary Labour Party on the services available for the adult mentally handicapped and we received a number of representations in relation to placement procedures.  We felt that the best course of action was for the House to debate it.  If my memory serves me right this is the first time since I entered the House in 1969 that we had an exclusive debate on the mental handicap services.  It is not the intention of the Labour Party to be contentious in relation to this matter.  We feel that this is something on which we must sit down and talk&mdash;in the Department, in the health boards and with the voluntary organisations both lay and religious&mdash;and work out a system for the future.</P>
      <P>I strongly hold the view that existing arrangements either for accommodation or for servicing or for placement are not adequate.  In about five to ten years unless we review now the current arrangements we may find ourselves in a fairly critical situation. I welcome the fact that the Minister intends to have a seminar in the New Year with responsible administrative and other organisations.  It will be welcome because that form of consultation between the Department, the Minister and these organisations is always to be welcomed.  I also hope that in the terms of reference of the proposed all-Party Oireachtas Committee on Health, which the previous Minister for Health decided to establish and which I understand the present Minister intends to re-establish in the very near future&mdash;and on which we will be nominating Deputy O'Connell and Deputy John Ryan&mdash;very special attention will be devoted to a review of the services for the mentally handicapped.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My concern for the future is the extent to which the voluntary organisations, both religious and lay, will be <Col N="493" /> capable of dealing with the growing problem.  I have the utmost admiration for the voluntary organisations.  My sister teaches mentally handicapped children.  In my constituency I have a fair degree of contact with the St. John of God Order and I have the utmost admiration for their work.  But repeatedly more and more representatives of the voluntary organisations come to me and say &ldquo;It looks as though in about five years' time, particularly in relation to the handicapped, we, despite our work, are going to be in trouble&rdquo;.  We have seen the signs of that, where pressure has been brought to bear on parents, on families, on individuals and on organisations.</P>
    <P>At the stage where children reach the age of exit the pressures are there for alternative residential accommodation for the adult mentally handicapped. I am concerned about the extent of such accommodation and I am not entirely reassured by the Minister's indications here in relation to capital expenditure for 1978-79.  I brought great pressure to bear on the former Minister last year and this year.  Deputy O'Connell remembers the pressures we brought to bear on our colleague for a greater capital and budgetary allocation generally.  There was a measure of improvement.  The Minister has indicated that this grew from £21.23 million to £26 million in 1977.  We had various other improvements such as the percentage increases in the disabled persons' allowances, mentally handicapped allowance and so on.</P>
    <P>These improvements more than kept pace with inflation.  However, I know the pressures which will face the Minister for Health in the next 12 months and in the budget discussions which he will be facing in the next two months with his colleague.  These pressures tend to push out the legitimate demands for increased expenditure in this field.  The pressures in the Department of Finance for economic and social development in other areas push the demands into the background.  I know the capacity of the Minister to have an entrée into the Department of Finance in terms of demanding more money, but I want to <Col N="494" /> express a worry that, notwithstanding the moneys which he will manage to get from the Department, they will still not be sufficient in 1978-79.  These are our prime concerns in this debate.  I am sorry that, despite guarded references by the Minister to the projected capital works for 1978, he is not being explicit in that regard.  He may elaborate in January and we may get more information in the budget.</P>
    <P>I bear in mind the principle point which is made to us by many of the organisations involved.  A number of them, including religious orders, have been coming to us over the past few years and saying &ldquo;We never envisaged having the problem of adult mentally handicapped facing us in addition to our work at present.  We will not be capable of controlling the situation, we will not be capable of dealing with it&rdquo;. On that basis, despite their outstanding work, their concern is something we have to take cognisance of in this debate.  As a result a degree of acrimony, emotion and parental frustration can build up in relation to the placement system and can build up to such a degree that the pressures evolve around the formulation of an alternative placement system.  It would be far more productive and far more conducive to better services if we could have additional money spent on the extension of residential facilities, both day and fully residential.  On that basis we could meet the growing needs.</P>
    <P>These are the only comments I wish to make in support of Deputy O'Connell.  The word used by him, &ldquo;indictment&rdquo;, is legitimate.  Over the years we politicians have been quite happy to pass the buck of the care of the mentally handicapped to the lay organisations.  We have been happy to pass the buck to the religious organisations and they do the administration and we provide State funds.  But otherwise we tend to be reluctant at departmental level to get too deeply immersed in the overall formulation of a national policy.  That is not going to hold good for the late 1980s and 1990s. These organisations inevitably have their limitations.  They have their staffing problems.  Areas of duplication, overlapping and inter-organisational conflict tend to develop which can be <Col N="495" /> resolved in the final analysis only by the Minister for Health of the day.  I think he will be surprised at his seminar in January to find the extent to which these organisations will be looking to him and his Department for guidance.  We should not withhold that guidance.</P>
    <P>In the Dáil, unfortunately, we get little opportunity of talking about these issues.  We perhaps have a Health Estimate once a year or a Supplementary Estimate now and again, a Private Member's Motion occasionaly or a few intermittent Dáil questions.  The proper forum for a discussion of issues of this nature would be such as we had in the Select Committee on the Misuse of Drugs Bill where there was direct discussion between the former Minister and the present Minister, and on that basis we could tease out the issues.</P>
    <P>On that basis we can tease out the issues in a frank and open way with the exchanges recorded formally and published in the Official Report.  I would hope that the many Members of this House who have a deep interest in the problems of the mentally handicapped would have an opportunity of participating in the All-Party Committee on the health services the Minister will establish, when he may be assured that the Labour Party and my colleagues will contribute fully.</P>
    <P>Since I wish to hear the views of other Members of the House who have far greater knowledge than I on matters of this nature and since I can have only a lay politician's involvement I shall confine my comments to that extent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened with very considerable interest to the discussion on this motion in relation to the provision of adequate care, treatment, training and accommodation facilities for the mentally handicapped.  It is right that we should have a discussion of this kind here.  Having listened to the debate I feel sure that the views expressed by the various Members who have contributed will be helpful to the Minister in the formulation of his future policy in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="496" /> I should like to commence my short contribution by commending Deputy Dr. O'Connell for having put down the motion.  It is worthy of very serious consideration and, at this point in the discussion, it is right to say that it has received very serious consideration.</P>
    <P>I have been most impressed by what the Minister for Health had to say to us here this evening; it coincides almost exactly with what Deputy John Boland said last evening; his views, I believe, represent those held by Fine Gael in this respect.  However, this is not a party matter.  It is a matter about which the House generally is concerned, one in respect of which all of us want to arrive at the right decisions and always want to do the maximum for handicapped people of whatever grade, or from whatever part of the country they happen to come.</P>
    <P>It is very unfortunate that what has come through the media and the publicity we heard and read of today gives the impression that Deputy Dr. O'Connell did nothing but criticise what was being done up to now, and that in fact he said nothing was being done.  I suppose people, when making their case, often overstate it.  There has been an element of over-statement in the circulars we have all received.  I am not criticising people who want to do the right thing but who are quite deliberate in overstating the situation in order to draw people's attention to the matter in which they are interested.  I know that these people are well-intentioned; I know that Deputy Dr. O'Connell is very well-intentioned in putting down this motion.  I do not agree with everything he says in the Motion.  Indeed, were there a vote on it I would not vote for it; I could not vote for it with the experience I have in this field, and I have some little experience. I have had some responsibility for the setting up of at least one unit for moderately mentally retarded people and I am a member of the board of another institution with a large number of seriously retarded people. Therefore.  I have had some opportunity of seeing at close quarters what is happening.  It is altogether wrong to say that nothing has been <Col N="497" /> done.  An immense amount has been done in recent years.  The Minister was quite correct when he said that, for a considerable time, there was neglect in this area and very little done.  But, in the last five to ten years, there has been considerable progress made; after all, Rome was not built in a day. We must have some little patience if we are to do the job properly.</P>
    <P>From time to time over those years excuses have been offered&mdash;I say that deliberately&mdash;to cover up the fact that money was not readily available.  What was being said was that we had not enough trained personnel, but that is not a sufficient explanation of why there is not more provision.  I will give the House an example of an experience I had some years ago.  I called to a house where there were ten children, the eldest of whom was aged 14.  The father had a job that kept him away from the home for the whole week, returning only at the weekend.  The mother of that family had to contend with a child of five years of age, a very troublesome, mentally retarded child, and there was no place that child could be got into.  To tell me there were not trained people to take care of a child of that kind is not acceptable.  Any nurse with general training&mdash;and there are sufficient of them in the country&mdash; would certainly have been able to do more for that unfortunate child than a mother who had ten children to look after at the same time.  There are quite a number of these cases. If our people were brought face to face with them I believe they would be very much concerned.  But we have the case of the institutions that are suitably equipped to deal with children; we have the institutions suitably equipped to deal with severely handicapped patients.  We also have those equipped to deal with the moderately handicapped.  I agree entirely with the Minister when he says that the decision as to what type of patient is suitable for a given institution should be left to that institution.</P>
    <P>I do not think there would be any serious objection to a points system being set up or to having the panel Deputy Dr. O'Connell described.  There may be occasional cases in which <Col N="498" /> there is some little discrimination in favour of somebody, in which there is an immense amount of pressure brought to bear or where there is extra influence but it is a very rare thing.  It would be wrong if anybody got the impression that this is the general attitude of people who concern themselves, all day every day, with mentally retarded people, that they would take in patients according to the amount of pressure or influence used.  It would be a very exceptional instance.  We should not set up a board merely because this occasional thing happens.  I would be extremely afraid of killing the interest, initiative and concern of the people who have been so dedicated over the years and who have done so much in this area, if we take this responsibility from them; it is because they have responsibility their interest is alive and will remain so. They should not be surrounded by a set of rules and regulations that would hinder them.  I know that is not Deputy Dr. O'Connell's intention; I know he does not want that type of bureaucracy but he is convinced that a problem exists there.  He seems convinced that the problem is much larger than it is. I would say it is very small indeed. When he was speaking last evening I was afraid that that was the aspect of what he had to say that would come over in the newspapers and the media generally.  Unfortunately that is what happened.  That is not being fair to Deputy Dr. O'Connell because, in many ways, his views coincide with those expressed by other speakers in the course of this discussion.</P>
    <P>My experience has been mainly in the provision of accommodation and workshops for the moderately handicapped. I should like to say something about this aspect.  Deputy Boland made the point that it was important to have these people working with the mentally retarded in, so to speak, the whole of their health.  This is very true.  There must be a percentage who are not themselves handicapped working with them.  I have had some experience in this field.  I remember going around with a group looking at what people were doing in this field both here and elsewhere.  Generally speaking, these people were producing products <Col N="499" /> no one wanted and then others were being blackmailed into buying these products at sales of work and so on.  One of the things we were determined to do was to ensure that these people produced something others had to buy.  We were determined to ensure that the products were delivered on time and that we would be able to give that guarantee to customers good enough to support us.  The project eventually set up has worked extremely well and quite satisfactorily. Now that I have this opportunity I should like to thank those cooperating in providing suitable work for these workshops and thank also the people who purchase the products produced.  In my approach to the latter I was always met sympathetically. The only condition they made was that the goods should be delivered on time and be up to a certain standard.  That is understandable because people could not stay in business without a guarantee like that. Workshops will not be successful unless they are run on these lines and there must be enough people in the whole of their health with a suitable temperament working with the mentally handicapped in order to get the results essential to keep the workshops going properly.  Experience has shown that it is possible to do that.</P>
    <P>In regard to the points system of admission and discharge and the differential grants, I agree with the need for differential grants according to the category of patient.  This is already being done.  The Minister gave the reasons.  They get more, or less, for providing the accommodation, care, treatment and training of patients.  I use that word but when speaking of the moderately handicapped I do not think we should call them &ldquo;patients&rdquo; and we should not talk about hospitalisation. These people should be treated the same as any other worker and they should go out every day to work at the same time as other workers. They should have comfortable and adequate accommodation.  It is all very well to talk about getting those who have worked in workshops out into the community, but that is more difficult than many seem to think.  It <Col N="500" /> is amazing how well they seem to be getting on as industrial workers in workshops but the number who can compete outside is quite small.</P>
    <P>One of the drawbacks of the fund is that one gets nothing unless one is getting these people out into the community to work in the community. The Minister should use his influence to have this part of the regulation amended because the concept is quite wrong.  I have read a good deal of literature from Sweden and elsewhere about the patients' own views and the way in which patients progress because they were kept in certain environments and so on.  If patients were able to express themselves in that way they were no longer mentally retarded. My conclusion is that it is someone drawing on his imagination when I read this sort of stuff.</P>
    <P>Again, in the assessment of mentally retarded people you get this glib talk about I.Q.  What is I.Q.?  I think it is a very difficult thing to measure.  I believe it is vital to have a variety of jobs.  You can take in a mentally retarded person and try him at one, two, three or four jobs and it is only when he comes to the fifth or sixth job that he is attracted.  It is very rewarding to see someone, able to do nothing as far as one could judge, suddenly succeed because attention is attracted.  The great thing about these people is they do not suffer from boredom.</P>
    <P>I agree, with certain reservations, to the setting up of a panel that would look at the system of admission.  I do not think there would be any serious objection to it, but I do not think it is necessary.  I certainly do not agree that discharges should be regulated by a panel.  Discharges can best be arranged by collaboration between staff, parents and guardians.  Sometimes urgent discharge is necessary from institutions.  The necessity for such a discharge may be apparent only to the staff who are close to the people and who understand the damage that could be done either to themselves or other patients.  A distant body regulating such things would be more of a hindrance than a help.  Take the case of a patient subject to violent outbursts.  Such a patient could <Col N="501" /> possibly be easily managed by his parents but could not be looked after in an institution providing a limited service.  We must be very, very careful.</P>
    <P>What we should be doing is assuring those who led in providing accommodation, care, treatment and training for these people that we are not being critical of their efforts and, when he is replying, I am sure Deputy O'Connell will do this.  I suppose what we are asking for is a general review in the light of our experience in recent years, and it is only in recent years. We should be looking for general review arrangements all the time.  We admit that the attendance of a doctor would be a distinct requirement in a discussion of this kind, but even experts should be questioned and that is why I question some of the things proposed and recommended in the motion.</P>
    <P>The voluntary people who have worked in this field for a long time should know that we appreciate what they have done and that is why our words here should be words of commendation and appreciation of them. We should let them know we are prepared to support them and I believe the Department of Health are giving them a great amount of support.  As the Minister said, the Department are paying the bill, but that is not all. Whenever the Department are approached in regard to a problem they come along and do whatever they can to assist people in those institutions. However, this is not enough. The foundations that have been laid can be built on and progress can be more rapid in the next few years than in the past.</P>
    <P>I would issue a word of warning, from the little experience I have had. I would warn against the building of large units because I think it would be a bad thing to do.  People would become numbers.  This kind of care and treatment must be fairly intimate and I would say that units to cater for between 250 and 300 patients should be the biggest.  I suggest that it is wrong to put units in psychiatric institutions or close to them, but it is a good thing <Col N="502" /> to have such units close to hospitals because though the patients are not sick in the usual way they will have the ordinary ailments from time to time and it is better to have treatment facilities and doctors to prescribe for them as close as possible.</P>
    <P>However, there is still the stigma, the distinction between the psychiatric and the mentally retarded patient. Therefore a psychiatric institution would be the wrong place in which to set up a unit for the mentally retarded. I have looked at this problem in the constituency I have represented for a long time and I know the feelings of the people there.  Far from being dissatisfied with the way members of their families are being treated in existing institutions, they could not be more grateful or appreciative.  On many occasions I have had discussions with these people and they have expressed relief and pleasure at the way members of their families were being treated.  There are mothers among them who almost weep when they see members of their families who come home for weekends almost crying in their anxiety to get back.  This is not a reflection on their families but the company and the little element of excitement in the institutions.</P>
    <P>What we need are more places, not additional rules and regulations.  Far too many people are critical.  Many of the people who do all the talking do damn all else.  There are people who criticise and condemn everybody but if you ask them to buy a ticket for a cause they will not put their hands in their pockets to give a bob.  I do not pay much heed to the people who do all the talking because they do not take hand, act or part in improving the situation.  I again add my voice of appreciation for the people who have led the field in this area and I can assure them of my fullest co-operation and help.</P>

      <P>Although I do not agree with everything in the motion, I compliment Deputy O'Connell for introducing it because it has led to a discussion on the mentally handicapped which has been at a high level. Because of the brief time at my disposal I do not intend to go right <Col N="503" /> through the field, but there are a few points I should like to make.  In the care of the mentally handicapped we have a combination of the State, through the health boards, the voluntary organisations and the National Association for the Mentally Handicapped. As well, there are the religious.</P>
      <P>I do not agree with Deputy O'Connell that the State has failed. Last year the State spent almost £26 million, a fair amount, which proved the State has not failed.  Indeed it has played a very big part, particularly since the commission reported in 1965.</P>
      <P>The most important point to remember in planning services of this kind is assessment, and it is therefore important that in every health board area there should be an assessment team under a director of community care or a director of mental handicap.  Such an assessment team should have a psychiatrist, a psychologist and a social worker.  I should like to see such teams standardised so that they could work in harmony and at the same level, so that priority lists in different areas would indicate the children with prior necessity to be in care.  In my constituency there are nine different methods of assessment.</P>
      <P>We need to have priority lists to ensure that those who need care will be in care and the recommendation of Deputy O'Connell, I suggest, would not work as efficiently or to the same extent as having assessment teams within local communities.  The benefit of the advice of assessment teams has not been available to school managers and this should be standard practice in the interests of the children concerned, because this is necessary for the benefit of the education of the child.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another point on which I do not agree with Deputy O'Connell is that all moderately mentally handicapped people should be in residential care. We have ample proof in our communities that moderately handicapped children are very happy at home and their parents are happy to have them there.  They can travel to schools and in my own area they travel 20 miles a day to a school and it works very <Col N="504" /> well.  There are some children who are difficult to handle at home or perhaps home circumstances are not suitable and these children should be in residential care.</P>
    <P>The number of sheltered workshops throughout the country is growing, mainly through the efforts of the National Rehabilitation Board and the Rehabilitation Institute.  In rural Ireland there is a transport problem and the Minister might look at this at some stage.  Obviously there cannot be a sheltered workshop in every town but where there is a distance to be travelled it is important that transport should be available.  The same would apply to children attending day care centres in schools for the mentally handicapped. I gather that while the Department of Education have an agreement with CIE to transport children to the educational facilities in the schools, this facility does not extend to children attending the special care units, health care units, because the Department of Health do not have this sort of agreement.  They are carried on the bus if&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The point on residential care is an important one. It has to be looked at very carefully. It would appear at present that there are a number of people in residential care who would not have been there had there been day care facilities in the past.  I believe the emphasis in the future will be on community care and because of better day care facilities there will be less and less need for these people to go into residential care.  In this context, if new beds are created for residential care, rather than thinning out the population within the residential care units some children should be taken from the community. Two great problems are the waiting list for some severely handicapped children and the overcrowding of residential care facilities for adults.</P>

      <P>This has been a very interesting debate and certainly the contributions have been very helpful. If it has done nothing else, this motion has highlighted the fact that we must examine very carefully the whole problem of mental handicap.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Health must bear in mind that he and his Department do not have a monopoly on wisdom.  We in the Opposition have a role to play. We must not be destructive in our approach or in our contributions to debates.  If any motion or suggestion emanates from the Opposition there is an obligation on the Minister to weigh it up seriously and not to reject it out of hand.  We have a lot to contribute. Last week when amendments of mine were tabled the Minister rejected them but put them down under his own name.  We must put a stop to that petty, party-political approach.  We must be statesman-like in dealing with Bills in this House and the Opposition have an important role to play.  There will be other motions. The Minister should consider whether the Opposition might be right.  The same thing applied when the Coalition were in power.  Many useful contributions came from Fianna Fáil when they were in Opposition.  I earnestly ask the Minister to take this into consideration so that the Opposition may play a useful role in the governing of our country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Concerning the mentally handicapped, the Minister has said that perhaps I have been a little overcritical of the facilities provided.  I went to visit St.  It's a few years ago and I saw a temporary building erected in 1902 for the workmen involved in constructing the main building.  There were 96 mentally handicapped women in one dormitory with two open toilets. The Minister for Health was a member of the Government which tolerated that.  I am not exaggerating about this and when I wanted to highlight it they banned me from attending again.  The Department of Health stand indicted. When I said that it was benign neglect it was much worse; it was criminal complacency.  They played ducks and drakes with me in my appeals to have action taken.  One of the Minister's predecessors laughed scornfully when <Col N="506" /> I told him about the situation, but he would not visit the hospital and see for himself.  I would ask the Minister to visit a few of these places before he says that everything is all right with the facilities for the mentally handicapped. These people are human beings and we must treat them properly.  What I saw was a disgrace and a shocking indictment of our country.</P>
    <P>The points system I have suggested was asked for before.  The committee on mental handicap of the Eastern Health Board asked the society of social workers who were involved in mental handicap to consider a points system because they felt that the present system was not satisfactory.  I ask for some points system based on the degree of handicap, the family circumstances, the behaviour of the child and the destruction of family life, with a report provided by an independent psychiatrist.  Points would be awarded to the child and the mother would know when the child would be admitted.  Deputy Clinton said that the voluntary bodies might not like that; they might not.  They are not concerned with admission.  Their vocation is dealing with children and they are not concerned which child they get. They will care for them all.  They are not there to decide whether they like the look of a child.  It does not matter.</P>

      <P>They will deal with the mentally handicapped based on the points so that it is seen as a just and equitable system.  It is a flexible system but it may be modified.  I am suggesting the principle so that people will know the position of their child on the list.  They do not know this at the moment.  This should be operated in each health board area.  It will also give the health board lots of information about the number of mentally handicapped people in their area.  When the points have been allotted they can tell a mother that her child will not be admitted for a year and enable her to make arrangements in the meantime. I have tried to get children admitted and have been told that there was not a hope.  When I asked when there was <Col N="507" /> likely to be a chance they told me they did not know.  Is the Minister for Health satisfied with that?  If he is, then I am sorry that I put down the motion.</P>
      <P>The Medico-Social Research Board carried out a survey in 1974 and they found that there were about 1,300 mildly handicapped children in residential care who should not be there. Dr. Michael Mulcahy, who is the chief doctor in Stewart's Hospital, said they should not be there.  It is not good for a mildly mentally handicapped child to be put away with moderate, severe and profoundly mentally handicapped patients.  Because there is no points system these patients are getting in ahead of those who need residential care.  More than 1,300 places have been taken up by these patients and there is no medical need for it.</P>
      <P>It has been said that we need more places and that was my reason for saying that we needed a budget for each health board.  Now the Minister says his Department decide the budgets not the health boards, but I disagree with the Minister.  I was a member of a health board and I thought the health boards decided their budgets and submitted them to the Department for approval.  The Department do not decide the priorities as it is the function of the health boards to do so and is the function for which they were established.</P>
      <P>The health boards should be given a directive to give priority to budgets for the mentally handicapped so that in eight or ten years' time we will know that we can provide sufficient places from our waiting lists.  Surely that is not too much to ask.  We must have a target.  There is no point in dealing with the problem in an arbitrary way.</P>
      <P>I have seen the suffering of mothers of large families with mentally handicapped children.  The mothers are not able to cope and they have no hope whatsoever.  I accept that a points system can be subject to modifications and that that can be done by consultation with the voluntary bodies.  I am not suggesting that we supersede the voluntary bodies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="508" /> I do not like bureaucracy in any form. These children should be assessed and points awarded to them on the basis of the assessment, and this should be done in each health board area.  The suggestion should not be rejected because it comes from me or from the association for the mentally handicapped. The parents of the mentally handicapped children understand the problem and have asked for this system.  The social workers have submitted a set of proposals and have suggested that the scheme could be introduced on a pilot basis.  I do not believe we should reject their suggestion on the basis that we know better. I know the Minister's views on this matter and he has decided to reject it. However, something has been achieved.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked for permission to raise this matter to ensure that the cheap butter under the EEC scheme would be equitably distributed.  I thank the Ceann Comhairle for giving me the opportunity to discuss the matter.</P>
      <P>Under Commission Regulation, 2370/77, 65,000 tons of butter, part of the now notorious butter mountain, is being distributed among the member states at a subsidised rate.  According to the regulations which apply here, under Instrument No. 362 of 1977, the maximum price set here is 29p per lb, and the regulation provides that distribution must not start before 2nd December.  The official designation, under subsection (2) of Article 5, is &ldquo;Christmas Butter&rdquo;, which is appropriate and seasonal. Santa Claus has come prematurely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are now within a few days of the commencement of the distribution of this Christmas box and people are still at a loss to know how it will be distributed.  The Government have not done much to ensure the equitable distribution of this 2,000 tons of butter, which is a substantial amount.  I read in this morning's newspapers that a large city supermarket propose to issue coupons to their customers, pointing out that they would allow 1 lb. of butter per coupon per person.  While the supermarket must be congratulated on their approach to the matter, such an approach is open to abuse. I am told that an advertisement appeared in last week's newspapers to the effect that any customer who bought £5 worth of groceries in a particular <Col N="510" /> place would get a pound of butter for 29p between the 2nd and 9th December.  This is another example of abuse.</P>
    <P>When the distribution of surplus butter arose during the lifetime of the previous Government, they applied a system whereby the recipients would be those in receipt of social welfare benefits.  It may not be the ideal system but it is preferable to a free-for-all which will be the case now.</P>
    <P>I should like to point out that Deputy Clinton, when Minister for Agriculture, fought tooth and nail to have this surplus distributed under the social welfare butter system which applied some years ago.  He wanted the butter distributed in that manner until the surplus was used up.  I am forced to the conclusion that the Government are afraid to grasp the nettle in this case with the result that all sections of the community are expected to get portion of the butter but, in practice.  I doubt if that will work.  One is left wondering what the Government's attitude is to the needy sections of the community such as old age pensioners, widows and those in receipt of disability and unemployment benefits. Those categories come within the ambit of social welfare and if the system I referred to earlier was applied now they would get their fair share of the butter surplus.  Can the Minister or the Government justify a system whereby families with discretionary incomes, who are in most cases the better-off members of our society, are placed in an advantageous position and given a greater opportunity to avail of this offer than our less fortunate brethren? The old age pensioner with an utterly inflexible income finds himself at an enormous disadvantage in this case. The person who owns a freezer will be in a position to gobble up this surplus in no time while the individual who cannot afford a freezer can only purchase the normal current consumable amount because he cannot afford the luxury of storage.</P>
    <P>I should like to draw the attention of the House to a study carried out by the National Prices Commission concerning the elderly in our society.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="511" /> That survey revealed that in the region of 40 to 50 per cent of such people suffer from different degrees of malnutrition due mainly in many cases to lack of income and the lack of nutritional content in the food consumed. Taking those factors into consideration one would have expected that the Government would have taken action to ensure that fair play would be seen to be done and that the people most in need would get the lion's share of what would be given out.  Is it not true to say that the action of the Government is in line with their approach in the recent past? The Government got a substantial mandate from our people to govern because of the attractive packages contained in their manifesto.  They proposed the abolition of rates and a so-called abolition of car tax but the principle behind those is that the person who gains most from that approach is the person with two or three cars living in a mansion.  The person owning a small house gains least because it is likely that such a person cannot afford a car.  The same approach and the same philosophy applies to the distribution of this surplus butter.</P>
    <P>The Government had a golden opportunity in this instance to redress the imbalance and show some concern for the less well-off sections of our community.  However, they failed to recognise that there is in society different strata and that because of circumstances, many of them financial, people are not equal.  What did they do?  They took the easy and lazy way out by doing nothing with regard to the distribution of the butter.  In deciding not to do anything they have played into the hands of the unscrupulous selfish people.  Those people&mdash;I accept they are in the minority&mdash;can render a scheme of this nature useless and see to it that the goodies go into the wrong baskets. That will be the end result of the lack of action on the part of the Government. The directive issued by the EEC mentions the requirements as to packaging and identification.  It states that the butter shall remain in its original packing until it is cut up in <Col N="512" /> small packages and that it shall be accompanied by a list of packages enabling the butter to be identified and specifying the date of removal from storage.  The directive also states that packages containing butter in bulk are cut up into small packets and shall carry letters at least two centimetres high of one or more designations and the one which applies to us is that the butter at the reduced price is in accordance with regulation No. 2370/77.  That is the minimum requirement for identification of butter coming to us through the scheme but that in itself is open to abuse.</P>
    <P>I must emphasise that in all walks of life there are people who will exploit, abuse and cause damage by their exploitation and abuse.  Some people will endeavour to rewrap this butter.  It will be stated that it would not pay such people to do this because repacking is an expensive exercise but it should be remembered that there is in the region of 25p per lb to play around with.  Financially it could be a worth-while and profitable exercise for the minority of unscrupulous people who might be tempted to do this.  Under the directions in the directive there is no way under the statutory instruments or the directive one can detect this except by chance through the inspectorate.  On the question of the butter surplus I understand that the dairy industry in general are opposed to the distribution in this manner of the surplus.  The Irish dairy farmer is more annoyed in that he has not contributed even 1 lb to this surplus and I understand that at no time in the past did they contribute to the surplus.  Our annual butter consumption is in the region of 36,000 tons which is a very large volume.  The volume of Christmas butter, as it is called, is 2,000 tons.</P>
    <P>While I appreciate the fears expressed by the dairy industry that it will upset their marketing and upset the industry in general, I believe our portion of the overall volume of the surplus butter, which is 65,000 tons, is very meagre indeed.  The logic in all this escapes me, because it would seem that the countries who contribute most to the butter mountain, as <Col N="513" /> it is called, are the countries who complain most about its existence. Secondly, from the list I see here, they are the people who get most out of it.  In other words, they are the greatest recipients of the butter mountain.  To me the logic of that is that it pays them well to ensure that a butter mountain will continue to exist.  When the share out comes, they get the lion's share.</P>
    <P>The Christmas butter is welcome.  I should not like my statement to be misinterpreted.  The distribution of the butter may not turn out to be fair and equitable.  What I fear is that on 2nd December, which is only a few days away, there will be an ugly scramble at shop doors for cheap butter.  I do not think the Minister would welcome that.  Nobody could be in favour of it. It is unfair to place the onus of fair distribution on the traders.  While many of them will try to ensure the fairest possible results, I do not think they can possibly carry out this function equitably.</P>
    <P>It is not fair to the needy sections of our community to allow a free-for-all. They will find themselves on unequal terms with people who have the resources to store the butter.  While all types of schemes may be operated by traders to try to ensure fair distribution, we all know there are many ways in which they can be circumvented. Families can send people in to get butter even though traders will try to ensure that they supply only 1 lb of butter per person.  There are permutations and combinations which could go on for a week which would ensure large quantities of butter finding their way into one house, or one freezer.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to intervene and draw up a scheme, even at this late stage, which would ensure the fair distribution of this surplus butter. To my mind, he has an obligation to the people who gave him a mandate to do this.  I would ask him not to be afraid to grasp the nettle.  If he offends a small section of the community I suggest to him it is for the common good.  He would have the support of all Members of the House and the vast majority of the people if he said <Col N="514" /> out straight the categories of people to whom this butter should apply.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to avail of the minute or two at my disposal to support Deputy O'Toole.  The Minister's predecessor introduced an admirable system under which social welfare recipients received a voucher for butter.  It was not euphemistically classed as Clinton butter, or Christmas butter, or Gibbons butter.  It was classified as butter from the Community available to citizens.</P>
      <P>The system proposed by the Minister is ridiculous.  It gives rise to abuse. In south Dublin, constituents have told me that, if they buy £5 worth of commodities, they get a voucher entitling them to buy 1 lb of butter on 2nd December.  This is an outrageous approach by the Minister.  It is shoddy. It is lazy.  Under the system introduced by the previous Minister, you got your voucher and it was redeemed directly by the Department.  There is no reason why that system could not have been introduced again.</P>
      <P>For these reasons we regard the Christmas butter as a rather sick joke at this time of the year, and a particularly sick joke for social welfare recipients who will now have to scramble to the retail outlets with their few shillings from their pension books in the hope of getting a cheap pound of butter.  If the Minister used his drawing pen he could draw a very good sketch of this sick joke which will not be appreciated by the needy section of the community.  Many people who can well afford to pay the full price of a pound of butter will find this commodity going into their hands at a cheap price.  This is outrageous. The Minister should attempt to introduce an equitable scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Gibbons) James Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Gibbons)</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Desmond's brief intervention reveals the inaccuracy of his information.  This applies to some extent to Deputy O'Toole's contribution. Their remarks tend to give a distorted or inaccurate picture of the situation which actually exists.  To begin with, this is not an Irish Government scheme any more than the social <Col N="515" /> butter scheme introduced by the European Commission in the summer of 1973 and discontinued last year because it was considered to be ineffective in its purpose of reducing the size of the butter mountain.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Toole was quite right when he said the contribution of the Irish dairy industry to that mountain is zero.  The existing small scheme is by no means a good scheme from the point of view of aiding social welfare recipients, if that were possible or even legal under the regulation, and I do not believe it is.  I will come to that in a minute.  Even if it were, it is a bad and temporary scheme which arises from a Council decision of March or April of this year which decided that 52 million units of account would be made available for this scheme.  It was the same size as a tax put on other vegetable oils and fats would have yielded if it had been introduced, but the Council did not agree to that.  So, as a bad sop they introduced this Christmas scheme.</P>
      <P>It is as well to refer briefly to the text of the Commission regulation, Article 4 :</P>
      <P>The Member States shall take the appropriate steps to ensure as far as possible the balanced distribution of quantities of butter referred to in article 1&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>In our case that is 2,000 tons</P>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;having regard in particular to the quantity of butter normally sold by the parties concerned for direct consumption.</P>
      <P>Contrary to the opinion expressed by Deputy Desmond, this is not a social butter scheme, nor could it be.  Arising out of the Council's decision last March or April, on 28th October the Commission introduced the actual regulation which Deputy O'Toole and I have before us.  Even if it were permissible, and I do not believe it is permissible in law&mdash;again I refer Deputies to the wording of Article 4 &mdash;it would not be physically possible, and it certainly would not be within the powers of the Department of Agriculture, to introduce some system for allocating butter to particular classes within that time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="516" /> We would all like to give assistance to social welfare recipients.  Having regard to the fact that the last day for packing this butter is the last day of this year, it is estimated that only about one-fifth of the 2,000 tons would in fact be taken up and then the scheme would lapse.  It has a very brief duration.  The consumers generally would lose the advantage of three-quarters of the 2,000 tons that are available.</P>
    <P>In practice, both because of the terms of the EEC regulation and because of the impracticability of setting up a system for the confinement of the number of customers availing of this butter, the course being recommended by Deputy O'Toole is not a practical one.  The 2,000 tons are being allotted on a <i>pro rata</i> basis of their sales by the creameries to their own retailers and if for no better reason it is likely&mdash;in fact it is almost certain&mdash;that all the creameries will allocate to their retail customers as always because to do otherwise would be very bad for business.  When you get down to the retail level it is quite impossible for the Department of Agriculture to regulate the actual handling of the supplies made available to them.  Again, for the same reason it should be reasonable to expect that respectable retailers would have regard to the general desire that exists in the country, the desire Deputy O'Toole expressed and which we all share, that the maximum advantage be made available to poorer people who should not be exploited or fleeced in the manner Deputy O'Toole suggested might happen.  I do not believe it will happen and if particular retail outlets made it possible for this to happen they would earn the opprobrium of the public generally and that also would be a very bad business arrangement.</P>
    <P>It is important for everybody to bear in mind that the quantities involved are only one-and-a-half pounds per head of the population.  If it were confined, only about one-quarter of the total amount would be absorbed before the period laid down in the regulation expired. It is unsatisfactory; it is the Commission's preparation to deal with the situation that was handed to them <Col N="517" /> by the Council of Ministers last March or April.  I do not think that the Commission take the view that this is in any way a serious attempt to reduce the size of the surplus of butter; it would be far better if they applied themselves to the reduction of the butter mountain by the regulation of third country supplies.  It is worth bearing in mind that it was at the Dublin summit presided over by the former Taoiseach that the extension of the accessibility of third country butter was made to the United Kingdom Government and it is tending to prolong the presence in the Community market of third country butter.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="518" /> Finally, there is no means within the period of the next month by which it would be practicable to confine these supplies of butter.  If you could do it, the result would be that we would lose three-quarters of the total supply available.</P>

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 176 and 177 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="414" /> May I say first that the provision in the 1961 Act for compensation for mental distress was not intended to provide for compensation in the ordinary sense of that word since no amount of money can offset or compensate for the distress which a fatal accident is likely to cause to members of the family of the diseased person. The provision was intended more as an acknowledgement of the fact of grief or mental distress than an attempt to quantify it, which would be impossible.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, whether the sum fixed is £1,000 as at present or some higher sum it is necessarily an arbitrary figure and not one which is intended to be a measure or reflection of the distress that is caused.  The figure is, of course, additional to whatever is awarded by way of damages to compensate for monetary loss such as expenses or loss of support.</P>
    <P>Having said that, and allowing also for the fact that when the figure of £1,000 was fixed in 1961 it was intended to include a substantial margin to allow for inflation, I accept that the figure should now be looked at again and I intend to do this as soon as possible.</P>
