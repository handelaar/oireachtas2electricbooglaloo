      <P>It is proposed to take business in the following order: Nos. 1, 11 (resumed) and 12.  By agreement, all Stages of the Intoxicating Liquor Bill, 1977, will be taken this morning.  No. 12, if not reached earlier, will be taken at 3.30 p.m. Private Members' Business from 7 to 8.30 p.m. No. 29 (resumed).</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Cooney) Patrick M. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Cooney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The object of this very short Bill is to permit the District Court to grant an occasional intoxicating liquor licence in respect of a special event for a period not exceeding six days instead of a period not exceeding three days, which is what the law allows at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 11 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1962, provides that an occasional licence may be granted by the District Court to the holder of an ordinary on-licence to enable him to sell drink at <Col N="588" /> an unlicensed place where a special event is being held during such times and on such days, not exceeding three, as may be specified in the licence.  A number of special events, notably the Spring Show, the Horse Show, Galway Races and a few more last for more than three days and they have traditionally enjoyed the benefit of occasional licences to cover the entire event. Apparently the practice in some districts has been that the court has granted two consecutive occasional licences in respect of some of these events.</P>
    <P>Recently, however, a district justice in Dublin refused to grant a second, consecutive, occasional licence for the week of the Irish International Boat Show in the RDS Ballsbridge.  The applicants for the licence initiated <i>certiorari</i> proceedings in the High Court to have the order of the District Court quashed.  Showing cause why the order should not be quashed, the district justice stated that on his interpretation of section 11 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1962, he had no jurisdiction to grant more than one occasional licence in respect of any event.  The High Court held that the district justice was correct in his interpretation.</P>
    <P>I consider, however, and I am sure Deputies will agree with me, that there is a case for permitting occasional licences to operate in respect of the whole period of the kind of events which I have mentioned.  The only way that this can be done is by amending the law.  The Bill does no more than allow for the continuation of the practice that has existed in relation to some of these special events and I commend it to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>This is not controversial legislation although there are a few questions I would like to ask. Were the consecutive occasional licences issued since 1962 illegal?  It appears to me that when two consecutive occasional licences were given under section 11 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1962, that everything was not as it should be.  Why has it taken so long for this weakness to be recognised?  I have no objection to increasing the number of days for an <Col N="589" /> occasional licence from three to six. There are events all around the country which are of equal importance to the Horse Show and the Spring Show, such as the Rose of Tralee Festival, Listowel Harvest Week and so on which last longer than three days.</P>
      <P>There is a small fear at the back of my mind.  I would not like to make it easier for young people to get drink. Throughout the country a number of exemptions given for one reason or another make it easier for young people to get drink because large numbers are attracted to these towns and villages which have these licences.  I have no objection to mature people drinking.  That is their business provided they keep within reasonable limits and have due regard to the safety of others.  I am thinking particularly of motorists.  In my opinion there is a need for a tightening up of the general exemptions because I honestly feel a number of them which allow drinking up to mid-night in many places attract unruly elements who come solely for the purpose of drinking.  I would like to see the intoxicating liquor laws tightened up or strengthened in every way possible.  It is no secret that in rural Ireland the focal point in every parish is, unfortunately, the lounge bar.  That is where young people meet and these would not all be 18 years old.  There are pool tables and other attractions for them.  I would like to see it made more difficult for young people to get drink.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What I am going to say now is not exactly relevant but I shall say it nevertheless.  I shall be extremely brief.  I honestly believe this Government or the next Government, whatever parties constitute it, should ensure that the advertising of drink on television is stopped.  Young people are subjected to a great many pressures and one of those pressures is well thought-out commercial advertising on behalf of the companies which manufacture alcoholic liquor. It is wrong to give the impression that life centres around drink and we should do everything to prevent that image being given to our young <Col N="590" /> people.  There are quite enough pressures on them.</P>
    <P>I am not opposing the Bill but I have certain reservations.  Anything that would make the availability of drink easier than it is to young people should be prohibited.  Any relaxation in the system should be considered very carefully.  We will give the Minister all the help we can from this side of the House so long as legislation is designed to protect young people from the dangers of drink.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to clarify whether or not a secretary of a race company or an organisation can be given this six-day licence or does the person who applies for such a licence have to own a public house or an hotel?  I am not sure what the position is.  Is it at the discretion of the court to fix the hours of trading?  I should like it to be a minimum.  Where such licences are applied for there is generally only a part-time staff and that staff may not be as vigilant about not selling drink to young people.  As I say, I have a few reservations.  I do not object to the substitution of six days instead of three days but we must do more than we are doing to ensure drink is not&mdash;glamorised as it is being glamorised at the moment.  We have a responsibility to protect our young people.  Drink is available in supermarkets. I hope that its sale in these premises is being properly supervised. I confess I believe it is though other Members say the contrary.  We are getting, perhaps, too liberal.  In a way that is no harm but there is a helluva lot of money being spent on drink every day of every week.  The figures are frightening.  I think as much as £5 million or £6 million a week is spent on drink.  That is a colossal figure.  It is certainly one that we cannot afford.</P>
    <P>The Minister will get the full co-operation of this side of the House in any measures he introduces to tighten up the liquor laws.  If he gets on to the television people about the amount of time spent advertising liquor and glamorising it we will certainly do everything to help him in any effort he makes to put a stop to this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am a TT but I am not a pussyfoot.  If people want to have a drink, that is their business but it is only right that we should put on more controls.  It is the in-thing for young people to meet in lounge bars and that is where the danger lies.  How many publicans have lost licences because of permitting under age drinking?  It would be interesting to have that figure. I welcome the Bill.  We have a racecourse in my constituency and amenities are essential.  We have Government warnings about the danger to health from cigarette smoking.  I do not know how one could warn against drinking.  It would be a waste of time putting it on the bottle.  There is a problem of alcoholism.  A warning must go out loudly and clearly.  Young people are trapped into drinking.  One cannot turn on a television without seeing a smiling young man looking at a glass of liquor.  If a warning like that in regard to cigarettes were given with the drink, some good might come of it. The youth being trapped into drinking today will be the alcoholics of the future.  There must be a tightening up on under age drinking in lounge bars. It is tragic to see them coming out of these places and something must be done to curb this kind of drinking.</P>

      <P>I am sorry to interrupt the Deputy but the Chair has allowed a great deal of latitude so far.  The Bill is limited in scope.  It is confined to the granting of occasional licences.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no objection to the Bill but the Minister might have taken this opportunity to examine many aspects of the present situation and broaden the scope of the Bill.  I asked questions here in relation to guesthouse owners who lost licences because they did not have a special grading from Bord Fáilte.  One should take a look at the overall situation when providing for extensions.  There are restrictions on tourists under the existing hours.  Parents who cannot leave their children before 10.30 p.m. <Col N="592" /> or 11 p.m. cannot enjoy a drink in a local lounge bar and this is something that might be examined.  There are other aspects which should also be examined.  As this appears to be urgent he could have taken a look at the things I have mentioned.</P>
      <P>Hoteliers have a very short season and they find it hard to keep within the limits of the law and try to keep those on holiday happy.  There might be a sergeant or superintendent who is particularly strict in enforcing the law.  This creates problems in tourist drinking areas.  I am not advocating that we should make it easier for people to get drink.  I agree with what has been said with regard to restrictions on drinking in lounge bars.  I suppose the Minister cannot in this Bill do what I have been asking but when we are talking about drinking laws I believe it is necessary to have a Bill introduced to cover the points I have made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="StephenCoughlan" hpid="Mr. Coughlan Mr. Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have served inside and outside the counter for many years.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="StephenCoughlan" hpid="Mr. Coughlan Mr. Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>Definitely.  I have an all-time record.  I was fined £50 for selling drink after hours on one occasion.  I know the law from both sides and I want to commend the Minister for what he has done in those exceptional circumstances.  As Deputy Collins said, the law has been contravened in the past but his predecessor was in office during those contraventions and nothing was done about it.</P>
      <P>No matter what we say about not advertising the use of intoxicating drink the non-advertising of tobacco and cigarettes has not decreased sales. There was a lot of pressure about the dangers of cigarette smoking.  The non-advertising of tobacco and cigarettes has not curbed the practice of cigarette smoking.  Likewise, the non-advertising of alcoholic drinks will not stop alcoholism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are many functions which go on from time to time, such as Galway races, the Listowel races, Puck Fair <Col N="593" /> and Killarney races, which are tourist attractions.  I suggest that a limit be put on the closing time.  When a licence is granted by Bord na gCon to a greyhound track the licence expires 15 minutes after the time of the last race.  In the case of the functions I have mentioned when a licence is given for drink at those functions the licensee should be given about one-and-a-half hours after the last race to close his bar before the licence expires. We should have identification cards for teenage drinkers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>There is obviously a widening of the debate here.  I have allowed a brief reference to advertising but the advertising of cigarettes, tobacco and such matters, to which the Deputy is now adverting, do not arise on this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="StephenCoughlan" hpid="Mr. Coughlan Mr. Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister should go a step further in issuing licences, particularly wine licences.  Anybody can buy a bottle of cheap wine in any huckster's shop, chemist's, grocer's or supermarket.  Cider, which is intoxicating, can also be bought in many of those premises.  People have to live by their trade but I cannot see why any of those premises I have mentioned should be allowed to hold a wine licence.  I recommend that they oe curtailed.  If we want to regulate our drinking habits and bring them within limits we must put the law on ourselves.</P>
      <P>The Minister should also consider a Christmas morning opening to 1.30 or 2.30 p.m.  Nearly every publican in Ireland is open on Christmas morning.  If the Minister legalised a two-hour opening on that day, instead of having people going in at all hours of the day or night, it would be much better.  We agree that Good Friday is out but any man is in his wife's way on a Christmas morning and he should be allowed legally to mix with his friends in any of those places.</P>

      <P>What about a cure?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="StephenCoughlan" hpid="Mr. Coughlan Mr. Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>What does the Deputy know about cures?  He would need to go to Lourdes.  I want to congratulate the Minister on what he has done but I suggest that he goes <Col N="594" /> a few steps further.  When the Bill is debated in more detail I will have further suggestions to make.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>As our spokesman said, there is no objection to extending the licence from three days to six days in the case of a special event.  The Minister made it clear why he had to introduce this Bill.  The changing pattern in the tourist business imposes an obligation on the State to make a different provision from the one that was made in the past.  We now have different type holidays, such as camping, caravan and itinerant type holidays where people move from place to place.  Certain houses may get a reputation for a certain type of interesting, effective and very often internationally recognised entertainment and on special occasions the extension of the licence should be given to them.</P>
      <P>A traveller in the nineteenth century in Ireland commented very favourably with regard to licences and drinking. He said that in Ireland there was an abundance of food, game, red meat and poultry available in drinking places and that when you bought your alcoholic drink you got all the food you wanted for nothing, &ldquo;it being the custom of the kingdom&rdquo;.  This would be worth reviving, but it is unlikely that food would be available for nothing.  However, any future look at the licensing laws should see to it that with drink there is plenty of food.  Other countries have faced this problem and a great deal of <i>ersatz</i> food was made available in drinking places, plastic peas, <i>ersatz</i> meat and so on, a pseudo provision to cope with the law.  Many of the points made by Deputy Coogan would be met if the people had available to them plenty of food to absorb the drink.  There would be less damage to health and less drunkenness.  I would not agree at all with Deputy Coughlan that Christmas Day should be a day for a special liecnce.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FintanCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>It offends me to see such cases in the paper, and I do not have much sympathy for a publican <Col N="595" /> who is caught on Christmas Day serving drinks.  There may be a useful social purpose served if the man of the house gets out of the way while the women are preparing the Christmas dinner.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, that would be a useful exercise before the dinner or maybe a more useful one afterwards. However, when, as is inevitable, this whole question comes up with regard to licensing, there should be a look at the necessity of providing solid food by compulsion in all places where alcoholic drink is served.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>It is, of course, necessary to legalise the situation where drink can be sold at unlicensed places, and such events as Tramore races in August come within the scope of the Bill.  One can gather from what has been said in the House that Deputies would have preferred a more comprehensive Bill dealing with a number of wider problems which face our society.</P>
      <P>The question of young drinkers has been mentioned as having become a serious problem.  There should be greater penalties on licensees who sell drink to young people or to people who are drunk.  The closing hours should also be dealt with.  It was put to me that the licensees would prefer to see an all-the-year-round closing time of 11 o'clock.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is getting away from the subject matter of the Bill, which is very limited.  The Chair has allowed some latitude and fleeting references to other matters, but we cannot get into detail on matters which do not arise.  Occasional intoxicating liquor licences is the question at issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to go deeply into any matter.  I merely wish to refer to some matters which should be dealt with in an Intoxicating Liquor Bill.  Deputy Gallagher mentioned holiday resorts and I think for the summer season different closing <Col N="596" /> hours should be applicable to such places.  However, the Bill legalises what was in practice illegal, apparently, and that is to be welcomed.  Nevertheless, in relation to the whole question of Intoxicating Liquor Acts there are many problems which should be dealt with in a comprehensive Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Kitt Mr. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I support what has been said already on this Bill.  I just want to ask the Minister about the licence for special events.  Can I take it that under this Bill the courts will not grant two consecutive occasional licences for these events?  Under this Bill the licence may be granted for a period not exceeding six days and, as the Minister pointed out, in some areas the court granted two consecutive occasional licences where the event went on longer than three days.  If the event went on longer than a week, would the court grant two consecutive occasional licences for the event?  I think it would be a little too liberal if that situation was allowed to arise.</P>
      <P>I would also question some of these special events which are held in this country, and I would distinguish between those that are genuine, traditional events and those that are just pulled out of the hat in order to make some money for a few days.  Those genuine, traditional events are suffering because of the multiplicity of festivals and other events that are held at the moment and it is sad to note that some traditional events have disappeared in recent times.</P>
      <P>I support Deputy Wilson in what he has said about making food available. This country is noted for food and unfortunately at some of these festivals there is very little sign of food being made available.  That is something of which the organisers of every event should take note.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reference has been made to the glamorisation of drink and to advertising on television.  There is another type of advertising which is probably more frightening and dangerous, that is, the advertising of drink that is to be seen on children's garments.  This form of advertising is more harmful because children are being used by people who are behind such productions, <Col N="597" /> and when the children wearing these garments are at school these advertisements are obviously having an effect on the other children and encouraging young people to take drink. There should be a Bill dealing with this problem.  That is straying a little from the Bill but, in general, I welcome the statement the Minister has made.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LukeBelton" hpid="Mr. L. Belton Mr. L. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill. Like Deputy Coughlan I have had experience inside and outside the counter, and in my time I have been a Pioneer and a drinker.  At the moment I am one of the few Deputies holding a publican's licence.  I welcome this correction and I am surprised that the error has not been detected previously by other Ministers or other members of the legal profession. It baffles me why it was allowed to exist for so long.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unlike Deputy Coughlan, I would not advocate opening on Christmas Day.  Very few businesses are open for as long as the licensing trade who are now open for 363 days out of 365. The only two closed days are Christmas Day and Good Friday.  St. Patrick's Day used be a closed day but that has been changed.  I would appeal to the Minister to look for closer supervision of those occasional licences.  As Deputy Collins has said, very often temporary staff are employed who have not experience of this type of trade and are there only for the day and are not depending solely on this employment.  Many people blame our lounge bars for encouraging people to drink but the lounge bars in Dublin anyway are quite well conducted and the staffs in them are fully trained personnel.  The publican himself knows that if he does not conduct his premises properly his licence can be objected to at the next licensing session.  Proper supervision is needed in some supermarkets and in our hotels where people sit over the tables and there is not much supervision regarding the age of the people drinking.  This applies also to our airports.  I was surprised on a few occasions to see a number of very young people at airports being served at tables.  Granted they were not being served personally with the drink but <Col N="598" /> people were taking it over to them.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.  Deputy Kitt need have no worry about two six-day sessions being granted because from the Minister's speech on Second Reading it seems that this anomaly was detected only when a district justice pointed out that he had not power to grant two consecutive occasional licences.  Heretofore, seemingly, several district justices had granted double exemptions but this district justice found that he had not the power to do it and his decision was upheld.  I hope that in the near future the Minister will introduce a further licensing Bill on which we will have a lot to say.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>We are confined to the Bill and I want to say a few words about the question of alcohol, keeping as close as I can to the terms of the Bill.  It may be said that this Bill is not necessary.  It is necessary, and I compliment the Minister for bringing it in.  As Deputy Coogan has said, it would be very unfair if the Galway races went on for six days and the racegoers were without a drink for three days.  I also agree with Deputy Kitt that there should not be repetition of these exemptions.  There were comments here on the question of drinking. I never took a drink but I have been in and out of pubs with people and I have stayed in them until all hours of the night and I admire the person who takes a drink and knows where to stop.  The person who goes too far with it is a nuisance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Various people have mentioned the advertising of drink.  I do not think this will be cut out completely but at least the glamorising of drink in television advertising should be controlled. I object to the fact that teenagers are led to believe that if they are not taking a drink they cannot be with it.  I am not a pussyfoot but I do say that television advertisements give the impression that without drink one cannot enjoy life.  That is wrong.  With regard to what Deputy Coughlan said, I disagree completely with the proposal to have pubs open on Good Friday and Christmas Day.  Surely there is no house in the country which has not drink in on Christmas Day so that if <Col N="599" /> people then want drink they can have it.  That is the one day that everybody wants to be at home and no publican would wish to open his premises on that day.</P>
    <P>There is a question of wine and cider being available in supermarkets. This certainly is a danger but I would not object to restaurants having a licence.  Where there is a restaurant patronised by foreigners who like a glass of wine with their lunch it is only fair that the restaurant should have a licence to supply that.  French people, for instance, take wine with their meals and it is not fair to deprive them of it.  However, it should not be for sale off the premises and this is the point I would like the Minister to consider.  I know I am straying from this very confined Bill but every speaker is straying from it a little. The reason I am saying this is that it might go forth from this House that we have run through a Bill today extending hours or extending extensions without making a comment and we are supposed to be very heavy drinkers. I have no objection to anybody taking a drink.  It is a God-given right and people who drink are as good as the people who do not but the person who overdoes it is a nuisance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LawrenceMcMahon" hpid="Mr. McMahon Mr. McMahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMahon</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a short Bill to regularise something which is happening. Other speakers this morning have strayed from the Bill a little and it is fitting that they should.  Many people will view with concern what will be regarded as an extension of the licensing hours.  It is right and proper that we should have this Bill before us but, like a number of other speakers, I am disappointed that we have not a more comprehensive Bill covering more of the licensing laws.  I can see a greater need for applications for licences of this kind in the area which I represent.  It is not possible today to obtain a licence for a premises unless it is a mile from an existing licensed premises.  This is a most ridiculous situation in an area which could be described as the fastest developing area in Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are building three new towns <Col N="600" /> in County Dublin today and it is not possible to give the service to the incoming people.  One could have a grocer's shop, a newsagent's or a butcher's or any other business but it is not possible to have licensed premises for the needs of the people.  This is leading to a situation where we will probably have the record for the largest public houses or licensed premises in Europe.  One area can boast of a licensed premises which can seat well in excess of 3,000 people. That is not a desirable development. For the proper control and use of drink it is far better that we have licensed premises in practically every housing estate to which a person can walk with ease to socialise or to quench his thirst.  As we know, it is the habit to crowd public houses for the last hour or two in the evening.</P>

      <P>Many people have to drive to licensed premises, whereas if they were in better locations they could walk there and back rather than drive after drinking.  It is not clear in this Bill if the licence will be confined to the regular licensing hours or if these special licences can be granted after hours.  I, like other Deputies, would like to see the licence confined to a time limit after the event for which it is granted.  If an event lasts until six o'clock in the evening, the licence could last an hour or two after that.  This should be in the Bill rather than having district justices deciding on the Bill.</P>
      <P>I am against the Christmas Day opening.  On Christmas Day drink can be had in almost every house in Ireland. Ninety-nine per cent of the houses in Ireland will have a stock of drink on Christmas Day and it should not be necessary to have the licensed premises opened.  A Bill is not necessary for this but I would like to see the Government spend more money on what could be described as an anti-round system campaign.  Here lies the greatest ill.</P>

      <P>This Bill does nothing except legalise what has been taking place illegally over a number of years. The debate indicates that there is an urgent need for debate in the House on all the aspects of the licensing laws and on the advertising of drink.  What worries me about the change is how it will be interpreted by different justices in different areas.  We could get a situation where applications of this nature would be used as a way to get around the licensing laws.  Either we have licensing laws or we do not.  This is a way of getting round the existing licensing laws.  Could the Minister give any indication as to the increase in the numbers of these licences that have been granted over the past number of years?  I believe there has been an extraordinary increase in the number of this type of special event licences.</P>

I agree that events like the Horse Show, the Galway Races or the Colleen Bawn Festival are special events but it is not a special event when a marquee is put up in any area for a week.  There should be some definition in the Bill to define special event.  There is a need for urgent debate on the various aspects that have been raised here today.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanToal" hpid="Mr. Toal Mr. Toal">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Toal</NameTxt>
      <P>As many speakers have said, this is a very simple measure designed to extend from a period of three <Col N="602" /> to six days the occasional licences. Deputies would agree that occasional licences are not really confined to the Horse Show, the Spring Show or the International Boat Show.  They can be got down the country as well.  There are such events as ploughing championships and other agricultural functions which extend over a longer period than three days.  I am certain that the Bill before us will have its effect in various parts of the country.  On such a simple measure it is interesting to see the number of Deputies that come into the House.  Obviously, the Intoxicating Liquor Acts are a bone of contention among a number of Deputies and there is no real agreement or unanimity on either side of the House as to the interpretation of these Acts and what they should contain.</P>
      <P>Like many other Deputies, I would like to see the Intoxicating Liquor Acts updated and modernised.  I do not mean liberalised in any way.  It is very easy to stand up here and adopt a high moral attitude and pontificate and preach temperance and so on.  The Minister should take into account the economic factors in the Intoxicating Liquor Acts, the livelihood of publicans throughout the country who are depending on the sale of drink from their licensed premises in small towns. They are trying to make a living and they see all of this being taken away from them by the granting of licences to hotels which could be described as nothing better than glorified public dance halls.  These extensions which can go on until one or two o'clock in the morning seem to be given for the flimsiest of reasons.</P>
      <P>I should like to see all the legislation in this area being updated and brought into line with the thinking of the people generally.  More thought should be given to the situation of the beleagured publicans who stand behind their counters from morning to night trying to make a living themselves and their families but whose customers leave before closing time to go to hotels where they can drink until 3 a.m.  This is particularly the case in small towns.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill has been brought before us as a result of a High Court <Col N="603" /> decision.  In supporting it I can only express the hope that the legislation in this area will be updated with the support of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the reason for the introduction of this Bill but I am disappointed that the Minister did not take the opportunity of the occasion to give the House the benefit of his overall views in regard to what he considers to be necessary in the long term by way of changes in the intoxicating liquor legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Had I attempted to do so I would have been ruled out of order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>When introducing other measures the Minister has expressed his views and has given us some relevant background information.  To that extent I do not think he would be ruled out of order so I am surprised to hear him express that fear.  Had he said, for instance, that the purpose of this short measure is to permit the District Court to grant an occasional licence for a six-day rather than three-day period and that he would have preferred to introduce a comprehensive Bill in this whole area after he had had time to study the situation, I cannot see that he would have been ruled out of order.</P>
      <P>However, in regard to the Bill I take it that in the event of an applicant seeking a licence in respect of a function of four days' duration, the court would not be compelled to issue the licence for six days.  I expect that the practice that had evolved in such cases was that two separate three-day licences were issued.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having studied the section of the 1962 Act which the Minister seeks to amend, that is, section 11, I find that subsection (5) provides that an occasional licence shall not be granted in respect of any Sunday.  Christmas Day or Good Friday.  I take it that we are talking here of a licence to sell intoxicating liquor at a premises that may not be licensed for that purpose. I am thinking of a stand being set up for this purpose at a sporting or cultural function which may last for a <Col N="604" /> week or a fortnight.  In my area there is organised a maytime festival which continues for about ten days.  I expect that the licence would provide for the sale of drink between the hours of 8 a.m. and 10 p.m., in other words that the holder of such a licence would not be empowered to sell drink after 10 p.m.  Presumably, too, we are talking in this context of a week beginning on a Monday morning and ending on a Saturday night since a licence cannot be granted in respect of a Sunday.</P>
    <P>It is my opinion that, instead of seeking extended hours of normal trading, as has been suggested by another Deputy, publicans consider their hours of opening to be too long and would prefer a restriction in this area. This is why I am disappointed that the Minister failed to appraise us of his thinking in this whole area.  It would have been interesting, for instance, to have heard from him in regard to something that has been advocated for some time, that is, the elimination of the need to hold licences at all, in other words, to allow licensed premises to fix their own hours of trading.  Just as the Minister for Industry and Commerce would advocate letting prices find their own level, hours of opening could be left to find their level, too.</P>
    <P>A Deputy who spoke earlier referred to the situation under the 1962 Act whereby, on any pretext at all, a licence for an extension can be granted to a hotel or other licencsed premises in respect of any sort of function. There is this peculiar sort of arrangement in practice whereby one door would be closed between 11 and 12 p.m. but another door is open.  In other words, there would not appear to be any restriction on the sale of intoxicating liquor up to 2 a.m. in a premises in respect of which the extension had been granted.</P>
    <P>Have we not reached a stage where this whole area must be reconsidered and the business people concerned be allowed decide among themselves during which hours they should trade? They are doing this at the moment in relation to the fixing of prices, as the Minister for Industry and Commerce knows to his cost.  Some element of <Col N="605" /> rationality is needed in this whole area.  I recall a former Minister for Justice talking in terms of following the European pattern in this regard and having a situation in which it would be possible to buy a drink at any hour of the day or night.  What he had in mind, though, was granting licences for the sale of drink up to 2 a.m. in all licensed premises.  There was an outcry but we must all appreciate that if the House were to pass legislation to enable that to happen, every pub would not be open until 2 a.m.  The publicans in each area would get together and decide to close at 10 or 10.30, that they would open on Sunday until such and such a time or that they would open on Saturday night until such a time but would close every other night at 8, 9, 10 or 11 o'clock depending on the business in the area.  This might be the logical way to approach the matter.  I am sorry for digressing but I use the occasion to mention what the Minister had not spoken about.</P>

      <P>I am sorry.  I am anxious to make it clear that we are talking here about occasional licences that operate from Monday morning to Saturday night.  I cannot think of an instance, but I should like to ask if it would be possible for a district justice to grant a licence for a particular special occasion from, say, Wednesday of this week until next Tuesday night? Is there anything in the section debarring the court from giving that six days from Wednesday morning at 8 o'clock until the following Tuesday night at 10 o'clock?  In fact this would be seven days but under this section of the 1962 Act which we are not amending, Sunday is ruled out.  Is it permissible to give this six days?  Under the table in section 1 it says &ldquo;authorising him to sell at that place during such times and on such days not exceeding six as may be specified on the licence.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="606" /> Is it possible for the court to grant a licence under these circumstances or does the section debar the court from doing so?</P>
    <P>The Minister gave some examples including the Spring Show, the Horse Show, Galway races and a few more. The Spring Show and the Horse Show run from Tuesday to Saturday.  Galway races run from Monday night and there is an extra day now in July and perhaps we may get another day.  The promoters might decide to extend Galway races in view of the fact that they can have a further couple of days' booze-up if the money lasts.  Does the proposed new section allow the type of six-day licence which I visulise&mdash; four days of one week and two days of the following week with Sunday intervening when no licence can operate? I should like the Minister to clear up that point.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>As somebody who spent many years working in licensed premises and whose family have been involved in the business for many years I should like to make a few remarks on the Bill.  Having noted the furore in the papers when the Boat Show licence ran into difficulties I felt that the Minister for Justice would soon come to the House with amending legislation.  Fair play to him, he is here with such legislation within a very short time.  I believe it is welcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One thing about the legislation that is being amended is that the hours are restricted; there is no open-ended trading and this is a good thing.  The functions we have in mind are social events at which there is a great mixture and mingling of people.  In these cases I believe that the emphasis is not on drink, at least I would hope so.  It is more of a social occasion.  I live in the midlands and Galway races is one of the most popular social events to which people look forward for weeks ahead and I think the majority who go there do not go for a booze-up.  They enjoy the racing and enjoy meeting friends from different areas.  It is a holiday event for them.  I believe the main emphasis is on the social aspect of the occasion. <Col N="607" /> I am sorry Deputy Lalor has left the House because I should like to put on record that I disagree with some of the things he said for instance in regard to having no time limit on the closing of licensed premises.  He spoke about open-ended hours of trading and thought it might lead to a situation where publicans in an area would eventually agree to fix their own hours of closing.  I believe it would be wrong for the Minister to introduce legislation under which there would be no time limit for the closing of licensed premises.</P>
    <P>I do not think Deputy Lalor's view is widely held and I think he would be in a minority in that regard.  There is no demand for removing control on the closing of licensed premises.  Should such legislation be passed in this House, which God forbid, I think the £4 million per week that we are spending on liquor would be driven up enormously and that there would be widespread abuse of alcohol.  I am sorry to say it, but I think that we as a nation are not sufficiently mature in our approach to and use of alcoholic beverages and the social aspect of drinking.  Deputy Lalor seemed to feel that we should be able to have a situation in which people at 11.30 or 12 o'clock would all decide they had had enough and go home.  I do not think that would happen.  I believe it would lead to considerable abuse.  At present a large number of families are suffering seriously because of abuse of drink by husbands.</P>

I felt there was a necessity for it when I read the point of view expressed by the district justice.  His decision was upheld later by the High Court.  The Bill has the approval of everyone in the House. In the very near future the Minister should take a serious look at the Intoxicating Liquor Acts.  This Bill goes some of the way.  It is important that they should have full licences for the Spring Show, the Horse Show, Galway races, the Boat Show and all these important events.  The restraints imposed on me by the Ceann Comhairle do not allow me to develop other arguments at the moment, but I hope I will be able to raise them in the House on some future occasion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank the Minister for bringing in this Bill. I see the need for it.  Up to recently the difficulty was got over by the three-day licence being extended by a further three days.  This has now been found to be against the law and only a three-day extension can be given for a special occasion.  This could have very far-reaching effects in a particular instance in my own constituency.  At the moment there is a tendency to run race meetings and festivals for a five-day period.  I refer in particular to festivals and race meetings in Kerry, Galway, Tramore <Col N="609" /> and places like that.  I am only sorry the powers-that-be in the racing fraternity cannot see their way to extending the Curragh Derby meeting to a five-day period and tie it up with a five-day festival in Kildare.</P>
      <P>I can speak in an unprejudiced fashion because I am a Pioneer and I think we are being held up to ridicule abroad because of a too rigid interpretation of the letter of our licensing laws and a very irresponsible approach to the consumption of alcohol.  Without this Bill the law as rigidly interpreted would mean that international sales now being held in Kill, which are attracting very good crowds and bringing a lot of money to the country and providing a wonderful shop window for our bloodstock industry, would have three days in which to sell drink and the rest of the period would be dry.  This would provide great copy for those who might like to ridicule us abroad and would not be any incentive to continentals, who have a proper approach to drink and look upon the consumption of wines and spirits as part of their daily lives, to come here. They would not feel that Goffs was the place to be for the last three days of the period.  Weeklong sales, which are a feature of Goffs at the moment, would fall by the wayside.</P>
      <P>I should like to mention something which is not covered in this Bill and which I should like the Minister to consider.  Recently this sales complex was used for shows and musicals and functions of that nature.  Last year there was a performance of <i>Joseph</i> which ran for a 14-week period.  The occasional licence covered it then but now with the more rigid interpretation of the law, any theatre company or any impresario who would like to put on a show will not be attracted to a place such as Goffs in Kill because the licence will be limited to six days. To get over this difficulty the Minister might consider the extension of the licence in such a case.  It would not be abused and it would be helpful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No theatrical production company would entertain the idea of facilities which did not include a bar and the profits accruing from it for the entire run of the production.  At this time, <Col N="610" /> theatrical companies are faced with a certain amount of difficulties.  Amateur theatres which were flourishing up to some time ago now find themselves in extreme difficulty.  Drama festivals are running at a loss.  I would ask the Minister to introduce an amendment to cover this eventuality and give it special consideration.  It is worthy of that.  I compliment him on introducing the Bill so speedily to cover a situation which could have had a disastrous effect on us abroad and hold us up to ridicule.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Cooney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to thank Deputies from all sides of the House for their welcome for this limited measure.  Unavoidably and understandably there were what the Chair described as fleeting references to other matters relating to the licensing laws.  I might be permitted the liberty of making fleeting references to them in my reply.</P>
      <P>Essentially Deputies expressed dis-appointment that this Bill was so narrow and that all matters relating to the Intoxicating Liquor Acts code which are due for review are not being reviewed.  This is a limited Bill to deal with an urgent point.  If one were to include anything else in it&mdash;and, indeed, there was a temptation to include one or two extra things in it&mdash;one would be opening the door to strong and justifiable arguments as to why that, and why not something else.  It has been some time since there was a review of the intoxicating liquor code and it is at a stage now when amendments and changes are needed.</P>
      <P>With regard to the question of hours, opinions ranged from Deputy Lalor's view that there should be no restriction. It was his opinion that the market should find its level in each area, that the customers and the trade should determine the hours.  On the other hand, Deputy Enright considered that 11 p.m. all the year is a sufficiently late hour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The matter of special exemptions was also mentioned.  Deputy Toal pointed out that these are granted in the most bizarre situations and are now regarded as run of the mill <Col N="611" /> instead of special exemptions, that hotels are receiving so many of these exemptions that they are taking business from <i>bona fide</i> pubs. Obviously the question of what should be the criteria for special exemptions must be examined.  In addition, we must examine the standard and the cost of the meal that has to be provided to justify the special exemptions.</P>
    <P>The question of the licensing of restaurants was raised and this is a matter with which I am in general sympathy.  Deputy Wilson expressed the opinion that pubs should be obliged to serve food.  I do not think we could oblige them by law to do so but they should be encouraged and I think the practice is becoming more widespread.  Restaurants feel themselves prejudiced by not having a full licence to sell spirits and beer because they are put in a difficult position <i>vis-à-vis</i> customers, particularly those from abroad.  The six-day licence holders consider they have a grievance and think their situation should be examined and this must be taken into account.</P>
    <P>During the debate it was suggested that the position with regard to holiday resorts should be dealt with but nobody defined for me what is a holiday resort.  I am quite sure that when the Curragh races are on Kildare considers itself as much a holiday resort as Ballybunion or Bundoran.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid very little water is consumed in watering places. Perhaps we might be able to get a definition on those lines.  The point made by Deputy Gallagher contrasted with that of Deputy Collins and it shows the wide divergence that exists. In their contributions Deputies were reflecting the divergence of views held throughout the country.  Any Minister for Justice who proposes changes in this area will not satisfy everybody. Deputy Gallagher raised the point of extra hours for hotel keepers in tourist areas who have a short season but Deputy Collins said there was too <Col N="612" /> much drinking.  Certainly there is a divergence between the two points of view.</P>
      <P>The question of advertising was raised by many Deputies.  The spokesman for the Opposition was speaking personally on this matter as I am and I share his views that advertising is something that has potential adverse social consequences.  It is something that must be considered carefully.  A Deputy on this side said that there should be something adopted with regard to alcohol advertising equivalent to the anti-smoking advertising of the Department of Health.  It was said that if the advertising of drink were to be permitted there should be a balance achieved in advertising features, pointing out the dangers of the misuse of alcohol.</P>
      <P>All these matters give an indication of the number of considerations that must be legislated for in due course. It is an area with many social as well as legal implications and that adds to the difficulties of creating a system that will command widespread acceptance. All of these matters have been raised with me from time to time and I have taken them into consideration. I have met the vintners' association and I have had deputions from restaurant owners.  In addition, the general public made representations and there are the questions raised in the House. Gradually a pattern is building up of areas where reform is needed and that pattern is beginning to establish itself quite definitely.  I have not yet come to a firm conclusion with regard to the reforms needed.  At this stage I cannot make any promise to the House that a comprehensive Bill to amend the entire liquor code is likely in the near future.  That concerns the general issues made and I am obliged to the Chair for allowing me to make fleeting references to the brief points that were permitted during the debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Collins wondered if the orders granted since 1962 were illegal. The answer is no.  The position is that the law is as printed in the statute and as found by the courts.  Until the last finding, the courts found that there was power to grant successive or consecutive orders.  So long as that <Col N="613" /> was a finding by a court in accordance with the court's interpretation of the Act that was a lawful finding.  Recently it was held by the High Court that the interpretation was wrong. When a superior court finds that, the ruling of that becomes the legal position and that is why we are here now to change the law.  It is not a question that the orders were illegal.</P>
    <P>The applicant for a licence under section 11 (1) must be a publican.  He applies to the court and he gets a licence if the court is satisfied that a special event is being held.  Deputy Kitt asked for a definition of a special event.  It is not defined in section 11 and it is a matter for the court to decide if the event in respect of which the occasional licence is sought is special.  The court then grants the applicant a licence and this enables him to sell intoxicating liquor at the place where the special event is taking place.  The licence is not granted to the secretary, manager or organiser of the special event.  There was some confusion between occasional licences of that type and the exemptions for special events granted on occasions such as the Rose of Tralee or similar festivals.  In that sort of situation the licence was granted to exempt all pubs in the area from the licensing laws during the period of that festival.  The licence is not confined to the particular venue where a special event is taking place; it is a licence that permits in a town or a village exemption from the licensing laws for a certain period, not exceeding nine days in all in the whole year.</P>
    <P>In this case we are talking about a very net type of thing that permits for a race meeting, a sporting organisation, a trade fair or a horse sales. The section also limits the hours in which the licence can operate from 8 a.m. to 10 p.m.  They are the starting and finishing limits but the court can grant the hours for a shorter period. The court has discretion to grant what hours it thinks fit within those limits. Occasional licences shall not be granted in respect of any Sunday, Christmas Day, or Good Friday.  There is no argument in the House with regard to Christmas Day or Good Friday.  Indeed, Christmas Day should, <Col N="614" /> in my opinion, and this seems to be a majority view, be always a closed day. Deputy Coughlan in my view exaggerated the position when he gave the impression that there was widespread breach of the licensing laws on Christmas Day.  I am satisfied that is not so.  Occasional breaches may take place but breaches are not widespread. The licensing laws are honoured on that day as they should be.</P>
    <P>The prohibition of granting occasional licences on Sundays affects certain sporting events which used take place mid-week but now take place on Sundays.  I refer in particular to point-to-point meetings, coursing events and gymkhanas.  They cannot have an occasional licence because of this prohibition.  If one were to include sporting events with the intention of confining it to that traditional type of event how does one exclude football matches?  The door opens too widely then.  For the moment we will have to maintain the restriction on occasional licences for Sundays.</P>
    <P>Deputy Luke Belton raised the question of supervision of the licensee in using his occasional licence.  He made the point that often temporary staff are employed with the results that standards are not what they should be. I agree that this can happen and, indeed, the rush of business on such occasions is too great for the facilities that are provided but this is not a matter that the Minister for Justice has to deal with.  It may pertain to the hygiene regulations but that sort of situation is cured by commercial considerations. If the contractor who undertakes to provide drink for sale does not do it properly he will not be taken on the following year.  The public will make their dissatisfaction about unsatisfactory standards known quickly to the organisers of the event.  It is up to those people to ensure that a contractor is engaged who will provide services at a proper level.  That is the best sanction to ensure standards rather than to attempt to do it by way of legislation.</P>
    <P>The same Deputy also wanted to know why this gap in the law was not spotted earlier.  That is something that could be asked about every piece of legislation when a court makes an interpretative <Col N="615" /> decision of it.  It is a matter of a court's interpretation and it is not a question of there having been a mistake in the Act and it slipping through.  Deputy Daly wanted to know if there was an increase in the number of special events.  He also asked for a definition of &ldquo;special event&rdquo;.  It is not defined in section 11. It is for the court's discretion to say if the particular event is special or not. Section 10 of the 1962 Act states:</P>
    <P>an event...that, in the opinion of the Court, the period will be one during which a considerable number of persons will be likely to be attracted to that locality,</P>
    <P>That section deals with the Tralee Festival type of event.  There has been an increase in the number of such events and this is not an undesirable development.  It brings activity and business to an area and can lift that area considerably in terms of its tourist trade.  It is a good thing to see special events of that kind increasing.  I am not aware that there has been any extra number of occasional licences for events of the type we are dealing with in this Bill.  They are all traditional annual functions.  There may be an additional trade show at the RDS but that is something that is desirable.</P>
    <P>Deputy Power raised a difficult matter for me when he spoke of the situation in Goff's premises at Kill, County Kildare, when they are used as a theatre.  Quite frankly, I do not know what the answer is.  I would have sympathy with his point but it would have implications of a far reaching kind with regard to the licensing laws generally if one were to say that a place which is not normally a theatre and does not have a theatre licence should be entitled to get special exemptions or occasional licences in excess of what is now being provided when it is used as a theatre.  This is something we will have to look at but the answer at this stage is that it is something that will have to await a general look at the licensing laws.  It is not something for which I would be keen on proposing an <i>ad hoc</i> solution.  It could well be a classic example of a hard case making a bad law.  I would <Col N="616" /> like to look at this in the context of amending the licensing laws generally. It is an anomalous situation but the anomaly arises not so much from the law as from the rather odd use that the premises are put to from time to time.  The premises were designed primarily for the sale of bloodstock and the promoters, rightly, decided to turn another penny and use them in this extra way.  The licensing law anomaly that arises then does not arise from the laws but arises from this unusual use of the premises.</P>

      <P>That might have been the answer.  Deputy Lalor asked what would be the position of an event which started on a Wednesday and ended on a Tuesday.  The event would be entitled to have an occasional licence for Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Monday and Tuesday but not for Sunday.  The court would grant a licence for each day and would specify the hours of drinking for each day.  Deputy Kitt raised the point that if an event goes on for more than a week could a licence be granted for in excess of six days.  It cannot.  It is clear from the decision of the High Court that consecutive exemptions are not in accordance with the Act.  I thank Deputies opposite, particularly Deputy Collins, for the co-operation in enabling this small corrective measure to go through.  The measure is small in itself but it is large in its implications</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I was speaking last evening about subsection (7) (2) (f) and the difficulties that that creates about indicating the charge for installing goods.  The Parliamentary Secretary agreed that many problems were raised by the drafting of paragraph (f) which is not clear to say the least of it.  He agreed that, while we do not have an amendment to it now, he would amend it on Report Stage in an endeavour to meet the problems I outlined.  Perhaps one of the ways that might be done would be to take out paragraph (f) altogether.  I am not certain that it is really workable in relation to a great many items which, quite obviously, entail an installation charge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another matter arises under paragraph (e) of subsection (2) where an advertisement appears from a national chain, if one could call it such, of supermarkets having branches in more than one city or town showing the price of a particular commodity.  As I understand it, the obligation will be on them to charge the same price in that chain everywhere in the country.  I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to confirm that my understanding of paragraph (e) is correct.  It is important that this be done because some of these chains of supermarkets tend to charge a lower price in some areas than in others for particular commodities. Perhaps this may be caused on some occasions by the fact that locally obtainable produce might be cheaper in one area than another.  It would be helpful to consumers generally if it could be enforced that the price of a particular commodity be the same in <Col N="618" /> every branch within the State of a particular firm or supermarket.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the situation is that if the chain publishes an advertisement which could reasonably be construed as applying to all branches of the chain, then it must so apply.  Of course, they can, if they wish, insert an advertisement which is clearly understood to refer only to a particular shop in the chain.</P>
      <P>So far as the points raised by Deputy O'Malley on subsection (f) are concerned, I have been thinking about the matter overnight.  I do agree with him, as I said, that it is difficult exactly to limit the effect of this subsection, as drafted.  It could apply to situations in which it would be very difficult to determine what were the ancillary goods&mdash;for instance, in so far as one needs a tank of petrol to set a car in motion should the price of the first fill be included is a question that could create difficulties.  I would prefer on Report Stage to remove the subsection and make specific requirements in relation to the areas where abuse can arise under the provisions of section 10 of the Bill which deals with marking orders.  In that case one can introduce by order &mdash;which would have to be discussed in the House again&mdash;specific requirements either in relation to all goods or to particular goods.  Probably it would be the latter if one were dealing with the matter covered in subsection (f) of this section.</P>

      <P>Again, on this section a person indicating the price or charge for goods, services or accommodation will commit an offence if such is false or misleading. One question in respect of which a great many people are frequently misled is that of whether or not VAT is included in a price.  The practice appears to vary in this respect.  Most firms quote an inclusive price; some tend to add VAT afterwards.  It is noticeable particularly in hotels where there is the further complication in that some of them add a service charge of 10 per cent, 12½ per cent, <Col N="619" /> sometimes 15 per cent.  More of them do not.  Most Irish people are not seriously misled because they tend to expect this but it is a frequent cause of complaint amongst foreign visitors that the practice here varies so greatly. For example, if a hotel advertises that it offers accommodation, say, bed and breakfast, at £7 a night many foreigners believe that that is what they have to pay and are rather taken aback to find that they end up paying approximately £9 because VAT has been added to the £7 at, I think, 10 per cent and additionally a service charge is added at rates which vary between 10 per cent and 15 per cent. This often means that the price of the accommodation is approximately 25 per cent higher than they might reasonably have anticipated.  It seems to me that this is the type of section which should lay down some guidelines for that type of situation which is very misleading to the public generally and particularly to foreign visitors.  The degree of error, if one may put it this way, to which a person can be subjected can be as much as 25 per cent, which is significant.  In other words, it has to be made clear whether VAT or its equivalent or a service charge has been included or has to be added.  If these items have to be added, it must be indicated.  That is not so here, and it would be helpful if there was some provision in the Bill to ensure that it would be done. The section does not appear to include it, although it should be provided in some way.  I appreciate it would create difficulties in certain respects but it is important it should be done if at all possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another matter the Parliamentary Secretary should bear in mind is that the section does not apply charges to goods.  It applies to services and accommodation.  I have been talking about accommodation, including hotels and such like, but in relation to services, it would apply to professional services.  Somebody may indicate that he believes he can provide a particular professional service at a particular rate and he does not want to see a situation developing in <Col N="620" /> which he is liable to prosecution if he charges a different rate.</P>
    <P>As somebody who has practised for many years, I can say that one often embarks on a task in the belief that it would take a certain amount of work in a certain time only to discover when half way through that there was some complication which necessitates a great deal more work and consequently a higher charge.  On a strict reading of the section, it is quite possible that somebody who finds himself in that situation, a doctor, a vet, a solicitor or a barrister, conceivably can be prosecuted.  The Parliamentary Secretary will agree that that would be undesirable and unfair in such circumstances and, therefore, it would be better to have some from of amendment to make it clear that somebody in that situation would not be liable to prosecution and that there would be no question of his contravening the section if he found he had to revise his charge for the particular service due to circumstances of which he had been unaware when he commenced the service.</P>
    <P>For instance, some types of professional services may go on for many years through nobody's fault and it may well be that the rate of charge appropriate at the end of the service would be significantly higher than when the task was originally undertaken.  As well, some allowance should be made in these days of excessive inflation for that type of situation.  I should be glad to hear the Parliamentary Secretary's views on such problems.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The difficulties in relation to VAT and service charges and the need to have these made known to the consumer at the time of purchase or service can be dealt with under the powers requiring mark orders under section 10, under which specific information must be given in relation to a particular trade description.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Would not section 10 apply only to goods?  You cannot mark a service, and in these circumstances section 10 would be hardly <Col N="621" /> appropriate to hotel accommodation, for instance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 11 would cover a service.  It could be made the subject of an order.  I have not got the terms of such an order with me but one has been made under the Prices Acts in relation to charges being included.  The problem referred to by the Deputy in relation to VAT has been the subject of an order. There can be a prosecution.  Because it has been raised, I will ask the prices inspector to report on the enforcement of the order applying to the giving of prices as including VAT on a uniform basis.</P>
      <P>On the question of service charges, I think that can be dealt with by the use of powers contained in section 11. It could also be dealt with, possibly, under paragraph (f) of this section. It is possible that we could retain that and amend it in a precise form. As far as professional charges are concerned, there would be a lag between the initiation and the performance of a service and this does not apply only to professional services.  The advertisement would not be applicable if the goods or services were sold at a later date&mdash;the relevant time is the time of the placing of the advertisement. Professional people do not have to advertise their charges anyway but if they do so in the knowledge of the standard charges in relation to particular tasks they may subsequently alter the charges upwards because of necessary extra work and in such cases it is open to them to insert a saving clause in the advertisement to let the consumer know that the charge will be subject to revision in certain stated circumstances.  The taking of that simple precaution ensures that professional people will not get into the difficulties envisaged by the Deputy.</P>

      <P>In page 6, subsection (1), line 46, after &ldquo;provision&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;, in the course or for the purposes of a trade, business or profession,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is to ensure that as in the case of the application of trade descriptions in the sale of goods the Bill will not apply to private non-business advertisements but only to advertisements inserted in the course of trade or business.  It would be undesirable that purely private advertisements inserted by people not engaged in trade in the field to which the advertisements relate should be the subject of criminal proceedings and therefore this amendment was introduced for the sake of clarity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>This brings us back to the point we talked about last night. This Bill seems to limit the provisions of the Merchandise Marks Acts generally to things that are done in the course of trade, business or profession and the 1887 Act seems, on the face of it, to extend to sales generally.  This amendment is another indication of the desire to limit the application of these Acts to a smaller category of transactions than was the case originally.  The Parliamentary Secretary has said that it was his belief that the 1887 Act and subsequent Acts were intended to apply only to a transaction carried out in the course of trade.  I pointed out to him last night a number of instances where it might well be desirable that things done otherwise than in the course of trade would be covered by and have the protection of this and other Acts which this is amending.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The insertion, for example, of a private advertisement in the case of somebody trying to sell his car or <Col N="623" /> goods which were his own property and in respect of which he was not a trader could be misleading and have serious consequences for a purchaser or consumer who was misled by that advertisement.  The Parliamentary Secretary may not be taking into account that a trader in a particular line of business who inserted a misleading advertisement or made a false trade description would be still available at his place of business for some sort of action to be taken afterwards. On the other hand, somebody who has a one-off private sale may well not be there in future and may move to some other part of the country or, indeed, to another country and the need for the protection of a consumer against misleading advertisements or false trade descriptions on the part of a non-trader is still, in my view, in spite of what the Parliamentary Secretary has said, at least as great as the need for protection against permanent traders with a permanent place of business.</P>
    <P>There will be a somewhat anomalous situation here for newspapers. They could be placed in the very difficult position of having to decide when accepting a particular advertisement whether it is being inserted in the course of trade, business or profession or whether it is a purely private or non-trading advertisement.  They could be in a situation of committing an offence if the advertisement was a misleading trading advertisement but not committing an offence&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>There is a limited saver for them in the sense that if they could not know they would not commit an offence.  Perhaps they could know.  Would the Parliamentary Secretary not agree that it is somewhat anomalous that a private individual who sets out to mislead is exempt from the provisions of this Act and, on the other hand, a trader who may not be attempting to mislead at all and who may have no intention to defraud could be penalised under the provisions of this Act?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>In any event, a private individual who is engaged in activity that is fraudulent can be prosecuted for fraud under the long-standing legislative criminal provisions against fraud.  Furthermore, if a private individual engages in the sort of activities envisaged by the Deputy the person who is the victim of his blandishments still has the possibility of taking a civil action against the private individual who sold him something on the strength of a misleading advertisement and can recover damages which will be decided by the court on the merits of the case.  If this amendment were not included and this section were interpreted in the manner envisaged by Deputy O'Malley, it could put the private individual wishing to avail of a box number or some other form of advertisement in a very difficult situation.  He would be subject to the same stringent restrictions as somebody publishing an advertisement in the course of business.  He would be subject as an individual to powers of inspection, duties of care to avoid all due negligence in relation to any untruth in the advertisements he publishes and also to the provisions in relation to the burden of proof of the truth of the advertisement.  It would impose such a burden on any private individual wishing to insert such an advertisement that he simply would not do so.  It is legitimate to make a distinction between a private individual who would be publishing an advertisement once and who has not the time or expertise to make sure that everything is right and a person doing so in the course of a trade who has the opportunity to make sure that his advertisement is propertly framed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In any event, it would be very difficult to extend the provisions of the legislation in relation to misleading and false advertisements to private advertisements because the problems of enforcement would be very great.  This would represent a wasteful diversion of the limited enforcement resources if one were to spend time going after private advertisements which are onceoff jobs.  It would be far better to confine the legislation to advertisements in the business or trade fields which are likely to be repeated and <Col N="625" /> to give rise to continued abuse if the misleading or false practice continues.</P>

This right to injunction exists effectively in common law. The intention of the Bill however in the matter of misleading advertisements is to provide an injunction facility to a person who, though himself not likely to be injured, fears that members of the public could suffer loss, damage or injury.  The wording in lines 52 to 55 was, therefore, considered inappropriate and the revised wording is considered more appropriate to the innovation being made here.

Amendment No. 17 overrules the present practice in the High Court or changes it because it says that notice will have to be given before an order under this subsection will be made. In the normal way notice is not given on the making of an interim injunction. The Parliamentary Secretary seems to justify amendment No. 15 on the grounds that he does not want to interfere with the existing practice but then he introduces amendment No. 17 which does interfere with it.</P>

      <P>In so far as a person suffers damage himself, existing practice is not interfered with and there is no requirement as to notice being inserted in this situation.  In these amendments we are introducing a new provision whereby a person who is not subject to the damage himself but who fears that damage may be caused to others may seek an injunction. In that situation it is desirable that there should be provision as <Col N="627" /> to notice even in interim or interlocutary injunctions.</P>
      <P>Perhaps it would be in order for me to formally move amendment No. 17 in that context.  The purpose here is to avoid a situation where, for instance, a trade competitor or some person acting in a mischievous fashion might, without any damage being suffered to himself and therefore not in the process of redressing any in-justice against himself, seeks an interim injunction and thereby, without any undue cause having been produced, obtains such an interim injunction pending a full hearing of the case.</P>
      <P>This sort of provision, without special provisions as to notice, could be the subject of abuse.  Obviously, it would not be the subject of abuse if the person suffered damage himself because it would be right to redress a situation which was causing him damage but when he was only acting on behalf of other people it was necessary to introduce this further requirement as to notice.</P>

      <P>This is one of the sections that has given rise to legitimate concern on the part of manufacturers, advertisers, trade associations and traders generally.  I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to consider the consequences of what is proposed here, even taking into account the amendments he has made. I do not think the amendments are that significant. They do not change to any great extent the potentially harmful consequences of this section.  Subsection (3) gives power to stop advertising that could be allegedly potentially misleading.  The first three words are &ldquo;Any person may&rdquo; and the position will remain the same even under amendment No. 15 in the name of the Minister.  It will still be: &ldquo;Any person may&rdquo; at the discretion of the High Court be granted an order prohibiting the publication, or the further publication, of an advertisement the publication of which is or would be a contravention of subsection (1) of this section.  That is how subsection (3) (a) will read if amendment No. 15 is accepted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="628" /> I draw the attention of the Parliamentary Secretary to the potentially serious consequences of putting a provision in our statute law to the effect that any person may apply to the High Court for such an order.  At the moment the High Court will not hear an application from someone who does not have an interest of some kind in the matter about which he is seeking to litigate.  I cannot go down to the High Court and apply for an order against someone in respect of something that will not affect me.  That has been the rule of the law for many centuries because the courts do not want to encourage people who are vexatious or interfering and so the courts will not allow one to take an action in respect of a matter that does not affect one or potentially damage one.</P>
    <P>There was a very interesting example in Britain of this recently in the very famous case related to the Post Office strike.  An individual sought to obtain an order from the High Court in London prohibiting the strike on the grounds that it was a breach of the law&mdash;I think common consent agreed that it was&mdash;because it is necessary in Britain, as it is necessary here, where an individual is trying to take an action that does not relate to him personally in any specific way to get the consent of the Attorney General in Britain. Mr. Silkin refused his consent for reasons with which one might well disagree and in a very historic judgment three judges of the Court of Appeal upheld the right of the individual. There is now tremendous controversy as to whether an individual should have that right without the fiat or consent of the Attorney General.  The decision has been appealed to the House of Lords and there is a 50/50 chance that the House of Lords will overrule the Court of Appeal thereby restoring the position to what it was originally.</P>
    <P>The reason why there is a good deal of interest on one side is that this is opening the way for all kinds of cranky individuals to take vexatious actions in their own names in regard to matters that really do not affect them at all. Here the exact opposite concept is being introduced into our law.  I see no objection to subsection (3) (a) in its <Col N="629" /> original form or in its amended form provided it is not the right of every crank to come along to the High Court and start looking for these orders.  To get over that difficulty my amendment No. 16 has been tabled.  Under that a person can take action only if he gets the consent in writing of the Director of Consumer Affairs.  Naturally, being a responsible person, he will give his consent only where he knows the individual concerned has some valid ground for going to the High Court. The order should not be available to every member of the public by and large.  This would prevent frivolous and vexatious applications.</P>
    <P>There is, too, great danger of damage being deliberately done by competitors or nominees of competitors, men of straw being put up on the quiet to interfere with an advertising campaign in regard to some new product which, if the campaign were successful, would seriously damage some existing manufacturer. The Parliamentary Secretary must realise it is not in the public interest to give every individual in the country the right to go to the High Court seeking orders of this kind.  Even if the order were not granted the very fact that the application had been made, with allegations in court about the advertising possibly forcing the defendant to undertake withholding the advertising until the court could look into it further could, even if the applicant ultimately loses the case, cause immeasurable damage to the advertiser who might be perfectly legitimate.  There is provision in subsection (b) that the court may require the person to give certain security but, unfortunately, the sort of people who make applications like this are very often those who could not give any security.  If an individual believes he will be damaged and can show that he will be damaged by the advertising then, by all means, let him apply. That is his right and has been for centuries.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, what is proposed by the Parliamentary Secretary goes far beyond the common law concept of allowing someone who is injured or can be injured the right to apply for an injunction to the High Court.  The <Col N="630" /> provision suggested by the Parliamentary Secretary, however, could be used by unscrupulous manufacturers and suppliers to cause difficulty and loss to a competitor.  The words used are &ldquo;Any person may&rdquo; and that person could be a man of straw with no interest whatever.  The way I have suggested out of the difficulty is to leave the right but make it a restricted right.  Allow it to be exercised only if the Director of Consumer Affairs agrees it should be exercised.  He will be in touch with the situation.  He will know whether or not there are reasonable grounds for going to the High Court to get the advertising stopped. Tremendous damage could be done and this subsection will be used by all kinds of unscrupulous people for all the wrong reasons if it is let stand as the Minister originally had it or if it is amended.  The easiest way to get over it is to accept the substance of my amendment No. 16, to allow those types of applications to be made to stop advertising only with the consent in writing of the Director of Consumer Affairs.</P>
    <P>I am told by the Chair that my amendment No. 16 will be out of order if I agree to amendment No. 15. I suggest that is only very technically so because amendment No. 16 proposes to insert certain words after &ldquo;Any person may&rdquo;.  Those words are retained in amendment No. 15 so that amendment No. 16 could come in even if amendment No. 15 is accepted.  I ask the Parliamentary Secretary to agree to that in order to prevent abuse of the provisions of subsection (3) which in my view are too wide and which will give rise to harmful, vexatious and frivolous litigation which can have very serious consequences for manufacturers and advertisers.</P>

      <P>The right of the individual to have access to the courts in this sort of situation, particularly officers of a consumer association, should be safeguarded.  There are dangers in accepting Deputy O'Malley's amendment which would leave the right of access of the consumer association purely at the arbitrary decision of the Director of Consumer Affairs who is only an individual and <Col N="631" /> a public official who may have one concept of what is false or misleading which may not coincide in all particulars with what either the individual, the consumer organisation or, in the final analysis, the courts might decide. There is a danger that he would refuse to allow an application to go ahead within the terms of Deputy O'Malley's amendment in an unreasonable fashion which would prevent this section having the effect it is intended to have.</P>
      <P>It is important to remember that an injunction of this sort would only be granted if the advertisement is false or misleading&mdash;that is the first requirement&mdash;and which is likely to cause loss, damage or injury to members of the public in a material degree.  All of those considerations have to be established before the order is granted.  I believe there are grave dangers in saying that the director alone may decide who shall have access to the High Court, which, after all, is a judicial body which is set up to act in a fair manner to take into account both the needs of the consumer and of traders in order to stop a practice which is false or misleading and thereby likely to cause loss, damage or injury to members of the public to a material degree.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This interposition in Deputy O'Malley's amendment of an administrative officer, who, ultimately, is responsible to the Oireachtas and to the majority in the community, between the right of the individual, who may be in a minority, to get access to the courts under the law, within the terms of this section, is not a desirable situation.  The provision in the section requires that in all cases notice must be given before any action is taken by the courts, including applications for interlocutory injunctions, to the person against whom the injunction is sought so that he can produce evidence to the courts to show that his advertisement is not false or misleading before any decision is taken. That protection plus the power which the court has to require the lodgment of money in the court by the person seeking the injunction provides very adequate protection.  One can be sufficiently confident in the sense of <Col N="632" /> justice of the judges of the High Court to be sure that they will not allow vexatious applications to proceed without imposing the requirement in relation to giving such security, including the lodgment of money in court for such amount as the judge thinks proper in relation to the undertaking and, having done so, any vexatious application will be sufficiently discouraged.</P>
    <P>It should also be borne in mind that even if the damage is done there is an action against the person applying for malicious prosecution or for tort of that sort resting with the person affected.  There would be grave disadvantages, taking all of those safeguards together, in ensuring that only applicants, who have been cleared in advance by the Director of Consumer Affairs, should have access to the High Court in the exercise of the power to seek an injunction being conferred under this section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Parliamentary Secretary realise that this concept of allowing anybody to object was contained in the Planning Act, 1963?  Any person could object to a planning application and any person could appeal against a decision of a planning authority.  It was found, in practice, that that was too wide a power and the Oireachtas decided last year to limit that right of appeal and that right of objection to people who had an interest and who could in some small way be affected by a decision of a planning authority or the decision on appeal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There were other provisions made, such as the necessity to make a deposit when one was appealing, to stop the vexatious and frivolous appeals which were taken under the old Planning Act because it was too wide and because it was expressed in terms similar to those in subsection (3) of this section. After gaining that experience in planning and the Oireachtas having rectified it in relation to planning, the Parliamentary Secretary is now asking us to go back to the old 1963 system which we know was wrong, was abused and was used by cranks to cause damage and loss.  This subsection will be used by cranks to cause damage <Col N="633" /> and loss except that in this case it will be used principally by competitors to damage their opponents in business. That is wrong.</P>
    <P>I cannot accept what the Parliamentary Secretary says about the Director of Consumer Affairs having the decision. He only has the decision as to whether or not the advertisement should be stopped.  That is not what I am suggesting.  I am saying the application should not be made to the High Court or should not be allowed to the High Court unless the director certifies in writing that there are some grounds for it.  He is not deciding whether it is misleading or not or he is not making any final decision.  He is just certifying, in the same way as the Attorney General does in relation to the whole spectrum of actions and applications, that there are some grounds for it and that it is not wholly frivolous or vexatious.  The Attorney General has to do that every day of the week in relation to a large number of things.</P>
    <P>I gave a recent example of how this matter became very controversial in Britain in regard to Mr. Silkin's refusal to give a certificate to the people who applied for an injunction in relation to the proposed Post Office strike. Mr. Silkin took the political view&mdash; which he was entitled to take because he is a member of the British Government and an elected member of Parliament&mdash;that it was in the public interest that the High Court in London should not be given the opportunity to make injunctions in a trade dispute matter of that kind.  He said he was prepared to answer to the House of Commons and to the people for it but he was not prepared to answer to the courts for his decision because the decision was a political one.</P>
    <P>We are now putting ourselves in a very tricky area here, and I think we are wrong.  We have learned by experience of the Planning Act since 1964, when it came into effect, that it is wrong to give cranks and competitors the unfettered right to hold up a legitimate development, and if it is wrong in planning it is wrong here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>This is not a situation of legitimate development.  We are talking here of an advertisement which is false or misleading and liable to cause damage or injury to members of the public.  There is a radical difference between holding up a legitimate development in the planning field and satisfying the court, having given notice to the producing party, that the advertisement is false or misleading and likely to cause damage.  The burden of proof, before any injunction would be granted, is far more severe than the burden imposed on a third party objector in the former situation in relation to planning where all he had to do was write in and object, no more, and the whole procedure would be delayed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary may not be familiar with the court's work.  The Parliamentary Secretary rather innocently says that this power only applies to advertisements which are false or misleading to a material degree.  I know, but that does not stop me making an application in the morning in respect of an advertisement that I know very well is not false or misleading but is part of a campaign by a competitor of mine to launch a new product on the market which I know will damage my sales if it goes through.  Therefore, I go down to the High Court and send in my counsel to make an application under subsection (3) of this section, and before the court decides whether to give the injunction or not, it has to decide whether the advertisement is false or misleading to a material degree.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It may take the court a month to find that out.  All kinds of experts may have to be called from Britain, America, Germany and France to give evidence on this.  An affidavit is put in by one person saying this proposed advertisement is likely to be false or misleading.  Because the notice is given, the firm against whom the application is made put in an affidavit saying that, in their view, it is not false or misleading.  The controversy may be about matters of tremendous technicality that the judge may not know the first thing about. <Col N="635" /> He is not in a position from his own limited knowledge of these things to say A is right or B is right, and he says: &ldquo;I will have to get expert independent evidence to assist me in coming to a decision.&rdquo;  It transpires that Professor So-and-So in Los Angeles is the leading expert on this. He is sent for and comes a month later.  In the meantime, the normal practice would be that the court would say: &ldquo;Pending our decision on this, it would be advisable that these advertisements were not published.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Even if the proposed advertiser wins this matter in the end and if the injunction is refused, it may be that the delay of a week, a month or two months will have destroyed entirely his effort to launch a new product and that the frivolous or vexatious efforts of his competitors, not acting in their own name but acting through some non-entity, some man of straw, as their private nominee, will have had the most appallingly damaging effect on a perfectly legitimate effort to launch a new product and to advertise it nationally. I do not think we should be in that situation, and the way of getting round it is that the Director of Consumer Affairs, while he may not agree with the application being made, should be asked to certify that at least he is satisfied that it is not vexatious or frivolous, that the person concerned has some interest in it and that he has some grounds to go on, even though they may not be enough to secure the injunction.</P>

      <P>and <b>Mr. Keaveney</b> asked the Minister for Social Welfare whether it is the policy of his Department to disallow payment of unemployment benefit to married women with young children on the grounds that they are not available for work because in his Department's view these women must stay home and care for the children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department as such do not have any policy in relation to claims for unemployment benefit from married women with young children.  All claims for benefit, including those for unemployment benefit from married women with young children, are decided by statutorily appointed deciding officers. Each claim is decided in the light of the relevant statutory conditions and of the particular facts and circumstances pertaining to it.  In considering a claim for unemployment benefit a deciding officer is obliged to determine, on the evidence available to him, whether a claimant is &ldquo;available for employment&rdquo; which is one of the statutory conditions applying to that benefit.  A person who is dissatisfied with the decision of a deciding officer has the right of appeal to an appeals officer.  Both deciding officers and appeals officers are statutorily appointed and are independent in the exercise of their statutory functions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that there is quite a spate of this analysis of claims not only of married women but of others?  This question concerns married women.  Is he aware that there is this undue incidence of married women being refused or cut <Col N="641" /> off from unemployment benefit?  Is he further aware that in the investigations surrounding these cases it has been highlighted by questions by the investigating officer?  Is he aware that their insistence that the children could not be properly looked after regardless of what arrangements might have been made seems to have been the kernel of the case against such people who have ultimately been refused by the appeals officer and by the deciding officer?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that I have no function in this matter.  I cannot interfere.  There is no direction or policy in this matter. The deciding officers and the appeals officers are appointed and they have complete autonomy as to whether or not a person should be allowed benefit.  They have to take into consideration the availability of employment, and there is also the other qualification, that of seeking employment. As has been said by the Parliamentary Secretary before, a Minister has no function in this.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>While it is accepted that in the strict confines of this proposal a Minister would not have any function, might I ask the Minister whether he would inquire into this general situation which I know to exist in my own constituency? Undoubtedly, the effect is that married women with children are not getting unemployment benefit, and it seems to be on the basis that their children require their care and that they are not available for work, whereas this is not so in many cases that I am aware of.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government if he has instructed Galway County Council that demountable dwellings for elderly people in rural areas are not to be connected to electricity supply where the cost of connection exceeds £200; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not so instructed Galway County Council; indeed, I have indicated to the local authority that I am opposed in principle to the provision of dwellings without adequate lighting and cooking facilities.  I did, however, inform the county council, in May of last year, that where the cost of the electricity connection to a demountable dwelling exceeds £200, my prior approval to the expenditure should be sought.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister say whether he has received a request from Galway County Council for approval in any case where a demountable dwelling was involved or whether he has received a request from them in respect of a dwelling other than a demountable one?  They are using this as an excuse although the Minister may not wish that to happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>No, no instructions were <Col N="654" /> issued to any housing authority and no specific case has been received from Galway County Council.  There was a suggestion made as a result of a resolution passed in June, 1976, that when the cost of electricity is too high applicants should be given the option of accepting houses without electricity. I agree that there may be occasions where they want this done and I have approved it in circumstances where it was impossible to get electricity and where other sites cannot be obtained. There is no question of refusing Galway or any other county council permission to spend more than £200.  But in order to let local authorities know how serious I consider the need to get an electricity connection to houses at a reasonable cost, I have asked local authorities to select sites close to electricity supplies where this is possible rather than pay an excessive sum for connection to a demountable dwelling which is in a sense a temporary dwelling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister consider changing the recommended figure of £200 to something more realistic because the ESB are charging £200 per pole for installing a supply? A house would not be too far away from an electricity supply if it required only one pole to extend the supply to a dwelling.  The present figure is very low.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall keep it under review, but in view of a recent decision by the ESB it may be possible to have more people connected to the supply at a reasonable cost.  I want local authorities to erect dwellings where connections can readily be made rather than just taking the first site offered which may not be suitable for an electricity connection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>The recent decision by the ESB only applies where the cost is over £300.  I think the figure of £200 is unrealistic.  The Minister knows the ESB charge that for one pole.  The Minister should make the figure at least £400.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think this is as serious as the Deputy seems to think.  My reply to Deputy Molloy <Col N="655" /> was because of the change; it may possibly have to be adjusted now, but in no case so far have I refused sanction&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not accept that in general local authorities have endeavoured as far as possible to comply with the conditions laid down?  Does he not agree that they have to get prior approval from him where the cost exceeds £200 per demountable house and that this delays the supply of demountable dwellings to people badly needing them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it has any bearing on the matter.  A local authority have only to notify me that under special circumstances they require something to be done.  Galway County Council have, in fact, provided a number of demountable dwellings without electricity in very remote areas of the county.  If they make a reasonable case&mdash;so far all their cases have been reasonable&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>In no case will they be held up for more than a week.  I shall have a decision back to them before they have the demountable dwellings on the site and they are aware of this.</P>

The matter is being considered and at present a Departmental inspector is discussing the outcome of it with the council.

    <P>NOTES:</P>
    <P>1.  The allocations notified for new work are in respect of works advertised for tender at 22nd March, 1977, and for individual rural cottages and demountable dwellings to be commenced by 30th June, 1977.</P>
    <P>2.  Allocations generally will be reviewed after 30th June, 1977, and further allocations may be made, following the review, to cover expenditure on additional starts to be authorised later in the year.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that many housing authorities are completely dissatisfied with their allocations this year and that it will not be possible for them to make any more starts with a view to completion before Christmas this year due to the small capital allocation?</P>

      <P>The Deputy must not have his facts right or he would not have asked that supplementary because, in fact, money was given for commitments and money for new works and they were told that in June a further allocation would be considered according to how they were getting on.  In the case of Kerry County Council in 1972-73 they got only £449,000; in 1973-74, £585,000; in 1974, £715,000; in 1975, £1,372,000; in 1976, £1,710,000 and in 1977 to date £1,080,000.  How Deputy O'Leary can say that enough money has not been given&mdash;I assume he is talking about Kerry&mdash;beats me when the allocations have gone from £449,000 to an instalment for the first three months of £1,080,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1972, a scheme of grants was introduced for the adaptation of houses to accommodate physically handicapped persons.  In 1975, I extended the scope of the scheme to include work done where the local authority are satisfied that a member of a household suffers from severe mental handicap and that the existing accommodation in the house is inadequate for his proper treatment or segregation from other members of the household.  I do not propose to extend this scheme further at present.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  There is a big difference between moderately mentally handicapped people and people who are severely mentally handicapped. Moderately handicapped people are living in houses and working around them and they are absolutely no trouble at all.  The reason I included severely mentally handicapped people was that I realised they are a great cause of trouble in many houses and it was necessary to build additions for them.  It is unfair to try to press something which is still in the experimental stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not received such a request but in the context I have had an inquiry from Dublin Corporation as to the requirements for amendment of the Dublin Corporation (Markets, <i>et cetera)</i> Act, 1901, which is a Local Act. This request is being examined and I hope to have a reply issued to the corporation shortly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Pretty soon, I hope.  The Deputy must be aware that the matter was raised by way of letter on 5th January, 1977.  They asked me if I would let them know what will be required in order to have the Act amended so as to permit stall trading in Thomas Street.  It is not as simple as that, because it involves an amendment to an Act and also an amendment to regulations under another Act. There is no point in giving a reply which may not cover the full point. Under the 1901 Local Act it was done consequent on an arrangement entered into by the then Baron Iveagh with the corporation.  The corporation tenants are there.  It was done to prevent trading on the streets.  If the matter is to be legally correct the advice must be legally correct.  It is almost ready. There are one or two matters which have still to be cleared up.  I would say within the next fortnight or three weeks we should be able to notify Dublin Corporation as to what they will be required to do.  The matter will be over to them then to decide.</P>

This is an internal matter relating to British revenue and social welfare affairs and, since the proposed new regulations would apply generally to United Kingdom residents who have children living abroad, there would be no conflict with the terms of the convention between the two Governments for the avoidance of double taxation.

      <P>Deputies on the Special Committee will remember that we abolished the three categories of controlled drugs and replaced them with a single list in the Schedule.

      <P>I accept this amendment on behalf of the Opposition. Perhaps it might be as well to say at this stage that to a large extent our work on the Report Stage will be of a <Col N="685" /> mechanical nature because this Bill was gone through in very great detail in the Special Committee and argued about very cogently from different points of view by different Members. The Minister's amendments represent the outcome of that work and improvements in the legislation which represent a consensus of the Special Committee.  This amendment is typical of that situation.  It gives effect to the decision of the Minister and accepted by the committee that the different categories be abolished and that control be exercised in a completely different manner, that is, by simply having one list of harmful drugs.  Therefore, I accept this amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Very well.  I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 4, line 31, after &ldquo;smoking&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;or consumption or injection&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment will be clear to the House.  It is a repeat of an amendment I put down in the Special Committee.  It seemed to me to be necessary to elaborate a little on the definition of &ldquo;opium&rdquo;.  As the House will see, &ldquo;prepared opium&rdquo; is defined in the definition section as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;prepared opium&rdquo; means opium prepared for smoking and includes dross and any other residues remaining after opium has been smoked;</P>
      <P>At the Special Committee we on this side of the House argued that we thought it would be necessary to insert after &ldquo;smoking&rdquo; the words &ldquo;or consumption or injection&rdquo;.  The definition would then read:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;prepared opium&rdquo; means opium prepared for smoking or consumption or injection and includes dross and any other residues remaining after opium has been smoked;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been suggested to us that opium can be prepared for consumption in ways other than smoking, and it would <Col N="686" /> be desirable to cover these in the definition.  It is in continuing to uphold that view, which the Minister did not succeed in persuading us against, that we are now putting down this amendment to the definition of &ldquo;prepared opium&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>This was debated at length in the Special Committee and deals purely with opium.  Raw opium can be processed by two methods, for medicinal purposes or what is called prepared opium for smoking.  Medicinal opium is defined in the Schedule, as the Deputy will recognise, and it is not an issue here.  Prepared opium is a drug of abuse and is normally smoked.  It can also be orally consumed or even injected as the Deputy said.  In order to avoid giving a lengthy definition of prepared opium, including a description of the process by which it is made, legislation in most countries defines prepared opium simply as opium prepared for smoking. This is the internationally accepted definition of opium and drug abuse.</P>
      <P>I see clearly what Deputy Haughey wishes in his amendment that is that prepared opium can not only be smoked but it can be consumed or injected.  Needless to remark I agree with this and we want to prevent the consumption or injection of opium. I believe this is covered in section 16 (1) (a) and is further strengthened by section 16 (1) (b), which relates to amendment No. 22.  I ask Deputy Haughey to accept that section 16 is adequate to cover his point.  If we amended the definition of prepared opium to cover consumption or injection, as suggested by this amendment, we would be prohibiting the use of opium in any form, including medicinal opium, under section 16.</P>
      <P>I am at one with the Deputy in what he wants to achieve but it would make it impossible in respect of opium treated for medicinal purposes. As I said in reference to section 16, I believe it is covered here where it says:</P>
      <P>A person shall not&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  smoke or otherwise use prepared opium,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="687" /> With my amendment section 16 (1) (b) reads:</P>
    <P>A person shall not&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>(b) frequent a place used for the purpose of smoking or otherwise using prepared opium, or</P>
    <P>(c) have in his possession&mdash;</P>
    <P>and so on.  I believe the Deputy's intention is met by that section, including the fact that if we include in the definition for &ldquo;prepared opium&rdquo; what Deputy Haughey wants, it would make it impossible to use opium for medical purposes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Naturally I do not want to interfere with the legitimate and official use of opium and, while I am not entirely convinced about the way of doing it, I recognise that the new section 16, taken as a whole, is pretty comprehensive and on that basis I am, therefore, prepared to withdraw my amendment.</P>

      <P>&lsquo;registered druggist&rsquo; means a person registered in the register of registered druggists in Ireland established under the Pharmacy Act (Ireland), 1875, Amendment Act, 1890;</P>

I fully accepted the point the Deputy made which is, of course, also applied to pharmacists and the purpose of this amendment is simply to give effect to the consensus reached in the Special Committee.</P>

      <P>I gave an undertaking at the Special Committee to Deputy Haughey that I would re-examine the section with particular reference to the use of the phrase &ldquo;or other thing&rdquo; which he described as a very vague sort of phrase.  As I explained then, the phrase was inserted for the sake of tidiness and economy in the use of words and was intended to cover articles other than drugs, the possession of which would, in certain circumstances, be an offence under the Bill.  Having considered Deputy Haughey's argument against the vagueness of the phrase I found myself inclined to agree with him and the amendment now proposes to add specific items to the section.</P>

      <P>We appreciate the proposal by the Minister to make this amendment so that the first line of subsection (2) will now read: &ldquo;For the purpose of this Act any controlled drug, pipe, utensil or document&rdquo; and so on.  We discussed this at some length in the Special Committee and there was general agreement that the wording in the Bill was altogether too wide and too sweeping. The form of words the Minister now proposes meets the situation.  The subsection is designed to help out the whole approach to the control of the <Col N="690" /> possession of drugs more effectively. The problem is how are we to ensure the legislation is effective and the Garda and others concerned can effectively implement control while at the same time not wishing to interfere unduly or unnecessarily with the rights and freedom of the individual.  It is the sort of dilemma which confronts us right through and it is quite legitimate to argue very strongly on both sides.  It is quite legitimate to argue for the preservation of the maximum amount of freedom and the minimum of interference by the authorities in the ordinary daily lives of ordinary people.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, it is equally legitimate to argue that we have a situation which must be dealt with and, if it is to be dealt with effectively, this legislation must have some teeth.  Subsection (2) as amended will be regarded as acceptable by most reasonable people.  It will still be an offence to have a controlled drug, pipe, utensil or document and these are the sort of things with which the legislation deals throughout.  In making this amendment the Minister has met the situation reasonably and I accept the Minister's amendment and withdraw my amendment No.8.</P>

      <P>In page 5, line 53, to delete &ldquo;may&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;shall after consultation with the appropriate registration authority&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>We adverted at some length to this matter in the Special Committee. Section 4 is a very important section. It deals with the making of regulations by the Minister in respect of a very important aspect of this Bill.  The section as it stands states:</P>
      <P>(1)  The Minister may make regulations enabling any person, or persons of a prescribed class or description, in prescribed circumstances or for prescribed purposes, to possess a controlled drug subject to such conditions (if any), or subject to and in accordance with such licence, as may be prescribed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(2)  Subject to section 13 of this Act, the Minister shall exercise his power to make regulations under this section so as to secure that it is not unlawful under this Act for a practitioner or pharmacist to have a controlled drug in his possession for the purpose of his profession or business. <Col N="692" /> (3) It shall be lawful for any person, or a person of a class or description specified in regulations under this section, to have in his possession in prescribed circumstances or for prescribed purposes, as may be appropriate, a controlled drug specified therein, provided that any conditions specified in the regulations or attached to a licence granted under this Act and applicable in the particular case are complied with by him.</P>
    <P>The approach of the Bill is to make it an offence to have controlled drugs in one's possession.  This section is necessary to make sure that people who legitimately have controlled drugs in their possession will not be liable for penalties under the Bill.  It is a sensible way of dealing with the situation to make possession generally an offence and then to exempt those who should be exempted by Ministerial regulations.</P>
    <P>The regulations will also be very important.  It is necessary that they are appropriate to the circumstances and that all those classes of people who will be exempted from the Bill will be correctly ascertained, the circumstances in which they are exempted and so on.  This will call for specialised knowledge of the circumstances and, in particular, of professional practices. The Minister, statutorily, makes the regulations but the people drawing them up for his signature will have to be accurately and comprehensively informed about the situation from the point of view of ensuring that all those who should be excluded are excluded and that the circumstances in which they are excluded are accurately described.  They will also have to ensure that the regulations will not inadvertently permit somebody into the exclusion circle who should not be in it.  It is right, from every point of view, that the regulations be accurately drawn up and that they be drawn up on the basis of the full knowledge of the circumstances prevailing.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in making the regulations, should consult the authorities and bodies who would be in <Col N="693" /> a position to state clearly who should be included and who should not and in what circumstances.  I want to make it mandatory on the Minister to make regulations and also to make it mandatory on him in making the regulations to consult with the appropriate registration authorities.  Those authorities are those which we have, by amendment No. 3 written into the Bill, the registration authorities for dentists, dispensing chemists and druggists, medical practitioners, pharmaceutical chemists and veterinary surgeons.  It is very desirable that those bodies should be consulted about the making of the regulations.</P>
    <P>The Minister may reply that, of course, in the normal course of events the Department would have these consultations and that they would consult the authorities concerned.  If that is the case, it is as well to write it out clearly and definitely in the Bill that consultation with these appropriate registration authorities shall take place and that it shall not be left to the Minister and the Department to decide when they should and should not consult.</P>
    <P>My amendment seeks to change the section from giving the Minister the discretion whether or not to make regulations.  The wording of the section at present is that the Minister may make regulations, whereas the effect of my amendment will be to compel him to make the regulations. The wording in my amendment is &ldquo;shall&rdquo; and in the section it is &ldquo;may&rdquo;.  My amendment stipulates that the Minister shall consult with the appropriate authorities before he makes the regulations because the livelihood of those different people and the carrying out of their duties will be affected by those regulations. It is only fair that those authorities, who are responsible for them and to whom they are responsible should be consulted in the way I suggest in the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>The effect of the Deputy's amendment is twofold.  He suggests, firstly, that we should make it obligatory on the Minister to make regulations specifying the class of persons <Col N="694" /> who are not acting unlawfully when they have drugs in their possession. Secondly, he wants to require the Minister to consult with, in the words of the amendment, &ldquo;the appropriate registration authority&rdquo; before making the regulation.  I would like to take these two points separately.</P>
      <P>I do not believe the first is necessary. It would be too restrictive.  I will admit that as far as subsection (1) on its own is concerned, it could mean that the Minister need not exercise his discretion at all to make the regulations, and this would make the prohibition on possession in section 3 absolute, that is, that no person could have a controlled drug in his possession in any circumstances.  However, the subsection does not stand on its own.  It is qualified by subsection (2) which, in respect of practitioners and pharmacists, obliges the Minister to make it lawful for these practitioners and pharmacists to have drugs in their possession for the purpose of practising their profession.  It is essential that they should have these drugs in their possession and on a regular basis.  There are others who may need to handle controlled drugs in certain circumstances, but I think that it would be unwise to oblige the Minister to make regulations in regard to them and that he must be left the discretion of deciding what persons should be covered.</P>
      <P>I think I made it clear in the Special Committee that in relation to consultation the regulations to be made under section 4 would be very general in scope, that they would apply to a wide category of people such as gardaí, customs officers, licensed traders, those who would be engaged in transport, carriers, messenger boys, a whole variety of people to whom it would be justified to give a licence. These people to whom I have referred would not be any special concern of professional registration bodies and it would be inappropriate to seek the view, say, of the Medical Registration Council on provisions which do not concern doctors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister will have to consult a large number of bodies about regulations under the section and it would <Col N="695" /> be very unwise not to listen to any views they would have to offer as to whether the interests of their members are being adequately protected.  On Committee Stage I said I would consider introducing into this section a general provision requiring the Minister to have consultation before making regulations.  This has been discussed with the parliamentary draftsman, but because of the wide and varied interests which might be involved on different occasions in making regulations many provisions of the Bill on consultation would have to be in the most general terms, and I would see no advantage in adding such a provision to the section.  I would suggest we leave it to the good sense of the Minister for Health to consult all interests involved before making the regulations.</P>
    <P>That would, of course include the professional bodies who are covered under subsection (2) and those still undetermined; we have a broad idea of the type of person who would be concerned under subsection (3).  Therefore, the Minister must make regulations in respect of practitioners and pharmacists but in respect of other people who would not be practitioners or professional people, it would be at the discretion of the Minister because in contemplating it now, one might be able to say what type of person would be involved, but there are many others who might also be involved, and I gave some examples of those a few minutes ago.  All in all, I think the matter is fairly well covered.  If subsection (1) was to stand on its own, Deputy Haughey's amendment would be valid, but it is qualified by subsection (2) to the utmost extent and under subsection (3) to an extent as well.</P>

I have listened very carefully to the Minister and even though he states that subsequent sections of the Bill where the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; is used, more or less take care of any problem about not having &ldquo;shall&rdquo; in line 1 of section 4, I cannot see, at this moment anyway, why the Minister cannot accept that as an amendment, the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; after &ldquo;consultation with the appropriate registration authority&rdquo; since in subsequent paragraphs he has the word the Minister &ldquo;shall&rdquo; exercise his power.  Why not exercise it all the way through?  The Minister is right that we can rely on the Minister's good sense to consult with the appropriate authorities.  If he agrees with this in principle and that it would be a foolish Minister who would not consult with the appropriate authorities, why not include it in the Bill?  You might get some Minister who might not be sensible&mdash;I will not use the words &ldquo;mad doctor&rdquo;&mdash;or somebody who considered he was the authority, who thought he knew it all and would not consult.  I would like to see a safeguard built in that it should be mandatory for the Minister to consult with appropriate authorities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment is not as wide as the Minister seems to think it is, because the amendment talks about a registration authority. The amendment says that &ldquo;the regulations shall be made after consultation with the appropriate registration authority&rdquo;.  &ldquo;Registration authority&rdquo; is defined in the definition section, page 4, lines 37 to 39:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;registration authority&rdquo; means such one of the following as the context requires namely, the Dental Board, the Medical Registration Council and the Veterinary Council.</P>
      <P>Therefore the amendment would only compel the Minister to consult with one of that very limited number of specific bodies.  In replying the Minister more or less made my argument for me because he admitted that the innate revelation seems to be that the Minister for Health would, of course, consult.  I would not expect that the Minister should have to consult about a nondescript category of people or some person or category that he could not define.  All I am asking in the amendment is that where this specific number of professional bodies are concerned or where the regulations are to apply to these members of these professional bodies, he would consult these professional bodies.  I think that is ensured by the wording.  Taking the new section 4 in conjunction with the definition section, it is clear that the need or compulsion to consult would apply only where the Minister was making regulations affecting these professions and he would have to consult only three bodies.  From that point of view I would have thought that the inclusion of these words in section 4 (1) would have been desirable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not a good idea to legislate on the basis of: &ldquo;Well, do not worry about it.  You know very well that a good, sensible Minister would do such and such.&rdquo;  If we proceed on that basis we need not legislate at all.  We could say: &ldquo;Well, Ministers are responsible people and if by some mischance or <Col N="698" /> some quirk of the electoral system they turn out to be irresponsible people there is a good, wise body of professional civil servants there to make sure that they do not behave irresponsibly.&rdquo; That is not good enough.  We should not accept that situation.  We should legislate to ensure, whether a Minister is responsible or irresponsible, and whether the cadre of civil servants in the Department are reasonable people or autocratic, dictatorial, democratic or co-operative, whatever they may be, that the legislation lays down how they behave.  I have always distrusted the argument at this stage of a Bill when the Minister, all sweet reasonableness and very often a decent man, appeals to the House and says: &ldquo;Oh, look, let me get my Bill through.  You know very well that this will work out all right, everybody is going to be sensible and there is no need to bring the thing down to the last detail in the legislation.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is not the right way to go about our business.  We should legislate for the situation in full and make sure that if the Minister is to do something the legislation says that he shall do it and how he shall do it and in so far as it is an important issue it will not be left to his goodwill or his feeling of co-operation or otherwise.  The Minister knows that we have had for some reason or other a tradition of very strong-minded people in the Department of Health in the past, people who from time to time came to have uneasy relations with the different professions.</P>
    <P>It is probably inevitable in the normal way that Ministers from time to time would come into conflict with professional bodies on different issues and the relationships might not always be harmonious and smooth and completely satisfactory.  The Minister at any time might feel perfectly entitled not to consult a particular professional body about any matter.  There have been times in the past when relations between the occupants of the ministerial chair and the Department of Health were strained.  In such a situation a temptation to the Minister to ignore a particular professional body might prevail. That cannot happen if the matter is dealt with specifically as I am suggesting it should be in the section. <Col N="699" /> With that final appeal to the Minister and cribbed, cabined, confined or whatever I am by the Report Stage, I leave it at that.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(v) the showing in public or the broadcasting of any feature film or <Col N="700" /> play in connection with controlled drugs.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I am glad to have this opportunity of putting this proposal forward again in the context of this legislation.  It speaks for itself.  It is something that found a great deal of favour with the Special Committee.  In section 5 we deal with the entitlement of the Minister about regulations governing a whole variety of matters in regard to preventing the misuse of controlled drugs.  Section 5 is a very important section.  From a practical point of view it will be to a large extent the section which will enable the whole machinery to operate.  It gives the Minister power to make regulations governing all sorts of things.  We went through these in detail in the Special Committee and we made various suggestions in regard to them.  This is one of the suggestions which this side of the House are very keen on.  It would be a very useful addition to the number of matters about which the Minister can make recommendations.  I draw the attention of the House to subsection (1) of section 5 which says:</P>
    <P>For the purpose of preventing the misuse of controlled drugs, the Minister may make regulations:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) prohibiting absolutely, or permitting subject to such conditions or exceptions as may be specified in the regulations, or subject to any licence, permit or other form of authority as may be so specified&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  the manufacture, production or preparation of controlled drugs,</P>
    <P>(ii)  the importation or exportation of controlled drugs,</P>
    <P>(iii)  the supply, the offering to supply or the distribution of controlled drugs,</P>
    <P>(iv)  the tranportation of controlled drugs,</P>
    <P>They are all good sound ideas, it is very desirable that the Minister should have the power to govern these matters by way of regulation.  The Minister can prohibit absolutely, or permit subject to conditions or subject to licence, these various functions.  I want to add another function to this <Col N="701" /> list.  After (iv), &ldquo;the transportation of controlled drugs&rdquo;, I would like to add &ldquo;the showing in public or the broadcasting of any feature, film of play in connection with controlled drugs&rdquo;. My reasons for that are obvious.  The situation in regard to the use of drugs in our community is sensitive.  We are dealing with a delicate area, and it is necessary that the authorities should have every legitimate means available to them to monitor control and govern the situation.  Again, we come up against the whole crux of how much power should they get, how much power should we give the authorities to enable them to deal with this matter?  This is a function which we can give to the Minister.</P>
    <P>Section 5 is an enabling section, it does not say the Minister must not make regulations, but it gives him authority if he wishes to make regulations governing certain matters.  We know that in the misuse of drugs, films, plays and literature can play a very important part.  It is possible to glamorise the drug culture in films and plays and it is quite possible to harm inadvertently in regard to the drug situation by means of plays and films.  One would like to think that if there are malicious people with commercial interests, pedlars, pushers and anybody of that sort, who would seek to use films, plays or broadcasts to promote and glamorise the taking of harmful drugs, the Minister for Health would have power to do something about it.  None of us likes censorship, but I am much more prepared to give the Minister for Health the powers of censorship than the Minister for Justice, the Minister for Defence or the Taoiseach.  I am not talking about them personally but their office.  From my point of view a very limited innocuous form of censorship, administered by the Minister for Health in the interests of health, is an entirely different matter from the literary political censorship about which people rightly complain. I am not in favour of censorship as such.  The general trend in public opinion is away from censorship and towards as much freedom of discussion as possible in many different areas.  But this is something where we <Col N="702" /> are confronted with a social evil, with a problem in the community in relation to drug taking.  We need to control the misuse of drugs.  It is a bit unreal to have to contemplate a situation where we are giving fairly draconian powers to the Garda, in an attempt to make this legislation effective, and at the same time, we would have to visualise plays and films being broadcast, which could be more harmful than one individual pusher, but which we cannot do anything about.  My amendment is limited.  It confines the power of the Minister to making regulations to govern the showing or broadcasting in public of any feature, film, or play in connection with controlled drugs.  These words are fairly carefully chosen and the amendment is carefully farmed to confine the power to make regulations to what would be absolutely necessary, and no more.</P>
    <P>We went into this at some length in the Special Committee and there were divided views.  I have thought on it since and have read the debates and having looked at what we said on this matter, I still think it is worth while putting in this additional power.  I would like to give the Minister the power to make these sort of regulations. If the Minister does not want to make them or if he feels they are unnecessary, he does not have to make them but I would not like to have a situation where public conscience and what we all want in this situation could be openly flouted and detrimental deleterious material broadcast by means of features, plays and films in regard to drugs.  In the interests of the drugs situation, I am prepared to accept any opprobrium that might attach to the censorship element involved in this proposal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne1969" hpid="Dr. Byrne Dr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the wording of this amendment, I presume Deputy Haughey refers solely to the illicit promotion of drugs.  In many sections educational, preventive films are shown in connection with controlled drugs so that the adverse effects may be brought home to the community or to the audience with a view towards discouraging them from taking the particular preparations.  I am sure <Col N="703" /> that Deputy Haughey tabled his amendment with that proviso in mind. It is imperative that those concerned with health continue to broadcast in the media on the dangers of tobacco and alcohol and that some of the side effects of these drugs are made known. The only comment I have to make on the amendment is that it would refer only to the adverse promotion of drugs, whereas debauchery in various forms might be glamourised in the broadcasting of features and films.  Indeed, on the multi-channel television networks this element is filtering through with various levels of intensity. Therefore, one would like to see contained in this section power whereby the Minister could control the distribution of various forms of literature that indicate ways of manufacturing certain drugs, particularly LSD.  A provision on those lines would be very helpful. We should support any measure that would strengthen the Minister's hand in helping to prevent further spread of drug abuse.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I am attaching a great deal of importance to this amendment. Unlike my colleague, Deputy Haughey, I am in favour of censorship, albeit limited censorship.  I suppose it can be said that we are all in favour of censorship to some extent but that we differ on the question of extent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the Special Committee debate I said that on matters of public health we should have control in relation to what is broadcast on our television network.  As Deputy Haughey has rightly said, in many cases it is more important that this control be in the hands of the Minister for Health rather than the Minister for Justice. There is censorship in so far as the advertising of cigarettes on television is concerned.  It is known that nicotine is a drug that is damaging to health. Frequently we have tabled questions here regarding the introduction of legislation to prevent also the advertising of alcohol on television.  Recently, the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs informed me that revenue from this source to RTE amounted to almost £400,000 but I would consider the loss of that revenue to be a small <Col N="704" /> price to pay for the amount of damage to health that might be avoided as a result of withdrawing such advertising.</P>
    <P>The amendment is aimed at preventing the glamorisation on television of drug taking.  I do not suppose that a producer of a television programme would set out deliberately to glamourise drugs any more than a deliberate attempt would be made by way of a television feature to glamourise violence.  Yet, it has been established without doubt that violence as portrayed on television is one of the causes of violence in society.  Very often lurid situations or sadism are portrayed in the name of art.  This section provides that the Minister may make regulations to prevent the misuse of controlled drugs.  It is the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; which concerns me.  Any Minister for Health should take on himself the power to make regulations regarding the showing in public or the broadcasting of any film, feature or play in connection with the question of drugs.  There is an increasing propensity in recent years of shows on television which, perhaps, five or ten years ago, no television network would have dared to show.  I am in one of those regions in which it is possible to receive the ITV and BBC programmes and there are many features on those networks that are certainly not suitable for children.  However, we would have control over our own network and we must exercise that control particularly when matter of public health are concerned.</P>
    <P>The view during the Committee Stage was that an amendment of this nature would not change greatly the Bill before us so even at this late stage I urge the Minister to accept the amendment.  It is an amendment that would go a long way towards alleviating the anxieties we have regarding what we consider should be in the Bill. The provision may never have to be invoked but it would be good to have it included.  We are living in a world of rapid change but we must make every effort to protect what we consider to be valuable to our way of life.  While not saying for a moment that all people associated with the arts are involved in drugs, it is known that <Col N="705" /> many such people are in an environment in which there is a prevalence of drugs.  It may be that very often some of these people wish to share with others their sense of guilt and to this end they may encourage others to take drugs.  The same happens in the case of the alcoholic who seeks out somebody to drink with.  However, I would not wish to be taken as saying that all people connected with show business or with television are involved in drug taking.  That profession is as prone as any other profession to drug taking.  There are doctors who are drug addicts.  That is why I think it is very important that the Minister accept the amendment and recognise the truth of what Deputy Haughey and I are saying.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>We discussed this matter at great length in the Special Committee and I think it is fair to say, particularly from the record, that there was general unease about the introduction into the Bill of censorship provisions.  I shared that uneasiness. It is not that I want to escape my responsibility as Minister for Health but I am more than reluctant, in respect of this amendment, to assume the position as general censor for plays, films, television shows <i>et cetera</i>.  I prefer voluntary, worked out practices in areas like this and, on the whole, I believe they will work out much better.  As regards films, the film censor has adequate power to deal with the position described by Deputies Haughey and Briscoe.  I believe the board have adequate power to delete undesirable references to drug taking or to ban the films entirely.</P>
      <P>Deputy Haughey moved a similar amendment on Committee Stage and there was general unease in the Committee about this amendment.  I indicated that I would look into the possibility of including in the Bill a provision prohibiting advocacy of controlled drugs.  Having looked into it, I do not believe it is necessary because section 21 (1) provides:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A person who attempts to commit an offence under this Act, or who aids, abets, counsels or procures the commission of an offence under this Act, or who solicits or incites any <Col N="706" /> other person to commit an offence under this Act, shall be guilty of an offence.</P>
    <P>I believe that is adequate to deal with the situations described by the two Deputies who spoke for the Opposition.</P>
    <P>As regards broadcasting, particularly as regards advertising smoking and alcohol, the authorities have a code of ethics which is strictly adhered to and I am confident that there would be, as I suppose there is now, the same code of ethics in respect of controlled drugs.  There is no censorship of plays at present but if there was advocacy in a play of the use of controlled drugs those responsible for the production of the play would be caught by section 21 (1).  In any case, I believe it would be impossible to devise regulations which would be workable and I think the Deputies opposite recognise that.</P>
    <P>While I do not put this forward as the most important argument we have, as Deputy Briscoe said, about three television channels from Britain and I do not know what control there is over the broadcasting of any feature or film in respect of controlled drugs. As regards broadcasting, films and plays, first, those responsible could be charged under section 21 (1).  As far as films are concerned, the functions of the Film Censorship Board are well defined and as far as broadcasting and television are concerned, I believe it would be better&mdash;it has proved successful so far&mdash;to have a code of ethics rather than to introduce regulations under which a Minister for Health would have to be the deciding factor. In practice, I do not know how this would be possible unless one depended on&mdash;there is no reason to say they could be depended on&mdash;the officials of the Department.  Ultimately, if this were passed, responsibility would lie with the Minister for Health.</P>
    <P>I fully agree with the opinions expressed by the Deputies who spoke but I believe the amendment is taken care of in section 21 (1).</P>

      <P>May I ask the Minister a question?  The Minister mentioned the film censor but he does not have any control over what is shown <Col N="707" /> on television or what is broadcast. Literally, they could show anything on television&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I fear we are faced today in the House itself with the same sort of disagreements as we had in the Special Committee.  What worries my colleagues and myself in this regard is the danger of being forced into a ridiculous situation.  We know that there is a community problem regarding the misuse of certain drugs.  We know this drug culture represents a very serious and potentially tragic threat to our population, particularly our young people, and we must do what we can to legislate wisely for this situation.</P>
      <P>Censorship is a very complicated question.  I do not think anybody has ever really come up with a totally satisfactory philosophical approach to it in a modern community and I would not purport to have the wisdom necessary to propound any solution to the essentially difficult matter of censorship.  But we do have censorship and, as the Minister points out &mdash;again making a case for me in that regard&mdash;we have a film censor.  We are prepared to have an official of the State exercise censorship in regard to morality, violence and things of that nature.</P>
      <P>The Minister is not prepared to consider in principle, I think, censorship in relation to drug taking.  That seems to me to be having a peculiar mix of a sense of values.  If he is prepared to give the State authority to cut out certain parts of films because they demonstrate some sexual behaviour, surely he should be able to contemplate, at least, the Minister taking action in regard to undesirable films where drugs are concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not at all convinced by the Minister's reference to codes of ethics or codes of behaviour in RTE.  I <Col N="708" /> am afraid I must refer the Minister to what I said at the Special Committee in that regard:</P>
    <P>Mr. Corish: There is censorship in RTE itself.</P>
    <P>Mr. Haughey: With due respect, I would not leave any matter of public well-being to the discretion of RTE.</P>
    <P>Further on I said:</P>
    <P>I should prefer to leave such matters in the hands of the Minister for Health in preference to leaving them in the hands of anyone at Montrose.</P>
    <P>Because the people at Montrose have different priorities from those which the Minister for Health has, is it not possible to envisage a situation where a series would be broadcast by RTE, or by somebody else, and the nature of the series would be such that we would all recognise it was undesirable and detrimental in this context? Nevertheless we would have to contemplate the series going on and on without having the capacity to do anything about it.  I want to give the Minister the capacity in such a situation to have the authority to do something, to act to prevent the dissemination of detrimental and undesirable material.</P>
    <P>The Minister, I hope, realises that in the amendment I put down at the Special Committee the Press were included. Most Members who entered into the discussion at the Special Committee were quite against the idea of having censorship of the Press even in this connection.  The Chairman was prepared to go so far as agreeing in principle to some sort of censorship of films and broadcasting.  I have left the Press out of my Report Stage amendment.  My amendment is now confined to the showing in public or the broadcasting of any feature, film, or play, or publication of any similar matter in connection with controlled drugs.</P>
    <P>In this connection I think most of us would be primarily concerned with broadcasting.  I do not think you could get the ordinary man in the street to accept that this is something which could be left entirely to the discretion <Col N="709" /> of the people in RTE.  Rightly or wrongly, there is a great deal of criticism from time to time in public about what RTE decide to broadcast. There is still very active public opinion in that regard.  People take exception to certain material disseminated and broadcast by RTE.  I do not think that has any particular effect, but I should not like to have this matter dealt with in that sort of context at all.  If we approach this matter from the point of view of health, giving the responsibility to the Minister for Health and confining his powers to matters totally and completely in relation to controlled drugs, that is an entirely different area from the general area of censorship of films and of the Press.</P>
    <P>I know there are difficulties in dealing with this from the point of view of giving effect to it but the machinery we are putting at the disposal of the Minister will be flexible.  We are giving him the authority to make regulations and he can have a much more con-centrated and direct approach in making a regulation than he could have, perhaps, in something he has to spell out in legislation.  I am disappointed the Minister is not prepared to take this latent power.  As Deputy Briscoe implied, it is the sort of power which might never be used.  Common sense might prevail generally and good sense, and an occasion might never arise when the Minister would feel compelled to intervene in the interests of the welfare of the community.  All we would like to ensure is that if such a situation does arise, we will not have the Minister and his Department, and public spirited people, and medical people, sitting back frustrated and impotent because they have no power to do anything about a particularly undesirable piece of glamorisation of drug taking, or drug addiction, or drug culture.  That is all we are concerned with.</P>
    <P>As I say, in deference to the view expressed at the Committee, I have limited and watered down my amendment very considerably.  It is now restricted completely to films and broadcasting.  I would have hoped that, having thought the matter over, the <Col N="710" /> Minister might have seen the desirability of providing himself with the power to make regulations.  I am very glad Deputy Briscoe made the reference he did to the advertising of tobacco and alcohol on television.  I certainly hope the next Fianna Fáil Government will take very positive steps to ensure that the terribly subtle, and persuasive, and seductive advertising of alcohol which now goes on on television will be stopped.  In that regard we are being very ambivalent.</P>
    <P>I am fully prepared to acknowledge that when I was Minister for Finance I might have been difficult to persuade about the desirability of preventing or banning the advertising of alcohol on television.  I would hope I would now take a broader view and that my experience in Opposition has given me the capacity to look at things more in the round than from the narrow departmental viewpoint.  When you are in a ministerial office for a while, I am afraid you become institutionalised and you tend to see most things through your departmental eyes.  You are inclined to be convinced that your job is the only thing that matters.  In that regard the Opposition may have an advantage in that we can see a broader picture.</P>
    <P>I hope that when we go back into office we will take a very positive step in regard to the present type of advertising of alcohol on television. I do not know if it would be justifiable in banning the advertising of alcohol completely&mdash;perhaps it would &mdash;but in any event it should be rigorously controlled.  The skilled, seductive and glamorous advertising which we see constantly on television will have to be stopped.  We are not being sensible in permitting young people to be exposed constantly to this type of persuasiveness.  I realise that stopping people advertising a particular product is a form of censorship but it is one I would be prepared to tolerate.  I like to think I am reasonably liberal in outlook and devoted to freedom of opinion but in this connection I see the public need in regard to drugs as being paramount.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="711" /> The power of films and features on television to influence young people is incalculable.  These things can have enormous effect for good or for ill.  On the one hand, we are promoting public funds to health education and that is good but is it not silly and ambivalent to be promoting health education, teaching young people how to live their lives properly, while, on the other hand, we are exposing them to detrimental broadcasts and films.</P>
    <P>From my own experience of legislation I appreciate that this kind of legislation might be difficult when he had the flexibility of a ministerial regulation at his disposal to deal with the matters we want dealt with without in any way interfering with freedom of expression, artistic freedom and so on. I make a final appeal to the Minister with regard to our proposal in amendment No. 13.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 14:</P>
      <P>In page 6, line 36, after &ldquo;prescribed&rdquo; to add</P>
      <P>&ldquo;and without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing requiring that all prescriptions for controlled drugs be in standard form, having an identifiable serial number and counterfoil and supplied by the Minister.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is put forward in an attempt to improve the effectiveness of the legislation.  We are dealing with section 5 and the power of the Minister to make regulations with regard to various aspects of the control of drugs.  We had useful discussions in the <Col N="712" /> Special Committee on the section with which this amendment deals.  We talked at length about prescriptions, forged prescriptions, prescriptions getting lost and people using them for illicit purposes. We also referred to persons being able to use existing medical and pharmacist structures to obtain illegal access to controlled drugs.  In the Special Committee we were conscious of the need to have tight control over the whole situation covering the distribution of controlled drugs, of the maximum amount of control, restraint and regulation in the distribution area. We did not want unscrupulous people to use prescriptions or to have others using them in order to gain access to controlled drugs to which they were not entitled.</P>
    <P>In the Special Committee we put forward the suggestion that there should be a special type of prescription for controlled drugs.  We suggested that it should be in standard form, with an identifiable serial number and counterfoil and we said that all prescriptions dealing with controlled drugs should emanate from the Minister.  We said that controlled drugs should be dealt with only by means of such special prescription forms authorised by the Minister which could be fully accounted for.  We said they should have an identifiable serial number and counterfoil so that any abuse could be traced and brought home to the person concerned.  In this way the present undoubted looseness that exists would be eliminated so far as controlled drugs are concerned.  Our amendment proposes that while it is not mandatory on the Minister to do so, it gives him statutory authority to make regulations prescribing these types of official prescription forms.</P>
    <P>Section 5 gives the Minister wider powers in regard to the distribution process.  He is entitled to make regulations:</P>
    <P>(b) requiring prescribed documents to be used in a prescribed manner in relation to prescribed transactions concerning controlled drugs and requiring copies of such documents to be furnished to prescribed persons, or to persons of a prescribed class or description,</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="713" /> (c) requiring prescribed precautions to be taken for the purpose of ensuring the safe custody of controlled drugs.</P>
    <P>(d) requiring prescribed records to be kept in relation to controlled drugs and regulations under this section may specify the manner in which the records are to be kept and maintained and such regulations may also provide for the furnishing of information relating to such records in such circumstances and in such manner as may be prescribed,</P>
    <P>This section gives the Minister very wide powers in the regulating, controlling and dispensing of controlled drugs.  It gives him powers to make regulations regarding all sorts of records to be kept and the production of these records.  This seemed to us to fit naturally into that general structure.</P>
    <P>This is a system to which most members of the Committee were prepared to agree.  If the Minister accepted it it was difficult to envisage all the advantages it would have but it would certainly bring the whole system of issuing, distributing and prescribing controlled drugs under very close control. It would isolate these dangerous drugs from the general body of pharmacy activities, set them aside, make sure they were dealt with by everybody in a very special way, so that there would be nothing casual or haphazard about the way they were dealt with.</P>
    <P>Pharmacists are very careful people and have very high professional standards. We would all be prepared to rely on their discretion in this area. They have a very fine tradition in serving the public and protecting public health and welfare.  In that regard they are probably as reliable and as trustworthy a section of the community as you can get.  We feel that this mechanic would be of very great assistance in helping them to maintain those very high standards.  It would emphasise the special nature of controlled drugs by having them dealt with only on particular forms, emanating from the Minister and under his control.  I recommend the amendment to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as this argument is concerned, Deputy Haughey and I are not too far apart.  We agree that as far as prescribing and issuing drugs are concerned the utmost possible tightening up should be engaged in, particularly for tracing forgeries or altered prescriptions.  We should take all precautions to guard against forgeries or altered prescriptions. In the Special Committee I told Deputy Haughey that I had power under the regulations&mdash;section 5 (1) (f) &mdash;to do what he suggested.  At that time I indicated that it would be necessary to consult the medical professional organisations on this matter because of the complications that might arise with the use of different kinds of prescription forms for ordinary or for controlled drugs.</P>
      <P>My Department recently had discussions with the medical organisations particularly in relation to the prescription forms used under the general medical service.  The points raised at the Special Committee were brought to the attention of the medical organisations and these discussions are still continuing.  As far as I know the medical organisations have reservations about the use of the four different kinds of prescription forms which would be needed if the amendment as it stands were to be accepted.  I do not look lightly on these reservations, particularly in relation to the practical operation of the general medical service and the arrangements for paying pharmacists under that service. Therefore, I ask the Deputy not to press his amendment on the understanding that as far as practicable this will be done in order to meet the spirit of the Deputy's amendment.  As I said, I have power to do this under section 5 (1) (f) and as far as I can, in consultation with the medical profession, I will see that some scheme is worked out to comply with what was suggested here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the amendment were to be accepted it would mean that the practitioner would need four prescription pads.  For general medical service there would be one for ordinary drugs, one for controlled drugs, and for private or paying patients there would <Col N="715" /> be a pad for ordinary drugs and one for controlled drugs.  It was indicated at the Committee that doctors might not take too kindly to this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">

      <P>For the general medical service, there must be one form for ordinary drugs and one form for controlled drugs&mdash;controlled drugs would be subject to scrutiny&mdash;and the same would apply to private patients.  In view of the fact that the medical profession have not completed their discussions with my Department and especially in view of the fact that section 5 (1) (f) will enable me to do what Deputy Haughey suggests, I ask him not to press his amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughGibbons" hpid="Dr. Gibbons Dr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make a few remarks on the question of prescriptions. I am not aware what the medical organisations offered in detail but it strikes me that prescription forms must be standard for the whole country.  Each health board will not have the right to issue their own particular type of prescription form to cover this part of legislation.  The other thing that strikes me is that, unlike the present prescription form, it should be in triplicate so that the practitioner will have one for the patient, one to be retained by the chemist and one retained by the medical practitioner. Thirdly, I do not see the necessity for having a different prescription pad for the GMS and another for the private patient.  It should be sufficient to have one pad to cover all patients.  In that way one would reduce the number of pads by at least one.  With regard to the question of identification numbers, numbers do not appear on the present prescription pads but I think a number would be of some importance because it would make the prescription more easily identifiable.  The problem of the chemist having to decide what particular form he would submit to the GMS and what one would belong to the private patient, again this could be covered by arranging to have a panel and put the GMS number on the panel for the GMS and just write <Col N="716" />&ldquo;private&rdquo; on it for the private patient. This would indicate to the pharmacist what he should do with the prescription. This should create no difficulty. A decision will have to be made as to how long these prescription pads must be kept.  There is a tendency in some places to get rid of them very quickly. In other places they seem to last for years.  The Minister should consider fixing some particular time at the end of which the records can be destroyed so that they will not be hanging around <i>ad infinitum.</i></P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe much of the difficulty with regard to the security of prescriptions could be overcome by the provision of a special stamp.  If such a stamp is provided to each registered general practitioner that will obviate the possibility of doctors coming from abroad, who are not eligible to practise here, of doctors here whose practice has been curtailed through other sections of the Bill, issuing prescriptions for controlled drugs.  The stamp should issue directly from the Department of Health and that would overcome the rather elaborate and bureaucratic content of this amendment.  The Minister might give consideration to that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I was just looking at the report of the meeting of the Special Committee on 20th January, 1976.  The Minister said negotiations are going on at the moment with the medical profession in regard to this particular suggestion but so far nothing has emerged in the sense of a definite solution.  Something concrete should have emerged by now.  At the Special Committee Deputy Byrne said he was very much in favour of this amendment. He said at column 89 on that date:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This would be of tremendous advantage if we were able to do it and also if the prescription form has some identification mark of the prescriber and if it were mandatory for the age and sex of the patient to be included.  It is high time that a deeper look was taken at the multiplicity of prescription forms available.  The law at present does not prohibit a doctor from taking up an envelope and writing his name <Col N="717" /> and address on it and the name and address of the patient nor is there much technical difficulty in the lay person getting forms printed; I have never been asked for my certificate of medical qualification when I go to get prescription pads printed. This is another way in which there could be abuse.  I would be in favour of Deputy Haughey's amendment. The wording is very similar to that of the amendment I put down.  I would like to see the Minister introducing the thin edge of the wedge here by prescribing standardisation.</P>
    <P>That was the Deputy's own practical experience.  I am sure Deputy H. Gibbons has had similar experience. This is more important than it might appear to be.  Section 5 (1) (d) regulates the issue of drugs.  But there is a &ldquo;may&rdquo; here.  From what Deputy Byrne said in the Special Committee we can assume that the prescribing of drugs is wide open to abuse and if we are serious about controlling the prescribing of drugs, then we must put teeth into this Bill.  We have waited a long time for the Bill. It was born when we were in Government. It died when we left office and it was resuscitated.  It is in its fifth year, the fourth of this Government's reign, and we are still trying to get it through.  We do not want to delay it but we want a Bill of its importance to be capable of implementation.  It is very important that there should be clearly identifiable pads because there is big money behind drugs and, when there is big money involved, people will take big risks.  We must ensure that every channel of possible abuse is cut off.  The Minister should accept the amendment because it is quite specific in what it sets out to do.</P>

They should be issued only by doctors.  Somebody must have paid for all these bottles and tablets.  If it was not the unfortunate man of the house, then the State must have paid.

I also believe that he should take greater responsibility in many of the sections.  I know that he is having discussions with the medical profession on this matter.  When we talk about the medical profession we are talking about people who administer and prescribe drugs.  The Minister will have to make a decision on this matter.  I appeal to him to make the decision now.</P>

      <P>The Minister, I am sure, has gathered that my colleagues agree with me about this proposal.  It has received more support here this afternoon than any other proposal. I am reinforced in my appeal to the Minister for very strong consideration of this.  He has disarmed me somewhat by indicating that he is discussing the situation with the medical profession and that he hopes to come forward with some proposal along the same lines.  That is encouraging because we see a great deal of merit in the proposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is particularly interesting for us that the two doctors, who were members of the Special Committee, continue to support this proposal or something along the same lines.  We are <Col N="719" /> only asking that the Minister take the power to do this.  It seems to us, from an examination of paragraph (f), that it is not specific enough.  It does not give the Minister the specific statutory authority to introduce the type of compulsory system we envisage.  Paragraph (f) states:</P>
    <P>regulating the issue by registered medical practitioners, registered dentists or registered veterinary surgeons of prescriptions for controlled drugs and the supply of controlled drugs on prescription.</P>
    <P>On a very superficial reading that does not seem to me to give the Minister power to insist that he alone can issue the particular prescription forms for the control of drugs and that he is entitled under the provisions of this paragraph to insist on the type of scheme we envisage in the amendment.</P>
    <P>It is encouraging to find that we are all thinking along the same lines and moving in the same direction.  We want to copperfasten the situation.  We want to ensure that the form of control through the prescriptions is clear-cut, identifiable and that the Minister will have the very specific power to have this special type of ministerial prescription form for controlled drugs. It is at a late stage in the examination of this Bill.  There is not a great deal we can do on Report Stage to push the Minister further along the lines we think he should go.  This Stage is largely very much a matter of having a last look at the Bill before it moves to the Seanad.  I suppose at this stage, if the Minister is not prepared to accept our amendment, we have got to accept that situation.  We urge him to pursue those discussions with the professions with a view to getting a very clearly, indentifiable standard practice initiated.</P>
    <P>We are bringing veterinary surgeons within the control of this Bill.  They operate in a different sort of <i>milieu</i> from the other professions.  They very often work under much more difficult conditions and move around a lot. They work on farms and travel around in their cars a lot and perhaps do not have the same need for office routine as dentists and medical practitioners, <Col N="720" /> who operate in a less mobile manner although some doctors in rural areas also travel a great deal.  We hope, because this new regime will apply to doctors, dentists and veterinary surgeons, that the type of prescription, which will be used for control of drugs, will be the same for everybody.</P>
    <P>I want again to mention the question of colour.  Colour is very important in this type of situation.  I hope that the Minister in his discussions with the medical profession will advert to the possibility of having a distinctive colour, red, blue or some other distinctive colour for this type of prescription so that they will be readily identifiable wherever they appear.  It will become well known that that particular colour and type of document can only mean a controlled drug.  It would be very quickly established throughout the distribution system and throughout the professions, people associated with the distribution of these drugs, that this was the standard document; if you saw one of these things anywhere you could be on your guard and you could be alerted to the fact that controlled drugs were involved. That is very important.</P>
    <P>There has been a very interesting report by the National Prices Commission about the savings that could be effected by a more rational use of forms throughout the bureaucracy. There is a great deal in that and it is something that should certainly be followed up.  Rather than, as the Minister seems to suggest, this proposal further complicating the situation, I would have thought that something like this would help to standardise and rationalise the prescription issue situation. If you had one standard form going right through the whole system, used by vets, dentists, doctors and everybody else, that would have a rationalising effect.</P>
    <P>Deputy Briscoe mentioned the length of time everybody has been waiting for this Bill.  I want to assure the Minister that we are very anxious to have the Bill dealt with.  We offer him our complete co-operation in ensuring that, dodgy and rickety though this Administration may be at the moment, this Bill becomes law before <Col N="721" /> the Dáil dissolves.  We have all travelled too far with it to let it fall at this stage.  While we want to try to get these various Report Stage amendments dealt with, we will not, as Deputy Briscoe said, delay the Bill unduly. Certainly we will make sure that whatever else falls with this Dáil this Bill will not and that we will leave at least this legislation on the Statute Book before we take to the hustings.</P>
    <P>Again I accept the reality of the situation that we cannot do much more about this proposal on Report Stage. I am somewhat encouraged about what the Minister has said and I will urge him to go as far as he can under the provisions of paragraph (f) to ensure that a very identifiable system, as watertight as possible, is introduced quickly for the issue of prescriptions for controlled drugs, because that is a key factor that will greatly affect the efficacy of the operation of the Bill.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 15:</P>
      <P>In page 7, line 13, before &ldquo;manufacture&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;import, export, transport&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>In this amendment we are still dealing with arrangements which the Minister will be able to make by regulation to control the situation.  I had better read the existing subsection (2) of section 5 in order to indicate more clearly what I seek to achieve:</P>
      <P>Subject to section 13 of this Act, the Minister shall exercise his power to make regulations under this section so as to secure that it is not unlawful under this Act for</P>
      <P>(a) a practitioner for the purpose of his profession, to prescribe, administer, manufacture, compound or supply a controlled drug,</P>
      <P>(b) a pharmacist for the purpose of his profession or business, to manufacture, compound or supply a controlled drug,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>provided that nothing in this subsection shall be construed as enabling the Minister to make regulations under this Act <Col N="722" /> authorising a registered druggist to keep open shop for the compounding or dispensing of medical prescriptions.</P>
    <P>With the proposed amendment the paragraph would read: &ldquo;a pharmacist for the purpose of his profession or business to import, export, transport, manufacture, compound or supply a controlled drug&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I explained the reasons for this proposal during the course of the Committee Stage debate.  It seemed to me to be necessary to cover all the range of activities.  At the moment subsection (2) is the provision which enables the Minister to make regulations to secure that it is not unlawful for a pharmacist for the purpose of his profession or business to do certain things, but paragraph (b) is confined to manufacturing, compounding, supplying a controlled drug.  I think it would be necessary that that power should extend to importing, exporting, transporting as well as to manufacturing, compounding or supplying.  The Minister might argue that the existing wording comprises the activities of importing, exporting and transporting.  I do not think they do.</P>

      <P>Amendments Nos. 16 and 19 are cognate and amendment No. 20 in the name of Deputy Haughey is an alternative. These three amendments may, by agreement, be taken together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>This was discussed extensively in the Special Committee. <Col N="723" /> Deputy Haughey and Deputy Byrne participated in that debate and believed that there should be more publicity than would be given to a direction in <i>Irish Oifigiúil</i>.  On that occasion I agreed in principle with the need for more publicity but did not accept the proposals put forward.  There were a variety of proposal.  Deputy Haughey put forward his proposal that the direction should be publicised in two or more medical journals.  That is repeated today in his amendment No. 20.</P>
      <P>My amendments are Nos. 16 and 19 and are of a more general nature and, I suggest, are preferable for the following reasons.  I did indicate in Committee that the amendments I now propose would be the amendments I would put forward on Report Stage. First of all the direction might not be of medical interest and could relate to dental or veterinary practice. Secondly, it could not always be assumed that the two journals appropriate for publication of the direction would exist or be published at sufficiently frequent intervals to make the publication effective.  Thirdly, there could be difficulties if the journal refused to publish the direction.  These are practical difficulties which I ask the Deputy to appreciate, and I urge acceptance of amendments Nos. 16 and 19 which put the obligation on the Minister to give further publicity to each direction, this publicity being what is appropriate to the circumstances of the case.  As I said on Committee Stage, publication of a direction would be in <i>Irish Oifigiúil</i> and could be taken by any other journal or any newspaper.  There is no stricture on the publication in any other magazine, periodical or newspaper when a direction has been made by the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should also appreciate the difficulty and embarrassment there would be to some member of the medical profession if for a minor offence the publicity in respect of a direction for that minor offence were not alone in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> but also in other journals and newspapers.  I would ask therefore that, as I suggested in Committee, the section would read: &ldquo;The Minister shall cause a copy of any direction <Col N="724" /> given by him under this section to be served on a person to whom it applies and shall cause notice of any such direction to be published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> and in such other manner (if any) as the Minister may consider appropriate&rdquo;.  That would be the fairest thing to do in all the circumstances. We should not be too specific in respect of two particular journals, good journals in themselves and of interest to the medical profession.  In all the circumstances the Minister should be given this discretion to publicise it further if he thinks it is right to do so apart from publication in <i>Iris Oifigiúil.</i></P>
    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I moved this amendment on behalf of Deputy Haughey. The reason for doing this was that most of the medical profession in this country read either the <i>Irish Medical Times</i> or the <i>British Medical Journal</i>.  There is also the IMA journal which has a large circulation here among the medical profession.  Whilst the Minister's amendments are acceptable and welcome, we feel that with reference to anything relating to the advertising or announcing of the prescribed drugs in these various magazines, such as <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i>, those that affect the medical profession could go into the medical magazines, those relating to the veterinary profession would go into veterinary magazines and those affecting the dental profession would go into dental magazines.</P>
      <P>Whilst the Minister says that these other magazines are free to take anything they wish from <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i>, the fact is that if something is going into <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> which will affect a doctor and which might be embarrassing if published in other magazines, its publication in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> makes it public in any case.  The Minister was absent when I moved this amendment in Committee on behalf of Deputy Haughey, but I am repeating myself in stating that those items which would normally appear in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> which would have interest for the medical profession could be published in the medical magazines and so on.  There is no reason why every announcement published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> has to go into all the magazines appertaining to the profession.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The House, I hope, is fully aware of what we are dealing with here.  We are dealing with a social situation which we would all hope would not arise very often but which, unfortunately, we must be prepared to accept will arise from time to time.  There is no need to restate one's belief in the fact that we are wonderfully served in this country by our professions in that they have very fine traditions stretching back into their earliest history, traditions of complete and total integrity. Successive Parliaments and Executives have placed complete trust in those traditions and in that integrity. Indeed, without a secure knowledge that such standards prevail throughout our professions the administration of a great deal of our health and welfare services would be very complicated, if not impossible, so it is only fitting that, when we come to deal with the sort of situation we are dealing with in section 6, we pay that tribute to the standards which are upheld in the professions.  These traditions and standards are a very important national asset.  From time to time we take them for granted and trade on them and we as a legislature very often pass laws and assume that these standards and that integrity will be upheld because without that integrity the laws would not be effective. Unfortunately, in all professions and in all walks of life there will be the occasional lapse, and occasionally people who will transgress, people who will be careless, or who will be simply commercially minded, will seek to use their professions in a wrong way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 6 deals with practitioners or pharmacists, in other words, dentists, doctors, veterinary surgeons and pharmacists.  It is important to point out that the section only comes into operation where a person has actually been convicted of an offence under this measure or of an offence against the Customs Act in relation to the importation or exportation of controlled drugs.  That is a safeguard in the section.  The direction which the Minister can give under section 6 can only be given in the case of a person <Col N="726" /> who has been convicted.  The next thing to note is that he must be convicted of an offence under this legislation or under the Customs Act in relation to the importation or the exportation of controlled drugs.  To that extent section 6 is very confined and we need not be unduly worried that it is in any way onerous in so far as the professions are concerned.</P>
    <P>Where a person has abused his profession and has been convicted of an abuse in regard to controlled drugs, the Minister is taking power to give a direction in regard to that person.  The Minister is taking the very sensible precaution of denying the person possession or the power to prescribe, administer, manufacture, compound or supply controlled drugs.  It is only common sense that where a person is convicted of an offence in relation to controlled drugs, he should be stopped by the Minister from continuing to have power under this legislation to deal with these drugs.  Where a pharmacist has been so convicted the Minister can give a direction prohibiting him from having in his possession, manufacturing, compounding, and supplying, or supervising or controlling the manufacture, compounding or supply of such controlled drugs as set out in the direction.  In the case of a pharmacist the direction will only apply to controlled drugs.  It will not apply to the normal carrying on of his trade as a pharmacist.  This is a very tightly drawn section and it could not in any way be regarded as being onerous by the professions.  It is very fair to the professional people concerned. I suppose it is serious enough for a professional person to have this direction issued in regard to him.  As the section was originally drafted, it proposed that when the direction was made by the Minister various things would happen:</P>
    <P>(4) The Minister shall cause a copy of any direction given by him under this section to be served on the person to whom it applies and shall cause notice of any such direction to be published in the <i>Iris Oifigiúil.</i></P>
    <P>(5) A direction under this section shall take effect when a copy of it <Col N="727" /> is served on the person to whom it applies.</P>
    <P>(6)  Any person who contravenes a direction given under this section shall be guilty of an offence.</P>
    <P>It is a very clearly defined section and the situation in regard to these directions is very clearly set out and specified in the body of the section. We are in agreement with that section. It is a useful weapon of protection for the Minister to have at his disposal. It would be ridiculous to think that a person who was convicted of an offence in regard to controlled drugs could be free to carry on prescribing or supplying these drugs to the general public.  It is no good for the Minister to just give a direction to the person convicted.  It is also very important that everybody concerned in the business should know about the direction and should know that this person is no longer entitled to the privileges of handling controlled drugs in the way he had been because of his professional capacity.</P>
    <P>We all agree that a simple publication in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> is not enough. <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> is a very bureaucratic, weighty and intimidating sort of document&mdash;it is not bedside reading for many members of the general public. It would be very interesting to carry out a survey on how many Deputies skim through <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> every week. Particularly since our entry into the EEC <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> has taken on enormous proportions because of the directives in regard to companies.  There are far more issues of <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> coming out now than before.  Whereas publication in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> is a necessary bureaucratic step in regard to anything of this nature, it cannot be considered in the nature of a public publication.  It is an official statutory publication but it could not be regarded as putting the general public on notice about a particular matter.</P>
    <P>Since our discussion on Committee Stage the Minister has gone some way towards meeting us by reason of amendments Nos. 16 and 19.  Both the amendments are the same in principle although they apply to different parts of the Bill.  The Minister proposes that <Col N="728" /> in addition to causing the notice of the direction to be published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> it shall be published also in such other manner, if any, as the Minister may consider appropriate. That is a step forward although not very convincingly so.  One cannot but be alerted to the Minister's mind by reason of the insidious insertion of the words &ldquo;if any&rdquo;.  He is leaving himself plenty of scope to do nothing more than have the direction published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i>, if he so decides.  Therefore, there is nothing very mandatory about his amendment.  In effect, it is merely making a half-hearted offer to consider doing something more but, half-hearted as it may be, I would be much happier about it if the words &ldquo;if any&rdquo; were deleted.  Perhaps the Minister would have a look at this aspect of it.  The insertion of those words take entirely from the force of the amendment and would seem to make it very casual.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to be tendentious.  The Report Stage of a Bill is not the occasion for aggravation but I wonder if, in this connection, it is enough for us to leave the matter to what the Minister may consider appropriate. Unfortunately, I must point out that during the Special Committee debate the following exchange occurred as is reported in the proceedings for 18th February.  Deputy O'Connell, speaking of these medical journals and the publication of notice of these directions in medical journals said he assumed that the Minister meant medical journals published in the country, to which Deputy Byrne replied &ldquo;That is not stated&rdquo;.  But the Minister said he was sure that every doctor in the country gets <i>The Lancet</i> also, to which Deputy O'Connell replied that that publication would not have a 5 per cent circulation in Ireland.  Here was a situation in which our Minister for Health, well versed though he may be in other matters, was not very well informed regarding the circulation situation of medical journals.  Consequently, we must ask whether in those circumstances we would be justifield in leaving the degree of publication to what the Minister may consider appropriate.</P>
    <P>Bearing in mind the very weak <Col N="729" /> wording of the Minister's amendments. I prefer the amendment in my name. I envisage notice of these directions being published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i>.  We all accept that that is necessary, that it is preliminary but I suggest that these notices be published also in at least two recognised medical journals. I gather from the Minister that because there will be dentists, vets and pharmacists involved he considers it would not be appropriate to provide for publication in two medical journals. I cannot accept that contention.  If such notices are published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> and also in two recognised medical journals, everybody who should know about the existence of these directions would be put on reasonable notice.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Minister and sympathise with his point of view that in the event of a venial lapse by a member of the profession it would not be desirable to brandish the demeanour across the public Press for fear of creating a wrong impression. We must endeavour to strike a balance in this regard to ensure that the professional and the business people involved would know about the directions while, at the same time, not to create a need for graphic descriptions in the public Press.  That is why I suggested adding the words &ldquo;two recognised medical journals&rdquo;.  Perhaps this would be a better way of dealing with the matter than leaving it open which would be the case if the Minister's amendments were to be accepted.</P>
    <P>Before we go further, I should like to hear from the Minister as to whether he is prepared to drop the words &ldquo;if any&rdquo; from his two amendments. I expect this can be done across the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughGibbons" hpid="Dr. Gibbons Dr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>One might be forgiven for thinking that <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> was a house magazine of the Land Commission because for some time most of that publication's material concerned the activities of that body. Certainly, as Deputy Haughey said, <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> is not a document that finds its way into the hands of many people down the country.  Consequently, it would be futile to hope <Col N="730" /> that anything published in it would reach the public.</P>
      <P>Deputy Haughey seemed to think that the Minister's amendments were somewhat woolly in the sense that they would bestow on him a wide latitude as to where the information should be published.  I would be inclined to agree that the Minister should have this latitude but that it should be limited to medical or professional journals.  One would imagine that the most important people to be informed of such directions would be, first, the CEOs of the health boards since some doctors would be in a position of being able to order drugs through the health boards and, secondly, the pharmacists, since prescriptions issued by a doctor, a vet or a dentist must go to a pharmacist to be filled or, perhaps, to a drug company. I feel that such a journal is a &ldquo;must&rdquo;.  The medical journal creates a bigger problem.  <i>The Lancet</i> was mentioned and I think it is true that the circulation of <i>The Lancet</i> among doctors is very small.  It is quite possible that the <i>British Medical Journal</i> will come in in diminishing numbers in future also by virtue of the fact that we now have to pay £7 per year extra if we wish to get it.  This will not be as attractive a bargain as it was in the past because being a member of the Irish Medical Association you got it automatically.  To a certain extent, I think that must be out.  That brings us back to the <i>Irish Medical Journal</i> which, to me, seems the appropriate one to publish in.  Again, all doctors do not get this.  The same applies, I suppose, to the magazine of the Medical Union.  One must think of the other people who should be informed, the public, and this raises the question of it being published in the local papers.  It must be of some interest to the public to know that a medical or veterinary practitioner or a dentist is not in a position to prescribe.  Taking it all in all, I am inclined to agree with the Minister that the words he uses are the appropriate words to cover the case as I see it.</P>

      <P>Very briefly.  I think the amendments in my name, Nos. 16 and 19 are the consensus of the Special Committee.  I was pretty open-minded in that Committee as regards suggestions or amendments.  I do not want to protect anyone who commits a misdemeanour under this Act and in this case the practitioners but I also think we should have regard to their position.  We do not want to protect them; neither do we want to pillory them.  As I said in introducing the amendment, there could be a case of a minor misdemeanour and under the terms of the amendment proposed by Deputy Haughey this would have to be published not only in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> but in two recognised medical journals.  It might be a technical offence but still the man would get this publicity.  I recognise that if there is a grave abuse by a doctor or any other practitioner it might be necessary to go beyond the journals but, as far as Deputy Haughey's amendment is concerned, I am confined to the journals.  As Deputy Gibbons pointed out&mdash;I take it we are all concerned about it&mdash;not alone should certain information or the publication of a direction be available to those who read medical journals but it should also be available to the public.  That is extremely important because a doctor could be a pusher and could be abusing the Act and handing out controlled drugs whole-sale or in any other way.  If I accept Deputy Haughey's amendment, I am confined but if my amendments are accepted it means I can go beyond the medical journals if I so decide, to, say, the national newspapers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Haughey asked me to consider deleting the words &ldquo;if any&rdquo;. These words were inserted by the parliamentary draftsman because there could be circumstances where no publication might be needed, for example, if a doctor were practising in a remote rural area, sending copies of a direction to a few local pharmacists, perhaps, other than local <Col N="732" /> doctors could be enough.  I may be criticised on the basis that I am taking too much liberty in this and that my discretion would not be sufficient. I think we must consider everything &mdash;to punish those who have blatantly offended under the legislation but not to damage those who have committed minor or technical offences.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 21:</P>
      <P>In page 12, line 19, to insert &ldquo;or pharmacist&rdquo; after &ldquo;practitioner&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is a drafting amendment.  As section 11 stood originally it afforded a practitioner the right of appeal to the courts against a special direction or a temporary direction.  Special or temporary directions apply only to responsible prescribing, and so on, and have no relevance to pharmacists.  However, the section was amended in Committee so as to extend this right of appeal to section 6 directions, that is, directions withdrawing the doctor's or pharmacist's authority where he is convicted of a drug offence.  Consequently it is now necessary to insert the word &ldquo;pharmacist&rdquo; as proposed so as to bestow on pharmacists the same legal recourse already afforded to practitioners so far as an appeal is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>We have no alternative but to accept this.  It is simply to make sure that the pharmacist has the same right as the other professional people involved.  It would be grossly unfair if a pharmacist who happened to get caught up in this unfortunate sort of situation did not have this right of appeal which is open to his professional colleagues.  Therefore the amendment is strictly necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is also very desirable to have this provision about appeals.  We do not want this Bill running into the same constitutional difficulties as similar Bills in other areas.  Therefore, section 11, by providing for this appeals machinery, will help to obviate any <Col N="734" /> such unfortunate developments.  There is nothing which brings a Bill into greater disrepute, or makes it less effective for the purpose for which it is intended, than that any constitutional difficulties should arise in regard to it.</P>
    <P>The challenging of a Bill in the courts could result in the suspension of the operation of the legislation for a considerable period.  It is very important that in so far as we possibly can we ensure that when a Bill leaves this House it is in such a shape that it is not capable of being challenged in the courts.  If we had passed this legislation with the right of appeal available to practitioners as defined in the Bill, and not available to pharmacists, I do not think it would have been very long before its constitutionality would have been challenged. It is fortunate, therefore, that this drafting error, this drafting technicality, was discovered in time and is now being put right in this way, apart from the common justice involved in affording to a pharmacist who had the misfortune to become involved in a direction situation the same right of appeal as is afforded to other types of professional people involved.</P>

      <P>In page 14, between lines 14 and 15, to insert the following:</P>

      <P>Again referring to the Special Committee, Deputy Haughey made the point that subsection (3) in its present from would need to be qualified to cover a situation in which a parent, a pharmacist or a member of the Garda might take possession of a forged prescription but not for an unlawful purpose.  I fully agree with Deputy Haughey and, to meet the situation, I now propose an amendment which will enable the Minister to declare in regulations that in certain circumstance subsection (3) will not apply to persons of a prescribed class or description.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Again the Minister is meeting the point of view we expressed at the Special Committee on the matter of forged or fraudulently altered prescriptions.  Section 18 (1) makes it an offence for a person to forge a document purporting to be a prescription issued by a medical practitioner, dentist or veterinary surgeon, which document in this Act is referred to as a forged prescription. Subsection (2) provides: <Col N="736" /> A person shall not with intent to deceive either alter or use a prescription which has been duly issued by a medical practitioner, dentist or veterinary surgeon (which document is in this Act referred to as a duly issued prescription).</P>
      <P>Subsection (3) provides:</P>
      <P>A person shall not have in his possession either a forged prescription or a duly issued prescription which has been altered with intent to deceive.</P>
      <P>Subsection (4) provides that a person who does any of those things shall be guilty of an offence and the penalty provision set out later on in the legislation shall apply.  As the Minister has pointed out, we wanted this amendment made.  The amendment put forward by the Minister is satisfactory from our point of view. It is a reasonable and necessary safeguard. I want to express our appreciation to the Minister for meeting the viewpoint we put forward in this regard in the Special Committee.</P>

      <P>In page 14, to insert &ldquo;contrary to section 17 of this Act&rdquo; after &ldquo;cultivation&rdquo; in line 21.</P>
      <P>The inclusion of a reference in this section to the cultivation of the opium poppy and the cannabis plant proposed by Deputy Byrne was accepted in the Special Committee.  In the considerable discussion on this section the fact that Deputy Byrne's amendment could not be allowed to stand without the further amendment now proposed was overlooked.  If the words &ldquo;contrary to section 17 of this Act&rdquo; were not included, the section as it now stands would make it an offence to allow the use of one's land for such cultivation even if the person using the land had a licence from the Minister to grow opium poppies or cannabis plants for research or industrial purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne1969" hpid="Dr. Byrne Dr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>When this Bill was discussed in the Special Committee it was of great interest to see the drafting in so far as it related to the growing <Col N="737" /> of the plant of the genus cannabis.  As we know, cannabis grows quite freely in this country and legislation to prevent its growth and subsequent harvesting and distribution is to be commended. I wish to thank the Minister for helping in this regard.</P>
      <P>Much has been said about the adverse effects of cannabis.  However, there are people who speak in favour of it, who say it is a harmless and non-addictive drug, one without any side-effects.  I say quite categorically that these people are fools.  It has not been shown that cannabis is a harmless drug.  There is no research available in the world to indicate that it is totally without side-effects.  On the contrary, the bulk of the research has shown that marijuana, cannabis or hash or its many other names has an insidious danger associated with it not only to the physique but also to the psyche, the culture and the morality of society.</P>
      <P>We have seen the subcultures that have evolved because of the use of this drug.  We have seen the increase in the drop-out rate from universities and schools and we have seen the very sad disorientation that can occur. In their wisdom WHO have recently refined marijuana not as a drug of dependence or addiction but as a drug of disorientation.  It is here that the greatest danger lies.  It can undermine society; indeed it has done so throughout the western world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The mythology associated with the harmlessness of marijuana is sad.  It is true that 99 per cent consumed in the world is eaten.  The western world is one of the few parts of the earth where the drug is smoked.  The effects of marijuana when eaten are only 10 per cent of what it is when smoked. Because of this it is very important that our legislation should act as a deterrent to prevent the cultivation and growing of cannabis.  If the Minister's amendment is accepted section 19 (1) (a) will read: &ldquo;the cultivation, contrary to section 17, of opium poppy or any plant of the genus <i>Cannabis</i>&rdquo;.  In that connection I wish to refer briefly to a reference made by Albert Greenwood, MD, Resident in Neuro-pathology, <Col N="738" /> Presbyterian Hospital in the city of New York.  He said:</P>
    <P>We believe, on the contrary, that the untoward social and medical effects of marijuana reported by the marijuana commission and in the past and present medical literature do not justify the legalisation of cannabis anywhere in the world. We believe that the recommendations of the 1961 Geneva Single Convention outlawing stupefying drugs should not be unilaterally denounced by the United States.</P>
    <P>In so far as cannabis can be and has been grown in the country and having regard to the increased use of the drug throughout our society, any attempt by us to liberalise cannabis or to attempt to send a message from this House that cannabis is harmless will be an unfortunate day for this Parliament.</P>

It would be no harm if the public realised that members of the Legislature are aware that some people grow cannabis here.  It is important that this section be included in this Bill because while <Col N="740" /> officials at our airports and ports are able to detect, arrest and confiscate in any attempted importation of cannabis, we also have an internal source of cannabis.  I would like now to refer briefly to the opium poppy which is very easy to cultivate and which is referred to in this legislation. Both plants can be grown quite liberally here, the product from both can be mixed.  It is correct to have both in this section.  In a previous amendment there was no combination of the genus cannabis and the opium poppy.</P>

      <P>Last night the Minister for Education did not come to the real point, that is, he did not state clearly what is the Government policy in relation to energy for the next five years or even for the coming decade.  He spoke about what would happen in 30 or 40 years' time.  It is clear that there is no Government policy on energy at the moment.  There is no clear-cut programme laid down by the Government to cover the energy <Col N="742" /> situation.  An energy policy for the coming decade and programme should be clearly stated.  Such a policy should be closely linked with physical planning because the location and the siting of power stations and oil refineries must be considered from the planning point of view as well as from the amenity and environmental point of view.  One would have thought that the Government by now would have incorporated in a positive physical planning policy the locations of power stations and refineries in the future.  Environmental considerations must be taken into account in any such policy.  The environment must be protected.  It is the duty of the Government to protect it. The Government appear to have no realistic energy policy for the coming decade.  They have no positive physical planning policy.  They have no policy for the protection of the environment. All three should be closely linked in any realistic energy policy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I have heard two speakers on the Opposition benches, Deputy Barrett and Deputy O'Leary. The last speaker dealt with environmental matters.  I gather he recognises just three hazards, thermal, some sulphurous side effects and nitrogenous material, or nitrous oxide.  This is an over-simplification.  I am prepared to look at the whole situation from a broader spectrum.  One must divide into air, soil and water.  I do not know if the last speaker is aware that one of our most immediate difficulties from the point of view of pollution of the environment is coming from carbon extract.  He does not have to go very far from this House to see evidence of that in Dublin Bay, evidence which has been there now for quite a number of years.  I am told by those who claim to know all about the technical side of pollution that there is a little plant called ulva, or sea lettuce, which is evidence of the pollution of the water by carbon type materials.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One must bear in mind that nature is very resilient and very adaptable. There is plenty of evidence now coming forward everywhere to show that nature can adjust to what might appear to be a very serious challenge <Col N="743" /> to its survival.  These powers of resilience have been monitored and watched by scientists, particularly scientists in the botanical and marine spheres, and I have a recollection of a very interesting programme where environmental damage was under discussion. It was either on Telefís Éireann or the BBC.  The gentleman being interviewed, well-known in this sphere, discussed this problem of pollution. The programme was entitled &ldquo;Bellamy in the Mire&rdquo;.  He said we should not get into a pet or worry too much about pollution because nature has a way of adjusting itself and coming out very often in a stronger position than when it was first visited by antagonistic elements of water or mineral concentrations.</P>
    <P>It is not right for the last speaker to say no steps have been taken about preserving the environment by this Government.  We have had a planning Act.  It was discussed here in great detail in a very lengthy debate and eventually, when the Bill found its final form, it could, I think, be described as a consensus of opinion.  We had the Water Pollution Bill.  We have a Nuclear Energy Board for monitoring everything connected with nuclear energy.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barrett said we have done nothing.  Last night the former Minister for Transport and Power, Deputy Barry, refuted allegations in regard to the lack of an energy policy.  He said we have not put it in booklet form.  We have not produced a book entitled &ldquo;The Programme of Energy&rdquo;.  Various matters have been brought forward by the Government.  We have An Bord Gáis.  We have the Nuclear Energy Board.  We have the Third Bog Development Programme.  That is very significant because the output of milled peat will be increased by 1.7 million tons per annum.  This will effect a saving of 170,000 tons of oil imports per annum.  There has been an increase in oil stocks.  At present they run at an 80 days' supply.  That will be increased to 90 days by 1980 or before that.  There has been a committee set up constituted of officials of the Departments involved and State bodies involved in energy.  It is the <Col N="744" /> Conservation of Energy Advisory Committee.  It has done a great deal of work particularly on the domestic use of fuel and power.  Grants have been provided by the IDA to modernise plant and machinery in order to effect economies in the use of heat.  Grants are being provided to hotels and industry in the same sphere.  When one bears in mind the crisis in 1973 in relation to fuel, the only suggestion which emanated from the Opposition in those days was in regard to a rationing system.</P>
    <P>Reference was made last night to refining.  I do not know if the Opposition are aware that refining in Europe is only working at 60 per cent of its capacity.  The experts believe that that situation will last until the 1980s.  I do not see much point in increasing our refining capacity which at the moment covers 50 per cent of our requirements.  One must look at this from the point of view of the financial implications. Have the Opposition spokesmen considered what is called down side risks, the financial implications of going into some big scheme and finding that you can be undercut and there can be a far cheaper method of doing the work you want to do?</P>
    <P>I do not think one can plan at this stage in relation to ten or 25 years' time.  It is an on-going situation.  The Minister challenged the Opposition spokesman to state what their policy is in relation to nuclear energy.  There has not been any statement from them in that regard.  The record of the Government is honourable in relation to the fuel crisis when one considers what has been done in a very short time while faced with what was a European and world-wide crisis.  The Government's record has been very diligent when one bears in mind that they regard it as an on-going situation, that there is no static view to be taken in relation to fuel, power, energy, conservation or the environment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very appropriate time to discuss this motion by Deputy Barrett which indicates that a national energy policy to maximise our potential is needed but, <Col N="745" /> at the same time, we must take adequate precautions to preserve our environment.  The Government's amendment appears to suggest that they are happy enough with their progress and that they see no reason at all for any reappraisal of their policies.  I do not agree with that view.</P>
      <P>Many of our present ills with regard to energy and the cost of it are laid at the door of the Arab oil producing countries.  They decided&mdash; this coincided with the coming into power of the Government&mdash;in 1973 to increase the price of oil.  I would not blame the Arabs for doing that. They have a very valuable asset in their oil but it is a very finite one which will be expended in a number of years.  Their policy was to get as much as possible out of their particular product, provide for the things they need and improve their standard of living.</P>
      <P>We were able to buy oil very cheaply here.  We imported it by tankers and charged our people twice as much and, perhaps, a little more for it. Some countries even stopped producing their own oil to conserve their resources and bought Arab oil instead.  Oil was looked on by the Minister for Finance as a suitable source for taxation.  It is no wonder the oil producing countries woke up to this and increased the price of it. I am sure if we found that our beef was being bought by countries abroad and sold at twice the price we were getting for it, we would do the same. When the price of oil was increased by the Arab countries, the Minister for Finance increased taxation still further and placed a huge taxation load on motorists and others who have to use petrol and oil.  We have had regular increases in the price of oil since then.  We have now reached the stage practically when the £ a gallon, which appeared to be so outlandish some years ago, will be with us soon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some time ago many of us felt happy that the price of our petrol was slightly lower than that in Northern Ireland.  The Minister for Finance for some unknown reason decided that this was a drain on us.  He corrected that <Col N="746" /> by imposing taxation which ensured that that the price of petrol here would be greater than it is in Northern Ireland or in Great Britain.  I believe he overreacted. The position has never been rectified.  We read in today's <i>Irish Press</i> that the British Chancellor of the Exchequer increased the price of petrol by 5½p but that still Irish petrol is 15p a gallon dearer.  A very valid comment on that was that there is very little to attract the British motorist south of the Border.</P>
    <P>We need some new thinking in regard to our energy problem.  It should have percolated to the Cabinet by now that less taxation on petrol would mean cheaper petrol which in turn would mean cheaper goods which would be more competitive abroad and it would entice tourists to come here.  There would be more jobs and less need for taxation to finance social welfare benefits to people who would work if there were jobs for them.  This would be our programme.  We would reverse the vicious circle created by the Minister for Finance and replace it with what Fianna Fáil now recommend.</P>
    <P>I would like to deal with something which qualifies for attention as a source of fuel and also as a conservation subject for environment eventually.  I refer to our bogs and their future potential. I should like to record my admiration for the pioneers of turf production, the Turf Development Board, the predecessors of Bord na Móna, who opened up the bogs and experimented with machinery.  They did the equivalent of making the desert bloom.  They provided employment in the most distressed areas.  They created new towns and villages and brought new life to the centres of population.  I suppose after the many repressive plantations we had the bog was the final sanctuary of the sean-Gaedhal, the true Irish, who were victims of landlordism and had to leave their homes.</P>
    <P>The pioneering work by the Turf Development Board and Bord na Móna was badly needed in the distressed areas.  Progress was continued in the war years and since then.  We have now reached a situation where ESB turf fire generators are prominent <Col N="747" /> features on our landscape.  They provide jobs and also energy in the cities. Bord na Móna have produced new systems and techniques during that time.  Briquettes have now become part of our life and there is greater emphasis on production and sale abroad particularly.  Peat moss has now become a very valuable export.  It has got a big foothold in the English market and is expanding on the Continent and in the Channel Islands particularly for horticultural purposes.</P>
    <P>Milled peat production has become highly mechanised and sophisticated and one should pay tribute to Bord na Móna management and employees.  It is one semi-State body that we can point to that has consistently shown a profit.  There is very little industrial unrest there, which is probably due to good worker-management relations.  A generation of men have grown old in the service of Bord na Móna and have devoted all their working lives to this development.  They have come from all over Ireland and have settled in various places including new villages that were created in Kildare such as Coil Dubh, Rathangan, Droichead Nua, Prosperous and other small places all over the midlands.  They can look back with pride on their life of labour because today there are 135,000 acres under active peat production.</P>
    <P>What concerns me now is what happens next when we can measure the life of the bogs in terms of five, ten or 20 years.  What does the future hold for the cutaway bog after that? In my own area of Timahoe it has been indicated that the sale of sod peat to the public cannot be guaranteed after the next two years.  This facility that the public had of going to the tiphead at Timahoe and purchasing sod peat is something that commends itself to me.  Many of the people there have no alternative fuel; cookers were geared to this.  Many people earned a living by buying the peat and selling it from door to door to customers.  It would appear that Bord na Móna are committed to supplying sod peat to the turf-fired generating station in Allenwood.  Now is the time to produce a policy to make provision for the availability of <Col N="748" /> sod peat elsewhere, and I would hope it would not be too far away.  With present haulage prices the product could be priced out of most people's pockets and from a cheap fuel it could become a very dear fuel if it had to be brought long distances.</P>
    <P>I would also like to know about the alternative bogs being developed in the area.  I am aware of some development going on.  Are we sure that such bogs are capable of employing all the labour available?  I think not.  It has been mentioned to me that we might well experiment with some type of crop that could be sown on the cutaway bogs and harvested with existing machinery, as a crop would in the normal way, and be compressed or processed as a fuel.  We certainly have the climate and the expertise to deal with such a crop.  Possibly some experimentation is needed in this field.</P>
    <P>Despite our best efforts I think we will be faced with the situation of many Bord na Móna workers becoming redundant.  Therefore the Government and the IDA need a policy to provide industries in these areas.  There are skilled and semi-skilled workers capable of dealing with any type of industry that could be channelled in there.  It is in this sphere that the use of cutaway bogs will become very important. Bord na Móna and An Foras Talúntais have done great experimental work and have proved there is a future for cutaway bogs for farming and horticultural purposes.  As far back as 1952 the first experiment was carried out on Dunne's farm in Rathangan where 15 acres of cutaway bog were drained and reclaimed.  The fruits of what was done under that pilot scheme can be seen to the present day.  Further on in 1955 the Department of Agriculture initiated schemes in Kildare and Offaly utilising cutaway bog.  I myself have seen and have praised in this House the work done by An Foras Talúntais in Lullymore where excellent experimental work of a very practical nature was carried out in regard to the production of vegetables and of grassland that is capable of feeding cattle over the winter.</P>
    <P>In 1972 the Agricultural Science Association examined the future utilisation <Col N="749" /> of peat land.  They considered the production of peat and peat products and the possibilities in regard to forestry, grassland and horticultural and other crops.  At that time they stressed the need for a national coordinating body to be set up.  I would repeat that call to the Minister now, to set up such a body to deal with this problem.  We should also examine the possibility of EEC grants being made available for areas like these. I know of no other areas, particularly when the production of peat has finished there, that would better deserve the title of disadvantaged areas. We should also examine the possibility of fen peat being used for horticultural purposes and ensure that it is preserved, because I am sure that here is the greatest potential of all in regard to the future of cutaway bog.</P>
    <P>Whatever is done with the cutaway bog, I would suggest&mdash;and I am going into a contentious area here because different suggestions have been made &mdash;that there should be an overall authority appointed that would be responsible for drainage.  It has been suggested in some places that the large tracks of bog be given back to individual farmers.  I believe this would present difficulties, particularly with the cost of the drainage that would be required, and it is essential that one body be responsible for drainage.  With many farmers involved it can easily be seen that the man who was not so careful about drainage could undo the good work of the others.  Possibly I could take this opportunity of advocating the stepping up of the priority of the Barrow Drainage.  It will be some years before it is reached if the present priorities are adhered to.  I was under the impression that a cost/ benefit analysis was carried out some time ago and I was very confident that this would show that any money spent on the Barrow drainage would prove of far greater benefit than some of the drainage schemes that have priority over the Barrow scheme.  In many cases drainage is being done in areas where the land is not good.  The land surrounding the Barrow is good, and if the Barrow drainage was finished now it would release a great deal of good land which cannot now be properly <Col N="750" /> farmed because of water.</P>
    <P>There should be money made available for joint drainage schemes, and possibly grant aid for pumping stations; Bord na Móna have proved that these function very well, and Bord na Móna are the ideal body to undertake this work.  They have the machinery and the expertise; they own the land and they are the people who could best develop whatever type of farming or other activity that would be suited to the land.  They could also help to develop the ancillary industries such as the canning of vegetables and fruit.  There was an unfortunate experience with Erin Foods and the canning industry, and that is inclined to colour our thinking on this matter. However, with a market on our doorstep and free access to the EEC to feed millions, if we were capable of producing quality food on cutaway bogs a great deal of employment could be provided in the area.  In regard to farming in the bog areas of the three counties of Laois, Offaly and Kildare, a recent survey would seem to prove that great strides can be made with a little co-operation.</P>
    <P>Cutaway bog could be given to farmers with isolated pockets, but we must ensure, first of all, that sufficient peat is left to work on to give a base for the crops it is desirable to grow. In the main, we should hold on to the huge areas that are there and develop them under an overall authority like Bord na Móna to help to create the maximum employment for workers who want to&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>This would allow conservation to go hand in hand with what I am dealing with, the utilisation of the bogs, first of all to produce turf and when their duty in that regard is done we must preserve them for the future from a conservation point of view.  I consider I am in order in dealing with that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been proved beyond doubt that we can improve the environment in cutway bogs such as at Roberts-town where it is hoped to have an <Col N="751" /> artifical lake and possibly a sanctuary for ducks.  Cutaway bog need not be unsightly if necessary drainage is provided to produce good farmland.  The work that has been done by Bord na Móna indicates the possibility of a very good outlook for our land in the future.  A poet, William A. Byrne, from Rathangan wrote a poem called <i>The Purple Heather</i> and if I may quote two lines from it, he said:</P>
    <P>The purple heather is the cloak God gave the bogland brown,</P>
    <P>But man has made a pall of smoke to hide the distant town.</P>
    <P>He contrasted the God-given delights of nature with man-made marvels of the town.  I hope that the future of our cutaway bog will include homes and work for our people.</P>
    <P>I say to the Minister that there is an immediate need for a policy in the EEC which will free us from our dependence on imported energy and, hopefully, enable us to develop a nuclear energy system.  I read recently that by the eighties both the USA and the USSR will have exhausted their supplies of oil and we will need some acceptable cheap alternative.  Present progress in the nuclear field would not lead to any great optimism that we would reach that target.  The EEC countries would need to step up their programme.</P>
    <P>In any programme for energy of a nuclear nature there would seem to be proposals from people who are opposed to any change.  You may call them cranks, if you like, but we must reach a balance between the conserva-tionists and the progressives.  We must avoid the stagnation of the ultra-conservatives and the chaos of uninhibited progress.  People who are very keen on progress will constantly harp on the fact that we cannot live on scenery and those interested in conservation will say that any life other than the life they want would not be worth living.  Our party propose that we chart a middle course and so get the best of both worlds.  The Government will be faced soon with a decision in this matter in regard to the opencast mining proposed for Bula and they will have to balance the jobs created <Col N="752" /> there against the permanent scar which will be left on the countryside.</P>
    <P>We in Kildare are faced with the same type of situation.  This was highlighted by a recent report of a study in countryside conservation commissioned by Kildare County Council for the East Kildare Uplands.  The area involved is bordering on the Wicklow mountains with the dual carriageway to Naas on one side and the Dublin/ Blessington road on the other.  This area has been subjected to great development pressures which have been resisted by our county up to now. We feel that we have preserved the ideal scenic area in the foothills of the Wicklow mountains.  Most of these hills are Silurian shale covered in the middle and lower levels with deposits of sand and gravel.  Gravel pits are a feature of the landscape particularly on the eastern boundary in Wicklow and near to Punchestown.  A continuation of this type of exploitation would turn a lovely landscape into a moonscape.  We in Kildare have to examine the report and decide whether we should curtail future sand and gravel workings and confine them to selected areas, possibly with a greater insistence that the developer should restore the worn-out pits to agricultural use.  There is a possibility too that we might be asked to put a complete embargo on building on the higher exposed reach.</P>
    <P>If we decide on such a course of conservation in the hope of preserving our part of the country in its present state and of providing an amenity on the doorstep of thousands of people in Dublin&mdash;south County Dublin and west Wicklow have been pushed out to our borders&mdash;we have to embark on a policy which will discourage property owners from making a quick &ldquo;buck&rdquo; by selling a site or opening a small sandpit and possibly exploiting some minor workings which would be incapable of being restored to agricultural use later.  This policy would be highlighted by the developments across the border in Wicklow.  The Government need to intervene and channel industry into these discused gravel pits in the Kill area and so provide work at home for those who have been denied jobs by our conservation <Col N="753" /> policy.  Government intervention to dissuade them from taking part in the free-for-all is needed.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to a minor matter which is causing disquiet in some areas, namely the denuding of the countryside of trees.  These are regarded as a source of energy also, and in the process untold harm is done to the country.  More intensive agricultural methods in the removal of hedges and trees to form bigger fields has changed the landscape and the distinct agricultural character of some of our land.  Possibly new hedge-cutting facilities too have contributed to the cutting of hedges and trees in this area of Kildare, and this is something that will not be replaced within a generation.  We would need to preserve the trees and we should endeavour to preserve a proper ecological balance in the preservation of trees and hedges.</P>
    <P>The government are fortunate that in the area mentioned they were recently given as a present to the nation two very valuable estates, Russborough in Wicklow and Barretts-town in Kildare.  There are lovely trees in these estates and the fact that the Government own them will ensure that they are preserved.  I hope that some scheme will be forthcoming to ensure conservation and propagation of copses and spinneys, and to encourage the wildlife to remain there. This should be a subject dear to the Minister's heart as he has spent so much time dealing with it up to very recently.  All these areas have a great potential and Kildare County Council have shown responsibility in their attitude up to now and the landowners have too.  I suggest that the Government of the day should point the way to conservation in the future development of this area where there is marvellous potential.</P>

      <P>We have shown that present Government policy falls far short of what is needed today.  I would ask the Minister to get with it even at this late stage.  Some of the Semi-State bodies have shown admirable pioneering spirit, particularly the ESB with <Col N="754" /> their new scheme at Turlough Hill which has produced hydro-produced electricity with pumping done at night during the off-peak period.  Many of us had an opportunity of visiting there and seeing how it is done but we have not experimented to the extent that we should have with our own natural resources, resources that we hope are not expendable such as the one we are utilising now.</P>
      <P>I hope this motion will have the result of improving the Minister's thinking in the matter and in instilling into the Government some of our feelings that something of an urgent nature needs to be done.  I would refer the Minister to the thinking of Balfour when he said the energies of our system will decay, and the glory of the sun will be dimmed and the earth, tideless and inert, will no longer tolerate the race which has for a moment disturbed its solitude; man will go down into the pit and all his thoughts will perish.  I hope the Government will get away from the inertia that seems to have prevailed in this sphere up to now and do something about giving us a proper energy programme and pay attention to the conservation that we feel is very necessary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Cavan):</i> I will explain my absence from the opening of this debate yesterday, and apologise to the House if that is necessary.  I was engaged in Brussels on an EEC Council of Energies Ministers and later in the day on a Council of Research and Development Ministers.  I am not complaining, but when the Opposition put down this resolution I let them know that I would not be able to attend the opening yesterday.  I wish to put the record right in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We had an interesting and very long day yesterday in Brussels.  The meeting did not conclude until 4.30 a.m.  In the course of this debate yesterday I understood that Deputy Barrett criticised the slow rate at which the EEC was developing an energy policy.  In that regard I will tell the House very briefly what transpired yesterday.  We reviewed the energy situation in general and I availed of the opportunity to appeal for a community approach, <Col N="755" /> while at the same time safeguarding the circumstances of each country. The refinery industry which Deputy Barrett dealt with yesterday came up for discussion and it appeared from the facts given that the European Community area is labouring under an over-capacity as far as refineries are concerned.  I was there as the Minister for energy for Ireland to state our claim to establish another refinery here, if and when the time is ripe. The thinking there is that more refineries are unnecessary and that some existing ones should be closed down and that when they become obsolete they should not be replaced.  The question of Euratom loans for the establishment of nuclear energy plants was at long last disposed of and the Community has the power to proceed with the granting of such loans.  The question of imports of coal from outside the Community was discussed, and the suggestion was that imports should be monitored to see if any problem would arise.  Representing Ireland, which is far from self-sufficient in the energy field, I stated our claim to import coal from areas where we could get it cheapest, such as Poland, and I left no doubt in anybody's mind where we stood there.  Energy saving came up for discussion and the thinking was that there should be a special reference to clamping down on oil imports into the Community.  Again I had to have regard to our special circumstances as a country which relies on the importation of oil from outside the Community. I made our position quite clear in that regard.  In the early hours of this morning a multiannual research programme for the years to 1981 was settled.  That programme covers a fairly wide area of research in the sphere of new energy sources, such as solar, wind and water as well as nuclear reactor safety, and matters of that sort.  These are the sort of things that are being discussed in Europe.  Final decisions are not instant, they have to be worked out as a consensus.  It is vitally important that a Minister from this country should be at these meetings to have regard to the circumstances of this country and to make our position clear and to safeguard us.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="756" /> We are debating a resolution in the name of Deputy Barrett calling on the Government to prepare and implement a national energy policy based on the maximum use of the country's national resources and the making of adequate provision for the protection of the natural environment.  My predecessor, the Minister for Education, moved an amendment to that in my name, calling on Dáil Éireann to approve of the energy policy of the Government which is aimed at optimum development of the country's natural resources, ensuring an adequate and secure supply of energy at reasonable cost, and promoting rational and efficient use of energy while making adequate provision for the protection of the natural environment.  We have an energy policy, if we had not, it would not alone be a reflection on this Government but on the previous Government and on my predecessors in office I will again put on the record of the House the main points in regard to energy policy.  We belive in the optimum development of indigenous energy sources, in access to the cheapest markets for imported energy where that is necessary, in diversification of sources of energy supplied, in the promotion of economy in the use of fuels, in stockpiling against emergency situations and in participating in research aimed at the discovery and development of new energy sources.  The optimum development of indigenous energy sources has been national policy since the Electricity Supply Board was instituted many years ago.  It is necessary to put on the record of this House that we were probably one of the first countries in the world to recognise the importance of harnessing our natural raw resources for energy.</P>
    <P>That was done through the establishment of the ESB, a board that has been so successful that it is at present providing 98 per cent of the population with electricity.  That is a record that is not enjoyed even by many of the developed and highly productive countries in the world.  Let me give the Opposition credit for commencing the development of peat, another example of our natural resources being harnessed and used for energy purposes. In more modern times we have <Col N="757" /> established An Bord Gáis to obtain gas from our offshore resources and use it for energy purposes with a view to saving imported coal.  If that is not enough the Nuclear Energy Board has been established looking to the future with the far-seeing countries of the world to provide nuclear energy.</P>
    <P>That is a record I think many countries in the world would be proud of as regards the harnessing of indigenous energy resources and I would be prepared to stand up in any forum, recite that list and say it is a good performance and all credit to those who have achieved it.  It is not reasonable to try to downgrade it.  I and my predecessors in office gave the land; others followed and between us we have harnessed our natural resources for energy in a way that we can be happy about.</P>
    <P>We believe in access to the cheapest markets for imported energy.  I was in Brussels yesterday in pursuance of that policy demanding that we should be permitted to import the cheapest coal we could get from Poland because it is cheaper than other coal and that we should be permitted to import the cheapest oil we could get whether it comes from Russia or elsewhere.  That is the second plank in our energy policy.</P>
    <P>We believe in diversification of energy sources.  Few countries have as good a record in this regard.  We rely on hydro power, peat power, on oil, on native coal and native gas as well as&mdash;thinking for the future&mdash;on nuclear power.  That is diversification. I put it to the House and to the sponsors of the motion that this is not a bad performance.</P>
    <P>Promotion of economy in the use of fuel is very important at present. Four or five years ago this was not so because oil was for next to nothing and there was cheap fuel.  Oil is now dear and will never again be cheap and it is up to our people to become educated in regard to the conservation of oil and saving of energy.  The Government have embarked on that project.  We have set up various bodies to promote saving of energy.  We had a report produced by Dr. Henry which obviously Deputy Barrett does not like but I make no apology for <Col N="758" /> saying that it is a worth-while report It has highlighted the necessity for saving where savings can be effected and has brought the whole matter out into the open.  As a result of that study four projects, two in the industrial sector and two in the private sector are being studied at present by An Foras Forbartha and the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards and the money is being provided by the Government to make those studies possible so that we may get advice and reports on how savings may be effected in the use of energy. There is much more scope for further studies and advice on ways of conserving dear energy which will never again be cheap.  That is part of our policy.</P>
    <P>As regards stockpiling against emergency situations, a few weeks ago I made orders complying with EEC regulations ensuring that there will be 90 days supply of oil available here. I have told the House that we are participating in research aimed at the discovery and development of new energy sources.  That is the Government's policy in a nutshell.  When this motion was put down by the Opposition following many opportunities which they had for discussing energy policy&mdash;and there were discussions in my predecessor's time on a number of Estimates, Bills and resolutions on the Government's energy policy time and again&mdash;I was notified by my officials that the Opposition were calling on the Government to establish an energy policy, I thought that we would hear something new, that we would get something worth while out of the debate. I was not here yesterday but I have read Deputy Barrett's contribution and I have listened to Deputy Power's speech today and there is nothing new in them.  It is another political episode, another piece of play-acting.  I do not blame the Opposition; they are entitled to do that but let us analyse Deputy Barrett's contribution.  He proposes the establishment of an energy authority and he blames the Government for using offshore gas to generate electricity.  I shall deal briefly with those two items.</P>
    <P>I assume that in using the word <Col N="759" />&ldquo;authority&rdquo; Deputy Barrett meant some group that would generally supervise the energy area and exercise some sort of policy function in the matter. I want to make clear that responsibility for ensuring adequate and secure supplies of energy for the economy rests on the Government and specifically on me as Minister for Transport and Power within the areas with which I have just dealt.  That responsibility must be exercised to ensure the appropriate institutional framework for the production and distribution of energy through policy control of the various agencies involved and by securing adequate provision of capital to meet the investment needed.  No board or authority that Deputy Barrett will set up can relieve the Government or relieve me of that responsibility.  The institutional framework to which I referred already exists.  In the electricity area we have the ESB which has never failed to meet the needs of our growing economy and is providing 98 per cent of our citizens with electricity at prices which compare more than favourably with most other European countries.  Our main native fuel resource, peat, has been developed in a comprehensive and imaginative way by Board na Móna who also enjoy a national reputation not only for their sucessful development of a valuable energy source but also for the contribution they have made to the social and economic development of areas in our country.</P>
    <P>In recent years we have established two further agencies to meet our needs. We have set up the Nuclear Energy Board to advise on all aspects of nuclear development including particularly the question of nuclear safety.  Following the discovery of the Kinsale Head natural gas field, we have established Bord Gáis Éreann not only to ensure the rapid development of that field but to provide the basis for development of the further gas finds which we all hope will be established as a result of our exploration programme.  The Government have indicated also their intention of establishing a State oil company in the event of discovery of oil in the Continental Shelf area and the Minister <Col N="760" /> for Industry and Commerce is already taking the initial steps in that direction.</P>
    <P>The existing agencies which I have mentioned are answerable to me.  I appoint the boards of directors.  I indicate the broad policy which they are expected to pursue.  Their capital development programmes are subject to my approval.  I constantly review their financial performances and I meet all the boards on a regular basis as part of a continuing process of policy review.  Not all the energy undertakings fall into the public sector.  Our coal supply, which comes mainly from abroad, is handled on a private enterprise basis.  My Department maintain regular liaison with the firms involved with a view to ensuring adequacy of supply for consumer needs.  We maintain regular contact also with the oil distributing companies and, in conjunction with our partners in the European Community, we are developing and sharpening our informaton systems on the oil companies to ensure a fuller understanding of the working of the industry.</P>
    <P>I am not clear what need exists for a further authority.  It seems to me that Deputy Barrett is fascinated by the prospect of some kind of superior authority who could by some mysterious means solve problems in the energy field which have confounded countries with greater wealth and stronger economies than ours&mdash;countries like France, Germany and the United Kingdom who are also grappling with precisely the same problems as we have here in Ireland.  What I am saying is that we already have an energy authority here; it is, in fact, the Government and more specifically the Minister for Transport and Power. I have no intention of shirking my responsibilities in this matter or of passing the buck by setting up some committee or council with vague functions and no powers.  I am, of course, concerned that the machinery available to me in dealing with these problems is fully capable of the task and that it is adequate to the increasing demands which have developed and are continuing to develop in the energy area. Within the past year we have greatly <Col N="761" /> improved our knowledge of the energy market in Ireland, of the pattern of energy flows and the breakdown of end uses.  We have greatly improved our statistical information and we have been identifying areas where there is scope for improvement of efficiency or elimination of waste.</P>
    <P>I propose to go further in this direction by setting up in the near future in my Department to advise me a full planning unit which will be headed by a senior officer assisted by a small expert staff.  One of the main functions of the new unit will be the forecasting of future energy needs, maintaining close liaison with the energy undertakings to ensure that supplies will match future demands, advising on such matters as the optimum fuel mix and other energy issues.  I announced this very shortly after becoming Minister for Transport and Power.</P>
    <P>We should, of course, have no illusions about the importance of energy in our economy or about the nature of the serious issues facing all western countries.  Yesterday I discussed these issues at great length and in great depth with my colleague, the energy Ministers of the European Community, during a period of some 16 hours.  Even countries richly endowed with resources such as Britain with her coal, oil and gas, Germany with her immense deposits of coal and the Netherlands with her extensive gas fields have no easy answer to many of the problems of the future.  If Deputy Barrett considers that the establishment of new committees or that some new extension of bureaucracy can provide an answer to these grave problems, he is greatly mistaken.</P>
    <P>I want to make the position clear. We have the policy and I am responsible for its implementation.  I am not saying this in any personal way but Deputy Barrett on the occasion of every opportunity that has arisen in the past few months has sought to complain about our use of the Kinsale gas find.  I do not expect there is any objection to the use by Nítrigin Éireann Teoranta of 40 per cent of that find.  We are using the remaining 60 per cent by allocating some to the <Col N="762" /> Cork Gas Company but most of it to the ESB for the generating of electricity thereby, saving about £16 million worth of oil imports in a year. Fianna Fáil are recent converts to the policy of using gas for a purpose other than the generating of electricity.  In the short time at my disposal I would refer the House to Deputy Barrett's comments during the course of a private members' motion moved by him on 13th March, 1974&mdash;another motion in which he was critical of the Government's handling of energy affairs.  I quote from column 174 of the Official Report for that day when the Deputy said that the Minister:</P>
    <P>might tell us what plans the Government have in the pipeline in regard to the natural gas find off the south coast.  Is it intended that the ESB should be given access to some of this natural gas?  Surely that would be a cheap method of producing electricity?  Or do the Government intend to let other interests develop this natural gas into other products?  As far as I know, the ESB should be very interested in having access to this natural gas for the purpose of producing electricity.</P>
    <P>Does the Deputy wish to go back on that? I wish to go back further to a period when Fianna Fáil had responsibility for energy policy.  The then Minister for Transport and Power, Mr. Lenihan, in introducing an Estimate for his Department said while referring to the possibility of the introduction of nuclear power to the ESB generating system, as reported at column 464 of the Official Report for 25th November, 1971:</P>
    <P>In this connection I might mention that a new dimension has been given to this problem by the recent discovery off Kinsale of what appears to be a promising natural gas find.  While further testing and exploratory drilling will be required before it is established that there is a gas field capable of commercial operation in this area, the ESB will be closely watching developments over the next couple of years.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="763" /> The capital cost of a generating plant based on natural gas would be about 60 per cent of equivalent nuclear capacity.  Existing and planned oil-fired stations could be converted to natural gas at a relatively low cost.  A gas discovery within the area would, of course, have enormous advantages from the point of view of security of energy supplies.</P>
    <P>The then Minister advised that gas should be used by the ESB to generate electricity.  All members of Fianna Fáil cannot be suffering from short memories but it would appear that loss of memory is a party failure where they are concerned because for the past couple of evenings we have listened to Deputy Barrett blaming the Government and me for using gas for the generating of electricity while he is on the record as having advised us to do so while a predecessor of mine, a Fianna Fáil Minister, gave the same advice.</P>
    <P>I have as much material here as would keep me going for an hour but there is not that much time remaining to me.  I can assure Deputy Power that the bogs of Ireland and, no less, the cutaway bogs are dear to my heart.  I agree that there is scope here for planning and consideration.  We must reclaim the cutaway bogs.  That is being done and Bord na Móna will continue to do it.  We must see that the cutaway bogs which will then be productive land will be used in the best national interest.  We must see to it that the jobs of the people who have worked in the bogs over the years, and their families, are secure in their present habitat.</P>
    <P>In my opinion, that calls for a study by various Departments: the Department of Agriculture who now have as an appendage the Land Commission, Bord na Móna and the Industrial Development Authority under the Department of Industry and Commerce. It is up to those three agencies &mdash;and they have plenty of time at their disposal&mdash;to see to it that the land is properly reclaimed and that, when it is reclaimed, it is used in the best <Col N="764" /> national interest and that the jobs of the workers are maintained.  That is my objective.  That is the objective of my colleagues in Government.  That is the objective of the Government.  I am sorry I cannot deal with the many other matters I should like to deal with.  When the Estimate is being debated, I hope to make a much longer contribution.</P>

      <P>We were in no way critical of the Minister's absence last night.  We fully understood the reasons for his absence, lest he might think we were critical of him.  The Minister wondered why we brought forward this motion.  We did so because we felt it was time to highlight again the lack of a Government energy policy.  It was said last night and again tonight that there were many debates on energy.  The last time we had an Estimate from the Minister's Department was about a year-and-a-half ago.</P>
      <P>So far as we can see&mdash;and we believe we are right&mdash;the Government have no energy policy.  This debate has again shown the lack of understanding and ability of the Government to take the necessary measures to deal with the energy problems which we have had since October, 1973.  The only source of energy displayed from that side of the House by Government speakers was all the hot air expelled in the different debates.  Unfortunately, we cannot create energy out of that hot air, and we still have an energy problem.  The arguments and generalities we heard have solved nothing.</P>
      <P>What we want to know, and what the people we represent want to know, is: why do we have to pay such exorbitant prices for gas, electricity, petrol and heating oil?  Why does the manufacturer have to pay so high a price for the energy which is so essential for the production of his goods? Why does he have to pay such high prices for the transportation of the goods he manufactures?  Why does the farmer have to pay such a high price for his fuel and the energy he requires?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Why do the fishermen have to pay up to £600 per week for oil to take them to the fishing grounds which so <Col N="765" /> far the Government have failed to secure for them?  Why do the glass-house owners have to spend so much time and effort in working for the benefits of the big oil companies?  Why have 120,000 registered unemployed and 40,000 unregistered unemployed to remain unemployed?  Why have 30,000 to 40,000 school leavers such dim prospects for employment?  The Government are in the saddle.  It is their job to produce an energy policy, and has been over the past three years.  We will set out our energy policy in a very short time, I can assure the Minister.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Education last night and the Minister tonight said the main elements of their policy are the optimum development of indigenous energy resources and access to the cheapest markets for imported energy. Bord na Móna are doing a very good job and it was not under this Government that they were initiated.  In recent years we had one opportunity to get the optimum benefit for the people from a natural source of energy, the natural gas find.  I do not care how many times the Minister quotes the former Minister, Brian Lenihan, or myself who asked what was it intended to do with that find.  The fact is that the Government have given 60 per cent of that natural gas to the ESB and the only reason for that put forward by the Minister's predecessor in the debate on An Bord Gáis was that we had to utilise it as quickly as possible. In other words, expendiency was the reason.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not look over my shoulder at what was said, four, five or ten years ago.  I believe in looking at the problems of 1977 in the context of 1977.  When I said we should not give 60 per cent of that gas to the ESB I meant it, and I still mean it, because they are about to waste up to 75 per cent of the thermal value of that natural gas for the sake of expediency where the Government were concerned. This was true at that time, and it is still true. <Col N="766" /> We are the only country within the EEC who will allow natural gas to be used for the generation of electricity. Other countries did so before the EEC made their recommendation.  They have not done so since.  According to the EEC regulation, we are right in saying it should not be used for the generation of electricity.  We had an opportunity to utilise it to the maximum benefit of the country, to feed it into centres where there are gas mains such as Dublin and smaller cities, to build a gas grid to get the maximum benefit from low cost energy.  Low cost energy is vital to our industries and will continue to be vital.  The natural gas found in the North Sea has proved that to Britain, to the extent that the British Electricity Authority and the Coal Board are unable to compete with natural gas as a means of low cost energy and, about a year-and-a-half ago, tried to get further taxes imposed on natural gas to enable the other two bodies to compete. These are the facts and they will remain facts.</P>
      <P>The other part of the Government's energy policy which was spelled out for us was access to the cheapest markets for imported energy sources.  We are buying coal in Poland and that is probably the cheapest place to buy coal.  That is only a small percentage of the energy we require.  Oil is still the big question and will continue to be the big question for many years as far as we can see.  Our bogs will run out, just as oil wells run out.  We are still refining 50 per cent of our oil products.  I said last night and I repeat it now, until we are self-sufficient in refining capacity with a second refinery outside the control of the multinational oil companies that did a right job on us during the oil crisis we will not have control over supply or costs.  These are two vital factors.</P>
      <P>Last night the Minister for Education told us a refinery is a refinery is a refinery.  He said it is nothing more than a method of refining crude oil into the various products needed for petrol, residual heavy fuel oils for the generation of electricity, light fuel oil and central heating.  The Minister really gave us some information there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="767" /> Of course an oil refinery has all these functions.  Nobody denies it.  I appreciate the problem of making it economically viable because I know that oil refineries in Europe are running at 60 per cent capacity.  There was a proposal not long ago for Dublin Bay and the proposers were able to prove to themselves that the project would be economically viable. In that instance it was not an extensive oil refinery.</P>
    <P>However, there is a lot more involved in an oil refinery than the functions I have listed.  An oil refinery could do a lot for our unemployment.  What about all the downstream industries that could develop as a result of a refinery? Why should an oil refinery not be used as a method of dealing with the 120,000 registered unemployed and the school leavers to put a dent in that unemployment figure?  Even though we have not yet found our own oil&mdash;hopefully we will but it may be some years before it can be brought ashore as happened in the North Sea&mdash;the fact is that we can buy crude oil direct at a lower cost than the multi-nationals are doing.  We can deal direct with the source.  We can charter tankers very cheaply in any part of the world.  They are tied up in dockyards and some firms would nearly pay one to put them into use. How much could we save in the haulage of crude oil from the Middle East to this country as compared with the way the cost is hidden by the Seven Sisters, the big multi-nationals?  There is no access to their costings.  We would be able to put crude oil into an oil refinery over which we would have some control at far less cost than is being charged at the moment.</P>
    <P>What about the 15p increase imposed by the Minister for Finance in December, 1974, on the petrol users? Were the Arab sheikhs to blame for that?  They certainly were not.  We know the sheikh who is to blame.  The same Minister imposed extra taxation on all other oil products in his 1976 budget as though industry and heavy fuel oil users had not enough to cope with.  It was an easy way of getting taxation from people who were hardpressed to compete industrially on the <Col N="768" /> home market and in markets abroad.</P>
    <P>Who is to blame for all these increases? Certainly it is not the OPEC oil sheiks.  It is the Government who are to blame and they cannot escape from that.  It would have taken three years to erect an oil refinery.  It is now three-and-a-half years since the oil crisis but we would still be in the same position if another oil crisis occurred. The Minister for Education last night said that I keep repeating the same criticisms.  My criticisms at the end of 1973 and in 1974 were valid and they are still valid.  We are still in the same position as we were in 1973 because the Government have done nothing about it.</P>
    <P>Last night I was asked about our attitude to a nuclear power station.  We have a nuclear board with a chairman, directors and probably staff.  What is the function of that board?  The nuclear power station that was envisaged has been deferred indefinitely but we add a little more to the cost by establishing a nuclear board, complete with staff.  What is the purpose?  We are told it is to advise the Minister.  I should like to know what they have to advise him on.</P>
    <P>It is now a fact that the nuclear power station envisaged would be uneconomical by present day standards and the cost would be much too great for what it would achieve.  It would give us about 16 per cent or 17 per cent of our energy requirements. Would it not have been much more beneficial to put that money into a gas grid to get the maximum benefit from a natural source of energy which we were fortunate enough to find?  We could utilise that to provide low-cost energy and the other low-cost fuels that would flow from it.</P>
    <P>The Government have no energy policy.  The Minister mentioned Bord na Móna and all the other bodies set up under Fianna Fáil.  With regard to the energy authority suggested by me, its purpose would not be to take responsibility from the Minister but to co-ordinate the various sources of energy the Minister mentioned.  This should be done rather than having them compete with each other, as is happening with the ESB and the Gas <Col N="769" /> Board at the present time with the result that fuels are more expensive for the users.  We should co-ordinate all <Col N="770" /> the sources we have for the benefit of all.</P>

Following investigation by a social welfare officer a deciding officer reassessed his means to include the yearly value of capital and income from self-employment which the applicant had not disclosed when he made his claim.  As a result of the revised decision the applicant was assessed with an overpayment of £857.56 in respect of unemployment assistance paid to him and to which he was not entitled.

      <P>On 22nd March, 1977, my <Col N="678" /> Department received a request for approval to a proposal of the assistant manager for Galway Corporation to limit any increase in rent arising from the implementation of the 1976 national differential rent scheme and general review of incomes to £2 per week, with effect from 1st July, 1976. On 25th March, a notification was received of a resolution passed at a meeting of Galway Borough Council on 21st March urging me &ldquo;to forego arrears of rent increases between July, 1976 to January, 1977&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The proposal and resolution are being examined in the light of my reply of 8th February last to a question on rents from the Deputy, and I expect to be in a position to make a decision in the matter in the very near future.</P>
