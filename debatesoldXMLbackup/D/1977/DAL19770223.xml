      <P>It is proposed to take business in the following order: Nos. 10, 12 (resumed), 14 (resumed) and 13 (resumed).  No. 13 will be taken at 3.30 p.m.  The last Opposition speaker will be called not later than 4.45 and the last Government speaker will be called on not later than 5.45, the debate to be concluded not later than 6.45.  Private Members' Business, No. 32, will be taken from 7 p.m. to 8.30 p.m.  Deputy Gene Fitzgerald inquired yesterday when No. 21 will be taken.  It will be some time because the Bill is still with the draftsmen.</P>

      <P>I thank the Taoiseach for this information.  I should like, a Cheann Comhairle, to bring to your attention the fact that I believe that the Minister was in breach of the procedures of this House in having an official of his Department convey and discuss the contents of this Bill at a week-end seminar before the contents of the Bill were available to the Members of this House.  This Bill was promised before the Christmas recess and circulation was promised during the recess.  We have not received it and, as the Taoiseach has informed the House this morning, it will not be ready for some time. Despite that, according to a report in <i>The Irish Times</i> on Monday, 21st February, 1977, an official of the Department outlined the measures to be contained in the Safety, Health and Welfare of Workers in Industry Bill, 1976. In view of that shabby treatment of Members of this House I believe that you should bring it to the attention of <Col N="132" /> the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.</P>

      <P>The Irish Congress of Trade Unions organised a seminar on the general subject of safety and health at work.  The programme of lectures at that weekend seminar included an appraisal of the existing safety and health at work situation in Ireland, the EEC action programme on safety and health at work, recent United Kingdom legislation and an outline of the future development of safety and health legislation in this country.  The Irish Congress of Trade Unions requested that my Department provide a speaker on this subject.  In accordance with my general wish that there should be a continuing dialogue with representatives of employer and trade union organisations, for which I am responsible, arrangements were made to have a speaker address the seminar on the subject of safety and an assistant principal of my Department attended in that capacity.  In his talk general reference was made to the type of subject which might be included in the proposed Safety, Health and Welfare of Workers in Industry Bill, 1976.  It was made quite clear by the speaker that parliamentary privilege precluded the disclosure of detailed information regarding Bills before they had been circulated to Dáil Deputies.  That is the position in relation to the seminar. As the Taoiseach has said, the Bill is still held up at the draftsman's office and the Deputy is aware that there is a great volume of legislation at present in that office.</P>

      <P>Having read the exchange that occurred in the Dáil yesterday regarding the Deputy's questions <Col N="133" /> to the Taoiseach, I made inquiries among the officials concerned. I was unaware of our attendance at the seminar.

    <Title>Social Welfare (Consolidation) Bill, 1976: Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Cluskey) Frank Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Cluskey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to consolidate into a single Act all existing enactments governing the social insurance and social assistance schemes administered by the Department of Social Welfare.  The Bill embraces the provisions of more than 60 existing Acts most of which contain some provisions which are still valid.  It also includes the provisions of subsidiary legislation, such as statutory instruments and statutory rules and orders, where such legislation expressly amends or modifies the statute law.</P>
      <P>The Bill does not of course provide for any change in the law as it stands at present and the Attorney General has issued a certificate in accordance with Standing Order No. 107 of this House to the effect that the Bill is purely a consolidating measure and as such does not promote any new law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A brief explanatory memorandum has been issued with the Bill and, as is required under the terms of Standing Orders, a memorandum prepared by the Attorney General has been prefixed to the Bill which shows the enactments which it is proposed to repeal and the <Col N="134" /> precise provisions of the Bill in which these enactments are reproduced.  I trust that these memoranda are of assistance to Deputies in their consideration of the somewhat complex provisions of this exceptionally large piece of legislation.</P>
    <P>As Deputies are aware, the process of consolidating legislation involves the grouping together within a single enactment of all those provisions of existing legislation in the area under consideration which remain valid.  It also can involve, as in this case, the re-arrangement of these various provisions into a logical and practical sequence suitable to the present needs of those who must implement and interpret the legislation. Consolidation also includes the repeal of such provisions as have, in the course of time, become obsolete and which have no longer any validity.</P>
    <P>The Bill contains some 311 sections and runs to more than 200 pages of print.  These facts clearly illustrate the scope and the complexity of the social welfare system as it has developed over time.  The Bill contains provisions embracing the schemes of social insurance, as provided for by the Social Welfare Act, 1952 and by the many subsequent amending Acts, including the Social Welfare (Pay-Related Benefit) Act, 1973.  It includes also provisions covering the schemes of social assistance as provided for by the Old Age Pensions Acts, the Unemployment Assistance Acts, the Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Acts and the Social Welfare (Supplementary Welfare Allowances) Act.  The Bill also embraces the legislative provisions of the children's allowances scheme, the intermittent unemployment insurance (&ldquo;wet-time&rdquo;) and the school meals and fuel schemes. And, of course, it includes the various ancillary provisions which relate to the administration of the various insurance and assistance schemes including the decision and appeals machinery, the various methods of financing and the arrangements for legal proceedings and so on.</P>
    <P>Thus, with the passage of this Bill, there will be for the first time a single Act of the Oireachtas making legislative provision for all aspects of the social welfare system.  It is my intention <Col N="135" /> that the new Bill should be made available, after its enactment, in a form comparable to that of the Income Tax Act, that is in a loose leaf form capable of being up-dated after the passage of any and all subsequent legislation. In this way the highly complex social welfare legislation will from now on be available in a more usable and readable form to those who have occasion to use it.</P>
    <P>This Bill has been prepared because of the legislative results of the expansion of the social welfare system over recent years.  The growth of the legislation necessary for the administration of the various social welfare schemes has reached the stage where the entire legislative framework has become so extensive and complex as to be extremely difficult and time-consuming to interpret.  When I announced in this House that work had started on the consolidation of social welfare legislation&mdash;in my Second Reading speech on the Social Welfare Bill of 1975&mdash; I pointed out that the long title of that enactment itself indicated the range of legislation governing this area, making, as it did, reference to Acts including the Old Age Pensions Acts and the Education (Provision of Meals) Acts covering the period from 1908 to 1974. I also pointed out that there were approximately 60 basic Acts and at least 350 regulations governing the schemes operated by my Department, not to mention innumerable examples of case or precedent law arising from the application of those Acts and regulations. I considered it appropriate to streamline all of this law so as to meet with the requirements of ease of access and greater clarity and so make for the more efficient administration of the whole system.</P>
    <P>In recent years there have been repeated requests from interested social services bodies in the public and private sectors for consolidation of social welfare legislation so as to provide them with a more easily understandable and more manageable body of legislation with which to work. Similar requests have been made by Members of both Houses of the Oireachtas and from all sides of those Houses for the consolidation of this <Col N="136" /> very complicated and yet very widely referred to body of legislation.  I hope that the Bill now before the House will serve to meet these very legitimate requests and to provide all these interested individuals and bodies with a meaningful and workable legislative framework.</P>
    <P>The main beneficiaries, to a great extent, of this change will of course be the officials of the Department of Social Welfare.  In their day to day work they must deal continuously with the interpretation and implementation of this wide range of Acts and subsidiary legislation.  I want at this stage to pay tribute to the officials of the Department who have carried out this task of consolidation.  It has been an arduous and demanding task calling for great attention and meticulous care and it has been accomplished with the skill which I have come to expect from the officials of my Department. I must also pay equally well deserved tribute to the officials of the Attorney General's office who have played a significant part in carrying out this work very speedily indeed.  They have all recognised the need for this development and have made a full contribution to its achievement.</P>
    <P>This Bill is among the largest to be presented to this House.  It will, following its Second Reading here, be referred to the Standing Committee on Consolidation Bills of the two Houses. I trust that it will be possible for the Committee to deal quite speedily with the Bill in order that it may be enacted and made available for use at the earliest possible moment.  I do, of course, recognise that the examination of such a complex piece of legislation is an enormous task and I can assure all those who will be involved in its scrutiny of the fullest co-operation of myself and of my Department in that work.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, may I say that I regard this consolidation as a most important piece of work in so far as it brings together, clarifies, and makes more manageable a body of legislation which is of profound importance to so many of our fellow citizens.  I intend that as soon as this legislation has been completed a consolidated set <Col N="137" /> of social welfare regulations, updating into a small and practical set of new regulations the vast range of existing statutory instruments, will be issued. When that is done I believe that a considerable step forward towards a more understandable social welfare code will have been taken.</P>
    <P>I do not, however, underestimate the extent of the continuing task of ensuring that everyone who has need to know about the social welfare code and its implications for them, either as recipients or as workers in the social services area, will be provided with all the information and assistance which they require.  That is a task which must be carried on with increased commitment and determination. I have pleasure in recommending this Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that the Parliamentary Secretary should have pleasure in recommending this Bill to the House because it is a singular achievement by the parliamentary draftsman, the officials in the Department of Social Welfare and in the Attorney General's office.  We must thank them for going some of the way towards preserving the sanity of those people who attempt to look up a particular piece of social welfare legislation and on that grounds they have done a good job.  Those of us who know the complexity of Acts, which go back to 1908 in this instance, can understand the achievement which this document enshrines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It must have been a daunting task. Since the Parliamentary Secretary first made the announcement in 1975 those people have been working very hard. I would like to join with the Parliamentary Secretary in thanking them for giving birth to this very important Bill.  There is nothing new in the Bill. We are constrained by the rules of the House from going into it in any great detail in the Second Reading debate. We will have a greater opportunity during Committee Stage, which will be taken in one of the committee rooms outside the Dáil Chamber, of going into it in more detail.  It is important to remember that the House cannot propose amendments to this Bill because it is consolidating existing legislation. <Col N="138" /> Of course, by definition, one cannot amend in committee live legislation, which is the term the experts use.  We are discussing live legislation.</P>
    <P>We have quite a number of queries to raise on Committee Stage.  I assume that this debate is limited to general observations on the quality and quantity of the document before us, Some years ago when I asked the Parliamentary Secretary if it was his intention to consolidate over 60 existing Acts and hundreds of statutory instruments and regulations he stated it was his intention to look into the matter in detail.  The Parliamentary Secretary, for that alone, must also share in the plaudits handed out to his officials.  He has been active in his Department.  This document indicates his activity and his concern.</P>
    <P>We are discussing a Bill which consolidates, on my last count, some 64 existing pieces of legislation.  I will not mention the number of sections I counted in case somebody suggests I counted them incorrectly.  In addition to the legislation before us we are also discussing the social charter with which our predecessors concerned themselves. It is very easy nowadays to condemn those who governed in the past for their apparent lack of concern but it can be seen under this Bill that there was social concern of one form or another since 1908.  In 1908 the Old Age Pensions Act was introduced. That is the first Act dealt with in this Bill and the last piece of legislation is the Social Welfare (No. 2) Act, 1976.</P>
    <P>This Bill outlines the concern from 1908 of our ancestors to the foundation of the State and from that time to late last year.  I accept that at the beginning of the century social welfare was welfare and was rather paternalistic.  It was given rather grudgingly and on the basis that if the State had to come to the rescue of some person or persons it would do go rather grudgingly.  Nevertheless, the social welfare, social security and social affairs consciousness or awareness of the citizens of the State has proceeded to develop and that development can be seen throughout the structures of the various Acts consolidated in this Bill.  For <Col N="139" /> instance, the Bill shows the beginning of an awareness of the State's need to look after the aged in the first Act of 1908 and the State went on to introduce the children's allowances scheme, &ldquo;wet-time&rdquo;, pay-related benefit, widows and orphans, deserted wives and prisoners wives allowances which were introduced by the National Coalition.  They indicate a development of a social consciousness.  For this alone this Bill must be seen as a good thing.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note the awareness of the various political parties over the years.  From the foundation of the State and the taking of power by the Cumann na nGaedheal Government, from 1922-23 to approximately 1931-32, four social welfare Acts were passed, according to the Bill before the House. Under Fianna Fáil, from 1932 to 1948, subject to absolute accuracy, about 18 social welfare Acts were passed and from 1948 to 1951, the period of the first Coalition Government, three social welfare Acts were passed.  Fianna Fáil Governments, from 1951 to 1954, introduced one or two Acts.  During that period of office Fianna Fáil introduced what could be described as the foundation stone of future social welfare Acts, the Social Welfare Act, 1952, which contained more than 125 sections.  That was an achievement by the whole House rather than an achievement by an individual Government.  One can see from the Official Report of those debates that there was great participation by all sides on that occasion.  The second Coalition Government introduced about three Acts and during the last 16 years of office of Fianna Fáil more than 20 Acts were introduced. They were important Acts and they included occupational injury scheme and pay-related benefit scheme&mdash;although they were introduced by this Government they were prepared by Fianna Fáil when in office.</P>
    <P>This Bill is a monument to the politicians of the past and the present and it will be a reference book for the politicians of the future.  I was pleased to read in the explanatory memorandum that the Bill embraces many far-reaching and wide references.  It includes social insurance schemes, social assistance <Col N="140" /> schemes, children's allowances schemes, &ldquo;wet-time&rdquo; schemes, school meals schemes, fuel schemes, footwear schemes and many other schemes.  I do not wish to enter into any great area of contention on this but when we are discussing a Bill which contains 64 Acts, 311 sections and five Schedules many questions must arise.  I am not suggesting that the Committee which will deal with this will meet in secret and I have no doubt that there will be a place for the Press to report the proceedings of that Committee.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary should inform the House when the Social Welfare (Supplementary Welfare Allowances) Act, 1975, will be brought into effect.  We understood that that Act would be brought into effect in June of last year but we are still awaiting it. I understand it can be made operative by way of Ministerial Order.  On the occasion of its introduction the Parliamentary Secretary implied urgency and anxiety that the old social welfare concept, the Victorian hand-out concept, would be abandoned entirely.  I ask him to give the House an indication as to when the Social Welfare (Supplementary Welfare Allowances) Act will become operative.</P>
    <P>This presents an opportunity to discuss social welfare in a very general sense and to indicate to the Parliamentary Secretary my concern in relation to the pilot programme on poverty.  I understand certain discussions are taking place, or that they will in the next hours or days and, to use a cliche, I do not wish to exacerbate the dispute.  However, I share the view of Deputies that the pilot scheme will continue successfully.  It is a pity there has been a breakdown&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>On a point of order, Deputy Andrews tabled a question for yesterday in relation to the poverty schemes and the dispute.  I have no knowledge as to why the Deputy withdrew that question because had he proceeded with it I could have been pressed to answer questions on it by way of supplementary questions.  In these circumstances, I suggest it is not proper for the Deputy to avail of the Bill, which has no reference whatever to the poverty committee, in this fashion.  If he had wanted information he should not have withdrawn his question yesterday.  I respectfully suggest that he is not entitled to avail of this totally irrelevant occasion&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I wanted to inform the Parliamentary Secretary that I did not withdraw the question&mdash;I postponed it.  It is my intention to try to ensure that justice will be done on that front and that the poverty programme will be continued.  I understand that <Col N="142" /> since 1950 there have been four consolidation Acts.  The Bill before us is an important piece of legislation which will merit close scrutiny when it comes before the Committee.  In the explanatory memorandum it is stated:</P>
      <P>Consolidation is a process whereby &ldquo;live&rdquo; provisions of existing legislation are rearranged together in one single measure.  Amendments which in any way alter the existing law are not permissible.  However, where the language in old enactments was considered to be archaic it has been modernised and other changes have been made to improve on the original wording of some of the enactments which are being consolidated.  The Bill has been certified by the Attorney-General to be a consolidating measure.</P>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary has indicated that he will assist the Committee and I suggest that he will bring to the Committee's attention how and where the language has been simplified and modernised and changed with a view to improving the original wording of the enactments.  The indexation to the Bill might be somewhat improved. Far be it from me to advise the people who drafted the Bill because they have done a really magnificent job but I find the index somewhat confusing.  It does not quite distinguish&mdash;I say this with reservations&mdash;between statutory instruments and the Acts themselves.  It is a small point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary has indicated that he intends introducing a booklet similar to that available where income tax laws are concerned. If the Parliamentary Secretary could bring out a booklet in glossary form, something not too bulky, he would be doing a good job.  This Bill will become a reference book for anyone concerned with social welfare since 1908.  It will be one of the most important reference works since the foundation of the State and for that reason its presentation should be well done.  If cost is a factor, then it will have to be done as cheaply as possible but, if what I have suggested is done, then it will simply be a matter of adding on subsequent social welfare legislation.  I hope this Bill will be passed before the next general election, <Col N="143" /> though I have my suspicions one is imminent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as we are concerned, the Bill will be given an expeditious passage.  The Parliamentary Secretary says in the explanatory memorandum that there has been a certain re-wording of the archaic language, and properly so.  As a result of research, we have produced a number of words and phrases which might be rejigged to give an up-to-date meaning. I trust the Parliamentary Secretary will tell us what he has in mind in this regard.  The Bill is comprehensible enough.  Much of the legislation has never been seen by the vast majority of the people.  It has, of course, been seen by those who operate it&mdash;the officials in the Department and in the exchanges, the lawyers and the politicians. The people for whom this kind of legislation is introduced never read these Bills or do not know their existence. From that point of view this Bill is a good approach.  I and my colleagues shall have a more extensive contribution to make on Committee Stage.  I did attempt to widen the debate but the Ceann Comhairle quite properly brought me to order in regard to the limitations placed on me by Standing Orders.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill. There are over 60 Acts dealing with social welfare and it is difficult for ordinary people to understand their entitlements.  Sometimes, through ignorance, they deprive themselves of their entitlements.  I agree that simplification <Col N="144" /> in the language is desirable and from that point of view the booklet will be most important.  I hope examples will be given.  If they are, a great load will be taken off the public representatives. People come to me who are entitled to social welfare but are not getting it because they do not know their entitlements. This is important legislation where the under-privileged are concerned. As has been pointed out, successive Governments have passed a number of Social Welfare Bills.  That is a reflection on us really.  There are a great many people who need social welfare.  That is the situation, unfortunately, and it is the responsibility of the State to see that these people are not left in need.  The intention of the Bill is to ensure that people have a reasonable standard of living and that there will not be severe poverty.  We must accept the fact that poverty exists and will increase as our inflation rate rises.</P>

I understand a select committee are to examine it in detail and it is obvious they will have a long and tedious job.  In common with Deputy Andrews, I hope the Bill will not be delayed.  I suggest that consideration be given to issuing an explanatory booklet which should be circulated to Deputies and also be made available to the general public.  The booklet should be in language that can be comprehended by everyone.</P>

      <P>I welcome this clarification of a very complicated system. Those of us who have spent years trying to solve people's problems particularly in the area of social welfare find it is becoming more confusing.  The Parliamentary Secretary stated:</P>
      <P>I considered it appropriate to streamline all of this law so as to meet with the requirements of ease of access and greater clarity and so make for the more efficient administration of the whole system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="145" /> I have been dealing with the Department of Social Welfare for more than 25 years and I do not think there is there the efficiency that is necessary. There is too much duplication involved and its offices are scattered throughout Dublin.  A previous Minister, Mr. Boland, centralised the Department in Dublin and that was the greatest mistake. We opposed it as bitterly as we could and we explained what would happen.  We have to wait for weeks or months for decisions&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I will do so on this occasion but it may not be taken as a precedent.  Standing Order No. 108 is as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(1)  On the Second Stage of a Consolidation Bill the only amendment which may be moved to the motion, &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a second time&rdquo;, is one proposing the <Col N="146" /> omission of all words after the word &ldquo;That&rdquo; in order to substitute words stating a reason or reasons in challenge of the Certificate of the Attorney General.</P>
    <P>(2)  If on the amendment to the question, &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a second time&rdquo;, it is decided that the words proposed to be omitted stand part of the question the Bill shall forthwith be declared to be read a second time.</P>
    <P>Standing Order No. 114 which is also relevant states:</P>
    <P>In the Standing Joint Committee on a Consolidation Bill the only permissible amendments shall be amendments designed to be for the removal of ambiguities and inconsistencies, the substitution of modern for obsolete or inconvenient machinery or the achievement of uniformity of expression or adaptation to existing law and practice. Amendments of the nature of substantive amendment of the statute law shall not be in order.</P>
    <P>Deputy Coughlan will appreciate how limited we are on this Bill.  He will confine his remarks solely to the desirability of consolidating the existing social welfare code.</P>
    <Speaker pid="StephenCoughlan" hpid="Mr. Coughlan Mr. Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I wish to congratulate the Parliamentary Secretary on combining as concisely as possible the activities of his Department, particularly with regard to giving the public the information they need.  That should have been done a long time ago. However, a further step should be taken now.  It is all very well telling people about their entitlements but the problem arises with regard to when they get them.  That is what is causing me concern.</P>

      <P>There has been a welcome for the Bill from both sides of the House.  When Deputy Andrews confined his remarks to the Bill he was extremely constructive and, indeed, fulsome in his welcome for the measure and in his appreciation of the arduous and tedious work performed by officials of the Department of Social Welfare and <Col N="147" /> in the office of the Attorney General.</P>
      <P>Deputy Andrews described the Bill as a reference book on social welfare and I agree with him.  It is a most important development and it could rightly be described as a milestone in the development of the social welfare code.  I wish to join with Deputy Andrews in expressing my appreciation to the officials of my Department and in the Attorney General's office for the work they have performed in a very short period when one considers the size of the Bill.</P>
      <P>As has been mentioned here, there is a tremendous need for the general public to know their entitlements and rights.  Deputy Andrews pointed out that few members of the public read Acts of the Oireachtas but they are widely read by those who are active in certain areas.  I do not think any other Department deals directly with more people than does the Department of Social Welfare.  When this Bill is enacted it will enable voluntary and statutory bodies and social service workers throughout the country to have ready access to find what people's entitlements are.  A number of questions were raised, not all of them relevant, but they were raised.  I will deal with Deputy Coughlan's question about delays.</P>

      <P>Deputy Coughlan raised the question of delays.  I dealt with this matter at considerable length at Question Time yesterday by way of supplementary replies.  I pointed out that there were over one million new claims per year in the Department of Social Welfare, approximately 20,000 per week.  The number of delays that occur can be attributed to the fact that people do not give sufficient or correct basic information when they are initially making their claims, such as neglecting to enter their insurance numbers or giving the wrong insurance numbers.  At times we have had the experience of people putting the wrong address on applications.  At the same time, I acknowledge that there are instances of delays for which the <Col N="148" /> Department and I accept responsibility. When dealing with a volume of applications in excess of one million per year it is only natural that there is some human error.  The Department are conscious of the necessity to minimise and eliminate, if possible, any form of delay because, irrespective of how few they may be in relation to the volume we deal with, they can and, in some cases, do cause considerable personal hardship.  Deputy Coughlan's contention that centralisation of the system has added to the delays does not bear scrutiny and is not in accordance with the facts.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a fact that decentralisation would add to the delay. Deputy Andrews raised the question of changing obsolete wording and so on.  There has been relatively little change in relation to the whole Bill but officials of the Department will be available to the members of the Consolidation Committee and they will point out where such changes have taken place and will give every possible assistance to the Committee to enable them efficiently to scrutinise the Bill on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>The question of producing a smaller copy of the Bill was raised.  As I mentioned in my Second Stage speech, when the Bill is enacted it will be produced in a loose cover form which will be a more compact edition.  Not only will it be available to Deputies but it will be available to the public through the Government service.</P>
      <P>Deputy Andrews raised two other points and I should like to deal briefly with both of them.  The question of the poverty committee was one point.</P>

      <P>I said that.  The question of the Social Welfare (Supplementary Welfare Allowance) Act was also raised by the Deputy.  As I explained to the Deputy, that Act has been passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas.  It is appropriate that it would be included.  It requires a ministerial order to bring it into effect. Negotiations are continuing with the officers who will be required to operate the new Act.  I am hopeful that the negotiations will soon reach the stage where agreement can be reached for the introduction and implementation of that Act.  I am extremely anxious&mdash; and I know the Deputy shares my anxiety&mdash;to have that Act in operation as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>Can the Parliamentary Secretary say when the Committee will meet and can he give us its constitution? I should like to thank the Parliamentary Secretary for his kindness in <Col N="150" /> putting his officials at the disposal of the Committee.  The Parliamentary Secretary seems to be suggesting that there is a breakdown of the officials who will be operating the scheme.  The Parliamentary Secretary is aware that this matter has been going on for nine months.  As I understand it, the officials who will be operating the scheme are anxious to have it work as a matter of considerable urgency.  The people who are suffering most are the people for whom it is being introduced, the home assistance people.  The Parliamentary Secretary should bring to the attention of all sides this first concern. I agree that there must be equity and justice for all but could the Parliamentary Secretary go into more detail about the real hold-up in the introduction of this Act&mdash;it is not a Bill, it is an Act?  I do not want to be contentious on this subject either.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that, but I have a weakness myself for pointing out such weakness.  As I told the Deputy, there are negotiations going on between the organisations representing the home assistance officers under the appropriate arbitration and discussion machinery for their grades.  That is outside the Department of Social Welfare and under the conditions for the resolving of any matters that they might wish to resolve.  We do not engage in direct negotiation with them.  There is appropriate machinery for it.  As I said, I am hopeful the matter will reach a stage where the legislation can be enacted.  There is just one thing I would like to point out.  I am extremely anxious that the home assistance scheme would be eliminated in this country.  Deputy Andrews is talking about a delay of nine months in its elimination.  I would remind Deputy Andrews that the home assistance scheme is administered under an Act which was passed in 1847, and up to three or four years ago since the <Col N="151" /> foundation of the State Deputy Andrews's party had no less than 36 years opportunity to replace it.  Therefore, while I am anxious to expedite matters and regret any delay, I think it is only fair that that fact should be pointed out.</P>
      <P>On the question of the composition of the Committee and how it will operate, under Standing Orders the Committee may not meet earlier than 14 days after the motions have been passed in both Houses of the Oireachtas. The members of the present Standing Joint Committee on Consolidation Bills are Deputies Esmonde, de Valera, and Mrs. Desmond, and Senators Alexis FitzGerald, McAuliffe and Eoin Ryan.  In accordance with Standing Orders the Minister of the promoting Department should be an <i>ex officio</i> member but such Minister can nominate the Parliamentary Secretary attached to his Department to be an <i>ex officio</i> member instead.  I assume that is what will happen.  I also understand that the Committee can co-opt three additional members to those already on the Committee.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Cooney)</NameTxt>
      <P>When we adjourned the last day I was dealing with the compulsory purchase of fee simple and the constitutional aspects of it.  There are other aspects, of course, concerning this which I would like to develop now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is frequently stated that the right to purchase the fee simple which was introduced in the 1967 Act has not been availed of to any great extent. There is a genuine difficulty in evaluating such statements.  In the first place it is in the nature of things that a high proportion of transactions under the Act will never come to official notice. They are private transactions.  Only those which have been the subject of some difficulty which needed solution by reference to the arbitration procedures provided for in the 1967 Act have come to attention.  It is also true of course that even if the right to purchase the fee simple given in the Act were not availed of by people generally, this would not prove the Act a dead letter.  The existence of a right can serve a useful purpose even if the right is not exercised.  This may be particularly true in the case of ground rents where the existence of the right to purchase the fee simple may alleviate many people's <Col N="153" /> dissatisfaction with the leasehold system itself.  The tenant knows that he may exercise this right at any time in the future.  The occasion might for instance be when he wishes to transfer the property to borrow money on it, to carry out a total reconstruction or at the stage when the lease is coming towards its end.  In the latter case the tenant may be faced with a choice of buying the fee simple or renewing the lease at a higher rent.</P>
    <P>We may speculate as to why the right to purchase the fee simple has not been availed of more fully.  One of the reasons which has actually been adduced is that the legal expenses of purchasing were prohibitive.  In some cases it appears that, on making inquiries concerning the matter from their landlords, tenants learned that the legal expenses of the transaction would be prohibitive and so were discouraged from exercising their rights.</P>
    <P>I accept that there can in fact be cases where an intending purchaser can be prohibited or discouraged from purchasing his fee simple because of difficulties of this kind.  It is for this reason that the Bill proposes a new procedure for the purchase of the fee simple. Under this procedure the tenant may apply to the county registrar who will, as arbitrator, carry out the full transaction. He will satisfy himself that the tenant is entitled to purchase.  He will determine the purchase price and on receipt of the purchase money and whatever expenses are payable will give the fee simple to the tenant by way of a statutory vesting certificate. The purchase money will be lodged in court and the claims of the ground landlord and any other interests can be made against the money and the county registrar will pay it out of those interests as appropriate.</P>
    <P>I think that this provision will meet the needs of people who genuinely want to buy the fee simple but who have been discouraged from doing so either by reason of title difficulties or by reason of vague fears of such difficulties and the likelihood of heavy legal costs.</P>
    <P>Whether or not the provision will lead to a spate of purchases is another matter.  I hardly think so, largely <Col N="154" /> because there is room to believe that not that many tenants are really interested in buying out at all.  Indeed I have been informed that one landlord who some time ago offered his tenants the fee simple for seven years' purchase plus £25 for legal expenses had only a negligible response.  I am nevertheless convinced that the availability of this service will be fully justified even if it is availed of only by tenants with difficulties out of the ordinary.</P>
    <P>I should like to say at this point that the intention is to confine the use of the new statutory vesting procedure to the fee simple of dwellinghouses. This is of course logical.  I propose to introduce an amendment on Committee Stage to make this clear.</P>
    <P>As I have mentioned, the Bill provides for arbitration by a county registrar as the method for the settlement of questions or disputes, with a right to appeal to the Circuit Court against any arbitration decision.  This arbitration procedure is being extended to all the matters with which the Bill deals apart from certain specified exceptions as, for example, where the question of the award of damages arises under section 23 (4) of the Bill. In that type of case the determination of the matter is being reserved to the Circuit Court.  This means that the simple and inexpensive procedure for the determination of disputes under the system of arbitration that has been operating satisfactorily under the 1967 Ground Rents Act will now be extended to all the landlord and tenant matters that are covered by this Bill.</P>
    <P>The question of principle involved in solving disputes of the kind in question by arbitration rather than by court proceedings&mdash;including the constitutional aspect of the matter&mdash;was adverted to in the debates on the 1967 ground rents legislation.  The general feeling then was that matters of this kind are in fact appropriate for arbitration and for arbitration by county registrars in particular.  Nevertheless, in extending the use of arbitration into other areas of landlord and tenant, I have been careful to keep this question of principle in mind and <Col N="155" /> it is for that reason that the Bill reserves to the courts the particular matters I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>The remaining class of change which I mentioned initially as coming within the objectives of this Bill consist mostly of extensions or clarifications of the rights already available to tenants.  These are based on recommendations of the Landlord and Tenant Commission contained in their two reports.  There is quite a number of these changes and they are indicated in the explanatory memorandum which accompanies the Bill.  They are essentially changes which we can discuss more fully on Committee Stage.  I hope Deputies will not mind if I confine myself to the most important of them at this stage.  If any of the changes which I do not touch upon now happen to be of particular concern to Deputies I shall of course try to deal with them in my reply to the debate on this Stage.</P>
    <P>The Bill proposes a number of important changes of this kind which will affect the rights of occupational tenants, that is, those who do not own the &ldquo;bricks and mortar&rdquo;.  A tenant of this class is being given the right to a new tenancy of a dwelling after 20 years' continuous occupation by himself or by his predecessors in title.  At present, there must be 30 years' continuous occupation without any sale of the tenants' interest during that period.</P>
    <P>Another change is that where the arbitrator awards a new tenancy it will be for a 35-year term, unless the tenant opts for a shorter term, instead of the 21-year term which is usually granted by the court under the existing law. This change is related to the proposal that the rent on renewal will be subject to review at the instance of either the landlord or the tenant at intervals of seven years instead of remaining unaltered throughout the term of the new tenancy.</P>
    <P>The commission recommended the introduction of such reviews to cater for the inflationary situation and the longer terms now proposed.</P>
    <P>Such reviews are, of course, now common in tenancies negotiated between <Col N="156" /> tenants and landlords.  Another change relates to the time when a new tenancy may be obtained.  Under the 1931 Act the right to a new tenancy can arise only in or about the time of termination of the previous tenancy. The Bill proposes that a new tenancy may be claimed and granted as soon as the necessary conditions are satisfied, although the new tenancy is not to commence until the existing tenancy has terminated.</P>
    <P>A further change concerns compensation for improvements.  At present an occupational tenant is not entitled to such compensation where he has failed to serve the appropriate advance notice on his landlord.  The Bill proposes that compensation be allowed even where the notice has not been served, provided the landlord has not been prejudiced by non-service.</P>
    <P>In addition to these changes the conditions for the grant of a new tenancy are being relaxed.  It is proposed, in particular, that the right to the new 35-year tenancy should be given to business tenants even where there has been a break in the required period of use for business, if it would be reasonable to disregard the break.</P>
    <P>These are the main changes proposed in relation to occupational tenants.  As regards ground rent tenants the right to purchase the fee simple given by the 1967 Act is being extended to new classes of lessees and yearly tenants.  Those include, in certain cases, persons holding under leases for 50 years or more, instead of 99 years or more as at present.  Moreover, the right to purchase the fee simple and the right to a reversionary lease are generally being made alternative to one another.  One effect of this will be to extend the right to a renewed lease to certain classes of lessees and yearly tenants who, under the 1967 Act, have only the right to buy the fee simple.  The provision will not enable tenants who are given the right to a sporting lease under the 1971 Act the right to buy the fee simple.</P>
    <P>Also in relation to ground rent tenants a change is proposed whereby improvements carried out by the tenant will be taken into account in determining <Col N="157" /> the new ground rent on the grant of a reversionary lease.  At present such improvements count only in the case of occupational tenancies.  Perhaps I should mention at this stage that while the creation of new ground rents on dwellinghouses is being prohibited under the Bill, this prohibition will not extend to ground rents under reversionary leases.  Such an extension of the prohibition would amount to forcing tenants to buy out their ground rents rather than exercising the alternative right to get a renewed lease.</P>
    <P>One of the changes proposed is exceptional in that it is not in relief of tenants but is in the public interest in the broader sense.  This proposes to enable a landlord, in certain circumstances, to have an occupational tenancy in obsolete buildings terminated before the lease expires.  The Landlord and Tenant Commission in their first report describe the situation which sometimes arises when a sitting tenant will not give up possession except for exorbitant compensation or cannot be induced to move at all.  In this way he can hold up redevelopment or reconstruction schemes for whole areas.  The Bill proposes to allow the arbitrator to make an order terminating a tenancy in a case like this but goes on to provide very stringent safeguards for the tenant.  First, it must be reasonable to make the order terminating the tenancy.  In addition the relevant tenancy must have not less than three years and not more than 25 years to run.  Compensation must be paid for loss of the tenancy and for any further hardship to the tenant.  The tenant is to be paid a share of the financial benefit that accrues to the landlord from obtaining possession of the property.  At least six months' notice of termination must be given to the tenant and every termination order would be subject to a stay of one year.  In every case the landlord will be required to have a development scheme that includes the property and for which planning permission has been granted and either the buildings themselves must be obsolete or they must be in an obsolete area as defined in the 1963 Planning Act.</P>
    <P>There is one other change which I feel I should mention.  The Bill proposes <Col N="158" /> to rectify what one might describe as technical anomalies which have arisen under the present law. These are essentially of two kinds. First, tenants using premises for charitable and sporting purposes do not at present qualify for the right to a renewed tenancy because use for such purposes does not amount to use for business.  The Bill proposes to amend the definition of &ldquo;business&rdquo; so as to include such purposes so far as concerns occupational tenancies.  The second kind concerns particularly the Office of Public Works who, under the present law, are not entitled to renewal of their tenancies because they are not themselves actually in occupation of the premises.  The Bill also proposes to rectify this defect.</P>
    <P>These then are the main changes proposed.  As I have indicated already the Bill provides for a number of lesser changes.  Because of the technical and detailed character of these I feel that it would not be appropriate to comment on them at this stage.</P>
    <P>To summarise, this is what the Bill proposes to do.  It would give us a comprehensive modern statute containing the bulk of landlord and tenant law.  It would up-date that law in a number of very important respects.  It would put an end to future ground rents on dwellinghouses.  It would effectively give the right to the perpetual renewal of long leases, with the alternative right of outright purchase of the fee simple, to ground tenants of every known kind.  It would extend to landlord and tenant matters generally the simple and inexpensive system of arbitration by county registrars that at present operates only under the 1967 Ground Rents Act.  It would enable tenancies in obsolete buildings to be terminated so that development can proceed.</P>
    <P>Before I conclude I should like to pay tribute to the Landlord and Tenant Commission whose work laid the foundations for the proposals for change contained in the Bill.  I think it is only fitting that an acknowledgement of their work should go on the record of this House and that, in particular, recognition should be extended to the work of Mr. Justice Conroy, the <Col N="159" /> chairman of the commission. Judge Conroy has during the past quarter-of-a-century acted most ably as chairman of a series of commissions dealing with various landlord and tenant matters. No one could be better fitted to guide to a successful conclusion the work of the present commission.  The commission are currently concerned with a review of the only remaining law of landlord and tenant which falls outside the scope of this Bill.  That consists of the non-statutory and statutory provisions dating from before the inception of the State.  Should legislation be needed to implement the commission's recommendations in this area, it will complete the task of which this Bill is the major element.  We would then have a full, modern and thoroughly researched code of landlord and tenant law.</P>
    <P>I trust that the Bill meets with the approval of the House and ask that it be given a Second Reading.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is an extremely important piece of legislation from a social and legal viewpoint because unlike a lot of legislation it affects a great number of people from all parts of society.  It is important that both sides of this House have an opportunity to discuss the contents of this Bill in full Committee of the House so that when it is finally passed it will truly reflect a modern social approach to the law of the landlord and tenant from the point of view of both the landlord and the tenant.  This legislation can be truly described as one of the most important and difficult pieces of legislation ever to come before this House.  It is desirable legislation because with the changes in modern times legislation dealing with the very vexatious relationship which in the past always existed between landlord and tenant should be reviewed in the light of modern circumstances and updated where possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many problems in the earlier part of this century between landlord and tenant gave rise to the welcome introduction of the 1931 Landlord and Tenant Act.  This Act clearly set out <Col N="160" /> the rights of the tenants as far as buildings were concerned.  In fairness to it and to those who were responsible for the Act at the time, it worked well.  It regulated two situations.  In many cases at that time the position was unsure in relation to buildings and lands which were leased, and people were not protected when the lease expired.  The 1931 Act secured the position for the tenant, and the landlord had to give a new lease if the premises were occupied for business purposes.  If residences were involved only certain categories were protected because most of the residential tenants at that time had the protection of the Rent Restriction Acts.  In that Act provision was made for the man who owned buildings but only leased the land on which they were erected.  It gave him rights to a new lease on expiry of the tenancy.  In both cases which I have mentioned under the 1931 Act whether the lease of a building or land, in the absence of an agreement, the court was authorised to fix the terms.  The situation dealt with under the 1931 Act existed until the 1958 Act was introduced.  This was an extension of part of the original 1931 Act as far as leases and ground rents were concerned.</P>
    <P>The 1958 Act was a step forward keeping up with the times.  It broadened the scope of the term &ldquo;building&rdquo; and &ldquo;lease&rdquo; and thereby extended protection to a greater number of people.  It also reduced the proportion of the market rent to be reserved in the lease.  The 1931 and the 1958 Acts in their day were desirable but with the passing of time changes became necessary.  A movement grew in the early sixties for the abolition of ground rents and Fianna Fáil as a political party seeking to represent as many people as possible, set up the Ground Rents Commission. As a result of a report by this commission the Government introduced the 1967 Landlord and Tenant Bill. Many people held the view, and I share it, that this Bill was a great step forward.  Its principal provision gave the tenant in most cases the right to buy out his ground rent at a fair price, which in the absence of agreement <Col N="161" /> could be determined by the county registrar.  The 1967 Bill could be described as a major breakthrough, but again with the passage of time certain shortcomings became apparent, which could not have been catered for when the Bill was introduced.  At that time and even now we are convinced that this type of legislation must be constantly reviewed because of the changes in economic circumstances and so on.  Naturally, certain new problems would arise as a result of the administration of existing legislation. Conscious of the problems that came to light as a result of the passage of time, as a result of flaws and loopholes in the Bill the Fianna Fáil Government at the time under the then Minister for Justice, Senator Brian Lenihan, set up the Landlord and Tenant Commission under, as the Minister has just said, the chairmanship of Judge Charles Conroy.</P>
    <P>Like the Minister, I want to pay a those who served with him on the public tribute to Judge Conroy and Landlord and Tenant Commission for their tremendous work in this very delicate and sometimes emotional area. Their contribution is appreciated by everybody.  The terms of reference of that commission at the time were to inquire into the working of the law relating to landlord and tenant other than the Rent Restrictions Act, 1960, and to recommend such amendments in the law as the commission thought proper, and they were to furnish an interim report on the provisions relating to the grant of new tenancies under Part III of the Landlord and Tenant Act 1931, and on any other aspects of the law which in the opinion of the commission should be given priority.</P>
    <P>A third heading was subsequently added to the terms of reference, namely they were to investigate and report on the following questions: (a) whether any leaseholders other than those given the right of reversion of the lease by the Landlord and Tenant (Reversionary Leases) Act, 1958, should be given such rights; (b) whether any leaseholders other than those given the right to purchase the fee simple <Col N="162" /> by the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) Act, 1957, should be given such rights.</P>
    <P>The commission, after much work and great effort on a voluntary basis, reported to the Minister for Justice, Deputy O'Malley at that time, and certain amendments such as the creation of a new type of lease were introduced. That gave rise to the Landlord and Tenant (Amendment) Act, 1971, which extended relief to certain categories not covered at the time in the legislation which existed and had particular relevance to the people involved in the Sandycove Proby Estate. The commission reported in full and subsequently Deputy Desmond O'Malley, as Minister for Justice, had legislation drafted which was in itself extremely complex.  He did not get the opportunity of introducing it into the House.  Since the present Minister for Justice has had his portfolio and in particular since I became spokesman for my party in this area, the Minister will be aware that on any occasion that I would have the opportunity I would call for the introduction of the legislation which we have before us. I am glad it is here now for what is in it, and there is a lot in it.  I hope by the time we are finished with it and in particular on Committee Stage that this Bill will be much improved as a result of the many amendments, which I believe are reasonable and reasoned. I know how reasonable the Minister can be sometimes.  I am sure he will see the validity of the case which I am going to make for the amendments which I have no doubt he will accept.</P>
    <P>One of the principal provisions of the Bill as it stands at present is an extension of the role of the county registrar in the operation of the Act. We see in it the elimination of certain impediments in former legislation and a widening of the scope of the categories who would benefit.  It aims, as the Minister says, at reducing legal costs.  I hope that it will achieve that aim.  The Bill codifies and consolidates existing legislation and repeals the 1931 and the 1968 Acts, the 1971 Landlord and Tenant Act plus section 4 of the Rent Restrictions Act, 1960, and section 13 of the Rent Restrictions (Amendment) Act, 1967.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="163" /> The Bill also makes provision for a periodic review of rent during the term of the lease.  This is a big step forward.  We have a seven-year term now instead of 21 years.  The suggestion has been made to me and possibly to the Minister that even seven years might be too long.  This could be looked at again and perhaps a five-year term considered.  We will put this to the Minister during the course of the debate.  Presently when the courts are fixing rents for 21 years they are surcharging by as much as 50 per cent in recognition of inflation.  Perhaps that percentage increase surcharge will be increased as things are going because if you are trying to strike a rent for 21 years allowances must be made for that.  With the periodical review the courts will fix more moderate rents in the knowledge that the rents will be coming up for review after a short period.</P>
    <P>With regard to the section of our community who have a special interest in ground rents the position is now, as a result of this legislation, that more people can buy out their ground rents than heretofore and the county registrar is given wider powers to facilitate easier and cheaper purchase.  This is what the Bill sets out to do and I hope it can do it.  I want the Minister to understand that I am not knocking the Bill in any way, but I have doubts and reservations as to whether what the Minister hopes or aims to achieve in the Bill will be realised.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides that no new ground rents can be created.  That is a big step forward and one with which this party are in full agreement.  We have been committed to it for a considerable time.  There is disappointment that the acceptance of the principle of the abolition of existing ground rents is not in the Bill.  It is fair to say that those involved in this area had great hopes that this would be catered for in the Bill, particularly having due regard to the statements made in recent times by certain members of the Government.  Deputy Richie Ryan, T.D., now Minister for Finance, in his time described the payment of ground rents as a medieval <Col N="164" /> anachronism and a private tax by the wealthy on the poor.  The present Minister for Local Government, Deputy Tully, has described the system of payment of existing ground rents as an abomination.  Having heard such definite statements from two prominent members of the Government when they were not in Government, those who are very closely interested in this legislation believed that when given the opportunity these two important men in their own political parties, Labour and Fine Gael, would come up with some scheme or system to help get rid of ground rents as they are, together with the prevention of the creation of further ground rents.</P>
    <P>The whole question of the success or failure of the ground rents part of the Bill depends entirely on whether or not the county registrar's office, which is going to have a greater job of work than heretofore, can handle the additional work.  Legislation enacted into law can work only if it is able to work. I am not setting out to point-score but in recent times we have had legislalation from the Minister for Justice on behalf of this Government which was enacted but has not been put into operation.  I am thinking of the Criminal Law Jurisdiction Act, one Bill which was nine months here.  I am making a comparison&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>There is not any comparison.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>There is.  I will make my point now and the Minister might agree with me.  I am talking about the implementation of legislation once it is enacted.  There is no point in having legislation here like the Landlord and Tenant Act enacted if the implementation of it hinges on the county registrar's office and cannot be implemented or put into operation if the county registrar's office is not geared to do the work.  That is the point I am trying to make.  I am sorry if I made it in a confusing way.  I did not mean to do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At this stage the Minister and the Government should spell out clearly what is to be done for each county registrar in this regard.  This Bill protects the State.  I wholeheartedly support <Col N="165" /> anything the Minister or the Government can do to protect the State.  In the past, the State failed to get a new lease within the terms of the Landlord and Tenant Act, 1931.  The Minister is protecting the State as a tenant. Whereas on the one hand the State is being protected as a tenant, on the other hand the State is not giving the same protection to its own tenants.  It protects itself as a tenant, but its tenants are not protected.  If I am wrong perhaps the Minister will correct me, but if I am right perhaps he will say why the State's tenants should be excluded from the protection of the Bill.  From my reading of the Bill there is no compensation from the State to its tenants if the lease is not being renewed.</P>
    <P>On Second Stage it is possible to deal with this Bill in a very general way only.  In his speech this morning and three or four weeks ago when he started to introduce the Bill, the Minister dealt with it very generally.  He was wise to do that because, from the very nature of the Bill, unless one dealt with it very generally it would be very easy to become bogged down in specifics.  We do not want to do that at this stage.  This is an extremely complex Bill.  Part I deals with preliminary matters, as all Bills do, such as interpretations, and provisions for making regulations, and so on.</P>
    <P>Part II deals with the jurisdiction of the county registrars.  This is a most important part of the Bill.  When one reads it in conjunction with the rest of the Bill one realises that the county registrars are given wide-ranging powers they did not have heretofore. At the moment they have to arbitrate on matters such as whether people have the right to purchase their ground rents and what price they should pay for it.  These powers are now very much widened and they now have the power, which is dealt with in another part of the Bill, to issue vesting certificates when they are satisfied a person has the right to the freehold.  They have the power to decide the sum of money he will pay for it and the costs and other peripheral matters.</P>
    <P>Under another part of the Bill they also have the power to decide whether a person has the right to a new lease <Col N="166" /> and what rent he should pay for it. This is a new departure because, heretofore, it was a power held only by the courts.  One can see therefore that the county registrars will have a much greater workload imposed on them. Under section 73 the registrar has power to issue the vesting certificate vesting the fee simple in the lessee free from encumbrances.  That sounds simple enough but it is not that simple because the county registrar will have to be satisfied that the notices served by the lessee on his immediate lessor and the notices served upon the superior lessor are being served on the proper people.  He will have to identify the owner of the freehold and subsequently pay that money to him, or portion of it, to the intermediate lessors.</P>
    <P>This entails an investigation of title and the county registrars are not very well equipped for this increased volume of work.  That is why I say the Minister has an obligation, during the course of the debate on this Bill, to tell the House what proposals he has for restructuring the county registrars' offices so that the Bill will work as smoothly as we would all wish.  There is no point in introducing a Bill with such far-reaching effects on landlords and tenants unless the machinery for carrying its provisions into effect has been properly set up.  It should be set up in advance and not afterwards.  I hope I am not labouring this point but it is the key to the success or failure of the Bill.  This is something which strikes one on reading the Bill and it must be dealt with at an early stage.</P>
    <P>The Bill does something else very important.  It repeals the 1931 Act, the 1958 Act, the 1967 Act, the Landlord and Tenant (Amendment) Act, 1971, and the Rent Restrictions (Amendment) Act which I mentioned.  As one goes through the Bill, one sees how the repealed Acts are incorporated in this Bill.  In all fairness to the Bill as a whole, one's reaction to it is that it is a good thing that it consolidates all the landlord and tenant laws and makes provisions in relation to ground rents.</P>
    <P>Part III of the Bill deals with the right to a new tenancy and incorporates a lot of the old law with various <Col N="167" /> changes.  We can have more discussion on these changes on Committee Stage. Part IV deals with reversionary leases and incorporates the old law under the Landlord and Tenant (Reversionary Leases) Act, 1958, with various extensions. Part V deals with sporting leases and incorporates the provisions of the Landlord and Tenant (Amendment) Act, 1971, again with various changes.</P>
    <P>Part VI is a very important part of the Bill.  It deals with the right of a person to purchase the fee simple of his or her property.  It incorporates the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) Act, 1967, and extends it considerably and deals with the county registrars' right to issue a vesting certificate vesting the fee simple in the tenant and the cost of acquiring the fee simple. The Minister said the cost of acquiring the fee simple will now be cut down. I hope that is true.  I should like the Minister to say how the cost will be cut down under the present procedures. Is he saying the State will bear the cost of the research which the county registrar may have to do, or appoint somebody to do it for him?  Is he saying that in the case of arbitration it will not now be necessary for persons seeking arbitration to engage legal advisers? I should like to know how the Minister hopes to keep costs down.  I put forward these questions for comment by him.</P>
    <P>Part VII deals with apportionment of rent in the case of intermediate lessors and superior lessors and incorporates, again with extensions, part of the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) Act, 1967.  Part VIII deals with covenants.  This, too, is a very important part of the Bill because, under its provisions, all covenants, with the exception of certain covenants dealing with amenities and such things as rights of way, and so on, will cease. Part IX deals with compensation. This, too, is an important section. There is compensation for &ldquo;improvement&rdquo; and it incorporates part of the repealed legislation with extensions and modifications.</P>
    <P>It is fair to say that the most important part of this area of the Bill is section 108, which prevents the <Col N="168" /> creation of future ground rents in the case of ordinary dwellinghouses.  This is a big step forward and something we have been pressing for.  It meets a growing demand from lessees over the years.  When this Bill was circulated it was popularly, but incorrectly, described in the press as the &ldquo;Ground Rents Bill&rdquo;.  It is not a &ldquo;Ground Rents Bill&rdquo; because the part of the Bill dealing with ground rents is a small section of the entire Bill.  It is wrong to describe it as such.  Certainly, the main volume of interest as far as the public are concerned deals with the ground rents section and for their benefit it is no harm that it is spelled out clearly what is in it for them.  We should also spell out what is not in it for them, particularly with regard to ground rents.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated that the Bill, as far as ground rents are concerned, brings about the prohibition of the creation of new ground rents, and that is fair enough.  He also told us that it brings about the consolidation of statutes in relation to landlord and tenant, the increased arbitration powers for county registrars, the extension of the right to purchase ground rents and the hope for a reduction in the legal costs.  They are all welcome features of the Bill, but as welcome as they are they can only be effective if they are going to work.  What will happen to a lessee who is entitled to and wishes to buy out his ground rent?  Must he pay the costs of the arbitration, as suggested in section 15 (1)?  Will he be liable for the landlord's costs in arbitration proceedings under the same section?  Is he also liable for the costs and other expenses of the landlord? Over and above all these costs is he not also liable for his own costs? Under the Bill will the person who wants to buy out the lease be caught for four sets of costs and expenses?  If the Bill is meant to reduce costs and make it possible for people to buy out their ground rents there is a doubt, and the Minister can readily see that, if the person involved must pay four sets of costs.</P>
    <P>It is nice to say in the introduction of a Bill that it is hoped to make it cheaper for people to buy out their <Col N="169" /> ground rents but in practice this might not necessarily be true.  Another part of the Bill which causes concern is the exclusion of State and local authorities from it.  That was an undesirable exclusion and this aspect was completely ignored by the Minister in his opening address.  That is an important matter because thousands of people are involved. The Minister should consider dealing with householders who have the State or local authorities as landlords under the Bill.  Why are they excluded?  If the ordinary householder is to enjoy the benefits which the Minister says will be conferred on him on the passing of the Bill, then the question must be asked why those benefits are not being conferred on all householders.  Is it the intention of the Minister to allow the State and local authorities to retain freehold title on houses erected in the past and on houses to be erected in the future?  Is it the Minister's intention to assist local authorities by avoiding future complications in relation to land title?  If that is so this is discriminatory against one section of the community.  The Minister is aware that local authorities have great powers in their own right and are well equipped to look after their own interests.  That was a serious omission from the Bill and I should like the Minister to refer to it when replying.  He can be assured that I will introduce an amendment for Committee Stage to rectify this matter.</P>
    <P>The Bill also proposes that a reversionary lease will be denied to a lessee where the local authority intends to develop the land in question, according to section 45.  That is a serious omission.  The Minister should consider allowing such a reversionary lease which would allow the prospective lessee to realise the full commercial value of his property.  If the lease is not given the property would only have a minimal market value.  This is a denial of such a person's rights and safeguards under the Constitution.  I should like the Minister to refer to this when replying.  The Minister for Posts and Telegraphs&mdash;since the Minister for Justice mentioned the question of the abolition of ground rents and compensation&mdash;according to a <Col N="170" /> speech reported in a daily newspaper said that there was a call for the termination of the landlords' interest in ground rents without compensation. That is not correct.  I met representatives of ACRA on a number of occasions and discussed the question of ground rents in full with them, but at no time was it ever represented to me that they wanted the abolition of existing ground rents without compensation. There is a general and widespread desire on the part of householders to own the land on which their houses stand and this can be done by the abolition or the purchase of the ground rent.  It is important that the Minister should deal with this matter.</P>
    <P>The Minister has told us that the right to purchase a ground rent by a householder has not been availed of to any great extent and that there is difficulty in evaluating the demand that will be created.  I disagree with the Minister because I believe there will be a big demand.  It is because I believe the demand will be great that I say the county registrars' offices might not be able to handle the demands made on them.</P>
    <P>The Minister is in a very strong position to find out from the clerks of the various courts the number of householders who have been prepared to face court proceedings in order to register their protest in opposition to the ground rent system. I am told by some of these people that they underwent great strain and anxiety during the course of these proceedings in an effort to highlight their dissatisfaction with the legislation as it stands.  Naturally they used the opportunity to awaken the interests of the Minister and the Government to the problem and hoped by doing this that they would speed up the introduction of this long awaited legislation.  I believe there are thousands of these people and if they went to the county registrar's office there would be an immediate bottleneck.</P>
    <P>In the past there were a number of reasons why under existing legislation those who wanted to buy their ground rents did not do so.  One of them <Col N="171" /> was the excessive legal costs.  We all hope these costs will be minimised as a result of this legislation, but we have yet to be convinced.  A number of people who wanted to buy their ground rents did not avail of existing legislation because as a result of their agitation and organisation they were able to secure better terms for themselves by direct negotiations.  Another very important reason the Minister might have been wrongly advised in this area is that a large number of householders in Dublin, Limerick, Cork, Galway, and recently in Castlebar, were supporting the campaign for the abolition of the ground rent system.  They were holding back in the hope that by working together they would achieve more for their members. Now that the floodgates will be opened it is of vital importance that the county registrar's office will be able to deal with them.</P>
    <P>I find one part of this Bill extremely objectionable and unnecessary, particularly in the year 1977.  One of the features of the present leasehold system is a covenant in the average lease permitting the lessor to take eviction proceedings for arrears of ground rent.  With the present value of houses and the importance of the house to the householder, physically, socially and emotionally, I am strongly of the view that it is a most draconian law that permits a lessor to evict a lessee for the sake of a few pounds due in ground rent.  In case there is any misunderstanding on this point I want to make it clear that I have no objection to the lessor taking ordinary civil proceedings for the recovery of the debt but, in my view, it is wrong that, in the Republic of Ireland in 1977, this should happen.  The Minister should have another look at this.  The right to evict should not be given to the lessor.  I would like him to comment on this defect in his reply.  We hope to table an amendment on Committee Stage prohibiting such an eviction.</P>
    <P>Section 75 is very important.  It outlines the factors to be taken into account by the arbitrator in determining the purchase price of the fee <Col N="172" /> simple.  There are some significant omissions in this section which should be looked at very carefully in the hope that by the time this Bill is enacted into law we will have a good and desirable Bill which will be welcomed by all.</P>
    <P>Firstly, there is no reference to the price being paid by the lessor in purchasing the land and the amount of the site fine paid by the lessee as well as the number of years for which rent had already been paid by the lessee. Secondly, there is no reference to the cost and expenses which may have been incurred by the lessee due to the failure of the lessor to maintain any local amenities, such as gardens, footpaths, playing spaces, which he had covenanted to do under the terms of the lease.  Thirdly, there is no reference to the failure of the lessor to make any demand for payment of rent over a period of years.</P>
    <P>This last factor is most significant. To my knowledge in a considerable number of places no demands have been made for ground rents for a number of years.  I have been told that in one provincial city demands for payment of ground rents are issued in less than 50 per cent of the cases.  The omission of any provision in the Bill to cover this type of case renders the Bill defective.</P>
    <P>I have already referred to other obvious defects such as the burden of the cost falling on the lessee who wished to acquire the fee simple and the exclusion of State and local authorities from the Bill.  Another defect is revealed in section 75 (g).  The purpose of this section is that over and above other factors to be taken into account in determining the purchase price of the fee simple the arbitrator shall also take into account the costs and expenses which will be incurred by the lessor in investing the proceeds of the arbitration.  Who suggested that this should be included?  I fail to see the argument for it.  It is wide open to abuse.  Off the top of my head I could list a number of cases which would make it look very silly. If, for instance, the Minister was my landlord and we had come to a settlement for £500, and if he wanted to invest that money in South America, <Col N="173" /> under this Bill I would appear to be responsible for his expenses to South America to invest that money.  If that is so it could be a sure way of getting a nice holiday.  As I said, I do not know why it is in the Bill because it is very wrong and I hope the Minister will deal with it in his reply.  We will put down an amendment on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>There is no fundamental difference between the Fianna Fáil Party and the Government about the need for amending legislation on this very vexed question of ground rents, but there is a difference between us in relation to means.  I believe this could be and will be a good Bill if the Minister accepts the many reasoned amendments we will put down on Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>I would like to deal with the question of flatdwellers.  This is something with which I understand the Minister is familiar because he met representatives of the Dublin Flatdwellers' Association.  Recently our spokesman on Justice also met them, as did a number of other Deputies. The Minister is aware of what they are looking for.  They expressed a certain disappointment that parts of this Bill did not contain matters which would be relevant to them.  In all honesty I must say that I have not had a chance to study this Bill in detail.  It is a very technical Bill and not being a lawyer I find it difficult to define what some of the sections mean.  I should like to list for the Minister some of the problems of the flatdwellers. The Minister is no doubt aware of these problems but I feel that they should be listed for the record. First there is the question of security of tenure for law-abiding tenants. There is at the moment a feeling of great insecurity among many tenants of flats.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>That may well be, but it is after all a landlord and tenant Bill which we are discussing and surely this must affect the rights of flatdwellers. Let me list the points anyway and possibly they will be in-included in legislation on rent restriction.</P>
      <P>They ask that a tribunal be set up to adjudicate on such matters as rents, repairs, and grievances generally of tenants and also of landlords.  There is no doubt that there is a problem about unruly tenants and we are not making the case that the tenants are the only people who have rights.  Flatdwellers are in the main people who are unable to buy their own houses and they have really no rights at all to protect them.  We recognise that if the control over flats is too rigorous this may tend to cause a shortage of flats because people may not be inclined to put too many restrictions on their own properties.  This could be the case where a landlord is resident. He could decide against offering accommodation which he might have offered in the ordinary way.  The housing shortage could be aggravated to a great extent.  However I feel that there are certain minimum standards which are required and which flatdwellers themselves would look for.</P>
      <P>There should be a compulsory register of landlords.  We have in the Dublin City Council a register of landlords and we have encouraged people to register their accommodation so that it can be inspected by Dublin Corporation to ensure that it is fit for human habitation.  A large number of landlords have registered but there are others who have not bothered, including some of the biggest landlords in Dublin who own vast amounts of property.  I think there should definitely be a compulsory register of landlords.  There should also be compulsory provision of rent books.  The feeling is that many people who are renting property are doing so unknown to the tax authorities.  Very often flatdwellers can be disenfranchised. When the electoral register is being compiled a landlord may get his hands on the application forms.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the introduction of this Bill.  There has been a lot of talk and there has been emotive agitation in recent years for this Bill, especially from private residents. Now that the Bill has been introduced I do not think it has the emotive appeal it had in the past.  In some areas leaseholders were practically giving away ground rents but they would not be accepted.</P>
      <P>The creation of new ground rents is very important.  Both sides of the House should try and get this Bill through as quickly as possible.  This will save quite a lot of money in relation to the creation of new ground rents.</P>
      <P>The legal cost in relation to the purchase of existing ground rents has been a very big inhibiting factor for people not going ahead to purchase. Will the county registrars be able to deal with this matter now?  Will there be new offices to deal with it or will it operate in the existing offices?  Will there be delays in the purchase of ground rents?  If more staff are required it is important that the county registrars have them because when this Bill is enacted there will be a big demand to purchase ground rents.  I believe that additional staff will be required to deal with this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purchase of existing ground rents and the abolition of new ground rents is a very big step.  Other sections of the Bill deal with sporting leases and reversionary leases.  There have been some anomalies in this field. When the leases of business premises run out the owners are required to pay very large rents and this very often forces them out of business.  This Bill will go a long way towards getting rid of the fears of people whose leases are about to run out.  Those <Col N="178" /> sections of the Bill to which I have referred are as important as the sections dealing with the elimination of ground rents.  We are now getting to the stage where this Bill is meeting most of the fears people had in relation to the expiry of leases.</P>
    <P>I am sympathetic to Deputy Briscoe's concern for the people in rented accommodation.  We are all aware of the plight of some of those people in Dublin.  I am glad the Minister indicated that a review is taking place.  We will have to update legislation in relation to those people to ensure that justice is not alone done but is seen to be done for everybody.</P>
    <P>This is a very technical Bill.  One would need to be the proverbial Philadelphia lawyer to understand the provisions in it.  The Minister's statement however sets out the Bill's purpose quite clearly.  We have legislation going through the House which is bogging us down at the moment while this Bill has been sitting here waiting.  During that time quite a number of ground rents are being created which impose a great penalty on people.  There is consensus on this Bill.  I ask Deputies on all sides to ensure that this Bill moves through all Stages as quickly as possible and that it becomes law in weeks rather than months.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The previous speaker asked in his concluding remarks for the speedy passage of this Bill.  We all accept that legislation should be dealt with as speedily as possible in this House and the Seanad. This Bill is a very important element of social legislation because it affects every householder, builder and tenant. There are few sections of the community it will not affect.  We have been entrusted by the electorate to look after their affairs so we should ensure that such a comprehensive Bill as this gets a very thorough examination, that every section is gone through line by line, word by word and that those of us in Opposition try to improve the Bill as it is introduced. Our spokesman on Justice, Deputy Collins, indicated that this party will introduce various amendments designed to improve this detailed Bill. <Col N="179" /> We hope the Minister will accept these amendments.</P>
      <P>The whole question of landlord and tenant relationship is a very difficult one and consequently it is necessary to have it constantly under review. This has been done since 1931 right up to the introduction of this Bill which is really a consolidating and codifying measure.  There are many sections in the Bill dealing with every aspect of the relationship between landlord and tenant but it has been tagged in the newspapers and by commentators as being a Ground Rents Bill and it is on that specific matter of ground rents that I wish to speak.  I think it is wrongly so tagged because there are many other very important sections in the Bill which will affect everybody in the community at some time in their lives.</P>
      <P>There are two elements of the ground rent situation in the Bill.  One deals with new ground rents.  When the Government were seeking election four years ago one of their main promises to the electorate was that they would introduce legislation to ban the creation of future ground rents.  On many occasions in the past four years we on this side of the House asked for the introduction of a simple Bill banning the creation of future ground rents.  We introduced a Private Members' motion asking, among other things, for the introduction of such a Bill.  The Minister consistently in the past four years said he would not introduce a separate Bill pending the introduction of the legislation now before us, the Landlord and Tenant Bill, 1977.</P>
      <P>The effect of the delay in introducing a short, simple Bill banning the creation of new ground rents has been this.  Taking the figures of the Minister for Local Government and his claim to have constructed over 25,000 houses per annum over the last four years, if we accept the Minister's figures&mdash;and I must say that I have distinct reservations about them&mdash;we end up with approximately 100,000 houses built.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I said I did not accept the figures.  I am just using them for the purpose of the argument. Assuming that about 25,000 of those were local authority houses not involving ground rents, it means that in the past four years while the Government delayed introducing a simple Bill banning the introduction of new ground rents, a Bill they were committed to introduce, approximately 75,000 new ground rents were created in their term of office.  Surely that is not something to be proud of.  The Minister should have accepted the advice of Fianna Fáil and introduced a short Bill on the lines we suggested. We would not then have the appalling situation of that number of new ground rents having been created.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The second element in the ground rents question is the whole vexed question of existing ground rents and how to handle them. Proposals have been introduced in this Bill giving powers to the county registrars but I suggest that the Bill does not meet the legitimate demands made for the abolition of existing ground rents.  The Bill has many weaknesses including the appalling weakness that there is still the right to take eviction proceedings by a lessor against a lessee.  In a recent article I saw this described as a mediaeval barbarity and the language is not too strong to describe this right. Surely it is appalling for a man to buy a house with a lease at a ground rent of, perhaps, 5p a year, and if he refuses as a point of principle to pay the 5p per year under existing legislation, and under the legislation now introduced, the owner of the ground rent can take him to court and legally get an eviction order because the householder refuses to pay the ground rent.  Surely this mediaeval barbarity requires to be dealt with.  I hope when we introduce an amendment to remove this right from the lessor the Minister will accept it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A more just and fairer system would be to give the right to the lessor to take civil proceedings for <Col N="181" /> the recovery of debt.  One could have the ludicrous situation even at the moment&mdash;because ground rents are still being created&mdash;of a man buying a house for £20,000 at £1 per year ground rent: he refuses to pay the ground rent and if the lessor takes him to court he could be evicted from his house because he refuses to pay £1 a year after purchasing a £20,000 house.  Surely this is completely unfair, and I trust the Minister will accept our amendment on it on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>A campaign for the abolition of ground rents has been waged for many years, particularly by ACRA, on the principle that when a man buys a house he should also own the bit of land on which it is built. Ireland has had a long history of campaigning against penal land legislation introduced by a foreign power which unfortunately still remains in part of our country.  Irishmen have always valued not only the bricks and mortar but the land on which the house stands.</P>
    <P>This legislation does not go far enough to assist house owners to remove this mediaeval yoke of ground rents from around our people's necks. It was announced that the Bill would reduce considerably legal and other costs involved in buying out ground rents but section 15 imposes on house-owners the cost of the arbitrator, the landlord's costs, the landlord's expenses and their own expenses&mdash;four sets of expenses.  The Minister blandly told us the purpose of the Bill is to minimise the costs of lessees.  This cries out for clarification, which the Minister has dramatically failed to provide to date.</P>
    <P>Another area in respect of which the Bill fails is in the matter of local authority housing.  In my constituency of North Dublin two major estates have been developed by the Corporation. One is Donaghmede, an estate of 800 houses erected by one builder and sold to people nominated by the local authority.  The Priorswood estate was developed by the corporation in the county area and the sites were sold off to builders who in turn sold the houses to people anxious to buy homes.  On <Col N="182" /> both estates there are ground rents. Under the 1967 Act it was not possible to buy out those ground rents because the ground landlord was Dublin Corporation. This legislation suffers from the same disability.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Deputy think it would be a good thing to allow local authority houses to be purchased by speculators, millionaires?  The reason for the retention of ground rents in those cases is to prevent local authority houses falling into the hands of speculators.</P>

      <P>A sum of £1,790,000 is provided by way of grant-in-aid in the Fisheries Vote for 1977 for expenditure by An Bord Iascaigh Mhara on administration and current development. The apportionment of this sum between the two headings is primarily a matter for the board.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to a question of mine last week the Taoiseach stated no extra duties were envisaged for the new Minister.  We know now no extra moneys will be provided for 1977.  In view of that fact would the Minister tell us why it is necessary to set up a Ministry or is it just a vote of no confidence in his colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, or in the Parliamentary Secretary who previously carried <Col N="187" /> out the work?  No extra duties are being assigned to the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not a vote of no confidence in anybody, least of all the Minister for Foreign Affairs or the Parliamentary Secretary.  The importance of the industry is growing day by day and there has arrived a point in time at which, because of the denudation of fish stocks and the Common Market situation, whereby very heavy extra duties will fall upon the person discharging the office of the Minister for Fisheries, or whoever carried out those duties before there was a Minister for Fisheries, there is a necessity for the extension and the advancement of the industry which in turn necessitates the appointment of a Minister for Fisheries who will do his best and work very hard in Brussels and at home.  A point in time has been reached when the Government rightly took the decision to appoint a Minister for Fisheries and I was lucky enough to get that appointment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Fisheries the proposals his Department have for the planting of additional lands in County Galway; the total acreage of land held by his Department and not yet planned; the average price per acre paid by his Department for land; and the total income from sales of timber in County Galway for each of the years 1973, 1974, 1975 and 1976.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to plant 1,100 hectares in County Galway in the current planting season.  Future planting programmes will be determined, in the context of a national planting programme of 10,000 hectares, by the area available for planting in the county.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The overall nominal plantable reserve of land held by my Department on the 31st December, 1975, was 37,992 hectares.  While the final figure <Col N="190" /> at the end of 1976 is not yet available it would be of the same order.  However, a substantial part of this nominal reserve is not immediately available for planting for a variety of reasons. The average price at which agreement to sell was reached in the last quarter of 1976 was £71 per hectare or £29 per acre.</P>
    <P>Details of income from timber sales in County Galway are not available as sales statistics are not kept on a county basis.  The total income from timber sales rose from £1.7 million in the year 1973-74 to £2.9 million in 1976.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister mentioned a price of £29 per acre.  That is very small when one considers the high price of land at present.  Does the Minister not consider that if his Department increased the price more land would become available for forestry?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>The price mentioned was an average price.  The amount paid for land can vary from £130 per acre downwards.  The position is that this land is not arable agricultural land.  It is planting land for trees and, as such, it has a low agricultural value. Land like this is often on the top of a mountain.  Therefore, it can be said it would not be too bad a bargain.</P>

    <P>I have already indicated in numerous statements and replies to parliamentary questions, that the Government's decisions on revised criteria for new house and reconstruction grant eligibility were influenced by the need to curtail the growth in public expenditure by confining available resources to sectors where there is clear justification for such expenditure on grounds of genuine need and where it will be of most benefit nationally.</P>

      <P>Questions relating to the housing needs of individual families in Dún Laoghaire Borough are a matter for decision by the corporation with whom the Deputy might take up the position of families living in Monkstown House.</P>
      <P>With regard to the general rehousing prospects of families in need of and awaiting rehousing by the corporation, I would draw the Deputy's attention to my replies to his Question No. 24 and supplementary questions on 16th December last.  At 31st January, 1977, the corporation had 531 dwellings under construction, 85 at tender, 317 in planning and a reserve of 660 sites available for future construction.  This compared with the position at the change of Government in March, 1973 when the corporation had no dwellings under construction or at tender, 154 schemes being planned and a reserve of 300 sites.</P>

      <P>With regard to the families living in Monkstown House, will the Minister tell the House if he made any inquiries from the local authority regarding the reason for the delay in rehousing them?  I should like to tell the Minister that on a number of occasions I and other Deputies of other political parties made inquiries with regard to those families.  My reason for bringing this question to the attention of the Dáil is because of the urgency of the matter and the attempts by Deputies of all the parties to resolve the problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that all Deputies in the area are anxious that the people be rehoused.  I am sure Deputy Andrews will appreciate that it would be a mistake for somebody at national level to attempt to fix the housing problems of individual families.  I am sure the Deputy is aware that there are only three families in flats in Monkstown House. The first family consists of a father, mother and a child aged nine years. They are living in a former conservatory which has very large windows. They have two bedrooms, a living room, kitchenette and a bathroom. They are on the corporation's list but are not deemed by them to be in overcrowded conditions.  Therefore, prospects of rehousing are not bright. The second family were offered accommodation five years ago in Mountwood House, a block of corporation flats, but they refused the offer. In accordance with the usual procedure of the Dún Laoghaire Corporation in such cases, the family were taken off the waiting list.  Accordingly, the housing authority have no up-to-date information on the present family circumstances.  They will have to reapply if they want to be considered. The third family have not applied for rehousing.  The housing authority have no official knowledge of the size of the family but it is believed to be a husband and wife.</P>

      <P>A separate analysis of motor cycle accidents is not available in my Department in respect of the period prior to 1968.  Statistics for the period 1968 to 1975 indicate that, while the percentage of motor cycle accidents as a percentage of motor cycles licensed fell from 3 per cent to 2.5 per cent, the corresponding figures for fatalities rose from 0.1 per cent to 0.16 per cent.  The majority of these fatalities occurred outside built-up areas.  A study undertaken by An Foras Forbartha in 1975 in relation to pedal cycles indicated that there are considerable problems involved in the use of special cycle lanes.  In all the circumstances, I do not think it appropriate to seek a further report as suggested by the Deputy.  I will send him a copy of the 1975 report for his information.</P>

      <P>An Foras Forbartha carried out a sample survey in 1973 of the condition of the existing housing stock.  The report of the survey shows that it covered only a very small sample of dwellings and it was, therefore, decided to get more detailed data on a wider range of dwellings.  All housing authorities were asked on 1st June last to undertake an assessment of the needs for dwellings in their areas, including an assessment of the needs of households in unfit dwellings. The returns were due to be furnished by all authorities by 1st October last, but some authorities found it was not possible to have their reports completed in time.  They have now been asked to have their reports in my Department by the end of this month.  A decision on the publication of the survey report will be made as soon as possible after that date.  Consideration will then be given also to the action necessary to maintain the stock in the light of the sample survey and the local authority returns.  Pending examination of these returns, it is not possible to give a reliable estimate of the cost of this work.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is confusing two matters.  If we are talking about people who need rehousing with assistance from the local authorities, there is only one way in which we can get that information, that is, if they apply for rehousing to the local authorities.  With regard to the other question, there may be a large number of people who need rehousing but who have not applied for it.  It does not matter whether they are recorded in a survey because they feel happy where they are.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that the only up-to-date guidelines available on the total housing stock are statistics from the Northern Ireland survey based on the assumption that our housing stock and the Northern Ireland housing stock are comparable.

      <P>I said I had asked for the survey to be made, a survey giving the information required and that I hoped to have it at the end of the month.  When we got the survey commissioned by the previous Government the information contained in it was not of any use.  I am sure Deputy Faulkner <Col N="198" /> will accept the fact that the information provided in that survey would not answer the question he is asking today.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Faulkner must not have been listening to the people who visited Dublin from Northern Ireland and who had nothing but admiration for the way in which we are dealing with housing.  The position is that we must have the necessary information. I have asked for that information. I have not got the necessary information because the survey commissioned by my predecessor did not ask for the necessary information.  We spent two years assessing the information produced by the survey and then found it was of little use.  Last year I told Deputy Faulkner that I had commissioned another survey and that I expected to have it by October.  As the information requested was not produced in October, I have asked the local authorities to let me have that information by the end of this month and they have promised to do so. When we get that information I shall be in a position to answer Deputy Faulkner's questions.</P>

      <P>There has been a contributory widows' and orphans' pension scheme in force for local authority officers since July, 1968.  Among the matters being considered by the working party which I set up to examine <Col N="202" /> the local authority superannuation code are claims for the extension of such a scheme to other local authority workers.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. R. Ryan) Richie Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. R. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 22 and 23 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A major purpose of the control and supervision exercised by the Central Bank over licensed banks, including merchant banks, is to safeguard the interests of depositors.  The bank's powers and functions in this regard are contained in the Central Bank Act, 1971, principally sections 9, 10, 11, 17, 18, 21, 22 and 23.  I would refer the Deputies also to a statement of the Central Bank's requirements and standards <Col N="205" /> for the licensing and supervision of banks, published in the bank's annual report for 1975.</P>
    <P>The adequacy and suitability of the supervisory powers are kept under constant review and I understand that the Central Bank are considering certain proposals in this regard.  Any recommendations which may be made to me in due course will be considered as expeditiously as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The various sections of the Act to which the Minister refers me would not be very enlightening to members of the public who had the misfortune to be caught by the malfunctions of some of the banks licensed by the Central Bank.  Would the Minister agree that merchant banks, although carrying licences from the Central Bank, are not to be relied on or, if they are to be relied on and if the Central Bank licence means anything, we require more than merely a reference to several sections of the legislation governing these institutions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 9 of the Central Bank Act, 1971, states clearly that the granting of a licence is not a warranty of solvency and that the bank are not liable in respect of any losses incurred through the insolvency or default of a licence holder.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>If that is so, let it be declared clearly and publicly that the licence means nothing, that it is only a facade which allows certain people to go into operation, to knock the public and to get out, leaving the public with no redress.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be incorrect to describe as a facade the Central Bank Act, 1971, which states clearly the status of banking institutions holding licences from the Central Bank. The Act puts depositors on notice that the mere holding of a licence is not of itself a certificate of solvency.  The Central Bank, by reason of the Act of 1971, requires that certain standards are observed and where there is reason to suspect a deviation from these standards they take action to rectify the <Col N="206" /> situation.  There was a recent case in which they saw fit to act.</P>
      <P>However, it may help the Deputy if I give an indication of what is contained in the sections of the Act that I refer to.</P>
      <P>Section 7 provides that in order to conduct banking business a person be licensed by the Central Bank and must maintain a deposit with the Central Bank.  Section 9 empowers the Central Bank to grant or to refuse to grant a banking licence.  Before a refusal is final, it must have the consent of the Minister for Finance.  Section 10 provides that the bank may attach conditions to a licence either at the time of granting the licence or later.  Under section 11 the Central Bank may, in certain circumstances or with the consent of the Minister, revoke the licence.  Sections 17 and 18 stipulate that licence holders must keep such books and records as the bank specifies and must also furnish the bank with whatever information is deemed necessary.  It is provided also that the bank may inspect books and records.</P>
      <P>Section 21 provides that where the Central Bank is of opinion that the holder of a licence has become, or is likely to become, unable to meet his obligations to his creditors, they may direct the holder in writing to suspend for a period of two months the taking of deposits and the making of payments unauthorised by the Central Bank.  It is provided that such a direction may be set aside, confirmed or extended by the High Court.  Under section 22 the Central Bank may direct a licence holder in relation to the publication and content of advertisements while section 23 provides that the Central Bank may require licence holders to maintain certain ratios as between assets and liabilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am satisfied that these powers are used properly by the Central Bank.  I would point out also, although this may be of little relief to anyone who has been embarrassed in any particular case, that Ireland's record in the banking field is particularly good compared with that of other countries.  In other places there have been a number of bank failures.  Fortunately, we have <Col N="207" /> not had these experiences here.  But in the light of what has happened elsewhere and having regard to EEC requirements, the Central Bank updated the requirements of the 1971 Act.  This updating was spelled out in their annual report of 1975 to which I referred the Deputy.  All the conditions need to be reviewed from time to time and a review in that respect is proceeding at present.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister, in simple terms, assure the public that the granting of a licence means more than merely the green light for somebody to set up a merchant bank and that the conditions attaching to a licence are directed towards the safeguarding of investors' interests?  If they are not so designed, what is the purpose of the licence?  Will the Minister tell us also where redress comes from in the event of default?  The public would expect that it comes from the source which governs these banking activities&mdash;the Central Bank and that, therefore, there would be an absolute guarantee from this State institution in respect of defaults.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The value of a licence is spelled out clearly in the Central Bank Act, 1971.  The disciplines which the Central Bank imposes on the banking system are as good as, if not more stringent than those which apply elsewhere.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is because of this that we have had such a comparatively good record during a period of extreme financial difficulty and at a time when in countries with a much longer banking experience quite a number of institutions have gone to the wall.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>and <b>Mr. Keaveney</b> asked the Minister for Agriculture if he is aware that OAP headage grant applicants are being queried by his Department as to the amounts of their pensions; and if he will state the purpose of this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Clinton)</NameTxt>
      <P>Applicants in receipt of pensions are being queried as to the nature of their pensions but not as to the amount.  The reason for this is that expenditure on grants made to persons enjoying certain types of retirement pensions are not eligible for reimbursement from EEC funds and must be segregated when claims are being prepared for submission to Brussels.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an extraordinary situation.  I question this matter as to the fine distinction that the Minister makes between seeking what sources the pensions come from and not the amounts.  Where are the EEC regulations or regulations within the Minister's Department that require this?  Why has it started this year? What sort of a gimmick is it?  Old people with pensions and some land and a certain amount of stock are being put in a quandary about this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Deputy's concern.  I was as concerned when I heard this question was being asked of old people because I can understand how upset they might get. Article 6 of EEC Directive 268 under which the headage schemes operate, permits the participation of farmers <Col N="212" /> on retirement pensions.  Article 15 of the same directive precludes the reimbursement from Community funds in respect of payments made to such applicants.  The reason for this is that, in general, retired persons are not likely to be actively farming especially those retired from agriculture.  In many cases the undertaking to continue farming for five years might not have much significance.  Apparently in order to make a claim from Brussels justly and properly they have to segregate the type of pension it happens to be. That is the only reason for it.  I must assure the Deputy that it holds no fear for the pensioners.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I would think that 1976 was on the whole a profitable year for pig producers.  Certainly profit margins were very good in the first half of the year but admittedly declined in the latter months of the year due to increases in feed prices.  The only means open to me to secure assistance for pig producers is to urge in Brussels for the implementation of Community measures to assist producers throughout the Community.  This I have done.  We have secured the re-introduction of refunds on exports to third countries and we are urging the Commission to <Col N="215" /> introduce storage aids which would enable us to cold-store pork until such time as external markets improve.</P>

      <P>Surely the Minister will not ask pig-fatteners who have been in the business last year and before to take seriously the suggestion that they have had a relatively good year?  Since it would appear from the Minister's reckoning that it was a good year despite the tailing off in the latter part of the year, how is it that our neighbours found it necessary to introduce certain subsidies even though they seem to be contrary to our EEC membership?</P>

      <P>Since the Minister introduced his budget it has been described in many ways.  Some say it was an election budget, others that it was not, and it is difficult to find any category in which to put it.  If it was to be an instrument of social justice or of a wider distribution of the national wealth or to attract more investment, in these it fails.</P>
      <P>Last week we had a most disturbing report from the authorities on the child care centres.  There are thousands of youngsters in these care centres and the report stated that the centres may have to be closed due to insufficient money to keep the children in them any longer.  The budget total is £2,200 million, yet we could not in the bigness of our hearts find sufficient money to guarantee that these eight child care centres would not have to close their doors and that these children would not be thrown on the streets.  Perhaps they will be eventually.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that since last Thursday there have been talks between the Departments of Education and Health and the school authorities.  I would ask the Minister to give us some information on the present position regarding these care centres.  Very often the liberals in our midst would attack the religious orders and say that they have more influence than they should have.  The religious orders who ran these homes for many years, unpaid in most cases, have not been as vocal as they should have been <Col N="219" /> and now, as I have said, these centres may have to close for lack of money. Had the authorities of the schools been more forceful in their methods of bringing their grievances to the notice of the Government and had we had road blockades and strikes, we would not have the situation that these centres would be closing when 1,500 children are involved.</P>
    <P>Is it all an empty gesture that we imply that we treasure all the children equally?  In a budget of £2,200 million we could not even plan economically to ensure that these care centres would be not alone maintained but improved.  Many of these centres have been able to stay open but they are housed in old buildings bought some years ago.  The cost of heating them alone is about half the capitation grant paid on each child. The wonderful work done by the religious authorities in these care centres has meant that a lot of these unfortunate children, some of whose parents are dead, some from broken homes, have found a haven where they had proper housing, clothing and food, and some of them are taking third level education.  Because of the fall in the number of vocations there are not enough religious to carry on the work.  That means that lay people will have to be trained for it and paid.  We want to pay the highest possible salary so that we can get the best workers, but we cannot do this.</P>
    <P>If this be taken as a high-water mark of financial planning then Heaven help the country.  This is something that shows the futility and bad planning of the Government's overall policy. Today one hears much talk about their making education available to all children who desire it and have the ability to take it, but here are hundreds of children who are denied the right not only of full education but of a roof over their heads.  Yet the Government tried to tell us what a marvellous budget this is.  In that aspect it fails.</P>
    <P>I am not an economist or a financier. Those who are competent to do so may well take this budget and show what a bad instrument for national development it is.  I sincerely hope <Col N="220" /> when the Minister is replying this evening he will tell us he is making money available for these child care centres so that not only can they be kept open but we can go on improving them and ensure that every child in them will have a proper opportunity to live a full life in his or her own country.</P>
    <P>The Government will be glad to see the national pay agreement has been accepted.  Not only the Government but any person who wants to see order and stability will welcome that.  In my union I voted for the agreement.  I do not say it is an ideal agreement but, in present circumstances, it is better to have an agreement rather than none.  The Government can hardly cavil about the help they got from the trade unions. Since about 1970 we have had national pay agreements.  Since this Government took office we had one each year.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Labour in one of those trite statements he makes, one of those pathetic statements he makes, said we will not have full employment with one national pay agreement.  Nobody suggested we would.  The Minister puts up his own words and then starts to knock them down.  That is what is wrong with the Department of Labour and the Department of Industry and Commerce.  No wonder our attempts at job creation are falling down.  No wonder thousands of our young school leavers cannot obtain employment when a Minister says we will not have full employment with a national agreement. In this Government's term of office we have already had three national pay agreements.  Nobody in his senses would make such a statement. It was totally uncalled for and absolutely unsupported.</P>
    <P>You do not need to be an economist to realise that it will take more than a year for us to reach full employment. This budget is no help in the creation of employment.  In fact, it will retard it because of the Government's ineptitude in the matter of price control.  This was one of the planks on which they were elected.  By the time this national pay agreement ends in about 14 months' time, if the Government keep to their past practice, they will have allowed inflation to erode whatever benefit comes to the people including <Col N="221" /> the whole range of those who have to earn their living.</P>
    <P>This budget gives no incentive to trade unions and employers to evolve or draft an economic plan which would give hope to the thousands signing on at the labour exchanges or to young people leaving school. Certainly in the case I made about the child care centres the budget has not been very wisely drafted.  It is easy for any Opposition in any Parliament to criticise the Government but everyone will agree that, with the means at their disposal, the Government could have generated hope that in the future we could build up our economy. If people saw that the Government were serious in trying to do this, they would back them.  At the moment, there is this national <i>malaise</i> which is not helping in the creation of that willingness on the part of people to work hard and share with their less well-off fellows.  Because of that failure, people may well lose faith in democracy and our young people will become the target of all agitators who want to see the end of democracy. By the very weakness of the budget we are playing into these people's hands.</P>
    <P>The Government have the power to direct our finances towards certain economic targets which would enable us to create an extra 30,000 jobs per year, or even to reduce the total number of unemployed.  They should give some indication that they really mean what they said in their election manifesto. Parents of today must be cynical when they see their boys and girls leaving school, or university, or any educational level, and know the vast majority of them will not obtain suitable employment.  If our school leavers cannot be given employment immediately, there should be an enlargement of the operations of a body like AnCO where they will be given some training so that they can give their parents some return for their struggles in rearing them.  Not only that, but they should be given an opportunity to create wealth which will enable us to raise the general standard of living.</P>
    <P>The Government should send out an idealistic call asking us to think more <Col N="222" /> about the person who has not got a job.  The Government, the employers and the trade unions should draft not only a national pay agreement but also a national plan for economic development.  When the change of Government takes place&mdash;and it will not be long now&mdash;as a member of the Fianna Fáil Party who undoubtedly will form the next Government, I will welcome a national economic plan.</P>
    <P>The Minister said this budget would be implemented if the unions decided to accept the national pay agreement. They have done so.  That is a good sign.  Because of the state of the economy, the Government must go much further and admit they were not able to maintain the standards we had.  They have not been able to prevent an increase in unemployment. We have the highest unemployment rate in the EEC and the highest inflation rate.  The time is coming when the Government will have to go before the people and admit they failed to keep their promises made four years ago.  This would be the honest thing for them to do because the evidence is there.</P>
    <P>In the short time at my disposal this evening I have tried to point out that their economic planning is crazy.  There is grave social injustice under this Government.  Any confidence one may have had that the economic and financial resources of the State could evolve a plan to provide jobs for all our young people leaving school has been eroded.  We cannot give a guarantee that these children in the care centres will be able to hold on to the roofs over their heads or able to continue to enjoy the standard of living given to most of them by the religious orders.  What faith can anybody have in a Government that cannot ensure in this small sector of education that we can maintain existing standards? People may say that this is a very small sector and that out of £2,100 million the amount needed is very small. That is the whole point; it is so small out of the total money involved in the budget that any wise Finance Minister could have said: &ldquo;We will see where the greatest need arises&rdquo;.  Surely ensuring <Col N="223" /> the future of these children must be one of the greatest needs.</P>
    <P>Last week the head of a major religious order shook many people with his announcement but we should remember that he also said that they had been too quiet and instead of pressing the Government they merely obtained large overdrafts.  Because of that, the time of reckoning has come when the overdrafts must be met.  Many of the buildings that house the children are old; formerly they were called orphanages.  They will have to be replaced. It is a poor reward for the religious orders that, despite the magnificent work they have done for many years, when we come to show our appreciation for their voluntary efforts we cannot even ensure that their good work will be continued.  That is why I ask the Minister when replying to give some indication of the progress of the talks initiated last week.  I hope he has good news for the House because on reading what the reverend gentleman who spoke last week said we find he said that they had sought interviews before with the Government but these were refused.</P>
    <P>One may say this is not a political issue and I do not want to make it one but every Member of the House has a duty to raise this matter.  This is the Parliament of the people and there are very few people who are not interested in this matter of how we disburse the national wealth.  If the religious orders and the children in the care of these centres have been too quiet and if they have carried on until the crunch which has now come, surely we are teaching people the lesson that one can be too quiet in fighting a cause. I have seen city streets blocked by protesters and traffic disrupted.  I have seen the sheer vandalism of damage caused to motorcars and other property during so-called protests but nobody has protested on the streets about these children.  Nobody shouted &ldquo;stop&rdquo; to the closure of the centres. I hope the Minister will advert to this matter when replying; if not, I shall raise it in the House as often as I am allowed to do so.</P>
    <P>People will say that it is very easy <Col N="224" /> for the Opposition to criticise, that it is part of their job.  I suppose it is also part of our job to say what we would do if we were in government. All the time when we were in government we never allowed child care centres to close for lack of finance, as far as I can recall.  I think I can promise now that if we are returned to power these child centres will not close.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to the lack of investment by the Government in the construction industry.  It has become a cliche to say that this industry is the national barometer, that if it is doing well the economy generally is doing well.  That is probably true to an extent but anybody can now see that the construction industry is far from doing well and there is little hope of it improving because of any provision in the budget.  We shall have the absurd situation that while about 25,000 building workers are unemployed the housing waiting lists are growing and young couples particularly are forced to live in unsuitable housing accommodation because they cannot get houses.  In the past, I suppose it was not too easy for young couples to acquire their first dwelling after being married but under the previous Government at least we had a realistic loan arrangement under which a young couple could get an SDA loan at a reasonable rate of interest. Last week I pointed out the ridiculous situation that in present circumstances if a couple can afford to buy a house they will not qualify for an SDA loan because the SDA limit is £4,500 and the average price of a house is £9,000. Therefore they would have to find £4,500, as a deposit, not counting legal expenses or the cost of furniture.  If their income is over £46 a week they will not qualify.</P>
    <P>This sector of the building industry could be given a shot in the arm by the Minister if he put extra money into the SDA loans, raised the loan limit to a realistic figure so that young couples could undertake to buy houses now on the market.  If the Minister did this the building industry would benefit; demand for houses would increase and extra workers would be taken on and more houses would be provided. <Col N="225" /> Instead, building workers have no jobs and people on housing waiting lists have no hope.  This must be changed because the social conditions a housing shortage can create may change it in a way we do not like.</P>
    <P>Although the Minister has ruled out a second budget this year, he should have a second look at some of his priorities because they are not in the right order.  The budget as an instrument for development is useless.  The Government will take credit for giving tax concessions which were conditional on the acceptance of the national pay agreement.  I welcome the acceptance of that agreement; I voted for it in my union.</P>
    <P>The area where the Government failed is plain for all to see.  Unless they take stringent measures in the very near future social and employment conditions will worsen and this time next year we could have an even more chaotic situation.  A cynical person might say that that could not be but it could happen unless the Government, even at this late stage, take a fresh look at their priorities. This budget is tolerating an injustice to the children I mentioned and this must be corrected.  It is not helping the building industry either.  Possibly an economist or financier could show that the budget is even worse than I think it is.  Under this budget a man earning a large salary will get a big tax cut and a man on low salary will get a small tax cut.  To use a cliché the rich will get richer and the poor will get poorer.  In my view things are even worse than that.  This budget illustrates that the Government, because of the national malaise, have not the heart to tackle the problems posed by the present state of the economy.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the unions and the employers on accepting the agreement. The Government have not encouraged the trade unions or employers by taking them into their confidence when preparing financial and economic plans.  If they had, this might have led to a plan which could have given a better living for our people.  It could have given some hope to the school <Col N="226" /> leaver that unemployment would be lessened, if not solved.  Children in care centres would have been assured that they would be able to live in those centres until they got employment and the religious orders would have been shown some appreciation for the work they have done over the years.  They are getting a measly capitation grant for their children, which has not been increased sufficiently. Again, I ask the Minister to tell us in his reply what will happen to the children in these care centres.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MylesStaunton" hpid="Mr. Staunton Mr. Staunton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Staunton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity of saying a few words in this debate today.  I understand that the Minister will be replying later this evening.  I am speaking on a very auspicious day because the premises of the budget provisions were based on the potential agreement on the national wage agreement.  This agreement is extremely welcome because had there not been a consensus among the social partners, trade unions, employers and the Government, in so far as the pay policy is concerned, the ravages of inflation would have been infinitely worse than they are now, despite the problems we are facing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have certain irreconcilables. Some people seek price controls from the Government but, singly, price control is an area about which a great deal of nonsense is spoken in political circles.  We get political demands for control of prices against an economic background in which it is extremely difficult for the Government to control prices without resulting in the bankruptcy of people in the wholesale, retail and manufacturing trades.  If profits are to be maintained in industry and trades, and if we are to guarantee and continue employment in those sectors, reasonable margins are necessary. With rising costs due to factors entirely outside our control, with the importation of goods, which are costing much more because of devaluation, and with the increased price in agricultural produce for our own people because of the enormously increased benefits for our farmers through EEC membership, price control is an extremely limited option open to a Government.  The extent to which they can control prices <Col N="227" /> is very dubious given the necessity which is operating at the present time of having a prices commission monitoring prices, having price limits on essential items, controlling prices under legislation and through the courts which is happening very rigorously. It is important to reiterate Government policy on essential foodstuffs.  Government benefits tend to be overlooked and disregarded completely when it suits the critics.</P>
    <P>Let us talk very briefly about food subsidies.  The position about essential foodstuffs is that price increases are caused by what our critics like to call internal inflation rather than imported inflation.  We are supposed to be nominally in control of internal inflation. When internal inflation consists of a large sector of agricultural foodstuffs which has increased in price, then it is internal inflation.  It is not desirable that there should be Government policy to reduce food prices to the detriment of the farming community if we are living in a farming country with the highest proportion of people living in the farming sector. Consequently, our policy within the EEC lobbying in so far as the common agricultural policy is concerned is totally different from the interests of industrial nations like Britain or West Germany.</P>
    <P>To offset the appalling price rises there is a very strong policy of subsidising essential foodstuffs.  The food subsidy at the present time is at a level of about £48 million, which is an enormous sum of money.  It is an attempt by the Government to help those in the lower income group.  We are talking here of milk, butter, flour and so on.  If this massive food subsidy did not exist today the cost of living would be about 2½ per cent higher than it is.</P>
    <P>There is a lot of woolly thinking about price control.  If we import bananas or coffee there is no way that we can control the prices except by ensuring that there is a reasonable margin of profit.  With the devaluation of sterling against other currencies, due largely to events in recent British economic history, this Government <Col N="228" /> cannot be held responsible for many of the price increases.</P>
    <P>I am delighted that agreement was reached yesterday on the terms of the new national pay agreement.  No other country owes us a living.  It is a fact that a gap exists between present income and the capacity to live as well as some people lived in the past.  It is essential that the Government should protect the standard of living of people presently in jobs, but it is even more important for the Government to see that there is an environment that will provide conditions which will result in jobs for future generations. At present the unemployment levels are unacceptable.  We must consider those who will be leaving school this year and the problems that will be faced by countless people in future years in obtaining employment.  We are told that we must create about 300,000 new jobs between now and 1986 in sectors outside agriculture. The priority of the Government must be to create the conditions whereby the school leavers of today and tomorrow have the possibility of getting jobs.  In circumstances like this restraint is necessary in some areas. The Government can exercise control in the area of incomes.  Patriotism today is completely different from the type of patriotism we spoke of 50 years ago.  It is restraint in demand in the consumer area that is called for today.</P>
    <P>I spoke briefly about the devaluation of the £ sterling and the difficulty it brought with it.  There was a staggering increase in importation costs, but it had also brought certain very substantial benefits to this country. We are fortunate that our economy is geared to a large extent to depend on income earned from other countries for our exports of agricultural goods. While the devaluation of the £ is not a long-term help in financial terms, it is at present working to the advantage of Irish exports especially in the industrial sector.  Despite inflation, despite the disadvantage at which we have found ourselves in some countries outside Britain, the devaluation factor of itself has simply built in a particularly strong Irish competitiveness. <Col N="229" /> This is a fact of life which it is sometimes difficult to get across to the man in the street.  Many of us relate everything to prices and incomes in this country and do not give sufficient consideration to what has happened to standards and prices in other countries.  It is apparent to anybody who has travelled in Northern Europe within the past few months that there is this very strong Irish advantage.  The ball is presently at the feet of the Irish farming and industrial sectors, of manufacturing companies and of the people involved in tourism.  They must get out and sell.  We have gone past the point where we can tolerate severe bias and criticism.  Some of it has been justified but much of it does not relate to the facts of the situation.</P>
    <P>We are speaking this year in somewhat easier conditions than those in which we were speaking last year.  This budget spells out very strongly that the Government are committed, as the Minister described it, to the work ethos and are bringing in a range of incentives for the individual and for companies at home and abroad.  The conditions are such as a result of this budget that the finger must be pointed at people other than those in Government if there is a weakness or slackening in the rate of development and growth in the country.  We are all partners in this, and that fact must be remembered.  The budget brought good news to the business community.  The greatest single criticism levelled at the Government from upper income elements, regardless of background, has been the supposed penal nature of the Government's capital taxation measures.  There has been an outcry about the introduction of the wealth tax and a somewhat smaller outcry about the capital gains tax.  These are the supposedly penal introductions of the Government, bringing rampant socialism across the land and discouraging all initiative.  As the Taoiseach said in his speech on the budget, the financial analysis of the present capital taxation measures shows that they are bringing in less than half the amount of money to the Exchequer which was received from the estate <Col N="230" /> duty which this Government abolished.</P>
    <P>This factor is not highlighted enough.  The Government are being unfairly pilloried in this sector.  Some years ago when we were in Opposition we listened to speeches of farming organisations, representatives of the business community and representatives of the chambers of commerce and other organisations about the extremely penal nature of estate duty taxation. If one was judicious and, having made provision, lived a certain number of years, one escaped the net.  The Russian roulette factor came into it if for personal reasons it was not possible to make such provision or if one made provision and died within the five-year term.  The result of sudden death or the lack of provision meant carving up substantial farms, selling businesses off and so on. Some of the great houses of the country&mdash;some of those people are at the moment complaining about wealth tax&mdash;could not be retained because of the estate duty taxation.  If there were a successive number of debts, in some cases this reduced to nothing what had been substantial estates.</P>
    <P>We do not hear a lot about the abolition of estate duty.  The wealth tax and other capital taxes are bringing in less than half what came in from the estate duty taxation.  The base line for wealth tax is fairly high at £100,000, private houses are exempt and in many cases there may be a division of assets in family businesses which allows further relief.  The rate of interest is relatively low, so that even to people in that category the payment of a relatively small sum is a great deal less penal than the possibility of being caught once or twice in one's lifetime for a very large sum of money.</P>
    <P>The personal income tax relief in the budget at all levels is very welcome. With regard to the Fianna Fáil attitude to income taxation, their attitude to the philosophy of government and the type of attacks they make on the Government it seems to me that we are dealing with a Fianna Fáil Party composed of two parties.  We see two entirely antagonistic attitudes developing within that party on issues such as this.  Until this budget, when personal  <Col N="231" /> income tax relief was introduced and in which corporation profits tax was reduced, we had Deputies from the front bench of Fianna Fáil, such as Deputy Haughey and Deputy O'Malley, decrying what they described as the rampant socialism, the lack of incentive and the lack of initiative of the National Coalition Government, talking about the freedom of man and the fact that there was a brain drain because people could not earn enough.  We had Deputy Moore, whom I hold in high esteem, saying a few moments ago that as a result of this budget the rich are getting richer and the poor poorer.  We also had Deputy Dowling in his contribution talking about the greater relief for the wealthy person and that the poor man was getting poorer.  It seems that the Fianna Fáil Party need to address themselves to this issue and get some kind of consensus about what their attitude is. The contributions we are getting are poles apart and would probably be very much to the right or very much to the left of the parties represented in the Government.</P>
    <P>The personal income tax relief and the corporation profits tax reduction point up some interesting contrasts between the incentives available here compared with Britain.  The taxation measures in Britain, both at personal level and at corporate level, are penal in comparison with the position in Ireland. In addition to that there is the added incentive here in manufacturing industry where tax relief of 100 per cent is available on all exports sales. Against this background I wonder, if, within the IDA programme, we are getting a sufficiently large participation by British industry and British interests in the industrial development programme in this country.  We are fortunate to have a very substantial investment from the United States. There seems to be an increasing investment from west Germany and other continental countries as well as Japan.</P>
    <P>It may well be that the British factor relates to events in the North.  I have no doubt they do to a certain extent, but I do not believe they should count <Col N="232" /> to the same extent in industry as they might in tourism.  In tourism we are dealing with the decision by an individual in regard to the country he will visit.  He will make his decision on surface impressions he gets from the media.  The industrial sector requires a greater analysis of attitudes and backgrounds.  It seems to me that we should push harder now to get a larger level of British investment in this country.</P>
    <P>The corporation profits tax reduction from 50 per cent to 45 per cent, 40 per cent to 35 per cent and the rise of thresholds is not a great amount of money, but at least it is a step in the right direction and I welcome it. The only quibble I have with the policy of reducing corporation profits tax is that I believe there is a tendency among Governments to improve policy in certain directions but at the same time involving certain built-in disadvantages for the country.  Take this relief of 5 per cent in the corporation profits tax and relate it to the potential of the offshore petroleum development from Donegal to Cork and along the south of Ireland.  It seems to me that in a case like this, where the Minister for Industry and Commerce has made available generous incentives and in which there has been agreement with the petroleum companies about exploration, rents, leases, royalties and tax, that those companies have come here on the taxation base which existed at the time of those negotiations. When we are talking about a wasting resource, something which will not be there forever, it seems to me that, while the marginal relief of 5 per cent corporation profits tax is a useful incentive to the existing base within the country, if it is given in addition to petroleum interests who have been coming in here and who are presently exploring off the Irish coast it may be an extremely high price for this nation to pay to get a general mood of enterprise and incentive moving here.</P>
    <P>There is a tendency for Governments to introduce welcome measures across the board to correct an imbalance, to correct a poor situation or to provide incentives but the danger in bringing in sweeping relief is that contained <Col N="233" /> within sweeping relief there may be sectors where a different attitude should be adopted.  On the question of offshore development, discussions took place between the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the multinational oil companies against a background where satisfactory discussions took place about rents, leases, royalties and tax and against a background where these companies took up options here on the tax base line which existed at that time.  We are discussing what is fundamentally a wasting resource that will not be there for ever, if discovered. Because of this I question the wisdom of the State in this example. Is this 5 per cent wise or not?  I hope the Minister will have time to deal with that factor when replying to the debate.</P>
    <P>I am assured that the stock relief introduced by the Minister some years ago was deeply appreciated in the industrial sector.  I am glad the Minister has continued the tax relief related to inflation.  This extension is welcome during this period of reinflation and difficult times internationally.  In addition, the removal of the uncertainty in regard to whether or not it is an outright reduction or whether it is a temporary relief is also welcome. Industry is of vital importance to the country because future jobs will come to a large extent from the industrial sector.  I accept that agriculture is basically the backbone of the country but in terms of numbers we are not likely to see an increasing number of people working in agriculture in the coming years.  Tourism, whilst welcome as a great producer of capital and an injection of foreign money into the country, is again, on analysis, not an employer of men for 12 months each year.  That is why industry is so important. We are getting over the worst as far as industrial policy is concerned.</P>
    <P>I expressed the view recently that whilst we had an enormous level of redundancies here in the last two or three years some of our critics glibly blamed these redundancies on Government policies and a lot of other factors. The redundancy levels we are experiencing could be much the same even in conditions of boom in the Irish <Col N="234" /> economy and world economy mainly because of free trade.  Some years ago the Anglo-Irish free trade agreement was signed in Britain and this was the first opening of the door.  We must remember that we had a completely protectionist economy; the shutters were up around the country and industry was artificially protected. Much industry became feather-bedded in that era when they did not have to compete with products from outside the country on an equal basis.  Under that agreement, and subsequently when we joined the EEC, there had to be a <i>quid pro quo</i> and the barriers had to come down.</P>
    <P>People always try to blame the redundancy situation on inflation, the world recession, and on the National Coalition Government but in spite of all this a large proportion of this would be happening in periods of boom.  The industrial picture is encouraging because against this appalling background of redundancies, factory closures and bankruptcies there has been a substantial creation of new jobs by the Government through the IDA in the past four years.  That is not appreciated sufficiently because in some years it has about equalled the redundancy level.  In the past four years something approaching 60,000 new jobs in manufacturing industry were created.  They are the statistics relating to this.  If we could only get rid of our chips, our own sense of inferiority in certain sectors and open our eyes and see what is happening in other countries we might appreciate this.  The statistics of industrial exports over the past year have been staggering, apart from the devaluation factor and apart from inflation.  We are talking about levels of increase running up about 30 per cent in some sectors. We would want to start saying this a little more often because the preponderance of speeches in the last three years from the Opposition and commentators outside the country has tended to build up a phobia and a sense of inferiority which I thought we had lost here some 20 or 30 years ago. Apparently, it has not gone.  This budget with the incentives it gives in income tax relief, corporation profits tax and the huge disparity that now <Col N="235" /> exists between the incentives at personal level to work and at corporate level between here and in Britain provides the conditions past which the other partners here need to look to themselves if expansion does not take place.</P>
    <P>There has been a tendency by Fianna Fáil spokesmen to be very nationalistic about industrial policy and to respond to the gods in suggesting that the industry we want is national industry.  There is a tendency to suggest that we have passed the stage where foreign industrial development is welcome here.  The Opposition spokesman on Industry and Commerce at the recent Ard-Fheis made remarks along these lines.  He said we had reached a new point where we can consider a new type of industrial policy which would give preference to the Irish base and adopt a different attitude to people coming from outside. Just about a year ago Fianna Fáil tabled a motion seeking legislation to require that the IDA toe the line in this regard by giving a certain proportion of their grants to Irish industry and to see to it that the amount of money given to foreign concerns does not exceed that point.  If the Government were to follow that advice, they would be following a prescription for disaster.  If the IDA were required to give proportionately less to foreign industry, we would reach the point where we would lessen the level of development against a background where we need 300,000 new jobs between now and 1986.  It is farcical to suggest this. We cannot bask in the luxury of taking options where jobs and job creation are concerned.  It is not a question of getting into a fashionable slanging match about whether we want labour intensive or capital intensive or foreign or native industries.  Provided they comply with Irish laws and fit into Irish society, regardless of where they come from, they are welcome in my book.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to assess the position where the public service is concerned. There is a tendency for people who are not involved in the political process or in local authorities to have a distrust of the civil service and to point <Col N="236" /> to the appalling cost of the public sector.  Relative to the GNP it is tending to cost more than it was costing. We have to have regard to the fact that the State is involved in many more areas than previously, that since EEC accession there has been vital work to be done <i>vis-á-vis</i> the EEC, in the interests of the country, and many of the grants flowing to the farmers and other sectors would not be there if we had not the administrative machine to deal with all the problems thus created.</P>
    <P>Different departments have grown, particularly those of Defence and Justice.  For instance, the Estimate for the Department of Defence in 1969-70 amounted to £14½ million and this year it was £70 million.  It is of importance to put these matters into perspective.  Increases in the number of civil servants have been restricted. In 1975 the percentage increase was two; in 1976 it was down to one in contrast to 6 per cent in the period 1969 to 1974.  The saving thus made would be in the region of £20 million. An important feature is that there has been a will on the part of the civil service to co-operate with the Government.</P>
    <P>The borrowing requirements of the Government as a proportion of the GNP is admittedly appalling but is so because the country was hit by the oil crisis.  However, this, too, must be put into perspective.  The borrowing requirements in 1976 were £506 million, 11.5 per cent of GNP, which contrasts with the 1975 figure of 16.9 per cent. It needs to be contained and I hope the policy of the Government will be to continue to contain it.  The trend is right, the approach is in the right direction.</P>
    <P>My final word is that if we could only instil in our people the necessity, where possible, to buy Irish goods we would immediately create jobs.  We face a major problem in this sector because many people in the trading community do not stock Irish goods to the extent they might.  We are faced with a careless attitude on the part of our people in the matter of buying Irish goods.  They should seek to buy Irish if it is as good as the imported product.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="237" /> I welcome the climate created by the budget, particularly the tax reliefs, and I hope the partners in the country outside the Government will take up the options so that we can get the country moving again after the appalling crisis we got into.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is fair to say that the most notable feature of the budget and the manner in which it has been presented by the Government, particularly the Minister for Finance, is a claim that the recession is over.  I wonder if the Minister for Finance and his colleagues realise just how lacking in credibility that claim is and how much more effective it would be if they were to put the improvements which have occurred in certain economic indicators into proper perspective.</P>
      <P>That would entail saying, as I have said on a few occasions here and outside, that any improvement in our economic position is welcomed for whichever cause it has occurred, but that in order to gauge whether there is a real improvement or whether one can go so far as to say the recession is on its way out, it is necessary to analyse the cause of the improvements, such as they are.  Any analysis in that respect will show that the principal reason for such improvements as have occurred lies in the falling value of the £.  I indicated on budget day the stark reality of the fact that while our industrial exports grew very substantially to non-sterling countries last year, our exports to Britain dropped.</P>
      <P>We must not lose sight of the reality of that or fool ourselves into believing there is a real improvement taking place as a result of our efforts.  I do not think the Minister is doing any good for this country by pretending otherwise.  We all understand the political difficulties he faces, that with an election pending he must put the best face he can on it, but from the point of view of the national interest it is not a good thing for the Minister to talk in the grossly inflated terms he has used about the recession being over.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Even from a political viewpoint, I <Col N="238" /> do not think he is helping himself or the Government by these obviously inflated claims which lack credibility. They lack credibility primarily be-because people can see for themselves what the situation is.  They can see that our unemployment figures are at record levels, and I say &ldquo;record levels&rdquo; because the actual recorded unemployment is more than 118,000, almost as high as the highest figure ever recorded&mdash;during the war&mdash;but now we have far more young people seeking employment who are unregistered than at any time in the past.</P>
    <P>People know this.  They know our inflation rate, at the most recent level recorded, was 20 per cent for the 12 months.  They know the appalling amount of debt and the appalling millstone around the taxpayers' necks represented by that debt.  The recent figures on our balance of payments show a dangerous trend.  In the light of all these facts it is not realistic to talk about the recession being over.</P>
    <P>I suggest the next most notable feature of the budget and its presentation is the extremely doubtful conversion of the Coalition to the value of encouraging enterprise.  I say &ldquo;extremely doubtful&rdquo; because first, the measures in the budget are not nearly enough, but second, and perhaps more important, it is clear that if by any mischance they were to win the next election it would not be long before they had reverted to the pattern they have followed in virtually every budget up to now, a pattern in which the general theme was &ldquo;soak the rich&rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister anticipated what I was about to say.  The usual phrase used by the Minister to justify his policy has been &ldquo;equity in taxation&rdquo; and, in the name of equity, he has done the most appalling damage to the economy.  The fact that he has in a few instances tried to mend his hand with this budget simply does not excuse what he has done in the past and his colleagues with him.  As a former <Col N="239" /> Minister for Finance I am perhaps particularly conscious of this but I want to repeat here that, when I criticise the Minister for Finance, I am not referring only to the Minister for Finance; his colleagues are equally responsible with him for what this Government have done.</P>
      <P>This alleged equity in taxation is partially being abandoned in this budget. The best example of that is, I suppose, the considerably greater reductions in income tax for those who are very well off as compared with those who are on lower incomes.  The mere fact that the Minister has done this illustrates of itself the nonsense he has been preaching over the past few years because what is really important to the people is whether their standard of living is improving or whether it is not, not whether everybody is going to pay precisely the same proportion of his or her income in tax. In the long run, when people come to vote and measure the performance of the Government, this is the measure they will apply and not the one the Minister has tried to encourage in recent years when giving the impression that it was necessary to impose a degree of tax on the middle income group which inevitably causes and has caused an almost complete absence of incentive.</P>
      <P>I and this party have never made any excuse for recognising the importance of incentive to get the country moving and keep it moving.  On the record of this Government it is now quite clear that, once they feel they have got over the hump&mdash;in other words, if they find by any mischance that they win the next election&mdash;they will revert to the policies they were following in recent years, policies they themselves have been forced to admit in the Green Paper were leading to disaster.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The alleged conversion of the Coalition to the benefits of initiative and enterprise is, as I said, an extremely doubtful conversion.  It is one of which I personally am not convinced. When one considers the tax cuts proposed in the recent budget one is entitled to ask again in the overall context why is it that the Minister says <Col N="240" /> that in 1977 we will have a growth rate of 4 per cent, a growth rate which would be very substantially in excess of what we have had in the last four years.  But, if that is so, what justification is there for a cut in the real standard of living of the great majority of the workers?  There is an onus on the Minister to explain that.  He could perhaps justify it if his forecast was nil or 1 per cent, or possibly even 2 per cent.  If there is any basis for what he is claiming, and if it is real growth, it certainly does not justify the proposition, taking the cuts proposed in the budget plus the pay increase under the national wage agreement, of an improvement in the standard of living because the great majority of workers will suffer a reduction in their standard of living.  That is true even if one accepts the suggestion that the inflation rate in 1977 will be only 14 per cent.  It may well be that the inflation rate will be bigger than that. There are a number of possibilities which suggest that it may but, even taking that figure, it is still true that the majority of workers will suffer a fall in their real wages this year.</P>
    <P>There is a particular onus on the Minister to explain why that should be the evolution with a 4 per cent growth rate projected.  The proposals from this side of the House in September last included far more substantial tax cuts, cuts designed to maintain the workers real standard of living not to reduce it and, at the same time, to reduce the overheads of business so that production could be more competitive and create more jobs.  When projecting forward to the end of 1977 and the inflation rate, when people look at the recent price increases in such thing as coal, flour, tea and other essentials, and when one looks at the enormous increases announced in the budget for telephones and the postal service, people see the tax cuts for the great majority of workers in proper perspective and recognise that the alleged benefits are illusory.</P>
    <P>As the Minister well knows that the tax cuts he proposed in the budget do not even match inflation last year, not to mention inflation in previous years under the Coalition.  As I said on another occasion, I am afraid that <Col N="241" /> the prospects of the taxpayer ever getting back to the position in which he was under Fianna Fáil are now extremely remote.  One of the major problems we faced under the Coalition has been the lack of understanding apparently by the Government of the necessity for total commitment to fighting inflation, to fighting every inch of the way against price increases and to grant them only when they were absolutely unavoidable but, much more than that, to ensure that the Government themselves do not add to inflation. In every single budget, except the one we are now discussing and the mid-1975 budget, the Government specifically and deliberately increased very substantially the cost of living. The best example of that is last year's budget where, as a direct consequence of the increases in that budget, quite apart from all the other increases outside it, our inflation was increased by one quarter.  In other words, it could have been reduced by one quarter if the Government had not done what they did by way of increased taxes. This is particularly disturbing when one finds this was not done to enable the Exchequer to pay its way.</P>
    <P>One recalls there was a deficit forecast in last year's budget.  If there was any economic justification for that deficit then there was no need for the additional taxation imposed.  There was no need for the taxation which added 5 percentage points to our inflation last year.  This is typical of what this Government have been consistently doing and what we have been consistently pointing out to them was causing inflation.  One wonders if the Government even yet have grasped this basic economic fact.  As inflation is increased here, particularly as a result of costs within the country, Irish goods are made less competitive and as they become less competitive fewer of the goods are sold, more and more Irish firms close and more Irish people lose their jobs.  This is a simple basic economic fact but it has gone on year after year under the Coalition until thousands and thousands of people have lost their jobs as a direct consequence of the mismanagement of our economy by the Government.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="242" /> The priorities of the Government seem to be totally wrong.  I am not going back over all the Coalition have or have not done.  I am just talking about the situation as we find it now and as we have known it to be last year.  When one does that one sees there are three major problems facing us in this economy&mdash;unemployment, inflation and the condition of the State's finances.</P>
    <P>Our priorities in dealing with this matter, as indicated in our economic proposals, are to tackle unemployment and inflation first and, as a consequence, to bring about the cure for the third problem, namely, the chaotic condition of the State's finances.  As a simple illustration of how that follows, I would point out that we calculated that the creation of 20,000 jobs in the first year of our economic plan would increase the net returns to the Exchequer by £47 million.</P>
    <P>Let us look at what happened and the out turn last year with which the Minister was faced when he brought in this budget.  We find that little if anything was done by the Government to tackle unemployment.  As I pointed out, inflation increased by one-quarter and the only area that showed any improvement was that of the State's finances.  It was a relative improvement because it meant that instead of having a huge budget deficit we just had a major budget deficit. It was quite major but substantially less than was planned.  Unless the Government were totally without control over the situation, one must assume that is what they planned and, therefore, one sees the Government's priority.  That seems to have been to try to improve in some way the condition of the State's finances without doing anything worth while about unemployment or inflation.  I want to make it quite clear that so far as we are concerned we believe that that priority is both socially and economically wrong.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  This has always been the situation and the record shows that.  The Minister is overlooking the fact that he and his colleagues <Col N="243" /> have created such an enormous mess in our economy and in the condition of the State's finances that it will be necessary for anyone who wants to tackle the problem to adopt emergency proposals.  They may be proposals which in normal circumstances would not be acceptable.  I said earlier I was not going back over the cause of the situation but the fact is that given the situation that exists it is necessary to define the priorities and work to produce those priorities.  The evidence shows that the Government's priorities were quite wrong.</P>
      <P>On may say that there has been a late repentance by the Government as exemplified in this budget.  The effort is to suggest that this is so but that is not the case.  The Government have learned for whatever reason&mdash;it may be nothing to do with the economics of the situation or the economic priorities but rather with political realities&mdash;that they should not again, at least in this budget, increase the cost of living by deliberate Government action, as they have done so often.  That is a step in the right direction and one we have urged on them every year.  However, when it comes to the creation of jobs, the first priority, what do we find?  The Government's major weapon in this area and the way they approach the problem&mdash;it is the way a Government would approach it in normal circumstances&mdash;is in the capital programme.  Here the Government's record is really frightening.</P>
      <P>We have the situation where in the mid-1975 budget the Minister proudly announced an additional £28 million for the public capital programme and six months later he had not spent £22½ million of that sum.  Last year he was proposing to spend money in the public capital programme for job creation but, on the outturn, we discovered that £50 million had not been spent.  Then, this year as part of the great package to provide jobs he tells us he is going to increase capital spending by more than £50 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If he did not spend the money provided in the capital programme in the second half of 1975 and in the whole <Col N="244" /> of 1976 is that not clear evidence that there is no commitment on the part of this Government to do what they can to create employment?  Does it not suggest there is no guarantee that the programme announced by the Minister in this budget will be carried out this year?  If two years in succession he substantially under-spent the capital programme, what guarantee is there that he will not do it again this year?  I suggest the evidence is that there is no commitment by the Government except in so far as there is political pressure.  There is no commitment to tackle inflation or unemployment. It is quite clear that if we are to tackle the very serious problems facing us the first requirement is to have an integrated economic plan, one that will tackle at the one time the major problems I have outlined.</P>
    <P>We all know the history of the Minister's attitude in this regard.  I am not going back over that either but it is notable that the Government recognised in the Green Paper that the first requirement, if one were to tackle this under the heading of &ldquo;Outline of proposals to stimulate economic growth&rdquo;, was the preparation of a clearly defined plan for economic growth. How long do the Government think they can go on talking about the need for a plan?  How long do they think they can go on moving pieces of paper around and calling meetings to discuss this, that and the other instead of doing the job they were elected to do?  Is there any reason to believe that, having failed for so long to produce such a plan, they can at this stage produce one?  Everybody knows that the Government cannot and will not produce such a plan, although they recognise the need for one, because they cannot agree on the nature of such a plan.  They pay lip service to this concept and that concept but that is not what it is about.  The situation is so bad that the Opposition, in an unprecedented move, produce a plan. Only one or two members of the Government have attacked the proposals. The attacks are based on a misreading of figures&mdash;I am putting it as charitably as I can&mdash;and there has been no worthwhile criticism of the plan.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="245" /> There has been the half-hearted use of some features of the plan in the budget.  In this connection, I should like to repeat what I said on budget day.  I thanked the Minister for the tribute he had paid to Fianna Fáil by using some of those features.  I did not say that the Minister had stolen them nor would I say so.  I said he used them.  To the extent that the Minister uses our ideas, it seems that it is an advantage to the country.  The best features of the budget have come from our proposals.  The tragedy is that is a half-hearted use, that it is not part of a plan.  It is designed on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis to get votes.  It is not part of a plan to get the economy moving.  It is not part of a plan which will realistically tackle unemployment and inflation.</P>
    <P>I wonder whether the Minister has grasped the essential nature of our proposals. I will try to explain it to him again.  The essential nature of our plan is that we propose to cut the expenses of Irish business by tax cuts for employees which would substitute for pay rises and to cut the social welfare contributions of employers.  If that had been done the consequences would have been that the workers would have maintained their standards of living, the costs of the businesses concerned would have been held down and the goods would have been more competitive.  Therefore, more people would have been needed to produce them.  Jobs would have been saved and more jobs created.  That is the essential nature of our proposals.  The Minister has half-heartedly taken the idea of the tax cuts but not sufficiently to maintain standards of living.  He has not done it sufficiently to obviate the charge involved for business generally in paying the national wage agreement. The approach of the Government seems to be an <i>ad hoc</i> one, not designed to tackle the problems we are facing.  I regret that that is so but it is only right that it should be pointed out that there is no plan, that there is no effort on an intelligent basis to tackle the problem as it is now without reverting to the cause.  The fact that the Minister has used some of our ideas and has either not been willing to use them properly or has not understood them properly so that they could <Col N="246" /> be part of an integrated plan, is regrettable.</P>
    <P>When Deputy Staunton was concluding he made a plea for more buying of Irish goods.  Again, that is part of Fianna Fáil's proposals, not just for the obvious reasons with which we are all familiar, but for economic reasons.  It is part of the working out of the economic proposals, the manner in which they are paid for and the manner in which balance of payments problems would be avoided.  In this connection, we have in mind proposals which would be effective, which would make the buying of Irish goods a realistic campaign, one which would not depend on patriotism&mdash;not that I deride patriotism, but we know that it does not operate effectively in this area. The most effective way to sell Irish goods, provided the quality is adequate is by making them at a competitive price.  The proposals I have outlined would make them progressively more competitive.  That is the most effective way to ensure that more Irish goods are bought.</P>
    <P>Apart from the general aspect of the budget, there are some specific matters to which I want to refer, primarily because the Minister did not refer to them and I want to ask him whether he intends to include provisions in the Finance Bill to deal with them.  The first one relates to the restriction on the expenses of business cars.  I should like to know whether the provisions operating in this area are intended as a revenue-raising measure or whether the object is to discriminate against particular forms of business and professional activities. If it is intended to raise revenue, could the Minister give us an estimate of the amount that has been raised?  It is clear from what has been happening that the cost of administering these restrictions is increasing substantially and has taken up a great deal of time and I wonder whether the Minister considers that the cost involved to the revenue justifies the imposition involved here on business, which many people consider to be quite unfair, and justifies the irritation to business and professional people which is caused by these restrictions.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="247" /> Another matter which has led to much irritation and, I suspect, to a great deal of cost to the Exchequer relates to the provisions concerning benefits in kind from the use of cars provided by an employer to an employee. The restriction here operates in the case of people with an income exceeding £1,500 per annum.  That level was set in 1967 at a time when such people were thought to be higher paid employees.  Not alone is that limit out of date but a very harsh minimum figure was imposed last year with the result that a great deal of time is used up in filling up forms and on correspondence with the Revenue Commissioners. That time-consuming operation applies not only to the Revenue Commissioners but also to the taxpayers. I would like to know what revenue has come from the charge on benefits in kind from motor cars and what estimate the Minister can give of the official cost of administering this.</P>
    <P>The 1976 provision is of course a minimum charge of 15 per cent of the cost of the car.  The Minister claimed that it would simplify the system.  We told him at the time that it would not. The evidence is clear that it has not done so and the amount of time taken up and irritation produced by this is enormous.  A great deal of hardship has been caused to a number of taxpayers, and in particular I would mention the case of commercial travellers; they are not the only people but they are the most obvious case of people who are provided with a car by their employers, for whom a car is an absolutely essential tool of their employment; yet they are being treated in this way, deemed to have a minimum use of a car for their own benefit whether they have or not.  The Minister must be familiar with the anomalies that have come to light in this case.</P>
    <P>It is time he had a rethink about this matter to find out whether the whole thing should not be cleared up now with great benefit to the Exchequer as regards time and money and to the taxpayer as regards not only the saving of tax but the saving of time and irritation, because this matter has caused an enormous amount of ill-will.  Any approach to <Col N="248" /> clearing it up should consider a certain amount of retrospection in order to clear arrears out of the way.  There are different ways of tackling it.  I could make some suggestions and will, if necessary, on the Finance Bill.  The Minister might look at the British system.  It is not perfect but it is certainly simpler and more equitable than the system he has introduced.</P>
    <P>Another matter which is causing a great deal of concern is the ceiling of £2,000 on interest eligible for tax relief, apart from the special categories that are provided for.  The Minister has given no indication of any change in this although inflation is eroding it.  A rate of interest of, say, 15 per cent suggests there should be a maximum borrowing of about £13,000.  At the rate house prices are going many quite modest semidetached houses are well above this figure and young married couples are being penalised by being deprived of the full benefit of tax relief for the interest they pay.  The restriction here is a very arbitrary one and the way property prices are going, unless he does something to raise the limit, a great deal of hardship will be caused.</P>
    <P>There is a strong case for treating the purchase of a principal private residence as a special category, as I urged previously and as I urged in relation to the capital gains tax.  The Minister will remember his original proposals did not do that, but the position now is that the principal private residence is regarded as in a special category under the capital taxes.  The interest paid on a loan to purchase one's principal private residence should be in a special category, and I would like to hear what, if anything, the Minister has in mind in that regard.</P>
    <P>When the capital taxation Bills were going through this House a few years ago he undertook to review the exemption lists each year to ensure that account would be taken of changing money values.  As the Minister well knows, the thresholds are being eroded by inflation but he does not appear to have made any reference to this in his budget speech.  I would like to know whether he intends to do anything <Col N="249" /> about these limits in accordance with his undertaking when the Bills were being passed.  The Minister might also indicate what is his policy in regard to these thresholds now.  It could be of use if the Minister would indicate the amounts which have been collected under each of the three capital taxes and if he would say whether he is satisfied that what has been collected justifies the expenditure in terms of official time and effort.</P>

      <P>In regard to the income tax changes, it is surprising, to say the least, that nothing has been done about the allowances for children or other dependants.  I am sure the Minister appreciates that, if the allowance is supposed to be compensation for the cost of maintaining and educating a family, it might well have been expected that the allowance would have been increased to meet to some degree the increased costs which parents are incurring year after year.</P>

      <P>That is a possibility all right.  The relief announced in regard to corporation tax for manufacturing companies is another area in which it would be helpful if the Minister would indicate what stage has been reached in the discussions with the representatives of industry on the precise conditions which are to govern the relief to be given by reducing the rate of corporation tax to 25 per cent.  In his speech the Minister said the relief will apply only to taxable profits made from 1st January, 1977, by manufacturers whose production and employment are raised significantly above the 1976 level.  Can it be stated at this stage <Col N="250" /> what the Minister has in mind by a &ldquo;significant&rdquo; rise in this level?  Will these conditions require that both production and employment should be raised?  What will happen if production and employment are increased for, say, nine months of the year but the good results are negatived in the final three months due, say, to a strike or to some interruption of supplies?  How is the increase in production to be measured?  Will it be measured by volume or by the amount of sales?  If the numbers employed are not increased but if more man hours of employment result, will the relief be given?  These, and many other questions, are being asked by people who are involved in this.  If industrialists are to be enabled to plan and if the benefits sought to be derived from this relief are to be gained, the answers to the questions being asked should be given as soon as possible.  The Minister says that the stock relief was to be continued up to 5th April, 1977.  While the relief given for 1974-75 and for 1975-76 seems to be permanent, in some circumstances the relief for 1976-77 may be withdrawn and relief given on accounts ending before 5th April this year may be withdrawn also.  The circumstances in which the relief may be withdrawn are defined as a drop in the stock value or a cessation of trade. Is it possible to indicate what will be the extent of the withdrawal?  Will it be complete or will it be only to the extent of the fall in the value of stock? These, again, are questions on which people would welcome information as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding the Minister's proposals for the taxation of farmers, many people would appreciate his indicating how he arrived at the multiplier of 65 and whether this figure has any relation to any established measure.  The proposals to ask a farmer to pay his tax in one lump sum on the 1st September, 1977 is one which, as the Minister knows, has aroused a great deal of opposition, opposition which in my view is fully justified.  Farmers should be given the benefit of paying in two instalments in the same way as other taxpayers are allowed to pay.  If the Minister has anything to say on this <Col N="251" /> topic he might choose to say it in reply to the debate.  There are cynics who think that he may be prepared to say it now that the national wage agreement has been voted on but this is a matter for the Minister.</P>
    <P>We are glad that the national wage agreement has been accepted.  This party pioneered such agreements and have gone to a great deal of trouble in efforts to ensure their continuance, at times paying a high political price for our efforts.  However, on balance, we believe that national wage agreements are more equitable than are free-for-all situations particularly in so far as the lower-paid workers are concerned. But having said that, I must say also that from the point of view of workers in general and of our economy in particular, the combination of the terms of the national wage agreement and the tax cuts announced by the Minister are much less satisfactory than would have been the proposals put forward by us in September last.  I say this because a great majority of workers must suffer a fall in their standards of living this year, whereas our proposals were designed to ensure that there would be no fall in living standards.  Another reason for the agreement and the tax cuts combined being unsatisfactory is that they increase the overheads of Irish business and Irish manufacturers and, to that extent, render them less competitive. Consequently, more jobs are put at risk.  Unfortunately, it is not only a matter of more jobs being put at risk but of some jobs being lost.  It is better, though, that we would have the agreement and the tax cuts rather than to have nothing.  But let us be clear that this was not the best option open to us.  It was the option that was imposed by the Government and by the Minister.  The accompanying proposals for job creation are anything but satisfactory.</P>
    <P>I have indicated already the legitimate reasons for doubt as to whether the proposed extra capital spending will ever take place but even if it takes place the stance of the Government in this regard is not indicative of a determination to tackle unemployment as our major problem.  Indeed, the withholding <Col N="252" /> of the £50 million capital spending last year and then offering it this year as an inducement suggests a total lack of commitment, an <i>ad hoc</i> approach to a problem in order to overcome the difficulties presented by the demands of the ICTU, while there is a lack of a determined approach to tackle the whole problem of unemployment.</P>
    <P>It is clear that even if the package announced by the Minister succeeds to the fullest extent&mdash;there are doubts about that&mdash;the problem of unemployment will remain enormous at the end of 1977.  Allowing for the many thousands of young people who will be coming on to the market later this year, the unemployment problem will be worse at the end of the year than it was at the time the Minister introduced the budget.</P>
    <P>The clear requirement of our economic situation and of our people at this time is that there be leadership but leadership involves the ability and the willingness to take responsibility for decisions.  I do not know whether the Minister is willing to accept such responsibility but if he is, he is unable to indicate that, because he cannot get agreement on the decisions that are required.  What is required is that the Government, having consulted with all the relevant parties, are willing to discharge their obligations.  The buck stops with them.  They must be prepared to say: &ldquo;This is what we believe needs to be done&rdquo;.  They must set out attainable targets, not pie in the sky targets or targets which in the end will not have been worth striving for, such as the effort in regard to job creation in this budget.  The Government must be prepared, too, to gear the structure of the whole State apparatus and to create a climate which is conducive to the attainment of those targets.  They must go out and sell those targets to the people.  All the evidence of our past history is, that given this kind of leadership and given the attainable targets, our people will respond.  Year after year, under this Coalition the people have had no such leadership. No targets have been put before them other than spurious targets on which the Government turn their backs a month or two later.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="253" /> I do not wish to go back over all the sordid history of this Coalition but it is impossible to forget that a short time before the Minister for Finance was telling us that the recession was over, he was talking of how serious the situation was and the Taoiseach was telling us that this Government were not going to tread the primrose path.</P>
    <P>This kind of nonsense and gimmickery may seem to the Government to be of some political advantage.  I do not believe it is, but that is a matter which will be determined fairly shortly. Irrespective of whether it produces political advantage or not one thing is certain, that is, that it is not the stance of a Government which are going to do anything for this country to get it out of the mess in which it is. Nobody can dispute that fact.  I guess that the Minister and his colleagues in the Fine Gael Party would feel, rightly or wrongly, that if they were in Government on their own they could approach the problem in the way I have outlined, that they could set targets, that, they could go out and sell them and that they could agree.  I do not know whether they could or not, but I am sure the Minister thinks so.  I am equally sure that the Minister knows, as I do, that while he and his party are in coalition with Labour there is no way they can agree on any worth while economic plan.  There is no way in which they can put attainable targets before the people and there is no way in which they can give the leadership required from any Government in the circumstances we face today.</P>
    <P>That being so, more and more people are recognising this reality. Without the necessity of casting aspersions on the competence or otherwise of members of the Government, the composition of the Government ensures that our problems cannot be tackled, that our problems will get worse and worse to the extent that if there is any improvement in our situation it will only be marginal and will be due to causes outside the control of the Government.  As more and more people recognise this political reality, whatever political sympathies they may have they will recognise that <Col N="254" /> there is only one way to get this country moving again and that is to make sure when they get the opportunity in the general election that they elect a Fianna Fáil Government which, whatever its fault, can agree and has agreed and has put forward its proposals to get the country moving.  With that kind of programme being implemented by a Government which believes in it and which knows that it can make it effective, there is no doubt that the choice the voter is given is one on which he or she will not have too much difficulty in making up his or her mind.  The time has come for real leadership and for real targets to be put before the people.  The time has also come when people in general have recognised that no matter how long they wait they will not get that from this Coalition.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. R. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>As is my wont I want to be fair to the Opposition.  They had an impossible task in the budget debate this year.  A futile exercise of trying to find faults and flaws in a budget which, even if I say so myself, is a good budget from every point of view.  It has been recognised by virtually every objective commentator as an excellent budget.  It was universally accepted even by the Opposition, although understandably they found difficulty in publicly acknowledging it.  I do not blame them for that.  It is not the tradition of Oppositions in Ireland to praise the Government of the day and I am happy not to be embarrassed by praise from Fianna Fáil.  At the end of this debate we now see that the Opposition speakers had the vain and unrewarding chore of trying to find something to say against the budget, something which would sound plausible or in any way worthy of consideration.  They failed not for want of trying but simply because of the well-known truth that one cannot beat a good thing.  This year's budget was good for the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We had the spectacle of the Fianna Fáil spokesman for Finance, Deputy Colley, devoting a large part of his speech to a defence of the Fianna <Col N="255" /> Fáil exhortation that the country should borrow until it bursts, in the vain hope that it could borrow.  They suggest a borrowing of at least £1,000 million this year mostly from abroad. Nobody would lend that amount.  If by any chance Fianna Fáil could find somebody in some part of the world ready to lend it, they would soon find themselves being dictated to, like Britain and other countries are being dictated to today, by the International Monetary Fund and other agencies. If their wildest dreams should be fulfilled and they were able to get their hands on this hot money, they would not be economically free.  The country would be subjected to the dictates of international organisations.</P>
    <P>Whatever difficulties we may have experienced in the last few years, there is no international financial agency dictating to this country the manner in which the country should be conducted. For all the long-winded, repetitious, irrelevant and frequently contradictory rhetoric indulged in by the front and back bench speakers of the Opposition, no useful purpose was served by most of their contributions. Perhaps it demonstrates plainly and unambiguously the complete absence of any actual or latent talent in the ranks of Fianna Fáil.  In all the weeks of the budget debate there was not even one constructive suggestion from the Opposition.  This is regrettable if not deplorable, but it at least puts the public on notice that the Opposition are as bankrupt today of ideas as they were when they were dismissed by the electorate just four years ago for the same reason.</P>
    <P>As this Government enters its fifth year of office it has produced an incentive budget for individuals and for business.  I so described it and it has been so received.  It is most heartening that the general public and the business community in particular have endorsed this budget and the trade union movement found in it a satisfactory basis for acceptance of the terms of the 1977 national wage agreement.  An important watershed in our national development has been reached with yesterday's formal recognition by the social partners of the inescapable link <Col N="256" /> between national budgetary policy and incomes.  This victory for common sense is a gratifying culmination of the Government's efforts over the last four years to get widespread acceptance of the severe limit on the capacity of the Exchequer to allocate additional resources to promote economic growth, to encourage employment and to provide for social development without recourse to additional taxation.  As we to encourage employment and to provide for social development without recourse to additional taxation.  As we have always preached, it is crucial to the achievement of more employment, economic growth and social progress that full account be taken by everyone of all these wider implications, including taxation and public expenditure, as we plan and work for the future.  Very positive steps have been taken by all concerned in responding to the initiatives which have linked in a very clear way national budgetary objectives and income policies.  On behalf of the Government I express our appreciation of the responsibility and patience which brought about the right outcome.  Good foundations have now been laid.  The budget was a critical part of those foundations, not only in relation to the national wages negotiations but in relation to economic performance in this year and in the years to come.  It was exceedingly well received by the people who make the vital decisions governing expansion and investment.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to the way in which it was received.  A survey of chief executives in key industries, representing firms employing in all over 40,000 people and with a cumulative turnover of £1,000 million, commissioned by <i>Business and Finance</i>, immediately after the budget showed that substantial majorities of the country's most influential businessmen are convinced that the budget has engendered a more favourable climate for investment, will result in increased industrial output allied with improved employment and will make a definitive contribution in the reduction of inflation.</P>
    <P>The Irish Management Institute described the budget as &ldquo;reasonable and thoughtful&rdquo; and:</P>
    <P>a budget which makes an honest effort to achieve its objectives of improving economic growth, fostering <Col N="257" /> conditions for greater enterprise and spreading the benefits of prosperity.</P>
    <P>This is typical of the response of the business community in general with the sentiments expressed by a leading accountant in the Press who said:</P>
    <P>The proposals on taxation are imaginative and politically courageous and have already contributed significantly to a revival of business confidence.</P>
    <P>In a nutshell, the psychological effect of the budget has been enormous. All sectors of the public recognise that there is a worthwhile incentive to the individual to work harder, to earn more and to improve his position, that there is an inducement to companies to expand, to produce more, to take on more workers and increase profits. There is no need for me to itemise once again the many incentives of this year's budget because they are well known.  Suffice it to say that the more they are availed of the happier I will be because it will mean that the country will be producing more, will be wealthier, it will be easier to service economic expansion and social development and to improve the standard of living of a larger number of people.</P>
    <P>A former President of the Institute of Chartered Accountants underlined for the business community the message of the budget.  He underlined it also for the individual worker because the message for all is the same. He was addressing the Dublin Rotary Club and he said:</P>
    <P>I do believe that there is an important responsibility for all of us to respond to the initiatives in this budget and to begin to create again the confidence which will lead to investment decisions, hard work, creation of real wealth for all of the communities and the creation and maintenance of more jobs.</P>
    <P>It is not often that a budget receives such an extensive welcome as this year's budget.  It is generally accepted that the Government have done all they could in present circumstances to foster enterprise and growth within the constraints imposed by the necessity in our own interest to reduce our dependence on borrowing and to avoid adding to the tax burden imposed by the increased <Col N="258" /> level of borrowing which was necessary to sustain economic activity during the recession.  Employee interests are showing a commendable willingness to moderate their demands in the interests of improving competitiveness. The onus now rests with business, as has generally been accepted. I am confident that business will not be found wanting and will maintain and improve the revival which is already apparent.</P>
    <P>In the contributions to this debate a number of Opposition Deputies have questioned the validity of my statement that things are looking up again. If gross domestic product fell by 1 per cent in 1975 and increased by 3½ per cent in 1976, any person with an understanding of the difference between plus and minus would consider that we are in a plus situation and, therefore, out of the recession and, therefore, things are very properly looking up. To deal adequately with this point, I would like to draw people's attention to what has happened to our economy in 1975 and 1976 and set the development in the international context. Despite what some contributors to this debate have implied, there was no way in which a small local economy like ours, with exports equivalent to about 50 per cent of what we produce, could be exempt from the adverse effects of a world-wide recession and a fall-off in world trade.  Nonetheless, our performance over the last two years compares more than favourably with that of many stronger countries. In 1976 we more than made up for the ground lost in the previous year.</P>
    <P>1975 was a remarkable year for agriculture.  Net output increased by 12 per cent, farmers' incomes by 50 per cent and exports by over 20 per cent in volume.  Last year as a result of consequential cattle supply constraints, output and exports fell in volume terms by 8 per cent and 10 per cent respectively but higher prices helped to cushion the effects on farmers' incomes.  Because of these fluctuations and the general international recession which was widespread in 1975, a more accurate picture of performances is obtained by taking the years 1976 and 1974.</P>
    <P>Last year output was some 2½ per <Col N="259" /> cent higher than in 1974, and 3½ per cent higher than in 1975.  How do other economies compare with Ireland?  Over the same two-year period, 1974-76, Germany's growth in output was not as high as Ireland's.  We had a 2½ per cent rise and Germany was 2 per cent higher.  In Italy the rise was less than 1 per cent while in Britain output last year fell compared with 1974.  This is the answer to the argument of Deputy Colley and others that the growth in the Irish economy was due to devaluation of sterling with the Irish £.  If that was the reason for Ireland's improved performance, why did it have a reverse effect in Britain?  For the seven major OECD countries the figure was about 4 per cent up but for the other 17 smaller members of the OECD, with the exception of ourselves, the growth rate was less than 2 per cent.  We did better than our comparable partners in the OECD and that is a very creditable performance, indeed, considering the extent to which Ireland is obliged to rely upon the sluggish market of the United Kingdom at present.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies in this debate and at the Legion of the Rearguard jamboree at Ballsbridge last weekend referred to the recent quarterly economic survey of the EEC Commission as a refutation of the Government's economic thinking.  I would point out that the same Deputies were only seven months ago relying upon another expert view, to wit the ESRI forecast that the Irish economy would grow by only ½ per cent in 1976, and the outcome, as we know, was 3½ per cent plus.  Of course, the experts are not always right. Arthur Burns, the chairman of the Federal Reserve of the United States of America, said on one occasion: &ldquo;There are no such things as experts. There are just some people who are better at guessing than others.&rdquo;  He was probably right.</P>
    <P>The EEC Report, however, was based for the most part on data which was going stale by the end of November last.  Quarterly reports from the EEC should be read with a great deal of caution and in the knowledge that they are usually written a long time before they are published and that <Col N="260" /> national governments have available to them data which is much more up to date than what is available in the huge machine of Brussels.  At a time of rapid economic change&mdash;and last year we had exceedingly rapid economic change throughout the Community and Ireland in particular&mdash;such reports need to be read with even greater caution.</P>
    <P>The EEC report did not take account of the end of the year economic trend of the budget or of the proposals for the national pay agreement.  It was written before any of these were known to them.  I do not blame them for not knowing them.  They did not know them and they were not part of the report.  Consequently, the report itself is of little relevance to the post-budget situation.  It is unfortunate that in its timing and phrasing the Commission's report has unwittingly caused no little confusion.  The report states that the most urgent problem of the Irish economy is to curb the growth in nominal incomes.  It is a view with which the Government entirely agree. There is nothing new in it.  We have been asserting this for the last four years.  The development since the report was drafted has again underlined the over-riding importance that the Government attach to securing income moderation.  The report has given rise to some singularly ill-informed comment and I hope that now that I have put the report in its proper context it will no longer be relied upon by people who by quoting it merely make themselves look foolish.</P>
    <P>I would like to deal with the industrial situation in the last year or so.  In 1975 industrial production fell by about 6½ per cent.  This decline was less than the OECD average of 7½ per cent and substantially better than the decline as recorded in the same period in countries with very strong economies like the US and Japan.  Although full statistics for last year are not yet available, it seems likely that our industrial output last year grew by over 10 per cent.  By the third quarter of 1976 production had exceeded its pre-recession peak of early 1974.  There are those who will say that we are not yet out of recession but our production today is above the pre-recession peak of 1974. <Col N="261" /> Only two other countries in the OECD had a better performance than us, the Netherlands and Greece.  So, our industrial performance throughout 1975 and 1976 is quite remarkable.  It reflects great credit on our industrialists and I should like to pay them the tribute they deserve. Those industrialists, in a year when our main market in Britain was depressed, sought out new markets and capitalised on the competitive advantage provided by the depreciation of sterling.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies like Deputy Colley have suggested that all of the rise in the volume of our industrial exports which, incidentally, was of the order of 17 per cent, and the 10 per cent increase in output last year were attributable to the weakness of sterling and the fact that some new firms came on stream.  While these factors undoubtedly played a part, and one should not minimise it, they are not the whole picture.  If they were, then Britain should have had a similar performance. British manufacturers had the same advantage that we had in relation to currency depreciation and yet industrial production there expanded by only 1 per cent while manufactured exports increased in volume by only half our rise of 17 per cent.  By contrast, Britain's share of world trade fell in the same period and even as world trade fell in 1975, Ireland's share of a declining trade rose and rose again last year, whereas Britain had a very poor performance by comparison.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested by Deputy Colley and Deputy Haughey among others that the 1976 budget did not achieve its objectives which were to curb inflation, safeguard employment and limit the growth of public expenditure. The fact is that we have progressed on all three fronts, not as much as I would like, not as much as the Government desire but, nevertheless, we have progressed.  The underlying rate of inflation in 1976 as measured on a constant tax-price basis was about 13 per cent compared with a rise of 20 per cent in 1975.  Employment in industry began expanding in the second quarter of last year and rose by 3,500 between the first and third <Col N="262" /> quarters and the unemployment situation has also eased.  At the beginning of 1976 the year-on-year rise in the numbers on the live register was, unfortunately, about 20 per cent.  The latest figures, for 11th February, show an actual fall on an annual basis. Equally encouraging is the seasonally adjusted trends which shows that between August and January the numbers on the live register fell by over 5,000.</P>
    <P>As regards limiting the growth of public expenditure, I should have thought that documentation released at the time of the budget would have proved conclusively how successful we had been in that regard.  As I said in the budget statement, the provisional out-turn estimate of current public expenditure in 1976 was £1,672 million; that is £11 million less than the original budget estimate despite the fact that additional money was provided to the tune of £29 million during the year for health services and social welfare and to cover the costs of the interim pay agreement which were not known at the time of the 1976 budget.  But, most significant, in a year of rising costs this was the first time in 20 years that it was possible to contain expenditure within the original budget estimate. To those who have suggested, as Deputy Colley did today, that a Government composed of more than one party, a Government of Fine Gael and Labour cannot agree, cannot control expenditure, cannot have agreed policies, I say: We did what they never did: we controlled public expenditure and kept it within the original estimate. That was a very significant success and something of which we are proud.  It is a policy we intend to continue.</P>
    <P>On the capital side, there were also substantial savings but, as I must stress again, this was due to lack of demand and not to any policy decisions to make financial cutbacks.  We expect that growth this year will be of the order of 4 per cent.  Indeed, the latest forecast emanating from the Economic and Social Research Institute suggests that we are on the conservative side and that growth this year will be of the order of over 5 per cent. I am humble enough to accept for the <Col N="263" /> moment the lower projection but if the incentives which we have provided in this year's budget are taken up quickly enough, it is possible to achieve the 5 per cent growth rate in 1976.  Frankly, while this has been described as an election budget I would say that its main impetus, the greatest good that will emerge from it will come not immediately in this year but in the years to follow as the climate of confidence which we are generating gathers momentum and spreads throughout business generally with tremendous growth in investment and employment as a result.</P>
    <P>The main factor contributing to the achievement of the increase in growth will be industrial exports.  On the assumption that the standard increases under the national pay agreement are not exceeded&mdash;it is very important that they should not be&mdash;the competitive advantage our industrial exports gained last year due to the depreciation of sterling will be maintained and improved.  Thus, it is expected that our industrial exports will benefit more than proportionately from the forecast increase in world trade through an improvement in Ireland's market share.  The growth of investment this year will be largely influenced by increased public capital expenditure on employment creation as announced in the budget&mdash;a subject to which I shall return.</P>
    <P>The favourable reaction to the budget is ample evidence that the incentives were well judged and that faster growth will be accomplished. The exceptionally high trade deficit recorded last month should not be taken as indicating an unfavourable trend.  The provisional trade figures do indicate, however, that the deficit, unadjusted for seasonal factors, rose from £40 million in December to just over £90 million in January.  This sudden capricious deterioration resulted from the coincidence of a number of factors to which I should like to refer.  Some of them were quite exceptional: for instance, an increase of £9 million in the importation of cereals and cereal preparations due to a bunching of shipments and <Col N="264" /> a surge of oil imports to the tune of £12 million.  The latter increase was due to the delivery of orders placed in anticipation of an OPEC increase in prices in December.  In addition, the value of manufactured imports reflecting in an improvement in the economy rose by £15 million.  Export performance deteriorated slightly compared with December due, in the main, to a slowdown in manufactured exports related to the Electricity Supply Board dispute and the unduly long Christmas and New Year holidays which we awarded ourselves. Machinery and transport equipment which are both ingredients of economic recovery were a substantial part of the manufactured imports increase and, therefore, it is not in itself a cause for regret.  Last week, referring to part of the very substantial increase in imports, I said it was attributable to a Bord na Móna turbine; of course, I should have said it was an ESB turbine.  So, the January deficit is freakishly high and it would be very misleading to draw any conclusions as to the likely trends throughout 1977.  Of course we must be careful to have less reliance upon imports and to endeavour to increase our exports very significantly.</P>
    <P>In recent years the need to relieve the pressure of global recession obliged us to adopt emergency measures to deal with the most pressing problems. Because of the improved underlying economic situation, this year I was able to take effective measures to set the economy in the right long-term direction and get at the deep-rooted underlying causes of our present difficulties. The main aims of economic policy this year are to expand economic growth closer to existing capacity so as to move towards the higher growth rates of 6 per cent, and over, which we indicated in our Green Paper, to cut our inflation rate still further and to achieve an employment level far higher than we have at present.  Apart from the direct measures introduced to reduce inflation and unemployment, for example, food subsidies, the employment creation package and the more extensive employer premium programme, I am also introducing, as is known, generous <Col N="265" /> taxation reliefs in the areas of both personal and company taxation in order to provide the proper environment for continuing expansion of the economy.</P>
    <P>The Government's Green Paper, as is known, proposed a wide range of measures for discussion with the social partners as part of the process of re-directing resources to improve economic performance.  Consultations are in progress with the National Economic and Social Council on many policy issues.  Meanwhile at inter-departmental level work on the more detailed and technical aspects is being finalised.  Since autumn, interested parties have understandably concentrated their attention on the short-term issues related to the national pay agreement.  Now that is happily resolved, we will need to expand discussions to cover economic, financial and social policies right through to the eighties.  Deputy Colley sneers at the idea of having consultations and discussions.  We consider them essential.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I understood the Deputy was sneering at having consultations instead of, as he said, firmly telling the people what to do.  We will evaluate the contributions of the social partners and other interests.  These will be drawn together with the work which is proceeding in Departments with a view to settling a plan which will have realistic goals and which will set ways of attaining them and, therefore, command what is absolutely necessary in relation to any plan, that is, the support necessary to achieve them.  We have had too many cases in the past of reports being pigeonholed, reports which never commanded the respect necessary in order to make them a success.  We intend to have this support when we formulate the plans so that the disciplines which are essential to the success of economic planning will be observed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the great handicaps, of course, from which the Opposition are suffering is a pathological inability to <Col N="266" /> see things as they really are as distinct from a desire to have them as they would wish them to be.  This paranoia led Deputy Brennan to remark, in total conflict with the truth, that the Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development condemned the Government's Green Paper.  The latest OECD report on the Irish economy, published last November, included a section on medium-term development which referred to the projections for the period from 1976 to 1980 which were contained in the Government's Green Paper.  The OECD did not, as Deputy Brennan alleges, comment on the contents of the Green Paper.  Rather they prepared their own projections for the way in which the economy would have to develop by 1986 if full employment were to be achieved.</P>
    <P>It is noteworthy that the scenario envisaged by the OECD was, in fact, similar to that contained in the Green Paper and pointed to the need, as the Government have argued, to maintain competitiveness and boost exports, and to shift resources to investment, particularly industrial investment.  In addition, it pointed to the importance of a favourable external investment and realistic domestic income expectations in the medium term.  Contrary to what Deputy Brennan and his colleagues said, the OECD are very much of the same mind as the Government as to what course the economy must take if we are to achieve, as we intend to achieve, full employment.</P>
    <P>This year's public capital programme, as published before the budget, showed an increase of 15.3 per cent in nominal terms as compared with the outturn for 1976.  This would be equivalent to an unchanged volume of expenditure as compared with 1976.  An increase of £36.6 million for capital expenditure under the public capital programme is included in my national wage agreement related job creation package.  Because the national wage agreement has been adopted that package will now be implemented with all possible speed.  As a result of the carefully designed budget and acceptance of the agreement, public expenditure on the capital side in 1977 will be 22 per cent higher than in 1976. <Col N="267" /> This represents an increase in volume terms of 5½ per cent.</P>
    <P>This is only part of a story.  The very substantial increase we will have in the private sector this year in capital investment will yield a very large number of additional jobs, not merely temporarily but on a permanent basis.  So much for the myopic view of the Opposite benches that the 1977 budget would lead to a fall in investment. Deputy Haughey excelled himself in this debate in miscalculation and misstatement in alleging that actual expenditure in the building and construction industry will be 15 per cent less in 1977 than it was in 1976 whereas, in fact, there will be an increase of 19 per cent&mdash;some difference.</P>
    <P>The addition of £12 million in my national wage agreement related job creation package brings the allocation under the heading &ldquo;building and construction&rdquo; in the public capital programme to £15 million over actual expenditure in 1976.  That is only part of the picture.  When, in addition to the main item the figures in Table 5 of the public capital programme under &ldquo;building and construction&rdquo;, account is taken of areas such as industry, agriculture and telecommunications, the overall public capital programme provision for 1977 affecting the building industry shows an increase of the order of 13 per cent to 14 per cent on the out-turn for 1976, excluding the job creation package.  Taking that package into account, the increase in 1977 is, as I said, 19 per cent.  These increases compare with the estimated increase in building costs of about 15 per cent to 16 per cent this year.  Again we have an actual real rise in employment in 1977 as compared with 1976.  Furthermore, the tax concessions will once again stimulate activity in the building industry to higher levels.  They must be taken into account in any assessment as to what are the prospects for the construction and building industry.</P>
    <P>I should like to comment now on housing.  Suggestions were made that the public capital programme provision for housing in the current year was inadequate. I should like to point out that the allocation for local authority housing has been increased from £65 <Col N="268" /> million to £74.1 million.  The 1977 allocation will not alone enable local authority housing output to be increased from 7,200 to 7,500 but will also meet the cost of loans under the recently introduced low-rise mortgage scheme whereby tenants and prospective tenants of local authorities will be able to buy private houses.</P>
    <P>In the case of private housing, the primary sources of housing finance will continue to be&mdash;and we make no apology for this&mdash;as they were in 1976, the private lending agencies, building societies, assurance companies and banks, which loaned out record amounts of money last year.  When these agencies are performing very successfully we see no reason why public money should be &ldquo;sloshed&rdquo; around unnecessarily in this area.  The important thing is to get the houses built.  It does not matter a hoot from what source the money comes.  If it comes from the private sector that means it is possible for the public sector to expend public money in other areas where money is not available.</P>
    <P>Last year, for instance, the building societies advanced £120 million as against £74 million in 1975.  As they did in the past two years, the Associated Banks will also advance this year at least another £20 million for housing.  Under Fianna Fáil the banks had run away from making money available for housing.  Under this Government they have confidence that the building industry and the Government's objectives in relation to housing will be sustained and they are providing the money, whereas they did not have that confidence in the Fianna Fáil Administration which so frequently showed a disinclination properly and adequately to house our people.</P>
    <P>Deputy Briscoe stated that I had implied in my budget speech that local authorities had gone on a wild spending spree during the period of the Government's rates transfer policy between 1973 and 1977.  That phrase &ldquo;wild spending spree&rdquo; belonged to Deputy Briscoe; I did not use it.  I wish to draw attention to the unusually large increases in rates financed expenditure on services other than health charges or housing subsidies which <Col N="269" /> were transferred to the Exchequer during the period.  The increase of 211 per cent to which I referred could not have been due to national wage agreements as Deputy Briscoe suggested because general wage increases were not of that order during that period.  They were about half.  So there is something to be looked at there, whatever Deputy Briscoe may think.</P>
    <P>Deputy Haughey referred to a very serious miscalculation in the 1976 budget estimate for public service pay. I am afraid the miscalculation once again is on Deputy Haughey's side.  He got himself mixed up, not for the first time but he will hardly be sacked this time for doing it.  He got himself mixed up between the term public service pay, that is, the pay of civil servants, teachers, Army, Garda and health boards and the overall budget provisions for pay which, of course, includes the pay element in the grants to certain non-commercial State-sponsored bodies, universities and voluntary hospitals as well as pensions for public service pensioners.</P>
    <P>The 1976 budget provision for public service pay was £540 million and the out-turn was £530 million.  The 1976 overall budget pay provision was £679 mil-million and the out-turn was £679 million. This was very close estimation. As regards the £46 million for this year, as I said in my budget speech this sum is being provided to meet all additional pay increases in 1977 falling on the Exchequer, including the national pay agreement and it is on the basis that public service staff will continue to show, as I acknowledge they have shown in recent years, moderation and responsibility in their pay demands in the present year.</P>
    <P>Deputy Colley referred earlier to the foreign debts of the Exchequer and asked why so much foreign borrowing was necessary.  He is now of the opinion that we should be borrowing a lot more.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy and his party should by some mischance slip back to power and try to borrow <Col N="270" /> £1,000 million, as they propose to do, in a year in Ireland, they would kill the private sector and with it tens of thousands of jobs which are directly dependent upon expenditure in the private sector.  Deputy Colley knows that well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has a lot to learn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Now we know and we will tell the people that they dare not let Fianna Fáil back because that is what they will do&mdash;they will try to borrow £1,000 million at home and so kill the Irish private sector.</P>
      <P>The Deputy knows the Exchequer borrowing requirement is the residual figure of current and capital budget that has to be financed by borrowing. There is a limit to what can be borrowed on the Irish domestic market and on that account there has to be recourse to foreign borrowing.  In recent years, mainly because of the recession, public expenditure was increased substantially and since it was impossible and inappropriate to raise taxes to match this rise in expenditure the borrowing requirement rose steeply from £134 million in 1972-73 to £506 million last year.  Since the credit available to the Exchequer at home was not sufficient to finance this increased borrowing requirement, increased foreign borrowing proved necessary.</P>
      <P>However, I would point out that when I took office, the receipts from sales of Government stock and from small savings were very small indeed. In 1972-73 they came to less than £100 million and of this the banks alone provided £52 million through purchases of stock.  In the intervening years these receipts have grown enormously to £370 million, for instance, in 1975.  Last year, mainly due to the bank strike it was not so good but, nevertheless, £240 million were borrowed at home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This increase in the resources becoming available from domestic sources has been quite remarkable and I intend to further intensify my efforts to develop the domestic capital market.  In this way, I hope to minimise  <Col N="271" /> reliance on foreign borrowing but we will not attempt in the foreseeable future to try to borrow so much from the Irish market that will kill the opportunity of making money available to the private sector.</P>
    <P>I would now like to turn to the question of taxation.  The Minister for Agriculture and I will shortly be meeting representatives of farming organisations to discuss, in keeping with the need in fairness to collect as far as practicable similar amount of taxes from people with similar incomes and liabilities, how to tax farming profits in a way which will encourage output rather than act as a disincentive to production.</P>
    <P>I, therefore, will not comment extensively on the matter at this stage but a few points should, I feel, be made.  It was widely recognised, even by persons engaged in farming that the previous multiplier of 40 bore little relation to actual farm incomes. Even when it was introduced it was only about two-thirds of the then appropriate figure.  With rising farm incomes in recent years it has become increasingly unrealistic.  The new multiplier of 65 is a figure which will bring national incomes closer to national farm incomes.  Even though more realistic than its predecessor, the new multiplier of 65 is favourable to farmers.  Allowing for the fact that the number of deductions allowed has been reduced, a full value multiplier, based on farm incomes in 1976 would be in the region of 80 and in 1977 would be over 100.  A farmer whose real income is below the notional income ascribed to him may appeal against the assessment by producing accounts related either to the previous year or the current year.</P>
    <P>When I met the farming organisations last May they expressed the view that they would like to have a simpler system involving fewer deductions and an adjusted multiplier.  That is precisely what we have given them on this occasion.  If further deductions were to be allowed, there would be a need to increase the multiplier.  In accordance with the wishes of the <Col N="272" /> farming organisations we have gone for a simpler system.</P>
    <P>As Dr. Seamus Sheehy, agricultural economist of UCD indicated last night, there can be no real argument against the amount of income taxation which the Government propose to collect on farming profits in 1977. Farmers, he said, were likely to pay £57 million in different forms of taxes in 1977 and he judged that to be &ldquo;a fair share&mdash;no more and no less&rdquo;. The only valid argument, according to this neutral and objective observer must relate &ldquo;to the form and not the overall level of tax&rdquo;.  This is an area which the Government are disposed to discuss with the interests involved but it must be remembered that £35 million tax on farm income was included in the current budget revenue for 1977.</P>
    <P>Through ignorance or malice, some Opposition spokesmen and others have wrongly suggested, and I repeat wrongly suggested, that all farmers who or whose spouses have full- or part-time employment off the farm will have to pay full tax on their farming profits and on their incomes as employees. This is not so.  The tax position of farmers with off-farm income from employment was not changed by the budget and will not be changed by the Finance Bill.  They only become liable for income tax on their farming profits if the rateable valuation of their land is £75 or over.</P>
    <P>As proposed in the budget, a landholder who carried on a trade or profession will be liable for income tax on his farming profits regardless of the rateable valuation of the land.  There has been some confusion regarding the phrase &ldquo;trade or profession&rdquo;.  It refers only to the self-employed and does not, therefore, include wage or salary earners, such as teachers, nurses, factory workers, labourers and so on. People such as shop owners, publicans or contractors would be regarded as carrying on a trade and professional people, such as veterinary surgeons, doctors and lawyers, will be liable to income tax on their farming profits regardless of the rateable valuation of the land.</P>
    <P>As I have just stated, contracting, <Col N="273" /> as such, is a trade.  However, in the case to which some Deputies referred, where a small farmer does a little contract work, he would not necessarily be regarded as carrying on a trade for the purposes of this provision.  A farmer who uses his own surplus machinery to do some contracting work would not be regarded as carrying on a trade, whereas a farmer whose machinery was clearly well in excess of his own needs and who holds himself out as a contractor, and that is the significant phrase, would be affected by this provision. This is not a change in the law; this has always been so.</P>
    <P>There has been some criticism of the proposed scheme of income tax rates on the grounds that those liable at the higher rates benefit most and that a married man gains less than a single man.  They overlook two factors. Firstly, the reduction in the tax rates includes the removal of the temporary surcharge which affected the standard and higher rates but not the 26 per cent rate and, secondly, the scheme, including the increases in allowances, must be taken in conjunction with the terms of the national pay agreement.  When it became necessary in June, 1975 to introduce the temporary 10 per cent surcharge in order to help finance the food subsidies and to replace revenue lost by zero rating clothes and footwear and fuel, which brought about a significant reduction in the cost of living, it was those in the higher tax brackets who were hardest hit by those increases.  It is to be expected, therefore, that the removal of the surcharge and the other adjustments would have a significant impact on those higher income levels.  The point about the scheme which I announced is that despite this those on the lower income levels still fare significantly better in terms of the percentage of tax saved than their more affluent neighbours.</P>
    <P>Concerning the second point&mdash;the comparison between the married and the single person&mdash;I should like to point out that if the people concerned care to look more closely they will see that the percentage of tax saved by the married man is in all cases greater than the amount of tax saved by the single person.  The reason why a married man <Col N="274" /> at a certain level is shown as saving less in absolute terms than a single man with the same income is that the former was already paying a significantly lower amount of tax on account of the additional tax free allowance to which he was entitled.  Again, however, a more relevant comparison between the two may be obtained from the table showing the increases in disposable income arising from the combination of the proposed national agreement increases and the personal tax relief which was issued, the House will recall, as part of the budget documentation. This table indicates that, by and large, a married man gains more than a single man in terms of net weekly take-home pay when both the pay increases and tax concessions are taken into account.</P>
    <P>Exclusive concentration on differences in the cash and proportionate tax savings which will arise at different income levels and on minor differences between different classes of taxpayer is, in any case, unbalanced and misguided as the objectives of the new structure are concerned not only with helping to maintain real disposable incomes but to create the conditions in which real disposable incomes can be increased through increased productivity and enterprise and now in most cases can be increased without attracting a discouraging rate of income tax. The cash savings arising from the new structure are greater for high earners than for low earners.  It must be remembered that because of the progressive nature of the tax system high earners are at present paying a much higher proportion of their gross income in tax than are those whose earnings are more modest.  Moreover, the immediate benefits of the new tax structure to the disposable income of managers and executives in industry can be confidently expected to boost entrepreneurial activity which will in turn present increased opportunities for em-employees generally to boost their earnings through increased demand for the goods they produce.  If one looks at the successful economies across the world, one will find that the highest rate of income tax is invariable in the region of 60 per cent or even less.  The important point about the personal income <Col N="275" /> tax concessions which are announced in the budget is that they afford a significant amount of relief for each and every taxpayer in the country and I believe that this is probably without precedent.  Their implementation in the context of the acceptance of the national pay agreement will mark a major step forward in terms of increased competitiveness and incentive to work.</P>
    <P>Deputy Staunton asked me this afternoon to give special consideration to the appropriate form of taxation for offshore petroleum operations. As regards the taxation arrangements which will apply to offshore petroleum operations, it will be recalled that in April, 1975 I made a statement setting out the Government's approach to taxation in this sector.  This envisaged a separate and appropriate code of taxation for this unique field of enterprise and legislation is at present being drafted to give effect to the detailed provisions necessary for this purpose.  The statement which I made in 1975 was, of course, based on the rate of company taxation then effective and indicated that the legislation would take account of the particular circumstances of the offshore petroleum industry. Full account will be taken of the views of the companies involved and the Government will keep their taxation arrangements in this area under review in the light of developments generally and in the light of the proper share of the benefits from any finds which should accrue to the community through a package of royalties, rents, taxes and so on.</P>
    <P>Some Opposition Deputies claimed that the increases in social welfare payments provided for in the budget do not adequately compensate for inflation. That is an argument I want to quickly deflate and I want to write these statistics into the record.  In their more leisurely moments the Deputies and others may study them.  If one considers the contributory old age pension and the base date of October, 1972 one finds that including the benefits of 1977 the pension will have risen by 124.2 per cent against an increase in the CPI of 103 per cent; <Col N="276" /> so there is a real increase of 10.4 per cent.  I can give similar detailed figures for other headings but I will just give the overall figure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am speaking of the record of this Government.  If we take even last year's figures the increases given in this year's budget more than compensate for the rise since the allowances were last increased.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>All I ask is that the Minister should do it consistently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall do it consistently and having given one figure I shall now give the comparable one. Taking the non-contributory old-age pension, with the base figure for 1972, the increase in benefits to 1977 is 128.2 per cent, the CPI increase I have already given and the real increase is 11.3 per cent.  The increase in unemployment assistance, taking the base date August, 1972, is 134.5 per cent, the CPI increase from that date is 105 per cent and the real increase is 14.4 per cent.  The increase in unemployment benefit, taking the base date October, 1972, is 124.3 per cent, the CPI increase being 103 per cent and the real increase 10.5 per cent.  This is only part of the picture as everybody well knows because in addition to increases in the rates of benefit, which for the first time have consistently exceeded increases in the CPI, the period 1973 to 1977 has been one of unprecedented expansion in the coverage of schemes which have been expanded by the abolition of the income limit for social insurance, the easement of the means test and the reduction in the pension age from 70 to 66 years, free TV licence, travel and electricity allowance for invalidity pensioners and easement in the stamp <Col N="277" /> contribution qualification for women for unemployment assistance.  At the same time, new schemes have been introduced such as the pay-related scheme and special allowances for unmarried mothers, prisoners' wives and single women approaching pensionable age.</P>
      <P>The Government have gone a long way in a short time in improving the position of all the less well-off.  Of course, we would always wish to be in a position to do more but we have done a great deal when resources were very severely limited.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to deal with a point which has been raised in the course of this debate and elsewhere about the social insurance stamp.  The Government have made a very significant contribution to the reduction in the social insurance stamp this year. Last year there was a very substantial increase in the stamp.  The employer had to pay an extra £1.17 per week for the stamp.  This year the employer has to pay an extra 42p only, or 75p less.  That is an answer to the several critics who have picked up the Fianna Fáil argument about the amount of the stamp.  We have put in a massive Government injection to subsidise the stamp this year both for employers and employees as a result of which they will get immeasurably higher benefits if they are in benefit without having to contribute this year as much as last year towards the improved benefits they will be drawing.  To complete the picture, the figure for employees this year is 27p as against 42p last year.</P>
      <P>Of course, it is very popular to call for reductions in public expenditure of all kinds but it is less popular to maintain control in the face of unrelenting demands for more cash for meritorious causes.  We hear many calls for more expenditure for meritorious causes, one of which is the capitation rate for children in residential homes.  I gather that one or two Opposition Deputies endeavoured to make a meal of this matter today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to write some statistics into <Col N="278" /> the record.  Current expenditure on the special schools and residential homes increased between 1973 and 1976 by 159 per cent.  My colleagues, the Ministers for Health and Education, will shortly be announcing yet further improvements in the State aid for such homes which will be in keeping with the improvements which the Government have given over the last few years without having to have emotional speeches delivered by Members of the Opposition or by their allies outside the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it this will be announced before the election.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The time for what I have to say is limited but I will undoubtedly be dealing more specifically in the Finance Bill with some of the more detailed queries which have been put to me.  I notice from what we read and observed over the media at the weekend that the hackneyed Fianna Fáil Party watchword is something about getting the country moving again.  They do not say in what direction.  Their financial policies would, as I have already pointed out, put the country into bankruptcy, their economic proposals would crumble in chaos, their taxation and social thinking would create again in Ireland the inequitable society which we happily dismantled over the last four years.</P>
      <P>When in office it will be recalled that Fianna Fáil were always turning corners. In Opposition they are always on the move.  Remember their 1957 slogan &ldquo;Wives get your husbands back to work&rdquo;.  They got back to office and they fulfilled their promise by moving the husbands of Ireland into jobs in Wolverhampton, Camden Town, Islington and further afield.  The people are unlikely to become enthusiastic now over the rethreaded slogan of &ldquo;getting things moving again&rdquo; when we all know from experience that Fianna Fáil in power between 1957 and 1972 moved 25,000 people out of the country annually, reduced the number of people actually working by 37,000 and had 80,000 people unemployed in 1972 at a time of unprecedented world economic expansion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Inertia rather than movement has <Col N="279" /> always been the distinguishing characteristic of the backward-looking legion of the rearguard.  I will conclude by paying the Opposition this tribute. In this budget debate they have, to the best of their limited resources, fought a rearguard action, an engagement fought by the soldiers of destiny to protect the retreat of the main body of their troops.</P>

      <P>Last night I said the Opposition were now getting somewhat excited about the situation in relation to this railway line and I was pointing out to them that they were the people who produced section 19 of the Transport Act, 1958, that gave the board of CIE the power to terminate services of railways without recourse to this House.  The Minister has clearly stated that there will be no closure of this line.  I am concerned at the fact that there is this propaganda emanating from the Opposition benches.</P>

You will recall that in my letter of 10th December, 1976, I said that the Board had decided to defer, for a reasonable period of time, the fixing of a date for the closure by the conversion of the viaduct to a road toll bridge, and the implications of the proposed road network on both sides of the bridge were being considered.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it would be worth my while to put on the record the relevant section of the 1958 Transport Act which was introduced by the late Seán Lemass.  Section 19 is as follows:</P>
      <P>(1)  The Board may, subject to the provisions of this section, terminate any service of trains for passengers and merchandise or either of them.</P>
      <P>(2)  The Board shall not terminate a service unless it is satisfied that its operation is uneconomic and that there is no prospect of its continued operation being economic within a reasonable period.</P>
      <P>(3)  The Board shall not terminate a service or close a railway station to any or all classes of traffic unless, at least two months before doing so, the Board has published, in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> and in such newspapers circulating in the area affected by the proposal as the Board thinks proper, notice of its intention to do so.</P>
      <P>(4)  The notice shall indicate the new or additional road transport services, if any, which the Board proposes to provide in the area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="285" /> (5)  If the Board does not propose to provide an alternative road transport service the notice shall state that applications for passenger licences under the Road Transport Act, 1932, or merchandise licences under the Road Transport Act, 1933, or both, as may be appropriate, may be made by persons desiring to provide alternative road services.</P>
    <P>(6)  Where the Board does not propose to provide alternative road services the Board shall make available at some railway station in the affected area to persons interested in the provision of alternative road services particulars of the traffic carried by the train service which it is proposed to terminate, or despatched from or received at the station which it is proposed to close as aforesaid, during the period of the latest twelve months for which such particulars are available.  The notice shall indicate that such particulars will be made available at some specified station.</P>
    <P>I personally cannot see this line being closed in view of the fact that we are looking to an expansion period at Rosslare Harbour, a very important terminal, the gateway to Europe from which there should be greatly increased traffic.  While speaking of it I should like to raise one more point, more for the benefit of CIE than this House.</P>
    <P>The section I have quoted refers to the economic viability of the rail services being provided.  From what we have seen in the figures of CIE's performance over the years, one wonders if there is a single inch of any railway economically viable, if one judges the matter from a plus or minus viewpoint. This must be looked at by CIE as being part of a whole network and it is not possible to arrive at a simple judgment and to say that the Rosslare/Waterford line is not economic.  It is probably a great deal more economic than any other line.  In making that judgment CIE must consider a lot of matters&mdash; the physical viability and alternatives. The fact is, if they were making a judgment now, they would be making a wrong judgment.  Certainly they would <Col N="286" /> be making a judgment which would be opposed by me, by other public representatives and by the people generally in Wexford.  Should they decide to take steps to close this railway they would be taking a decision without having a complete picture.  To date, no one has been given any proper financial accounts that I am aware of in regard to the working of this railway or any part of it.  It is ridiculous for people to go around saying that it has now been decided to close this railway because I do not think CIE can in law make a decision or a judgment that this line is not economic.</P>
    <P>There is another serious legal point. The question is whether the section gives CIE power to remove a railway. The Minister has expressed himself strongly on this matter in contra-distinction to his predecessors who let things go by default and allowed complete lines to be removed.  One can have a very viable railway one day not necessarily viable the next day but viable again the day after that.  This is a very vital link in the development of the south-east.  It links the south-east with other large centres of population.</P>
    <P>I would like to ask Córas Iompair Éireann how far have they themselves contributed to a downturn in trade on the railway.  I will instance here a very small station called Kilrane on this railway line.  This station takes the beet crop from 240 acres of beet.  In 1976 it took up 6,500 tons in 651 wagons.  The extraordinary thing is that the wagons were not available throughout the entire day.  They were available only during certain hours.  Kilrane has a loading capacity for 15 wagons.  The maximum provided by CIE was five or six wagons a day and these wagons were only available at 2.30 p.m.  I cannot see how CIE can be judged a responsible body in regard to the running of this station if that is the service they provide.  The farmers were there to deliver the beet but the wagons were not supplied.  There is a rumour that this station may not be open next year.  That will mean that every farmer will have to drive an extra 14 miles with every load and that will certainly add to the cost of beet growing in that area.</P>
    <P>One might also question whether <Col N="287" /> anybody has thought it worth-while approaching the people who are willing to avail of this service.  Has there been any marketing survey?  Has there been any effort to improve sales? Have CIE not contributed to their own difficulties by their failure to carry on in a business-like manner even over a limited period in regard to a particular but very important crop?  We have been given the figures. That area served by Kilrane could grow twice as much beet if the farmers got the contracts and the proper transport service.  There is a small increase in the beet acreage allotted this year.  South Wexford is one of the most intensive beet-growing areas. It is an important entity in keeping the sugar factory going in Thurles. If CIE are going to come to this House every year and look for money to help them in their difficulties we, as public representatives, are entitled to ask questions.  Are CIE doing their job the way they should be doing it?</P>

      <P>Deputy Esmonde referred to the Transport Act, 1958. There was a good deal of beating about the bush last night and again this evening with regard to section 19 which gives autonomy to CIE.  Every time a question is asked about CIE the Ceann Comhairle sends back a very nice letter saying the Minister has no function in the matter.  CIE are an autonomous body.  I have here a letter, dated 29th November 1976, from the South Eastern Railway Development Organisation:</P>
      <P>Further to my letter of 27th July, 1976, I wish to inform you that the Minister for Transport and Power was requested to receive a deputation on the above matter.  He informed our organisation, however, that as the question of future services on this line is a matter for determination by the board of CIE he considers that no useful purpose could be served by him receiving a deputation.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;Deputy Michael O'Kennedy to reply to Deputy Esmonde.  What I would like to know is has the Minister now taken power on himself or are CIE still autonomous? I have numerous letters here in front of me and there is one further letter I would like to quote.  I should like to quote from a letter from the office of the General Manager of CIE, John F. Higgins, to the South Eastern Regional Development Organisation:</P>
      <P>When the Barrow Bridge is converted to road use which is scheduled for completion in a matter of months from the date of closure of the line, improved alternatives of substantial road services will be provided over the converted bridge as detailed in the timetable.</P>
      <P>CIE have issued four pages of timetables in this connection.  One wonders how successful has been the Minister's intervention in view of section 19 of the Transport Act, 1958, which has been quoted in the debate.  As far as I am concerned the Minister is indulging in a political gimmick.  The people in Rosslare and New Ross do not accept what the Minister said in Thurles.</P>
      <P>Deputy Esmonde did not quote the letter dated 10th December from Mr. O'Connor, Area Manager in Waterford. This was sent before the Minister went to Thurles.  That letter stated in the last paragraph:</P>
      <P>There is no commercial justification for the operation of services on this line, and the Board has decided to withdraw passenger and freight services from the Waterford/Rosslare section.</P>

      <P>This Government have been in office for nearly four years.  During that time we have urged them to have further development works carried out in Rosslare Harbour but we have not succeeded.

      <P>I have no doubt that Deputy Ryan is interested in the future of the Thurles sugar factory. Irrespective of what the Minister says, I have no doubt that this line will be closed.  The Minister is not fooling the beet growers of south Wexford.  I was pleased to hear Deputy Esmonde speaking on behalf of the beet growers in the Kilrane area.  They have been informed by CIE that the loading depot in Kilrane station is being closed in 1978.  Thirty growers will be affected by the closure.  I understand that a man is sent from the CIE depot in Rosslare Harbour to supervise the loading of beet at Kilrane.  I should like the Minister to tell us whether or not this station is being closed.  If it is closed it will put extra expense on the farmers in that area in that they will have to travel an extra 16 miles with their beet.  I understand that the man who supervises the loading of the wagons is employed by CIE.</P>
      <P>There are approximately 900 beet growers in the rest of south-east Wexford. If CIE cannot haul the beet from that area the farmers will stop growing it because it would not be economical to transport beet from south Wexford to Thurles.  I should like to know where Deputy Ryan stands when it comes to voting.  All you have to do is read what the Minister has on the Order Paper.  The amendment reads:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following: &ldquo;recognises that under Section 19 of the Transport Act, 1958, the Board of CIE is empowered to terminate any train service provided <Col N="292" /> the Board is satisfied that the service is uneconomic ...&rdquo;</P>

Our county council has received an application from an independent body for planning permission to convert the Barrow bridge.  Permission has been refused for many reasons.  One reason is the infrastructure of the road in the area. Another reason is that, if the rail link is closed to beet haulage, it would be reasonable to assume that the resultant road traffic would use several roads and the cost of bringing these roads up to standard is estimated at £750,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Last night it was said that the Minister did not go far enough in regard to the future of the Rosslare/Waterford line.  I have experience of working with CIE for 25 years, and I can recollect stations and important branch lines being closed. Some of these decisions are being rued today by business people.  Not alone were they closed but during the Opposition regime station houses and railway lines were sold, sleepers were sold, in fact the very ground the track was on was sold.  Listening to such statements from the Opposition benches makes one wonder how many memories have been lost over there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was stated here last night that the Minister's journey to Thurles to make this statement was a political manoeuvre to ensure that the Government would hold the marginal seat in north Tipperary, which incidentally is my seat.  It is a pity the speaker did not do a little more investigation into the reasons for the Minister's visit to Thurles.  When this matter first came to light last September all sections of the workers in the beet factory in Thurles came together and, seeing that their industry was in jeopardy, they decided to form an action committee. I was at two of their meetings and I complimented them on their activity and their intervention in this matter. It proves one thing to me that the legislation introduced by the Minister for Labour some weeks ago on worker participation in the semi-State bodies brought about a welcome change.  This group of workers started a campaign to ensure that the Rosslare/Waterford line would not be closed and that therefore the Thurles beet factory would continue to prosper.  It was at their behest that the Minister came to Thurles.  They invited him there and, unlike former Ministers in former Governments who spoke from Dublin, I compliment the Minister for Transport and Power for coming down among us, talking to the workers and <Col N="294" /> listening to their grievances.  I say to the Opposition benches: do not worry about the marginal seat.  I will worry about that.</P>

      <P>And rather than the Minister's visit to Thurles being a political manoeuvre, I believe the re-introduction of this Private Members' Motion into this House was a political manoeuvre.  Perhaps some Members on the Opposition benches did not take enough interest in the cause at the beginning and felt their forces were suffering, and they now want to regroup.</P>
      <P>On the 3rd of this month I looked at a television programme specially presented in connection with this controversy. The chairman of CIE spoke on the programme and I agree there does seem to be a contradiction between what the chairman of CIE said and the Minister's statement on 19th January.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>CIE have always had and will continue to have a major role in the development of the social and economic life of the country.  I believe such a step as was intended by CIE would have been to the detriment of the south-east and also the north Tipperary part of the mid-western region. CIE, Bord Fáilte and the IDA are there for the betterment of our people and must be seen to be working to ensure that their way of life will be improved.  Therefore the Minister will have to clarify the situation with the chairman of CIE.  We must know that the Minister's word is final and that such statements as that made by the chairman of CIE on 3rd February do not stand up.</P>
      <P>I appreciate what Rosslare means to the south of Ireland.  It is a gateway from England, France and the rest of Europe.  It has contributed substantially to the development of tourism in the south, the mid-west and the west of Ireland.  This line also conveys 40 per cent of the beet for the Thurles beet factory, and this in itself is a major contributing factor to the viability of the Thurles factory.  CIE stated that for economic reasons this line would now be closed.  One has to bear in mind that the £135,000 loss involved amounts to approximately one-half per cent of the total subvention to CIE of £32 million, and also think of the £6 million losses on the Dublin city services and, in latter days, this fantastic plan for spending £150 million on the proposed underground system in the city of Dublin, which makes one wonder if CIE are more concerned with Dublin than with the rest of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To take this a step further, I would like to do a cost analysis in respect of the alternative service to prove how frighteningly expensive this substitute service would be.  At the meetings I attended in Thurles it was clearly indicated that a fleet of approximately 100 articulated units would be needed <Col N="296" /> to convey by road the beet which normally travels by rail from the south Wexford region.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LorcanAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>We would not grow it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnJRyan" hpid="Mr. J. Ryan Mr. J. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>This fleet would cost an additional £2 million and would contribute to the chaotic conditions of road traffic in the north Tipperary and Thurles areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LorcanAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>We would build our own beet factory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnJRyan" hpid="Mr. J. Ryan Mr. J. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The first stage of the road development scheme that would be needed initially to cater for this extra road traffic in Kilkenny and Wexford would cost another £2 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LorcanAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnJRyan" hpid="Mr. J. Ryan Mr. J. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy Allen has already pointed out, the extra cost to the growers would be in the region of £250,000, approximately £1.50 per ton for the road merchandise service in lieu of rail.  I agree with Deputy Allen that this would be a disincentive to the Wexford Beet Growers Association. Not alone would it be a big blow to the Thurles factory but it would be a serious blow to the national sugar industry because, as was made very clear to me at the meetings I attended, south Wexford is ideally placed for the growing of first-class beet.  If the alternative service proves less satisfactory than the one in existence at the moment I can see the situation arising that the Wexford farmers will not grow the beet, and I am concerned about that as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My basic worry is the sugar factory in Thurles.  This industry has been in existence in my constituency for about 40 years.  To the credit of the executive and workers down through the years, it has established itself as one of the outstanding industries in the country. It depends for 40 per cent of its production on the beet from south Wexford. The Thurles industry provides 300 permanent and, at peak, 600 jobs between CIE and CSÉ Teoranta and contributes a total of about £750,000 to the commercial life of Thurles and the surrounding area.  We have many industries, some big, some small, in <Col N="297" /> North Tipperary but we are very fortunate in having three major industries based on natural resources.  There is the sugar factory at Thurles, a meat processing factory at Roscrea and mining operations at Nenagh.  Our only concern in regard to these industries is in respect of Nenagh because that is a wasting industry.  Consequently, we must think of the day when we shall have to fill the vacuum that will be created by the exhaustion of the mine. At no time has there been any doubt about either of the industries at Thurles or Roscrea.  We have never anticipated their being interfered with or their viability being lessened.</P>
    <P>The closure of any one of these three major industries would result in the need for a colossal amount of finance by way of subvention for the purpose of job creation in that area.  I am thinking in terms of up to £4 million.</P>
    <P>I wish to make it clear that at no time, whether it be before or after the next election, would I be prepared to support any move here to close this branch line.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LorcanAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Therefore, the Deputy will be voting with us.</P>

      <P>I should like to clarify the facts and then to identify the areas in which certain responsibility lies.  Although my time is limited, I do not mind quoting from all the letters concerned.  The question that needs to be clarified first is whether CIE have made a decision to close the line.  I think the Minister will agree that CIE had taken a decision to close this line.</P>

      <P>It was clear from the facts that continued operation of the Waterford/ Rosslare link will incur increasing losses.  There is no commercial justification for the operation of services on this line and the Board have decided to withdraw passenger and freight services from the Waterford/Rosslare section.  However, in view of the inconvenience which would be caused to those commuter passengers who use the service, it was decided to defer, for a reasonable period of time, the fixing of a date for the closure to enable Wexford and Kilkenny County Councils further opportunity of considering the use of the converted bridge as a road toll bridge, together with the implications of the proposed closure for the road network on both sides of the bridge.</P>
      <P>Therefore, the only thing that it was decided to defer was the fixing of a date for the closure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The point is that the Minister said in Thurles that no final decision had been taken.  So far as the board of CIE are concerned they took the decision to close the line, the decision to be effected would have to be subject to certain conditions that are laid down in the Act.</P>
      <P>To confirm what I am saying I wish to quote from the unrevised version of what the Minister said last night:</P>
      <P>I have put on the record of this House the immense difficulties that are in the way of closing down this line and I am saying now that the line will not be closed down until these difficulties have been resolved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is clear from that that the Minister <Col N="300" /> is acknowledging that the decision to close has been taken, that he is saying that the closure will not be effected until what he refers to as &ldquo;those immense difficulties&rdquo; will be overcome. Therefore, let us have some accuracy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I make no comment on that.  Our motion is absolutely vital.  The Minister in his amendment asks us to note his statement and take <Col N="301" /> note of the powers of CIE under section 19 of the Transport Act, 1958.  I would also refer to section 7 of that Act to put the whole thing in perspective. It says:</P>
      <P>It shall be the general duty of the Board to provide reasonable, efficient and economical transport services with due regard to safety of operation, the encouragement of national economic development and the maintenance of reasonable conditions of employment for its employees.</P>
      <P>There is no discretion given here, it is an obligation that CIE have due regard to the encouragement of national economic development.  That should be taken into account as well as section 19.  Who is to ensure that CIE will discharge their obligations under this Act?  The Government are responsible if they do not discharge their duties in the first instance.  It is not only CIE who are involved in this decision, the Thurles sugar factory, the beet growers of Wexford, Rosslare Harbour and almost every other interest in the area will be affected by this decision. The Minister for Agriculture is involved; the Minister for Finance is involved because he has quite substantial shareholdings in the sugar factory; the Minister for Transport and Power, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, and the Minister for Labour are also involved.  Are we to uphold in this House that one body such as CIE can take a decision under their terms of reference without taking the whole matter into account for the sake of saving £130,000, which will very seriously damage other State bodies, in this instance Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann.  Are we coming to the mad state where one State body under one Minister can take a decision and be allowed to go through with that decision simply to protect their own position when the consequences of their decision will seriously undermine another industry with all the other social and economic consequences?</P>

      <P>It is very obvious that the implications of this decision by CIE some months ago has far-reaching consequences and it brings in other Government Ministers&mdash;the Minister for Finance, the Minister for Agriculture, the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Minister for Labour.  In those circumstances it is undoubtedly obvious that the Government are up to their tonsils in this issue.  I did not organise the meeting in Thurles, whatever the Minister might think.  The Minister was more involved in promoting publicity for it than I was.  Those people called on the Taoiseach and the Government to intervene to ensure that this line would not close down, and we on this side of the House are giving effect to that call.  The Government can take a decision to supplement their subvention to CIE by £130,000, to protect the beet-growing industry of south Wexford, and the jobs of the people in Thurles.  CIE cannot refuse to accept the £130,000 if offered, because under the terms of this Act they must have regard to the encouragement of national economic development.  It has been accepted that 40 per cent of the beet of Thurles comes from south Wexford.  The total employment capacity in Thurles, in terms of the <Col N="303" /> sugar factory only, is about 650 jobs. At least 200 jobs are at hazard here if this rail link is not maintained.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there any procedure in this House for getting a copy of the minute of the CIE decision in order to get this quite clear, because no one else said it was a conditional decision.  It was a decision which could not be implemented without statutory legislation.  CIE made a decision and the Minister should accept that.  The chief executive has accepted that, Deputy Ryan and Deputy Esmonde have accepted it, and the Minister is the only person who is literally brazening it out here.  The Minister is trying to twist realities.  We want to make sure the Government step in and see that the decision taken by CIE will now be rendered void by virtue of the Government, under the Minister for Finance, providing a subsidy of £130,000.  That money would be well spent, because 200 jobs are at hazard and it would cost a substantial amount of money to create 200 new jobs.  This industry was established in Thurles under Fianna Fáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> It may have been established by Fianna Fáil after we established sugar factories which were referred to as white elephants by Fianna Fáil.  The ESB was also christened as a white elephant by Fianna Fáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The rough standard of grant aid for setting up new industries is in the order of about £5,000 per job, that would mean that to create new jobs in Thurles for 200 people would cost £1 million at the minimum. That is a conservative estimate.  The annual interest rate on £1 million at about 13 per cent, which is not an exorbitant rate nowadays, gives a <Col N="304" /> figure of £130,000 per annum, which happens to be the loss that CIE say they are suffering on this line.</P>
      <P>So there is a line-ball position with £130,000 interest to provide for £1 million jobs and £130,000 loss on the line, but there is much more.  The Minister has acknowledged that to change the road structure, to build a new bridge, to do all that is required would cost £4½ million or £5 million. We are talking about huge expenditure. We are left in the position that, if the Government do not act effectively and if the CIE decision is to be implemented as it has been taken, subject to the Act, we will be throwing away millions of pounds simply to ensure that CIE would not lose an extra £130,000 or maybe £150,000 next year. We will be undermining a very basic industry with all the traditional social and economic strength of that industry in Tipperary and Wexford and we will also be bringing on to our roads between Wexford and Thurles juggernauts and heavy trucks that the roads are not capable of holding and creating hazards that we are all trying to avoid.</P>
      <P>If there is any sense left then the Government must step in.  I am not criticising CIE.  They work within certain terms of reference to keep the subvention down and to cut the losses. They say, in effect, to the Minister &ldquo;The losses are £130,000 on this line and therefore we are not going to subsidise this.  It is not fair to ask us to subsidise the Sugar Company.&rdquo;  If that is so it is fair to ask the Government to subsidise CIE to subsidise the Sugar Company so that this industry and these jobs can be maintained and there would be a guarantee that the Government would not have to spend millions more as a consequence of a decision, taken by CIE in their own justifiable but narrow interests, which would have very serious consequences for everyone else.  That is what our motion is about.  We believe that for economic and social reasons the Rosslare/Limerick Junction railway service should not be discontinued.</P>

      <P>The board have a discretion.  Section 7, to which I referred earlier, imposes an obligation on them to take account of the encouragement of national economic development.  In this other area they have not an unfettered power, but a discretion.  Having regard to the responsibility they have under the Minister for Transport and Power it is no more than consultation.  Surely that Minister as the agent of his Government can give effect to that Government decision.  We are asking for not just a casual explanation.  The impression which the Minister gave, though perhaps not intentionally, that no decision was taken when he went down to Thurles was misleading. Everyone knows that a decision has been taken.  We want to put the record straight and let CIE, the public and everyone else know that our motion calls for the Government to act on the obligation they have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Act of 1958 which the Minister refers to is also the Act which provides very significant compensation for the employees of CIE in the event of certain lines closing or certain persons' services being no longer required.  I recall some of those compensation cases coming before our courts as a result of closures and the general opinion of the people at the <Col N="306" /> time was that the compensation was generous but&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;what compensation will there be for the beet growers of Wexford and business people of Thurles?  There is no statutory provision for them if CIE can go ahead with this decision.  That Act had a lot more to it than section 19 which the Minister referred to.  We are concerned about justice all round and we do not want to see a position of compensation for the Wexford beet-growers or Thurles workers.  We want them to be allowed to continue in their employment and business.  That can be achieved only if the Government, through this Minister, make available to CIE the necessary subvention, if such it is, to provide for this. Then we can dispose of this question of the Barrow Bridge.  The Minister will not have to rely on whether or not Wexford County Council give planning permission.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>They are not.  The record will show what the Minister said.  Let us leave it at that.  The people of Thurles are concerned because there is not a clear commitment by the Minister on behalf of the Government that this decision by CIE will not be implemented.  The people of Wexford are concerned.  Quite a lot of concern was expressed to us and that is why we put down this motion.  It does not make any sense that, for the sake of £130,000 which is all that is involved out of a subvention of £32 million or £33 million which the Government are providing, this decision has been taken.  That is the issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me distinguish between this issue and the issue in other cases. When lines were closed before this had serious consequences for the people in the area, whether it was Claremorris or Donegal.  That must be acknowledged. It had serious effects on their style of living and serious consequences on traffic to and from both areas.  But none of those decisions had a direct detrimental effect on another State body.  There is the real crux in <Col N="310" /> this case.  If the CIE decision is implemented there will be a direct detrimental effect on another State body. That cannot be tolerated.  Otherwise, as I said in Thurles, we in this House are a nonsense; we have no responsibility; the Government are a nonsense. If any State company take a decision which will affect the welfare of another, who is to stop them?  Surely it is the Members of this House who pass legislation requiring State bodies to take account of national economic development.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to a statement made by the Minister for Finance.  The House will recall that concern had been expressed about the accountability of State bodies to the House and to the Government.  A new committee was set up to examine the performance and the accounts of these bodies.  Ironically, but not surprisingly, two of the bodies listed are CIE and Cómhlucht Siúicre Éireann.  I want to quote some statements the Minister made about State bodies when he was introducing that committee.  As reported at column 1405 of the Official Report of 10th November, 1976, the Minister said:</P>
    <P>Once established each body has tended to operate independent of its parliamentary creator while Members of the Oireachtas and the public were alternatively infuriated by or apathetic about its activities. This unhealthy situation has brought about the realisation that the effectiveness and acceptance of these bodies as efficient national agencies required a more formal relationship to the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>That is the Parliament of the people. Our party insist that no State body can take a decision which will affect people in other employment without being answerable to the Oireachtas. The Minister for Finance, who is providing the extra £130,000 has acknowledged that at column 1405.  As reported at column 1408 of the same Volume the Minister said:</P>
    <P>The examination required may also involve oral presentations and senior officers of a State-sponsored body being reviewed and, <Col N="311" /> possibly, senior civil servants from Departments should attend before the Joint Committee.</P>
    <P>The whole purpose was that this Parliament and the Government chosen by Parliament would be able to ensure that no State body can operate independently irrespective of the consequences to any other sector.  That is what the Minister for Finance was about.  As reported at column 1411 of the same volume he said:</P>
    <P>The Minister responsible for any particular company ...</P>
    <P>I presume that would be the Minister for Transport and Power in relation to CIE&mdash;</P>
    <P>... is responsible for the overall policy of the company and answerable therefore to the Dáil and the Seanad for that policy.</P>
    <P>That is what we are doing here.  At the moment we have no way of getting inside the boardroom of CIE, but we have a way of making the responsible Minister answerable to us and the electorate in Wexford, or Tipperary, or wherever else.  That is what we are doing here this evening.  If the Minister does not accept our motion, in effect he is saying the question of responsibility, about which the Minister for Finance spoke so eloquently in introducing the Joint Committee, is a nonsense, all a facade, all a lot of wind, and we will have to sit back and acknowledge that decisions taken by each board of each State body when taken must be lived with, subject to the fact that it may take some time to implement them or there may be problems about planning permission. That is not good enough.  We are on <Col N="312" /> hazard and rightly so.  We are answerable to the public who elect us.  We will have to face the sanction and rightly so.  Because we have to face the sanction we have that responsibility and that authority unlike the State companies.  We have to give effect to the wishes of the people who elected us.  That is what our motion asks for.</P>
    <P>I know it would be difficult for any Minister to accept the terms of a motion of this sort because it would seem that one side is vindicated rather than the other.  If the Minister is prepared to accept that, perhaps he will acknowledge that this motion was not put down to stir up the pot.</P>

      <P>We want to vindicate the responsibility of this House, the right and authority of this House and ensure that the Government will carry out their responsibility particularly when two separate State companies are involved, one taking a decision which will affect the other to the detriment of another. Anyone who cannot see the issues as we are presenting them is ignoring our responsibility and the Government's responsibility.  It will be a sad day for CIE, for Cómhlucht Siúicre Éireann, for the beetgrowers, and a sadder day for this House, if the Government do not recognise what is involved and accept our motion.</P>
