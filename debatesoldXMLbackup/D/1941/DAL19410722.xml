      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for External Affairs whether his attention has been drawn to the arrest and deportation to England of Mr. Cahir Healy, M.P., and whether in view of this action against Mr. Healy, who is an Irish citizen, he has made, or proposes to make, representations to the British Government to ensure his immediate release.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for External Affairs (The Taoiseach)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that Mr. Healy was arrested on the 11th July and is now detained in Great Britain under the British Defence Regulations.</P>
      <P>As regards the second part of the question, if I thought that any official action I could take in this matter would achieve its object, I would not hesitate to take it.  But as things are, I do not think that official intervention on our part would help.  Everybody must see in the action taken against Mr. Healy yet another unfortunate consequence of a political situation which all Irishmen wish to see brought to an end but which can be ended only by the ending of Partition.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the Minister's further reply, would he say that it is not desirable that representations should be made at least protesting against the circumstances in which Mr. Healy was arrested, against his deportation and against the fact that no charge whatever has been preferred against him?</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for External Affairs whether he is aware of the inconvenience suffered by members of the public who have to wait for long periods at the Passport Office, Stephen's Green, Dublin, and if he will state whether he will increase the staff at that office with a view to obviating the delay in dealing with the members of the public who attend there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The position referred to by the Deputy came under notice early this month, and on the 9th July, four additional officials were assigned to the Passport Office to deal with it.</P>
      <P>The position has since improved. Some delay is inevitable when a large number of inquires happen to call at the Passport Office at the same time, but on the whole, I do not think there is now any serious cause for complaint.</P>
      <P>The position is being kept under constant review, and I can assure the Deputy that, if further measures are necessary to save inquires at the Passport Office undue delay and inconvenience, the necessary action will be taken.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the Minister's reply, is he aware that it probably takes a person one-and-a-half hours to get out of the office once he goes in?  I have personal experience of that.  I sent a person to the office one day and he came back and informed me that he was kept there for one-and-a-half hours.  I had occasion to visit the Passport Office, and it seemed to me that if the case were dealt with in ordinary course.  I would be at least one-and-a-half hours in the place.  Will the Taoiseach have the case specially investigated with a view to procuring some kind of acceleration in the transaction of business which at present is quite chaotic?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>My information is that at certain times of the day, whether it is that trains come in at that hour, or otherwise, there is a very large number of different classes of inquirers. Some of them can be dealt with easily, without any need to look up records, and so on, and an effort is made to put cases of this kind into one queue and have them dealt with as quickly as possible.  Other cases may necessitate inquiries, which take a certain amount of time, looking up records, and so on, and unless you were unduly to increase the size of the staff to meet that one particular kind of case, I do not think it can be handled much more expeditiously than it is being handled at the moment.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure the Minister that I called there at 10 o'clock in the morning and at that time there were about 30 people in front of me. Having made inquiries as to how long it takes to deal with an inquiry I was told it would be unlikely that I would get out of the place in less than one and a half hours.  The only thing to do during the one and a half hours is to lie over the counter uttering maledictions. Would the Minister have further inquiries made in the matter? <Col N="2016" /> If he will, I feel sure he will recognise the necessity for additional staff.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if he will state the cause of the delay in providing a suitable water supply scheme for the residents of Stradbally, County Laoighis, and what is the amount of the grant, if any, provided by the Minister for Finance for this purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. Ruttledge)</NameTxt>
      <P>The delay in this case has arisen, I understand, from the protracted negotiations for the acquisition of the necessary water rights.  Approval was given by my Department to the plans as far back as January last, when it appeared likely that the rights would be acquired by agreement at a reasonable amount. Negotiations are still proceeding. While I regret there has been such delay in implementing this scheme, it is not possible for me to intervene in the matter at present.  No grant can be allocated until agreement is reached in regard to water rights, and the local authority is in a position to have the work placed under contract.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Supplies what arrangements he proposes to make to supply sugar to those persons who desire to preserve their own fruit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Minister for Supplies (Mr. Lemass) Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Supplies (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>Measures have been taken, in consultation with Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann Teoranta, to provide sugar to meet the reasonable requirements of persons who wish to preserve their own fruit. Those who are unable to obtain the sugar needed from their usual suppliers <Col N="2017" /> should communicate with Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann Teoranta.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister be good enough to state the correct procedure for persons desiring to purchase sugar for the purpose of preserving fruit?  Should they go to the grocer and say it is required for that purpose or should they get some kind of paper from the Department of Supplies?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  As I have informed the Deputy in the reply I read, persons who are unable to get sugar for that purpose from their own trader should communicate with Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann, who, after they are satisfied with the <i>bona fides</i> of the case, will make arrangements to ensure a supply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>In the case of a grocer who is approached by a person representing herself to be one who desires to preserve fruit, if he issues to her, say, two stone of sugar, can he get from Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann a proportionate amount, added to the monthly quota to which he is entitled for ordinary retail trade?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That will have to depend upon the circumstances of the case.  The trader may have received his full normal monthly supply already.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Suppose he appropriates part of that full normal monthly supply to a customer who desires to buy sugar for preserving fruit, can he apply to Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann for an extra amount of sugar?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  If the trader is unable to provide the sugar without leaving his ordinary customers short, the person who desires the sugar should apply to the sugar company to have the necessary arrangements made for a supply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>So, without pressing the Minister unduly, it would be correct to say to grocers that, if a customer comes seeking an unusual quantity for preserving fruit, he should tell her to apply to Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann and that they will arrange to have a supply <Col N="2018" /> issued through him or by some other convenient method.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMenamin Mr. McMenamin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Supplies whether retailers of sugar who have not in 1941 exceeded their 1940 drawings are entitled to require wholesalers to supply them for July with one-twelfth of their supplies in 1940 and, if not, if he will cause a notice to be published stating precisely the rights of retailers in respect to sugar supplies for July; if in future when restrictions are applied to wholesalers he will cause an official notice to be published setting out the nature of these restrictions and the effect which it is intended they should have on retail supplies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Sales of sugar by Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann, Teo., in the months of March and April of this year exceeded by about 14,000 tons the quantity sold in the two corresponding months of 1940.  These excess sales were stated to be due to forestalling of the Budget, and when I became aware that they were being made I caused a suspension of further deliveries until after the Budget.  It was necessary, however, to go further in the direction of effecting an adjustment in the position, as the existence in the hands of traders of a quantity of sugar largely in excess of current needs was felt to be undesirable.  Consequently, after consultation with the sugar company and the wholesale sugar merchants, it was decided that the deliveries should be restricted until the excess quantities sold in March and April had been worked back into circulation. The arrangement, which aims at securing that the excess will be absorbed by the end of October, provides that deliveries to individual wholesale merchants will be adjusted in an inverse ratio to any excess purchases made by them.  By a corresponding adjustment in their sales, the merchants will be in a position to make normal deliveries to their customers in the retail trade who did not over-purchase from them in the months of March and April.  The relations <Col N="2019" /> between the wholesale merchants and their retail customers with regard to supplies are not governed by official regulations, and it would not, therefore, be appropriate that they should be made the subject of an official notice, as suggested by the Deputy.  I am, however, prepared to take up with Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann any case brought to my notice where the present arrangement has not operated in the manner intended.  The procedure which may be adopted in the future is at present under consideration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>What exactly does the Minister mean by &ldquo;working it back into circulation&rdquo;?  Does he realise that most of the sugar is already in the hands of private consumers and that it never can come back into circulation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

      <P>The question of maintaining the supply of candles has been engaging the constant attention of my Department.  The principal raw materials required for manufacture, which must be imported from overseas, are in short supply due to the lack of shipping facilities.

      <P>The public are led to believe that we have bought six oceangoing vessels and the Minister has stated that it is proposed to use them primarily for the conveyance of wheat. That is perfectly understandable.  However, would he say, in respect of two commodities&mdash;such as candles and tea&mdash; where one cargo would make an immense difference, that he would consider appropriating one of these larger ships for one cargo of these commodities, even if we had to have four or five breadless days in the 12 months?  One cargo of wheat is, I think, about a week's supply.  Would the Minister consider appropriating one of these ships to the transport of the raw materials for candles and a cargo of tea?</P>

      <P>On the occasion of the Minister's speech on the Budget, it was put to him that he might consider giving this assistance in cash rather than in kind.  Since then various representations have been put to me that it would be more acceptable to the people concerned if the allowances were paid in cash rather than in kind. Would the Minister say whether that matter has been reviewed since by him or by the Government or whether it will be reconsidered in the period between now and when the allowances come to be made?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter has been discussed and some representations were received that payments should be in cash rather than in kind. The object of the Government, however, in deciding to give this relief was to secure that these people, who were regarded as entitled to these special allowances, should receive the actual milk, butter and bread which is being provided.  So far as it is possible for the Government so to arrange, it is intended that these items of food will be made available for this type of people.  It is realised that in some cases, unquestionably, individuals might be better pleased to get cash. It is further realised that in some cases cash would be properly used, but it is also known to members of the House that it is possible that in other cases the cash might not be used for the purchase of foodstuffs, if cash were made available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course, I know that even in cases where organisations of a charitable type have issued relief in kind, persons who desire to do so have been able to sell their coupons or tickets for cash, and it is possible there will be a certain amount of that procedure in relation to these coupons also, but it will probably be small.  People who know now that they are entitled to a certain quantity of milk, butter and bread will probably be anxious to receive it.  They <Col N="2035" /> will put in their claims and receive their allowances, and it is the Government's desire to see that where food is available, it will be made specially available for those people who will be given these relief coupons.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>If it is decided to make this additional allowance in the form of goods rather than cash, I should like to draw the attention of the Minister to one aspect of importance.  Let me take the provision of bread for old age pensioners.  There are many parts of the country in which pensioners do not buy bread; they buy flour and bake it at home.  Is there going to be a proviso in the docket that they can get so much bread or flour, whichever they choose to buy?  This additional relief is being provided for persons to whom every 1/4d. counts and, therefore, it should be our concern to make available to them the maximum food value as distinguished from the maximum amenity value of the allowance.  Anybody who is interested in dietetics knows that, from the point of view strictly of food value, vitaminised margarine is equal to butter.  It is quite true that lots of people do not like margarine and cannot eat it, and it would be foolish to trust it on them in those circumstances.  But you can get eight ounces of margarine for the price of four ounces of butter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>Probably margarine will not be available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Possibly not; if it were, it might not be right to thrust it on the people, but to give them the alternative of buying margarine or butter, whichever they please.  Some women who might use it for cooking and would not care to eat it, as thousands of others do, might prefer to have eight ounces of margarine instead of four ounces of butter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to renew to the Minister for Finance a most important aspect of the question of feeding the people.  We have now, thank God, advanced to the point where we are going to distribute food to the people to ensure that they will not go hungry.  I am delighted to hear we have reached that stage, <Col N="2036" /> because it means we are truly facing the problem in an effective way.  But, what does feeding mean?  I am putting it to the House that feeding means something over and above filling stomachs.  You could fill the stomachs of our people with sand, but it could not be said that you had fed them.</P>
    <P>When we come to examine the problem of feeding the people, we discover that it is a highly technical problem, and that we have in our midst excellent technicians to help us.  Those are men and women who have made a study of the science of dietetics. During the last war one of the greatest difficulties in most of the countries which found themselves short of food was that the health of the children declined rapidly and their liability to disease rose proportionately.  At that time nobody really knew the explanation. It was only post-war research that established that that was due to a deficiency of vitamins in the diets provided.</P>
    <P>With the example before the Minister of the Oslo breakfast, and with the American dietetic work it involved, the giving to persons whose normal diet was unsatisfactory of a vitamin biscuit containing a full ration of vitamins for an individual, ought to be considered here.  If we could ensure by the consumption of a simple biscuit that each individual would be given the necessary complement of vitamins, we might then proceed to distribute a restricted variety of foodstuffs to these people which could not be contemplated if we were concerned to provide them with vitamins in their foodstuff ration.  The most important thing that the Minister could give, far more important than bread, butter or milk, is a certain minimum ration of essential vitamins. If he can get that to the people, particularly to the children, then our principal concern in regard to the other commodities supplied will be one of bulk rather than of food value.</P>
    <P>I do not expect the Minister for Finance to deal with a matter of that kind, because he has not the expert advice at his disposal adequately to cover it.  But our present Minister for Finance has been Minister for Local Government and Public Health and he <Col N="2037" /> knows the resources of that Department. I will ask him to address a representation to the Department of Local Government and Public Health saying that his mind is not easy in distributing this large sum of money without an intimation from the dietetics division of the Department of Local Government and Public Health that the money is being spent to the best advantage.  He should ask them to investigate (1) whether the three commodities here proposed are the best commodities in all the circumstances&mdash; and I think they are&mdash;and (2) whether the use of these commodities could not be immensely increased in value if this distribution were supplemented, especially in the case of children, by the provision of a vitamin biscuit for each individual in receipt of the relief envisaged here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already stated that in giving this increase to the unemployed and the old age pensioners it would be much more economic for them to have it by way of cash rather than vouchers.  I am speaking with some experience of how the voucher system operates, particularly under boards of assistance.  I have seen women who get vouchers pleading with the Cork Board of Assistance to give them cash instead and they gave good reasons why they believe it would be better for them to get cash rather than vouchers.  Those women have to try and make ends meet on the miserable allowance they are in receipt of at present.  If they were given this extra 2/6 in cash, they could put it to much better use than a food voucher.  Old-age pensioners, I understand, will be entitled to a pair of bread on the voucher.  They would not require that much bread in the week.  Apart from anything else, the women in receipt of unemployment assistance are, in my opinion, just as capable of spending 2/6 or a £1 as the members of any other section of the community, and hence I urge that they should be given this allowance in cash.  I often wonder at the marvellous way those people manage to carry on on their present miserable allowances.  I should like to know if this voucher system is going to <Col N="2038" /> mean extra expenditure for administration. If so, it cannot be justified at all.  If the allowance were given in cash at the labour exchanges or old age pension offices there need be no extra charge for administration.</P>
      <P>Another serious objection that I have to this proposal is that those in receipt of unemployment insurance benefit and of unemployment assistance in the rural areas, as well as in the small towns which are outside city boundaries, are to get nothing.  The maximum amount that a man with a wife and five or more children can get at the moment is 14/- a week.  That means a total of £36 8s. per year, or 2/- per week per person, or 1d. per meal per day for each man, woman and child in receipt of the allowance.  In the larger cities an unemployed man with a wife and five or more children will now receive 33/- a week, including this special allowance.  That works out at £85 16s. a year, or an average of 8d. per day per person, or 2¼d. per meal per day for each member of that household, taking into account the cost of food alone.  But such a man has also to provide something to cover his own body and the bodies of those dependent on him and to pay rent.  I am at a loss to know why in a Catholic country like this with a Catholic Government we should have such a situation as that prevailing.  As a member of the House I am in receipt of £480 a year, free of tax from the State.  Therefore, I have no right to say to any other section of the community, since I find that sum necessary to support my wife, family, and myself that the members of it should only get 2/- per week per person for their support.  I say that is contrary to justice, contrary to the provisions of the Constitution, and to all moral law.  While that condition of affairs prevails, this House, in my opinion, is not functioning in the way it should, and I want to say that to every member of the House.  Is it any wonder that democracy is being challenged to-day?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are in this House making speeches while certain sections of the community cannot get more than 2/6 a week extra to enable them to feed <Col N="2039" /> and clothe themselves and their children.  I do not know how some of those women carry on on the present allowance of 14/- a week.  That is the maximum for a man, a wife and five or more children.  Some have eight or nine children.  There is this increase of 2/6 for the dependents of an unemployed man.  Why is no provision made to give an increase to the unemployed man himself?  There is another aspect of this question to which I desire to draw attention, and I wonder if Deputy Dillon would care to stand for what is being done under the regulations. Take the case of a man who has been in regular employment for 20 years, and has had the misfortune to lose his job.  Because of the amount of stamps to his credit he is enabled to draw unemployment insurance benefit for six months and is allowed 7/6 for his wife and 2/6 for each child.  As I have said, he has been paying into the Unemployment Insurance Fund for 20 years, but at the end of the six months he is transferred to unemployment assistance.  Why should that man and his wife and family be punished because of the fact that he is getting less now than when he was in receipt of unemployment insurance benefit?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>I just want to stress one point.  As I have said, in the case of the man entitled to receive unemployment insurance benefit, there is an allowance of 7/6 a week for his wife. Let me bring one case&mdash;I could bring several&mdash;to the notice of the House. In this case a man's wife died recently. He had a family of eight children. After the mother's death the eldest daughter, who was over 16 years of age, acted as housekeeper.  She received the allowance of 7/6 while so acting.  A fortnight ago the stamps to the credit of that man became exhausted and he was transferred to unemployment assistance.  The result was that he is allowed only 1/- a week now for the daughter who is acting as housekeeper.  Why should not that man be still allowed the 7/6 a week for that daughter?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>I again want to put it to the Minister that this supplementary allowance should be paid to the recipients in cash and not be given by way of voucher.  I think if the Minister were to consult the various local authorities and their home assistance officers he would find that the recipients could make much better use of the allowance if it were given to them in cash.  They do not always get full value for vouchers when they take them to the shops.  I think it is rather a blot on the Constitution and on ourselves as legislators that the most we are able to give those people is 2/6 a week.  Is it any wonder that we have people disgruntled and discontented? In certain cities we have people buying meat and chocolate for dogs, and in certain cases, while the owners are away enjoying themselves on holidays, they have their dogs and cats in dogs' homes at 5/- and 3/- a week.  Here we are expecting human beings to live on less than 1/- a week.  In view of that, I say that we are not worthy of being legislators and should not call ourselves a Christian Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Hickey that this is a wasteful and unsatisfactory way of dealing with this question&mdash;of seeing that those people will actually provide themselves with a certain amount of food.  I do not know whether, in connection with this, the Minister is looking for ideas that may affect a rationing scheme later on.  If so, I do not think his experience under it will be of much help. If shopkeepers have limited stocks, they may have great difficulty in refusing to sell to those who want to buy for cash and of giving out food to those who come along with vouchers. In actual practice the possession of a voucher is not, I think, going to be the security that the Minister thinks. If those provided with vouchers desire to take their vitamins in some other form than that which the voucher would ordinarily provide, I think one may say that their wits will not be <Col N="2041" /> beyond rising to the occasion sometimes. The Minister, apparently, has decided to deal with the matter in this particular way.  Will he say when the first supply of vouchers, for the additional assistance that is being provided, will be available for the classes in question?  I should also like to ask how the vouchers are to be distributed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>Listening to the speeches that were made in this House a couple of years ago in connection with the provision of free meat by the voucher system, I thought that we would not have any more schemes of this kind presented for the approval of the House. The cost of administering this scheme will deprive the classes of persons concerned of additional cash benefits; if the Minister could see his way to alter the present proposal, additional cash benefits could be provided out of the money which would otherwise be spent on administering this scheme.  I should be surprised to hear even now from the Minister for Finance that he approves of a scheme for the provision of food by voucher in the light of the experience and knowledge that he must have of the methods of administering the free meat scheme by way of voucher.  That scheme was suspended and eventually done away with altogether as a result of the dishonest way in which it was administered, and the cost to the State of that dishonest type of administration.  Is it too late to ask the Minister to review the whole position, and thereby save the taxpayers from the heavy cost of administration, which cannot be justified under the circumstances? The average housewife who looks after the needs of her family is in a far better position to get what she thinks is best for herself and her family by the additional cash benefits which could be provided, instead of by a voucher system which compels her to go into certain shops and take whatever is given to her without having any means of checking it up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>I had some experience of administering relief, and I know the arguments which can be advanced in favour of the giving of <Col N="2042" /> cash as well as those in favour of the giving in kind.  I know there are arguments, and good arguments, which can be used on both sides.  I have had experience of administering both, and, generally speaking, I am sure I could say with truth that the people were more pleased to get the cash.  But here we are dealing with a peculiar situation. Those people will have cash from other sources.  This is an additional allowance, an additional food allowance.  It is made available at a time when there may be a food shortage, and the effort is to try to secure that that amount of food, bread and butter, will be available for those people.  They can have their cash, whatever amount they get from other sources, to buy the vitamins of which Deputy Dillon and Deputy Mulcahy spoke, if they feel that way inclined, but here we want to make an effort at any rate to ensure that this amount of valuable food&mdash;the most valuable kind of food, I think&mdash;will be at their disposal, and that, irrespective of the increasing price of that food, this much will be available for them. It does not matter whether the price goes up or not, we hope that that much will be available for them at any rate, and I can hardly imagine that there is any more valuable type of food that could be made available for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Comparisons have been made between the food voucher here and the food voucher that was used at the time of the meat scheme.  Well, they are not comparable.  That again was a scheme organised at a particular time to get over a particular problem.  I admit that things happened in regard to the quantities of beef that were made available that it was not intended should happen.  Some of the people did not like beef, and would not eat it; others had no way of cooking it when they did get it, and they disposed of it. The scheme ceased because the problem ceased; the surplus beef that the Government was anxious to dispose of was no longer there.  As I say, in reply to Deputy Dillon and in reply also, I think, to Deputy Mulcahy, those people will have money from <Col N="2043" /> other sources with which to purchase, as far as that money goes, other kinds of food that they prefer.  As to the dietetics of which Deputy Dillon spoke, that does not come within my purview as Minister for Finance, but I think no dietician could find fault with the items of food which it is proposed to give. For adults as well as for children, milk is a valuable food.  Of course it is particularly valuable in the case of children.  The trouble is that, small as the sum is, if the 1/9 per week were given in cash, there might be a few of the old age pensioners who would think that if they could get a glass of whiskey for the 1/9 there might be more vitamins in it than in what we propose to give them.  There would be no way of stopping that type of person if they wanted to buy that kind of food instead of what we propose to give them.  If they want to get rid of their food voucher, they will find somebody to take it from them at a price.  The food which we propose to give is as good a food as can be got.  Deputy Dillon mentioned margarine.  I think, from the information I had recently, that it is possible that margarine may not be available much longer, whether it be vitaminised margarine or not.  Margarine of all sorts is, I think, scarce at present, and will probably be nonexistent before long.</P>
    <P>One last word on the question of vouchers rather than cash.  While it is true, as Deputy Hickey said, that some of those thrifty women with families might be able&mdash;I am not agreeing that they would&mdash;to buy better value than we are giving them in the way of food, they may not be able to get it if the food is scarce, and that is the main point in my argument at this moment in favour of the food voucher instead of cash.</P>

      <P>That a sum not exceeding £1,018,215 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending 31st March, 1942, for Special Emergency Schemes (including Relief of Distress) and Sundry Grants-in-Aid.</P>

      <P>In addition to the ordinary work, under Vote 67, in connection with unemployment, relief of distress, and such additional work as the emergency may throw up for that particular purpose, the Government recently transferred to me responsibility for the production, distribution, and price of turf, and for all matters ancillary thereto, in the coordination of the activities of the different Government Departments which might be concerned in it, and that transfer included the control of <Col N="2045" /> the Turf Development Board, Ltd., for the duration of the emergency.  In pursuance of the latter decision, the necessary orders have been made for the transference from the Minister for Industry and Commerce to the Parliamentary Secretary of the necessary powers of that Minister in relation to turf, and the Dáil have already approved of a revised Estimate for the Department of Industry and Commerce which makes provision for the expenditure of the Turf Development Board in respect of the period from the 1st April, 1941, to the 12th June, 1941.  It is now necessary to make provision for the expenditure on turf production and distribution for the remainder of the financial year, together with provision for miscellaneous schemes, to provide employment or to meet distress arising from the emergency; and, in addition, to include various schemes which can only doubtfully be provided for out of the Employment Schemes Vote, because either they are not related to the relief of unemployment in the ordinary sense, or the relationship is of a remote and indirect character.</P>
      <P>Broadly speaking, the title of this Vote describes its purpose, it is an emergency Vote.  The first, or A Group, of sub-heads, refers to the expenses arising out of the operations of the Turf Development Board as from 13th June, 1941, the date up to which provision has already been made in the general Vote of the Department of Industry and Commerce.  Sub-heads A (1) to A (5) in the Estimate correspond to sub-heads L (1) to L (5) of that Vote; and sub-heads A (6) to A (8) are explained in Part III of the Estimate. The Dáil is already familiar with the history of the Turf Development Board, its policy and the nature of its operations; and it is only necessary for me now to say that the general policy will be continued as heretofore except to whatever extent changes may become necessary or desirable to meet the exigencies of the emergency fuel situation which at present confronts the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It might be well, however, if I refer more particularly to sub-head A (7), £35,800, and say that the Turf Development Board are now undertaking the <Col N="2046" /> drainage and preliminary development of 14 large turbary areas with a view to their subsequent utilisation for the production of machine-won turf on a large scale.  The drainage and preparation of these bogs are estimated to cost £228,900, and the work will cover a period of three years or more.  Owing to the amount of employment for unskilled labour provided in development work of this kind, it was at first intended that two-thirds of the cost should be borne by the Employment Schemes Vote, and provision for a first instalment was allocated out of the Estimate approved by the Dáil.  The House will remember that I mentioned this matter during the discussion on Vote 67 in May last.  It is now considered more fitting that the whole of the cost of the development works should be brought within the scope of the present Vote, and the sum previously allocated from the Employment Schemes Vote for the same purpose will now be made available for employment schemes of the more conventional type.</P>
    <P>The next sub-head is sub-head B&mdash; £250,000.  This provision is for the making of drains and roads and other necessary work to open up bogs for the production of hand-won turf during the emergency.  The work will be carried out through the Office of Public Works and the county surveyors; and grants will be made for individual drainage and road works on the certificate of responsible officials.  It was pointed out, at an early stage, that, in order to encourage development, even in the case of private persons and groups of persons, or in connection with bogs developed by the county councils and local authorities, where it was shown that development works of this kind were necessary and would, in fact, be directly effective in producing an amount of turf which would be commensurate with the cost, the charges would be largely borne by the Government. About £100,000 has been sanctioned this year already for schemes of this character; that is to say, bog roads and drainage and development, which are intended to produce saleable turf in 1941 and 1942.</P>
    <P>Sub-head C deals with Miscellaneous <Col N="2047" /> Fuel Production Schemes.  Portion of this provision is intended to encourage voluntary bodies in the production of emergency turf.  Repayable advances have already been made in a couple of cases.  Other portions are assigned to guarantee certain local authorities against loss incurred in turf schemes which they are undertaking and in which inexpert urban labour is being employed on an experimental basis.  I cannot, at this stage, inform the Dáil exactly what loss, if any, may be incurred by the Government in either of these two types of schemes, but the experiments are necessary in connection with plans for a much increased production of turf in the coming year. A certain contingency might arise in relation to loss in connection with the provision of firewood, and that also is covered in this.  The House will recognise that this is a contingency Vote, and that all sorts of things, which we do not know now, may come up to be dealt with.  This is an attempt by the Department of Finance to give a certain fluidity and flexibility to finance in relation to this emergency, so that, when things come up which cannot be dealt with in the ordinary way, and which may be a little bit unconventional or off the lines of common procedure, they can be dealt with on this line. That is largely, the spirit and purpose of this Vote.</P>
    <P>The next item is sub-head D.  This provision is necessary to pay the remainder of the grants in respect of last season's Farm Improvements Scheme and to enable the scheme to be continued for another season.  As Deputies are aware, the works carried out under the Farm Improvements Scheme cannot be closely related to the relief of unemployment in proportion to the needs of the areas in which the expenditure takes place.  When this scheme was first produced and financed out of the Employment Schemes Vote, I warned the House that that difficulty would arise and that, in all human probability, these schemes would be most common in the areas in which there was least unemployment and that, very often, it would be quite impossible to show a relation between their unemployment <Col N="2048" /> relief factor and the amount of money which was spent on them. These schemes are, in themselves, essentially desirable.  They are a very proper way in which the State may spend money in the encouragement of agriculture and in getting over a certain difficulty, and experience has shown that they cannot be brought into reasonable conformity with a normal distribution of money which is intended to go to people who are in necessity, in any proportion to their necessity.  For that reason, it was considered that money should come right out of the Employment Schemes Vote and come into this Vote.  Another of the purpose which was behind the creation of this Emergency Vote was the fact that we were continually running up against an experience of that kind in which works, which, in themselves, were desirable, and for which the only possible provision then for financing them was out of Vote 67, were almost border-line cases and, in many cases, wholly unjustifiable within that Vote.</P>
    <P>As to sub-heads E and F, with regard to seed and lime distribution&mdash;£55,000 and £40,000 respectively&mdash;provision for similar schemes has previously been made out of the Employment Schemes Vote but, as they cannot easily be related to the relief of unemployment, they are, like the Farm Improvements Scheme, being included in this Estimate. Broadly speaking, those moneys go to necessitous people, but you could not get the same degree of proportionality, nor the same degree of control over them that was necessary for a specifically Employment Schemes Vote. For that reason again, I think wisely, they have been transferred from that Vote to this one.  They have always in practice been administered by the Department of Agriculture.  They used to make an estimate of what they required.  We did not administer them, but we did satisfy ourselves that, broadly speaking, they went into areas and were used by people who should be helped in that particular way within the purpose of the State.</P>
    <P>As to sub-head G&mdash;Miscellaneous&mdash; the provision of £150,000 is intended to meet charges arising out of emergency <Col N="2049" /> measures and unforeseeable contingencies of whatever kind in all those cases in which such charges cannot appropriately be included in any of the normal Votes of the Department, as, for example, a sudden increase in the number of the unemployed requiring the provision of additional and special employment schemes.  I allude to that particular item in relation to it in order to explain that the sum of £150,000 does not limit the capacity of this Vote.  It will have to be extended as and when circumstances of emergency arise, to deal with whatever kind of emergency may arise.  As the House knows, a good deal of the work which we are now doing in my particular Department does cross the ordinary conventional lines of other Departments and, in so far as it has to be done hastily and rather energetically, it may have to violate in many ways the customary conventions under which State finance is guarded.</P>
    <P>Everyone who has had any experience of dealing with State finance knows the extraordinary number of securities, guards, and protections which are put on the expenditure, and the extraordinary and inevitable delay which occurs in the fulfilling of those particular precautions. Many a good cause undoubtedly has been broken by delays of that character which are inevitable within the system, and unless some degree of flexibility and fluidity could be introduced into State finance in dealing with emergency measures, then it was impossible and would be impossible that emergency measures would be carried out with the celerity and energy which would enable particular emergencies to be met as they arise.  I am giving notice to the Dáil that that is the spirit in which this Vote will have to be taken.  In relation to any Department whose border lines I, unfortunately, have to cross in regard to any of the unconventional things which I ask them to do under this Vote, I will be responsible.  If there is anything wrong, a mistake, or trouble of that kind, the trouble comes to me.  The purpose and spirit of this Vote is that it shall be an emergency <Col N="2050" /> Vote, that it shall fill gaps which cannot conventionally be filled in the ordinary way and that someone shall be here to take responsibility for any consequences of those unconventional actions.</P>
    <P>This Vote is accounted for, like the Employment Schemes Vote, by the Office of the Minister for Finance.  One of the chief objects of that is because this Vote, and Vote 67, which is so administered, will be so closely interrelated that it will be necessary in work of this kind that the closest possible co-operation should be maintained between the Department of Finance, which provides the money, and the officer who administers it; that there should be the closest possible co-operation, conference, and understanding in the spending of that money.  Most of the items in this Vote are familiar to this House.  We have the Farm Improvements Scheme, road works, and the rest.  What has happened is that we agreed to have a new Vote, one into which we can put things which previously were on the border line of justification within the Employment Schemes Vote and into which we can put claims and necessities which are of an emergency and, at the moment, incalculable character, and out of which we can get that fluid and flexible finance which will enable those to be done properly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>On the turf side of this proposal, there are a few things I should like to say.  The first is that I do not know why the particular bog represented by sub-heads A to A (5) should begin to move at this particular time.  I think it is particularly disastrous that it should begin to move in the direction of the Parliamentary Secretary and his work, because he has sufficient work on hand.  All this work has been dealt with up to the present by the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  Upwards of £500,000 have been spent in one way or another on that work over a number of years.  The Taoiseach, speaking early this year, recorded the great achievement that the annual output as the result of that was something like 78,000 tons, in a country where ordinary people without any <Col N="2051" /> of that expenditure are turning out about 3,000,000 tons.</P>
      <P>I suggest that one aspect of the new turf development plan shows a breakdown of the official machinery.  I am terribly sorry that the official machinery has got so loose that this particular bog is slipping over the lap of the Parliamentary Secretary.  It makes me ask whether, with all the energy and drive he has shown in the rest of the work under his control and direction, work on turf under sub-head A (1) to A (5), is going to go on in the same old way that it was carried on in the past.  I hope in the carrying on of the work he will be able to give some shape to the Turf Development Board that will get some useful service for present-day purposes out of it.  It is a great mistake that it should be hampered either with history or present-day details.  A scheme that after a year's work has only given 78,000 tons should be asked to get out of the way when the Parliamentary Secretary has to deal with 1,500,000 tons a year with other subsidiary bodies working there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we see what work is being done on turf I can understand how great are our fears that all the work will not keep Dublin supplied with fuel during the winter, if the coal situation is going to be as anticipated.  Our fears are based on fairly firm foundations when we see people unable to get coal, and unable to get turf, as the emergency supply brought to the city is not going to be released at the present time.  As all that increases our fears with regard to the winter we can understand why there is so much attention paid to turf.  Making allowances for what is provided in the Industry and Commerce Vote, we have here a sum of £940,000 not budgeted for up to the present, and we are asked to recollect that it will be spent on special emergency schemes.  It is rather remarkable that so much of this money is going into turf.  On looking at the Estimate I ask why we do not see a more constructive spirit in the approach to emergency schemes.  I do not know whether that is any part of the Parliamentary <Col N="2052" /> Secretary's responsibility, but under sub-head G if the situation is going to develop, and if we are going to be cut off from possible supplies, then with our industries affected, as they are likely to be, even more than our agriculture, we will be reduced to something analogous to subsistence fare, and a growing number of our people can only be promised subsistence. While they are being promised subsistence, and while arrangements are being made so that they are to subsist, if we are able to throw so much energy into turf, and able to put so much money into it, I cannot understand why some of that energy, some of that organisation, and some of that money is not thrown more directly into the productive side and the needs of agriculture.</P>
    <P>We have had a considerable amount of agricultural work done under the compulsory tillage scheme through the ordinary machinery.  Just as the county surveyors have been taken away to do constructive work in the provision of fuel, we have on the local bodies an even bigger machinery, expert agriculturists, both men and women, fully trained, who are in close touch with conditions in the country, and with the higher and technical aspects of agriculture and agricultural education.  If as much money as is being spent on turf were spent on increasing agricultural production on some of the larger farms held by the Land Commission, and some other farms that could be made available, if younger people, and even older people, were brought in a collective way to these farms for production and instructional purposes, and if we could have evidence of mass production, especially by younger people on selected farms under the direction of agricultural experts, we would be doing something not only in the way of increasing production to meet the present emergency, but to increase our agricultural standard, our technical outlook and vision for the future that would be absolutely necessary if we are to meet the post-war situation with better ordering and better production on the agricultural side.</P>
    <P>I intervened to ask why the turf <Col N="2053" /> position is going to be allowed to get so much out of perspective or, if it is so vitally necessary to provide for our fuel needs, why we cannot learn from the turf scheme to bring some imagination and some cutting away of red tape into what would be really as important as increased production there.  From a long-distance point of view, that would be important.  A scheme that would bring our young people together in emergency work and in an educational atmosphere under trained experts could not but have a very profound effect on the future outlook of our people, on the bettering of agricultural production, and on the better ordering and disposal of agricultural produce.  There is a big field, when discussing the sub-heads, to review the type of schemes we ought to have, and that we cannot afford to keep out of view.  I believe we can learn a lesson from the size, energy and drive of the turf scheme that could be applied to the assistance of our agriculture by technical people and utilised on larger farms, and that we could do a great deal in the present emergency that would be even more useful than the work on turf.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>No; I am merely trying to get that help and co-operation from the Deputy which I am quite sure he is anxious to give.  There was a clear case for additional production, wealth and resources being concentrated in the State.  I think it is correct to ask that any raw material which is represented by turf, and any idle labour which previously was here, and which would have to be maintained, should be converted into intrinsic value to increase the wealth of the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy will understand that it is much easier to talk in general terms than in particular terms.  It was possible to come down to the particular <Col N="2054" /> in relation to turf.  If he has any scheme in mind, not of a general order, which he would be prepared to apply, say, to any part of County Dublin or County Kildare or some definite social surrounding in an area in the west, and was prepared to put forward a scheme of that character, it would be a scheme which would be very definitely welcomed.  There is here a sum of £395,000 under the Farm Improvements Scheme.  That is an earnest and a declaration by the Government that they are, in principle, prepared to do that kind of thing.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>What I am saying to the Deputy is that the fact that the Government are prepared to give £395,000 in this way for the purpose of improving farming is a definite declaration that, in principle, they are in favour of that kind of thing.  The Deputy has in mind&mdash;I speak subject to correction&mdash;something in the nature of communal farming&mdash;that we should send a couple of hundred or a couple of thousand men down to till certain areas which are not being tilled, or to use them in some way in which they are not being used.  If he will put his suggestion in some definite form, I shall be grateful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>We are quite clear as to what we get from the bogs, when we send down men.  We get turf.  If we take some of the Land Commission farms, and send a couple of hundred young men and a couple of agricultural instructors down to them, they can plan out their farms.  They will raise wheat, barley, oats, potatoes or turnips. They will go in for some of the crops of which it is vitally important <Col N="2055" /> we should have seeds for coming seasons.  I think the agricultural instructors for County Dublin could sit down to a sheet of paper, and, in half an hour, select three or four of the Land Commission farms available at present, draft out a scheme, arrange to control them and see what type of boys would be available for them.  They might have to take some from urban districts, but it would be a valuable thing to do.  The Parliamentary Secretary will not find any greater difficulty in arranging what should come out of those farms, run in the manner I have suggested, than he would have in deciding on what should come out of a bog.  I do not think there is difficulty there at all.  The difficulty lies in getting the idea and in drawing some of our agricultural experts away from some of the present supervision, which is not necessary, and putting them to constructive work of this kind in such a way as would enable them to manage these communal farms.  I think there are sufficient on the hands of the Land Commission to get work started for next year and do some of the land preparation during the coming winter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary has made claims and admissions here to-day which, I am sure, he never would have made at any time during the last eight or nine years, were it not for the fact that the fuel position has been so badly handled by other members of the Government.  The value of turf development would never have been discovered as it has now been discovered, were it not that the people as a whole were assured by the Minister for Supplies that no coal will be made available for domestic use during the coming winter, or perhaps during the next year or two.  I am very glad to recognise that the Parliamentary Secretary is the first Minister, junior or otherwise, who has come to the House and exposed the fact that he has been able to persuade the Minister for Finance, with the consent of the moneylenders, to provide such a huge sum for turf development at a time when it was never more badly needed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary <Col N="2056" /> would like to admit&mdash;I am sure he admits it to himself&mdash;that if the moneylenders or the Minister for Finance had foreseen the present position, they would have been very glad to have provided last year, the previous year or in any of the past few years half the amount asked for in this Estimate for the making of bog roads and the draining of bogs.  If they had provided half the amount last year, it would be very much easier to get out much more turf from the bogs than it is at present, and I dare say there would be no necessity for the standstill order which the Parliamentary Secretary has issued in respect of the movement of turf from bog counties into cities like Dublin, where neither turf nor coal is available to certain classes of people at present.  The Parliamentary Secretary, I am sure, will be able to find a record number of files in his office to show that there is a grave necessity for the making of a large number of bog roads without any delay, and the recent examination of the condition of many bogs throughout the country will prove to him quite conclusively that there is an urgent necessity for setting aside a large sum of money for the drainage of bogs.</P>
    <P>In connection with bog drainage I should like to know whether the Parliamentary Secretary has a sufficient number of engineering experts at his disposal in the Board of Works for checking up on the work of the county surveyors and their assistants in regard to the order in which certain bogs should be drained.  A few cases have come to my notice&mdash;and I have sent them to the Parliamentary Secretary's Department&mdash;in which it is alleged that bogs with a limited supply of turf have been drained before other bogs in which there is a much greater quantity of better-class turf.  I cannot express an opinion on these assertions, but I should certainly be prepared to take the opinion of an engineering officer of the Board of Works on matters of that kind.  Has the Parliamentary Secretary at his disposal a sufficient number of engineering officers to check up the work of the county surveyors <Col N="2057" /> and their assistants in regard to assertions, or, if you like, allegations of that kind?  The Parliamentary Secretary has visited many of these bogs. If, by draining a bog, it were possible to get twenty spit, as they call it in the country, of good-class, hard turf, it would be far better to spend money on draining such a bog than on draining a bog which might be much nearer to a main road, but in which the class of turf would be far below the class we ought to be able to get to meet the coal shortage.  The average class of turf should be about two to one in relation to coal.  I am not sure whether the Parliamentary Secretary, from his recent experience, would bear out that statement.</P>

I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to spend as much as possible of the money at his disposal on the drainage of bogs in which good-class, hard turf can be got, as near as possible to the cities and the towns where it is badly needed.</P>

I have a holiday knowledge of the West of Ireland but I have a fairly good knowledge&mdash;a better knowledge than Deputy Dillon has, at any rate&mdash;of the type of turf that is to be found in places like Kildare, Laoighis, Offaly, and in the midland and some of the southern counties.</P>

I should, probably, take the other view and be glad to think that the turf would be taken over the longest haul possible, if I was thinking purely in terms of transport finance, but I think it is a question of getting the best possible turf as quickly as possible into the cities, and make room for more turf to be produced where so much has been produced already.</P>

      <P>Is it a fact that the price of turf produced on the Clonsast bog <Col N="2059" /> has been recently increased by 20 to 25 per cent. and, if so, will the Parliamentary Secretary give the reason for the increase?  I have reason to know, from documents I have before me, that the increase is not due to improvement in the conditions of the workers there. I do not know if the Parliamentary Secretary knows it, but I know that demands for improvement in the conditions of the workers on Clonsast bog have been repeatedly made to the Turf Development Board since April of last year.  I understand that the representatives of the workers concerned find it very difficult to get a talk with the principal members of the Turf Development Board in regard to claims of that kind.</P>
      <P>I do not want to go into the details of that matter but I would be glad to hear from the Parliamentary Secretary whether the Turf Development Board will still deal with the question of the wages and conditions of all those employed on State subsidised bogs, or will questions affecting the working conditions of those concerned be dealt with, under the new arrangement, by the Parliamentary Secretary or whatever official he may depute to represent him in matters of this kind?  This is not the place and this is not the time to go into this question in detail, but I would be glad to hear the Parliamentary Secretary say that he or somebody representing him on the Turf Development Board will be prepared to meet the representatives of the workers employed on Clonsast or some of the other bogs who believe that they have genuine grounds for grievance in regard to the failure of the proper authority to deal with requests for improvement in their working conditions.  I have a statement here from the representative of one of these groups of people&mdash;a man claiming to represent 5,000 organised workers&mdash;in which he says they are working about 75 hours a week.  A copy of the document has been sent to the Turf Development Board.</P>

      <P>£2 10s. 0d. for a 75-hour week&mdash;it is alleged.  The reply from the Secretary to the Turf Development Board is that there are no grounds for complaint at the present time.  It would pay the managing director or members of the Turf Development Board or the Parliamentary Secretary to hear what these people have to say in regard to these matters.  That is the only claim I am making at the present time.  The Parliamentary Secretary admitted that the moneys provided under this Vote for this very necessary purpose would not be administered in the usual red-tape way that is expected by the Minister for Finance or, presumably, by the Auditor-General.</P>
      <P>As far as I am personally concerned, I have every confidence that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance, in view of his past history and in view of the knowledge I have, and which most Deputies have, that he is a hard-headed, hard-hearted man in many respects, has the energy and the ability to do this very tough job.  I am sure, if he goes outside the usual red tape regulations laid down by the Department of Finance for the administration of moneys of this kind for this particular purpose, the House will bear with him and I believe will be able to support him in any action he may take outside the usual red tape regulations that in the past prevented the House, the Government, and the people of the country from getting moneys or such a sum of money as is provided in this Vote for this very deserving purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will the Parliamentary Secretary say, if it is pertinent to this discussion, whether he has at the moment any figures in his possession as to the quantity of turf that will be required for consumption in the City of Dublin during the coming winter or from now onwards, or whether it is a fact, for instance, that he will require to carry into the City of Dublin from the nearest or most convenient bogs where there is a surplus of turf anything between 1,000,000 and 1,500,000 tons of turf?  Is he satisfied that he has the detailed plan in his possession, or that it is in the course of preparation by the principal transport and carrying companies to enable him to say with some <Col N="2061" /> confidence that that job is likely to be fairly well done?  I am asking this question because the Taoiseach, when speaking on this matter here the other night, stated quite definitely that there would be a sufficiency of fuel in the country&mdash;and of food also&mdash;but that he was not satisfied that the transport companies would be able to do the job of bringing that food and fuel to the places where it is required.  That is a serious matter.  It is also serious from the point of view that if we have commercial lorries lying idle in garages or elsewhere in this country at the present time because there is not sufficient petrol to enable them to transport turf from bogs to cities and towns, it is a terrible pity, in my opinion, that fuel may be given to private car owners to carry them to hotels and golf clubs and other places to which they could very well and comfortably walk.</P>
    <P>I was walking past a certain golf club-house in County Dublin at about half past eleven last Saturday night and I saw a fleet of motor cars outside, probably waiting to bring home the people from some dance or other social function that was going on there.  If there are, as I believe there are, some commercial lorries out of action in this country at the present time because they cannot get petrol to enable them to carry turf from the bogs to the cities and towns, I say it is a damn shame that these private motor car owners should have petrol at their disposal for the purpose of bringing them to social functions, whether in the country or in the city. People who play golf for exercise should be well able and willing to walk to the golf clubs instead of using petrol to take them there in cars.  If they are short of fuel themselves or if they are thinking about others who are likely to be short of fuel during the coming winter, they should surrender the small quantity of petrol&mdash;even though it is a small quantity&mdash;available at the present time for private car owners.  I am not objecting to the private car owner getting petrol when he requires it for professional purposes. The number of such persons <Col N="2062" /> can be stated easily.  On the other hand, if the Parliamentary Secretary tells me that there is a sufficient supply of petrol for every commercial lorry owner willing to carry turf from the bogs to the cities and towns, I will say no more about the private car owners who are getting petrol to carry them to social functions in golf clubs and hotels, but I doubt if he can do that.</P>
    <P>I have received complaints about this.  I daresay that other Deputies have received complaints also.  I do not say that every complaint a Deputy receives is a genuine one.  I generally send these complaints, with a careful note, to the head of the Department concerned, so that it can be investigated properly, and I do not ask that any definite action be taken until I see the other side of the case as a result of the inquiry.  I have seen a number of motor cars outside places, in circumstances where the petrol has been used for purely pleasure-seeking purposes. That petrol should be used for other purposes under the existing circumstances, if what the Taoiseach said the other night is correct&mdash;that there is a shortage of transport.  I give the greatest possible encouragement to the Parliamentary Secretary to go ahead with the big job he has in hand, and I feel certain that he will do it as well as any member of the Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I would urge on Deputy Davin and others in whose minds doubts are raised by the sight of private cars, to bear in mind two things.  One is that the allocation of petrol to private cars represents a very small percentage of the total amount of petrol available.  While it is very understandable that one should resent the appearance of private cars going about private business if there were a shortage of transport, it is very easy to forget that if we put private cars off the roads we will close hundreds of garages and put out of work hundreds of garage workers.  Most of the small garages owners are married men with families, and are just managing to make ends meet pending the passage of the crisis.  It may be that we will get a few more loads of turf carried if we cut them off by one stroke of the <Col N="2063" /> pen, but we ought to ask ourselves very carefully whether the advantage to be gained by eliminating hundreds of independent citizens, earning a living in most difficult circumstances at the present time, should be exchanged for the gain that would accrue by taking private cars off the road.</P>

      <P>I have often said to this House that people are inclined sometimes to take dramatic action to achieve a certain purpose, and are inclined to do it without thinking of the position of the individual who is crushed by the action.  I remember the Taoiseach saying here that &ldquo;you cannot have omelettes without breaking eggs.&rdquo;  I think of the eggs: the Deputy is thinking of the omelettes; and the eggs represent neighbours of mine in Bal-laghaderreen&mdash;people who are keeping decent homes and who will be wiped out of business, put on the dole and thrown on the ashpit of unemployment. If I could keep these men going until the full volume of the trade they have painfully built up returns to them, I would be very happy to do it, even at the expense of some hardship. It is one evil against the other.  I do not deny that the situation may arise in which we might have to reconcile ourselves and to let the garages go.  I would be very slow to adopt that expedient, even though keeping them in existence involves very substantial sacrifices.  I would like the House to bear in mind that this is a situation in which we must weigh the alternative evils.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary has spoken to-day of wiping away red tape and getting things done in a very flexible manner and of avoiding many of the inevitable delays&mdash;as he describes them&mdash;attendant on the system under which we operate our public finances. I ask the House to remember that this nation has set up one constitutionally independent person&mdash;the Comptroller and Auditor-General&mdash;and that his function is to say to this House, which represents the people, at the end of each year, that the purposes for which <Col N="2064" /> the House appropriated the people's money have been served.  Remember that we appropriate millions of pounds here every year for all sorts of little schemes and sub-heads of one kind and another.  No one amongst us could go down to those sub-heads and satisfy himself that the public servants charged with the expenditure of the money have done their task; but the Comptroller and Auditor-General actually follows every independent penny piece and satisfies himself at the end of the financial year that every penny piece issued by the Exchequer was spent in accordance with our orders.  To ensure that, the system which the Parliamentary Secretary refers to has been built up.</P>
    <P>At first glance, there are great advantages manifest if you cut all the red tape and pursue a very much simpler procedure, but I think the Parliamentary Secretary would agree with me that, while in a period of acute crisis that course may be justified, it is human experience that, though you can do it properly, prudently and safely for one year or perhaps two, in the third year abuses will begin to manifest themselves, and in the twentieth year corruption will run riot.  It must be remembered that in the public service there are thousands of people handling public money.  If you give that army of 3,000 or 4,000 men and women the impression that there is really no supervision over the expenditure of such amounts, sooner or later you will get one weak person who is not as careful as he should be and if he gets away with it the corruption will spread through the whole service.  Then the magnificent traditions of the Civil Service of this country will prove unequal to the dangers that may arise, and in our desire to cut red tape we will destroy the traditions which it has taken generations to build up.</P>
    <P>Many Deputies forget the existence of the Comptroller and Auditor-General. His office is considered to be so important that he holds it, not from the Government but from the people. He is one of the few officers of the State whom the Government cannot dismiss.  Even Dáil Eireann cannot <Col N="2065" /> dismiss him: he has a protection superior to any judge on the High Court bench.  He has that because it is regarded as very vital that there should be somebody, absolutely immune to pressure from any direction, to guarantee to Oireachtas Eireann that the public money they have appropriated has been spent in accordance with the law.  Cut the red tape and you will completely cripple the Comptroller and Auditor-General.  I do not say that there is not red tape which should not be cut&mdash;I quite agree that there is&mdash; but if you cut it all you will completely cripple the Comptroller and Auditor-General.</P>
    <P>In that connection, I wish to draw attention to a particular feature of this Estimate.  A great deal of this money comes in the form of Grants-in-Aid. When the Public Accounts Committee of this House meets and proceeds to go through those amounts with the Comptroller and Auditor-General and the accounting officer of the Department concerned, the accounting officer will be asked if the £23,500 appropriated under sub-head A (3) was spent in accordance with the Oireachtas directions. The accounting officer will reply that, under sub-head A (3), he was told to pay out £23,500 to the Turf Development Board when they asked for it and that that is all the information he can give.  The moment that sum of £23,000 odd leaves the hand of the accounting officer, on the requisition of the Turf Development Board, the Comptroller and Auditor-General is completely barred from investigating how it is spent.  That may be, in the exceptional circumstances in which we find ourselves, a justifiable mode of procedure but, from long experience on the Public Accounts Committee, I want to warn the House that, if you are going to appropriate all the public money in that way, you will give rise to danger of the greatest possible evils to the public administration.  Nobody knows that better than the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance.  It is common knowledge that bureaucratic spending of public money is not a satisfactory method of expenditure. It means administrative expenses out of proportion to the amount of <Col N="2066" /> money spent.  If the alternative is to allow a system to develop in which corruption might run riot in the public service, that is a price far in excess of anything that ought to be paid for the convenience of spending public money in a flexible way.</P>
    <P>Much of the money to be voted under this Estimate is concerned with turf.  I recently paid a visit to the Parliamentary Secretary's bog at Clonsast. The courtesy and kindness of those responsible for the administration of the bog left me deeply in their debt.  I was afforded an opportunity of seeing the working of the machinery and the administration of the bog which I, certainly, found extremely interesting.  It struck me, as I was going through Clonsast bog and watching the operation of winning turf from it, that if the bogs on which we cut turf in County Mayo had had the development that Clonsast had before a sod came out of it, we would not know ourselves.  When I think of myself and my neighbours on the bog at Aughalusta draining all the water out of one drain, putting up a kind of shough to get it away from there, cutting down below the level and cutting the shough away to let the water away below us and then going up on the dry bank, where the water was, and trying to cut turf with water running to and fro and spending half our time up to our knees in water&mdash;when I think of that and then look at Clonsast, with ten miles of railway through the bog, with immense power lines all over the bog, with its main drains, 14 feet deep, running up the full length of the bog, each drain flanked on each side by a subsidiary drain running the whole five-mile length of the bog, and the main drain connected with a subsidiary by a subterranean drain up the whole five miles of the bog, I am forced to the opinion that, if they did that for us at Aughalusta, we would take out turf that would surprise the natives. Has that ever struck the Parliamentary Secretary?</P>
    <P>Is it not an odd thing that, for machines, we do preparatory development of that kind, whereas, if we cut a bog-drain for human beings, we think <Col N="2067" /> we have done wonders?  Why is it, if you take the long view, that Clonsast, which is expected to have a life of 25 years if the Electricity Supply Board development is proceeded with, should have this immense capital sum expended upon it when bogs on which people will be cutting turf for the next four generations are not considered suitable for similar development?  Is there any good reason for the distinction? Think of the bogs in the Rosses, in Donegal, where people will be cutting turf long after every Deputy here is dead, buried and forgotten.  Is it not odd that the people there should be expected to go through the servitude they have to go through to get the turf out when the mighty machine at Clonsast was not asked to revolve until every square inch of the bog had been prepared for it?  The reason, of course, is that the machine at Clonsast would not budge until that had been done for it, but the poor &ldquo;goms&rdquo; in the Rosses have to do so.  The machine at Clonsast struck work and said: &ldquo;Not a sod until there are drains, subsidiary drains and cross-subterranean drains; then I shall start going and produce turf.&rdquo; The Rosses man has to produce it while up to his middle in water.</P>
    <P>Sub-head A (7) refers to the preliminary development of other bogs by Grants-in-Aid to the Turf Development Board.  Is this for the preliminary development of bogs on which people will cut slean turf in the future?  Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary would answer that question?</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The main purpose is machine development, but it is quite possible that they will be cutting slean turf in the meantime.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary spoke to-day of work preparatory to cutting machine-won turf in three years' time.  That will bring us, probably, beyond the period of world crisis which besets us.  It should, certainly, bring us within the period when the crisis may well have passed.  I do not blame the Parliamentary Secretary for assuming that it would not have passed by then.  I think that it is wise to plan <Col N="2068" /> on the assumption that it will last, even if the forecast should prove to be incorrect. But when is the Turf Development Board going to give us its accounts?  When are we to learn, with certainly, what the cost of machine-won turf is?</P>
      <P>So far as Lullymore bog is concerned, I am prepared to accept the proposition that it is still in an experimental stage, that the production of turf briquettes is not an economic proposition, and that it is being pursued with a view to determining whether it ever can be so made.  If Clonsast bog is being operated on economic lines, it would be more advantageous if there were more machines available to work the bog to full capacity, but I think we should get costings in connection with the machines already working there which will show us what the price of turf from that bog will be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was a little puzzled by a point raised by Deputy Davin.  He said that he heard that the price of turf from Clonsast has recently been raised.  I have heard the same thing.  I heard that the price of turf from Clonsast had gone up from 15/- to 22/6 per ton. That does not correspond with the price quoted to us by the Minister for Industry and Commerce when defending the economic prospects of the Electricity Supply Board development there.  My recollection is that we were told by the Minister for Industry and Commerce that the figures then presented to us were based on 12/- turf. I understand that the turf at Clonsast is costing 22/6.  Can the Parliamentary Secretary tell us if 22/6 at the railhead at the bog represents a profit on the Clonsast bog and will the figure mentioned by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, when dealing with the Electricity Supply Board proposal, represent a sum at which Clonsast bog can continue to be operated?  Somebody ought to tell us some time, somehow, what this turf is to cost.  So far as I can find out, this is a particular piece of information which nobody seems to be very enthusiastic about communicating to his neighbour.  Since we are trustees for public money and are spending hundreds and thousands of pounds, we ought to know whether we <Col N="2069" /> are giving it by way of subsidy or by way of capital expenditure with a view to ultimate development or on what basis the Turf Development Board looks to this House for larger and larger sums with which to carry on the work they have undertaken.</P>
    <P>I want to be quite frank in saying that whatever the economics of Clonsast may be, whether it is going to turn out as a solvent enterprise or whether it can never produce turf without the aid of a subsidy, this much is true, that when you go on that bog you feel it is a big enterprise.  You feel that the men who are working on it have thrown themselves into it with enthusiasm and zeal which, if anything can make a success of it, ought to make a going to visit Clonsast bog will admit that the money that has been spent there has placed machinery and facilities at the disposal of men who are going, if at all possible, to make the enterprise a success.  If those who are at present labouring to make Clonsast what they believe it is capable of being made, fail to make it an economic enterprise, then I do not believe that anyone, no matter who he may be, can succeed in making it economic.</P>
    <P>Before we pass from that matter I want to direct the attention of the Parliamentary Secretary to another point.  Repeatedly for the last five or six years I have seen roads made into bogs without any ancillary drains. There is not the least use in making a road of that kind into the centre of a virgin bog.  It seems to me a horrible waste of money to drive a road right through a virgin bog and then walk away and leave it there.  If you make a road into a bog you should insist that the engineer who lays down the road will, at the same time, lay down a system of drains which in the judgement of competent authorities will make cuttable all the turf that that road is designed to serve.  Deputy Davin has spoken of cases where the more remote bogs provide a better quality of turf than those which are easily accessible. That is very often true, but a man cannot cut the bog properly until it is lockspitted.  The man who opens a <Col N="2070" /> bog this year, who has taken off the surface water and allowed the turf to sink and become compressed, feels that he ought to have the right to go on that bog the second year and the third year to get the really worth while turf, because in the first year he will have taken virtually none of the good turf.  He cannot go down to a sufficient depth to get the good turf, because if he goes down, firstly, his drains will close in on him and, secondly, he will extract the turf in a state of hydration far in excess of that at which turf should be extracted.</P>
    <P>If you take out a spit of turf which is virtually mud, when that turf is dry it will break to pieces or it will crumble away in your hand.  You have got to take out turf with a moisture content not above 90 per cent.  The best turf has a moisture content not above 82 per cent.  Therefore, as a man cannot get out the best turf in the first year, unless you give him some security that he will have the bank in subsequent years, you cannot expect him to carry out the necessary drainage or indeed to work the bog properly at all.  I would consequently suggest to Deputy Davin that if you are going to make a road through a virgin bog, you ought to ensure in the first place that the man who lays down the road would provide an adequate system of drainage and, secondly, that the bog will be lockspitted.</P>

      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary might learn from the experience <Col N="2071" /> of those who have practical knowledge of work on these bogs.  I reiterate that if you go into a virgin bog and if you attempt to take out the deeper spits in the first year, you are likely to get turf of a kind but you are not likely to get useful turf.  That is common knowledge to anybody who has every cut turf on these bogs.  The Parliamentary Secretary might walk warily in this matter.  The Turf Development Board one time made the mistake of ignoring the advice of men of experience with the result that they turned the bog into a black morass into which they cannot get for the next five years.</P>

      <P>I reiterate very definitely that the best quality turf cannot be got off virgin bog in the deeper spits and secondly that you will not get any man to drain virgin bog if you do not give him a guarantee that he will have the use of that bank in following years.  It is necessary to arrange in the first place to have the bog adequately drained and to ensure that it will be lockspitted.  The present situation is that large areas of virgin bog have to be acquired by the Land Commission before they can be distributed among turbary cutters. The Parliamentary Secretary ought to ensure that his inspectors and engineers will have the power which the Land Commission now appears to enjoy of not only allocating existing banks but of lockspitting the bog <i>de novo</i> in order to delineate the several divisions between various persons who will be cutting turf on that bog hereafter.</P>

However, his insolence and his disagreeableness on this occasion elicited a most valuable suggestion, <Col N="2073" /> which I do not expect him to understand but, if he takes a note of it and shows it to those who are more competent to evaluate it, he will find that he has something really valuable.</P>
      <P>Deputy Mulcahy said that unused areas of land in the possession of the Land Commission should be employed for the production of agricultural seed. That is a most valuable proposal.  It requires a certain amount of technical skill which the ordinary farmer will not find it easy to command.  Deputy Mulcahy suggests that agricultural instructors should be taken off their ordinary work and concentrated on the production of agricultural seeds for the coming year on those areas of land that are not at present being otherwise employed.  That is a most valuable suggestion and, if properly pursued, it will give us a security which otherwise we could not hope to enjoy. Many of these seeds require to be grown at a distance from analogous types of plants, lest cross-fertilisation should take place and the seeds rendered useless.  The skill necessary to carry out that operation is available to the trained inspectors and instructors in the Department of Agriculture and, if they are put to work upon it, I think that much valuable work can be done and valuable training imparted to the individuals they may employ in prosecuting the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Years ago I pointed out to the Parliamentary Secretary, when he was wasting a great deal of public money on the types of public works carried out in the early stages of the Fianna Fáil administration, that a very much better way of spending the money would be to make flag drains on small farmers' holdings.  After four or five years that advice sank in, and schemes along those lines are in operation.  I now suggest a further way in which money might be profitably spent.  He might secure the services of experts in the cutting and laying of hedges, and carry out, in any given area like a parish, a comprehensive system of laying hedges scientifically, which is an art almost unknown in this country, and the cleaning of shoughs&mdash;that is, drains which serve as the outflow for <Col N="2074" /> all the smaller drains designed to carry water off the surface of a small farm.</P>
    <P>It is only too frequently true, and indeed it was referred to by the Parliamentary Secretary when he was speaking of the Barrow Drainage Scheme, that the most elaborate drainage plan is rendered abortive by the failure of farmers to keep the shoughs on their own farms clean.  No matter how exhaustive a drainage scheme is, if the drains leading into it are not kept clean, half the value of the scheme is lost.  I believe there is a wide scope for the laying of hedges and the cleaning of shoughs in this country, both on the large and the small holdings, and if an example were given of a comprehensive scheme over a wide area in any given county where the work would be scientifically done, and where labourers would be trained in the laying of hedges, it would tend to create employment for these men, and you would secure a very material return for the persons on whose land the work would be done.  There is provision in the Vote for miscellaneous schemes. Has anybody got precise knowledge as to the value of the Clare phosphate deposits?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I submit that we are discussing the Parliamentary Secretary. <Col N="2077" /> I prophesy that within the next month the Parliamentary Secretary will find out and will know whether money may be profitably spent on the Clare phosphates. He ought to know that now, and ought to be in a position to tell the House about it.  We ought to have information with regard to the amount of Clare phosphates to be dealt with. We ought to know what amount of ground rock is available so that it may be made ready for distribution in time for next year's harvest.  All that ought to be attended to now.</P>
      <P>There is one other matter.  Somebody must be made responsible for the distribution of turf.  I understand the Parliamentary Secretary has been given exclusive jurisdiction over the production and distribution of fuel.  I do not know whether he has taken coal under his jurisdiction, but I, personally, think that he ought to.  Does the Parliamentary Secretary appreciate how necessary it is for a person who is occupying the position of fuel controller in this country to have something coherent to say to the tenement dweller referred to by Deputy Alfred Byrne to-day?  Suppose a poor person in the City of Dublin comes to you and says: &ldquo;Literally, I have food in the house, but I have no fuel wherewith to cook it,&rdquo; surely the Parliamentary Secretary must have some plan in his mind to meet that situation.  Nobody under-estimates his difficulty or loses sight of the fact that it is hard to winnow out the honest <i>bona fide</i> deserving case from the person who is not truly in acute difficulty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But surely it would be justifiable, even now before the full blast of the winter is upon us, to establish turf depots in this city and say: &ldquo;Very well, for anyone who chooses at this stage to go to the depot and take away his own fuel, fuel will be made available for him.&rdquo;  Apply that test merely to ensure that persons who are not in urgent need will not start accumulating fuel, because I cannot see a large part of the population going to such depots and carting turf away in small quantities for the purpose of storing it.  The Parliamentary Secretary might say, with perfect safety: &ldquo;If any room dweller, any person <Col N="2078" /> living in one room, finds himself in the position that he cannot get enough turf to keep the fire lighting for the day, he can go to one of the depots and get two stone or four stone of turf until such time as he can get such a supply as he would normally purchase.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I cannot see, in that situation, any considerable body of the population proceeding to hoard a considerable quantity of turf at the rate of two stone or four stone.  Even if people were inclined that way the most they would be able to accumulate in a month would be about 56 stone.  If we had that position, the Parliamentary Secretary would be able to say to me or to Deputy Hannigan or to Deputy Alfred Byrne that there was not one poor person in the City of Dublin who could not get fuel.  If anyone should come along and say that he had food but had not the wherewithal to cook it, then we would be in a position to say to such a person that the fuel was there for him if he was prepared to go and fetch it.  I submit that it is most important that the Executive should be in a position to say that.  I think it is a shocking thing that any member of the House should be in a position to get up and say truly that there are people in the City of Dublin who literally cannot get fuel wherewith to boil a can of water to make a cup of tea.  That was the statement made.  I know that when Deputy Alfred Byrne made that statement as a true statement it is a true statement, and, being true, it is a grave reflection on all of us.  It is a monstrous thing that a poor person in this city cannot get the fuel wherewith to light a fire.  I say there is a grave obligation on the Government to provide, at whatever the cost, a situation in which they can say that if people have not fuel it is their own fault: that the fuel is there if only they will go and fetch it.</P>
    <P>I think the Government could easily take steps to ensure that undeserving persons would not avail of the scheme to build up clandestinely a big hoard of turf to the detriment of deserving persons.  I am not so enthusiastic about this business of grants-in-aid.  It may be necessary, in times of extreme difficulty <Col N="2079" /> such as we are passing through, but let the House be on its guard lest we hand over the administration of public funds to extern bodies unless we combine with it the authority and the vigilance of the Comptroller and Auditor-General.  If we want the Comptroller and Auditor-General to function in connection with these matters, then we ought to give him authority to function.  If, on the other hand, we are determined to take that authority from him, we ought to do so coldly and deliberately by abolishing that office and trusting to God.  But, before we do so, we ought to remember this: that the United States of America tried to get on without a Comptroller and Auditor-General for many a long day, and, ultimately, out of their bitter experience, they instituted the office of Comptroller and Auditor-General. Let us learn from the experience of the United States of America, and realise that we have much to be grateful for in that the machinery of the office of the Comptroller and Auditor-General, handed over to us, is functioning efficiently ever since the State was founded.  If it were not for it the State might be very different from what it is.  At the present time let us be conscious that, in anything we do, it will not tend to the destruction of the office or of the officer&mdash;in my opinion two of the most important institutions this State has.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephHannigan" hpid="Dr. Hannigan Dr. Hannigan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hannigan</NameTxt>
      <P>The specific points that I am chiefly concerned with relate to the quality of the supply of turf that is coming to Dublin.  I have in mind the very unsatisfactory situation that has arisen in relation to a sample of a 1,000-ton consignment of turf allotted to the Grangegorman mental hospital.  In fairness, I must point out that the fuel situation in that institution, having regard to the difficult circumstances prevailing generally, is considered satisfactory other than in the case of turf.  For that reason I understand the Turf Development Board restricted supplies of turf to the institution to the extent that they could only get them from the County Wicklow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A sample of the turf from this 1,000-ton <Col N="2080" /> consignment was submitted to the board's officers in the ordinary way.  It was found almost impossible to ignite it.  Later, when it was submitted to an expert for analysis, it was found to contain, in addition to the ordinary volatile constituents, 58 per cent. of water.  The sum total of the analysis revealed that this sample of turf equalled in calorific value only one-third of a similar type of turf in a dry state.  I should point out, too, that the expert was of opinion that the turf was of good quality.  The disadvantages in relation to it arose purely and simply from its high water content.  I regard that as a very serious situation. Boards like that of the Grangegorman Mental Hospital are in a very good position to protect their interests by reason of the fact that they have experts at hand to advise them on such matters, but the position becomes rather serious when we consider the unprotected state in which the ordinary user of turf would be in regard to turf of that quality.  As far as I can gather from the general opinion expressed by various members of the board who purported to be <i>au fait</i> with the situation, if the turf in that condition was not accepted at the fixed price the probability was that they would have to do without it altogether, as it was necessary to take that consignment of turf in order to make room on the banks for other turf.  In view of the fact that the price of turf is fixed, would it not follow that in that case the public authority&mdash;of course a private user would be in no different position&mdash;was paying that price not for turf but for water?  Would the Parliamentary Secretary say whether or not he is in a position to state that there is no danger of such a situation becoming general, and that users of turf, who will include a very large number of people in the near future, will be protected from having to pay the fixed price for turf in the unprepared state of that supplied to the Grangegorman Mental Hospital?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary stated that certain sums have been set aside for the development of Clensast and other centres.  It <Col N="2081" /> strikes me that we are continuously allocating money for those centres, and that other areas, where the bulk of the hand-won turf is produced, are not getting due consideration.  I have in mind areas adjacent to Killorglin, County Kerry, where, in a five mile radius, I am informed that they have produced in this season 10,000 tons of turf.  There is no mention made of that and other larger areas in Portmagee, Kells and Killarney districts, where thousands of tons of turf are being produced, and there is urgent need for drainage and road making, while we are continuously allocating thousands of pounds to Clonsast and other areas which should be developed by now. Regarding Deputy Davin's statement, I think that, in regard to this question of Clonsast, unless we intend to embark on very large scale development we should at some time reach the stage when it would be self-supporting, and when they could get the maximum output without any further assistance.  I should like to make that suggestion to the Parliamentary Secretary; seeing that those centres have been liberally treated, he should direct the Turf Development Board to concentrate on the areas which are practically undeveloped.  I might say in passing that I have very little confidence in what any boards can do.  There must be some driving force.  The Turf Development Board certainly did good work in Kerry, but they lack the organising ability.  They lack the very thing we are now looking for, the real push, the real organisation necessary to bring matters to a head and reach the necessary output. I do not want to criticise them, but I think the system has outlived itself; we have reached a new phase now and we want to go ahead.  There is one matter to which I should like to refer, because it is descriptive of the whole thing. Recently, in Glenbeigh, County Kerry, the local surveyor was asked to develop an area which had been previously scheduled by the Turf Development Board as a turf-producing area, and where they had spent £800 on the construction of a road.  The local surveyor now says there is no turf there at all.  I should like to have that matter investigated in order to <Col N="2082" /> discover whether the surveyor is wrong, or whether the Turf Development Board did not know their work and made some mistake.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I merely mention it with a view to having the matter examined.  I should like to ask the Parliamentary Secretary if a system could be arranged whereby the Turf Development Board would deal only with certain areas.  I submit that, from the organisation point of view, they cannot deal with all the work which is allocated to them under these subheads. There is a reference here to &ldquo;grants to Turf Development Board for the preliminary development of certain bogs&rdquo;.  I should like to know what areas are specified, or what is the intention, because as far as I know the Turf Development Board have no organisation for dealing with that matter down in places like Kerry, where the Parliamentary Secretary himself could make a success of it; he could arrange with the local surveyors that those areas would be developed, and that a proper marketing system be provided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is something in the suggestion made by Deputy Dillon that turf should be transferred to central depôts for distribution in the cities and towns, but I admit that that is a difficult matter and would take some time to arrange.  I am putting forward those points not by way of criticism but in order to prevent such dissatisfaction as occurred in the case of the Turf Development Board some years ago.  We are sometimes blamed for being critical, but in being critical we are also being helpful.  I am not by any means trying to take away from what the Turf Development Board have done.  I admit that they have worked under great difficulties, but if we want to perfect our organisation we must refer to those matters <Col N="2083" /> with a view to facing up to the problems which confront us at the moment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary has invited suggestions and proposals from the House that might help to solve some of the various and varied problems that have been thrown up as a result of the emergency.  The Taoiseach, speaking last week on the Vote for his Department, dealt with the food and fuel position, and he informed the House that the biggest difficulty and the biggest problem that the country has to face at the present time is the question of conveying that food and fuel from where they are to the consumer; in other words, that the biggest problem is the distribution of the food and fuel that are available in the country at the present time.  Now, I think that that is a very difficult problem in view of the fact that we are limited in the amount of petrol that will be imported during this present year to about half our normal consumption, and when we talk about the distribution of turf we must appreciate the fact that it takes, approximately, two tons of turf to equal one ton of coal.  It must also be remembered, in connection with the distribution of coal in the past, that the coal was landed at the various ports around the country.  Those were the biggest consuming centres and the biggest centres of population, and that, in fact, reduced the problem of the distribution of that coal.  Even at the present time, if we had our fuel requirements in turf, the problem of the distribution of that turf would be far greater, and the cost of distributing it is a much bigger problem than the distribution of coal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have two suggestions to make in connection with this matter of distribution. The first is concerned with the use of our waterways.  I do not know whether there is very much in it, but I have been informed by a man who lived in Canada for some years and had experience of it, that prior to more modern methods of conveyance, the Canadians made great use of rafts for <Col N="2084" /> the conveyance of goods down the water-courses of Canada.  My suggestion is that it should be possible to make use of our waterways by rigging up rafts, at a reasonable cost, for the conveyance of the turf down these waterways from the bogs to Dublin and other centres.  I suggest that the matter, at least, is worth investigation.</P>
    <P>The other proposal that I wish to put and which, I think, is more attractive, is in connection with the fitting up of our lorries with gas-producers. I think there has not been sufficient attention given to this question of rigging up more of our lorries with gas-producers. I understand, from people who have given this matter some examination, that there is, approximately, sufficient material in this country to manufacture about 1,000 gas-producers.  Of course, it does not require a lot of skill to manufacture a gas-producers, and the experience we have gained during the past few months&mdash;or during the past year, I might say&mdash;since petrol really became scarce, has produced the result that, at the present time, gas-producers are functioning reasonably well.  Now, it will take about 18 tons of anthracite coal to run a gas-producer on, say, a five-ton lorry for 12 months.  Assuming that we have material to make 1,000 gas-producers and that we could rig up 1,000 lorries, the fuel consumption of those 1,000 lorries would be 18,000 tons of anthracite.  The output of anthracite in Castlecomer during the past year was 100,000, so that, approximately, to run 1,000 lorries would take one-fifth of the Castlecomer output.  I think that the number of lorries registered before the war was, approximately, 10,000, and so I suggest that at least one-tenth of our lorries could be fitted up immediately with gas-producers, and I am convinced that these gas-producers would function reasonably well.  As a matter of fact, we know that many European countries had a big percentage of their lorries running on gas-producers even prior to the war.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, no, but certainly it was working quite well.  At any rate, I think it is a matter for examination. We have the raw material there; it is cheap fuel, and I think we have, approximately, sufficient material to manufacture 1,000 gas-producers, and there is no reason why we should not have 1,000 lorries running on gas at the earliest possible moment.  Assuming that those lorries would handle six tons, or possibly more, on a long-distance run per day, to supply even the City of Dublin, that would mean 6,000 tons of turf per day.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, on two runs.  As Deputy Davin probably knows, turf is a very bulky article and you cannot get on more than about 3½ or 4 tons of it.  However, I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to have that matter examined.  I notice that, under sub-head F of this Vote, there is a provision of £40,000 for a lime distribution scheme.  I should be very sorry to see any of that Vote diverted to work on the phosphate deposits in Clare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Deputy rather have lime than phosphates?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>No, but I say that it is essential to have lime for distribution on sour or acid lands.  Land with <Col N="2086" /> a high degree of acidity is practically useless and infertile.  There may be any amount of plant food locked up in the soil, but because of the high degree of acidity present in the soil that plant food is not available.  The moment you apply an alkali to that acid condition you set up a reaction and the plant food becomes free.  Lime is not a plant food, in itself, but the moment you apply it to an acid soil you free the plant food that is lying dormant in the soil and it comes away and you are able to produce an excellent crop.</P>
      <P>It would be useless to apply artificial manure to that type of soil if the chemical conditions in the soil are not right otherwise, and you can only put these conditions right by the application to an acid soil of lime.  It is a problem that is peculiar to this country. In countries such as Holland you will get the same type of soil, without any variation whatever, stretching for 300 and 400 miles, whereas, in this country, you will find an alkali soil, an acid soil, and a neutral soil, in varying proportions, on the one farm and even in the one field.  It is a problem to which we have not given much attention, and, in my opinion, it certainly would repay any attention we might give it.  Therefore, to my mind, money spent on lime that is distributed on sour and acid soil is money very well spent.</P>
      <P>On the other matter that was raised by Deputy Mulcahy, I think, and I have suggested it before, that the methods we have adopted this year for raising farm seeds are not the best way of handling the situation, because there is undoubtedly a danger of cross-fertilisation, and it is occurring on some farms at present.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say a few words in connection with this Vote.  I personally am in favour of the expenditure of any sum of money necessary to ensure the speediest possible production of fuel, especially in view of the circumstances which now face us <Col N="2088" /> and the probability that, far from improving, these circumstances will probably deteriorate still further in the months ahead.  I should like to be sure that we are really putting the maximum amount of energy into and travelling at the maximum tempo in the winning of turf.  I represent a constituency which is probably one of the finest turf-producing counties, where there is an abundance of black turf, not merely black turf in the sense of describing turf as a coloured commodity, but black turf of a weighty kind which is infinitely better than turf which will turn black and still lose weight.  There is an abundance of turf there, but it seems to me that the amount of money put into its production is not nearly comparable with the potentialities of turf production in that county.  I know the county surveyor there has done everything in his power.  I know that he has moved with sympathy, expedition, and understanding in approaching the various problems in connection with turf production. But I still think that as a nation&mdash;and county surveyors and everybody else are part of that nation &mdash;we have not yet brought ourselves to realise the appalling position that will arise next winter or in the early part of next year if there is a shortage of fuel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I see the turf-production problem to-day, my grave fear is that we do not appear to realise what is really expected of us, and that as a consequence the maximum amount of energy is not being put into the production of turf. In recent weeks I have inspected many bogs in my constituency.  There was excellent black turf there awaiting the operation of the slean and manual labour, and yet it seemed to me that a goodly quantity of that turf would still be in the bogs next winter, although people in that county and in the cities and large towns would be crying out for fuel, which they could not themselves win, when the fuel is most needed.  I know the Parliamentary Secretary has plenty of ability to do this job.  While I disagree with certain economic theories of his, particularly in relation to wages, I do not question his ability to do this job.  But <Col N="2089" /> my fear is that he will be strangled in a forest of red tape and that governmental regulations will be an impediment to him and prevent his giving of his best in the production of the necessary quantity of turf for our requirements.</P>
    <P>One of the things that struck me recently from an examination of the activities on the bogs was that the spreading of turf was now reaching a stage where it was impeding the production of fresh turf.  It seems to me that, having cut the turf, some attention should be given to the question of getting it away from the bogs at the earliest possible moment so as to make room for a further harvest.  I saw large quantities of turf on bogs in certain areas, and it seemed to me that the continued depositing of the turf on the bogs would impede the production of further turf there, unless new banks were opened up or persons intended to exploit another area which was not nearly as accessible as the area which was being worked.  I got the impression that a good deal of the turf which had been raised there was sufficiently dry for removal, and should be on its way to Dublin or other large centres, so as to ensure that when it was required there would be a substantial quantity of turf stored in Dublin and other large areas.  I fear that if you wait for a long period before you begin the transportation of the turf, you will get the position so cluttered up that you will inevitably have disorganisation, no matter how well-intentioned you are in the matter of transport.</P>
    <P>I realise that an area like Kildare must of necessity provide for its own requirements, and must ensure that turf is available locally.  But I do not think there is any doubt about the ability of a county like Kildare, not merely to satisfy its own requirements, but to satisfy the requirements of a number of other areas as well.  I should like to see the transportation of turf undertaken at the earliest possible moment to the centres where it is required, because I fear that if the problem is deferred much further, you will have disorganisation which will hamper the best-intentioned plans.  I shudder to think what the position of <Col N="2090" /> tenement dwellers will be this winter unless we appreciate the peculiar position of this city.  It is true that the grates and fireplaces in tenements, and even in small working-class houses, in the city are not specially adapted for the combustion of turf, but, if there is no choice, I suppose these fireplaces could use that kind of fuel.  If Dublin is going to face a hard winter, and if the position of poor people is going to be rendered more difficult by a shortage of fuel, as well as high prices of food, to some extent we might try to neutralise these difficulties by providing some fuel, particularly where there are children.  It seems to me that Kildare is the natural link with Dublin for a supply of fuel.  I hope that any effort made to supply Dublin with turf will be towards getting it from the place nearest to Dublin, which seems to be Kildare.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">

      <P>Is the man power there to get turf?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The man power can be made available there, and I believe the turf got there eventually gives a five, ton per ton, that will last much longer than turf got elsewhere.  I saw a number of men working on a bog in County Louth on Friday last.  They were simply cutting the top of the bog, but even when they went down a certain distance, what they were getting was very white looking.  It was a type of bog that gave results that were no better than brown paper rolled up in lumps.  I wish these people could have been working in Kildare where they could get black turf.  I do not know if it would be possible to induce them to go to Kildare bogs to work. When talking to some of the sleansmen I said it was a pity that they were wasting their time cutting such turf. Their earnings were not very good and the finished article did not seem to be worth much.  Where people are operating on what seems to be useless bog. some effort might be made to induce them to transfer to areas where they could produce the best turf.  I think there would be a certain measure of success for a voluntary appeal of that kind, if it was recognised that these people would have to be treated fairly <Col N="2091" /> generously.  Expert sleansmen should not have to spend half a day draining water off a bog.  They would probably go to work on good bogs if they got a fair rate of wages.  I am not making a special case for Kildare or asking that it should have a monopoly of the Dublin market.  I would make the same case if there was any other place nearer Dublin.  I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to give more consideration to the question of transport, so as to avoid long hauls for turf.  It does not seem to be right to have to bring turf from Mayo or from Kerry merely because it can be got in these counties cheaper than in Kildare.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Nothing was further from my thoughts, but where there is a bog so close to Dublin, for which the provision of turf is so important, it seems to me that Kildare and perhaps Offaly should be a kind of fuel reservoir for Dublin.  In these areas it is very necessary to encourage the maximum production of turf.  I also wish to call the Parliamentary Secretary's attention to an advertisement that appeared in a newspaper recently in which a Dublin trader offered to buy turf on the bog at £1 per ton. I presume the trader is entitled to sell turf at 45/- per ton.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not going to dwell on that aspect of the case.  The production of turf is not child's play.  A trader in Dublin offered to purchase turf on the bog at £1 per ton, and presumably he is entitled to sell it at 45/- in ton lots, and at 48/- or 49/- per ton in smaller quantities.  Assuming he purchases a ton of turf in Kildare, and can sell it at 45/- in Dublin, it seems ironical that the man who produced the turf only gets £1 while the distributor gets 25/-.  That seems to be an unreasonable allocation, having regard to the energy expended.  I do not know if the Parliamentary Secretary has examined the matter in sufficient detail to know whether turf bought at £1 per ton in Kildare and sold at 45/- in Dublin gives a fair return.  It seems to me that the producer is not getting the best part of the bargain.  I sent the advertisement on to the Parliamentary Secretary and presumably he knows the case.  Some <Col N="2093" /> effort should be made to ensure that, if people produce turf a trader will not come in&mdash;and the trader in this case was a very extensive one&mdash;and by refusing to pay more than £1 per ton compel local people to sell it at that price.  If that position developed people would begin to ask themselves what use there was in producing turf, when they could only get £1 per ton for it. In a short time that would produce a prejudice against the production of turf.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy does not suggest that turf cannot be produced at a profit at £1 per ton?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not think that there would be a great margin of profit out of £1 a ton for turf produced in Kildare.  If expert turf cutters, and people with a turf tradition, are to produce turf at £1 a ton it ought to be distributed from Kildare much cheaper than £1 5s. a ton.  If it is possible to produce turf in Kildare at £1 per ton, what profit would a man have who brought down a lorry and loaded it and got £1 5s. for doing so?  If you examine the balance sheets of the turf producer and the distributor I would prefer the distributor's profit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is provision in the Estimate for roads, drainage, and other work in connection with turf production, and I assume that the money will be made available from the Central Fund to local authorities when schemes are submitted. I quite understand that there must be some reasonable check on schemes submitted, but I should like to know if it would be possible to give county surveyors, particularly where they have shown ability, prudence and expedition in handling schemes, within definite limits to proceed with the making of roads and drainage of bogs, where they are satisfied the work will increase turf production and will facilitate its removal.  It seems to me that there is quite a danger that, in a desire to exercise the utmost care in regard to expenditure on schemes of that kind, there may be inevitable and quite understandable delay at headquarters, which probably everybody would wish to avoid.  If I had to make a choice between trying to get 80 per cent. efficiency <Col N="2094" /> in administration, with the production of a lesser quantity of turf, and 60 per cent. efficiency, with a greater quantity of turf, I should be prepared to have a lesser degree of efficiency in administration, so long as we could get the turf we require, because the administrative difficulties will be very easy to liquidate if we can provide fuel for our people.  To tell our people next winter that there is not sufficient fuel available for them, but that the administrative machine worked perfectly, is not going to get much thanks from anyone associated with turf production.</P>
    <P>I have the view in connection with turf production that, in a way, it may be well that we are, to some extent, thrown on our own resources in respect of turf.  I agree that it is very important for us to import very substantial quantities of coal, if we are to have efficient industrial production, but, at the same time, I think there are considerable national possibilities in the winning of turf on a greater scale than that which we have experienced in recent years.  If, under this scheme of endeavouring to produce the fuel we require, we can inaugurate a scheme of extensive bog drainage, the making of bog roads, and cultivating a turf-mindedness in our people, I think that, in the long run, we shall probably be able to produce fuel from our bogs to replace the fuel we formerly imported, and in that way help to provide greater employment in rural areas which, in the past and in peace times, normally suffer the maximum amount of hardship caused by unemployment.  I wish the Parliamentary Secretary well in a particularly difficult task, and I hope that in his efforts to produce the maximum quantity of turf we require, he will not be afraid to make mistakes, if they are made in the good cause of winning the fuel which our own people very badly require.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I informed the Parliamentary Secretary that I represent a constituency in which there is a considerable amount of development in regard to turf carried on.  In County Wicklow, everything possible, I believe, has been done to develop turf to the fullest extent.  The amount of turf available in the county is not very large, but, through the energy and activity of the county surveyor and the various parish councils, and enormous amount of work has been done under very unsatisfactory conditions in many cases.  The turf, in many cases, has had to be obtained on mountains, and from bogs which have never been drained.  The county surveyor laboured under considerable difficulties in Wicklow, and also in Carlow, portion of which I represent as well.  In Carlow, there is practically no turf, but nevertheless, by an almost superhuman effort, the county surveyor managed to procure a small amount&mdash;probably almost sufficient to supply the needs of the local authorities&mdash;but in order to secure that turf, he had to canvass the various bog owners and obtain permission to go, in a small way, on the various bogs.  He had, of course, compulsory powers, but the banks available were so limited that it would not serve any useful purpose to use them. Nevertheless, he overcame the difficulties to a considerable extent and did the best he could in the circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My attention was drawn to the fact that there are several very extensive areas of bog in County Kildare which, in the opinion of those who spoke to me, were not being developed to the extent to which they should be developed, and it was for that reason that I asked the Parliamentary Secretary if he were satisfied that everything possible was being done in all counties.  The Parliamentary Secretary to-day has more or less explained the reason why the maximum amount has not been secured in Kildare, namely, shortage of man-power and shortage of accommodation.  These are very serious difficulties, I admit, but they are difficulties which ought to be tackled immediately in relation to the <Col N="2096" /> future, because Kildare is very centrally situated for supplying the needs of the city and the large towns.  So far as the present year is concerned, the first duty of the Parliamentary Secretary should be to ascertain the amount of turf required in our large consuming areas.  In addition, a thorough survey should be made of the amount of turf saved this year.  I think the Civic Guards could be relied on to supply most of that information. Further, a thorough survey should be made now of the amount of timber fuel available, so that if, in the event of a shortage or with a view to meeting a possible shortage, a certain amount of timber is converted into fuel, the Parliamentary Secretary will know the amount available in the various counties and, if it be necessary to supplement our other fuel supplies with timber, he will know exactly where to secure the best supplies and where a sufficient supply is easily procurable. That information should be collected at once.</P>
    <P>I believe that the nation, and the Parliamentary Secretary, perhaps, in particular, have been extremely fortunate this year inasmuch as the weather has been very favourable for turf production. There have been years when turf could have been dried much more quickly but, on the other hand, there has not been a heavy rainfall during the summer months, with the result that it has been possible to cut and save turf in many bogs where, in other years, it would have been extremely difficult, and we should express our gratitude to Divine Providence for having assisted us in that way.</P>
    <P>A reference was made to virgin bogs. I believe that there is a certain amount of truth both in what Deputy Dillon said and in what Deputy Flynn said. In certain cases it is absolutely impossible to get turf out of a virgin bog without having it previously drained.  In certain years it is impossible. There are certain types of bog where, by reason of the fact that they have not been drained or cannot be drained, it is not possible to get turf out of them in any year.  Of course, in certain circumstances, occasionally, turf can be procured in such <Col N="2097" /> bogs.  It just shows that in regard to this matter it is not right that anybody should attempt to dogmatise because there are so many varieties of bog and so many variations in climatic conditions that no definite rule can be fixed.  I have before my mind an incident which occured this year, in which the county surveyor for Carlow went into a bog which had not been used for many years.  Every experienced bog-man&mdash;and of course there were hundreds about&mdash;shook his head and said he would get the fright of his life, that he would probably be working many weeks and get nothing at all.  It so happened that the surveyor succeeded in procuring several thousand tons of excellent turf out of that bog, in spite of all the advice and criticism which was showered on him by the professional turf-cutters.  The reason, of course, was that the year was exceptionally favourable for that particular type of turf.  If it had been a wet year, the turf would have absolutely crumbled away or if it had been an exceptionally dry, sunny year, the turf would also have broken up. Therefore, he was fortunate that he could laugh at his critics although he was a mere amateur.  It shows how unwise it is for anybody to attempt to dogmatise in regard to turf production.</P>
    <P>I wish to warn the Parliamentary Secretary and his Department against being too confident in regard to future development because of any success which may have attended him in a particular area this year because we may not always have years as favourable as this one.  My main reason in intervening in this debate is to warn the Parliamentary Secretary of the desirability and the urgency of getting any turf that is dry removed as far away from the bog as possible at the earliest possible date.  This warning may seem unnecessary but there are cases in which turf may be clamped in a bog and it may not be definitely decided where that turf is to be sent.</P>
    <P>In that particular case there might be a delay about removing it.  Although it is undesirable to have too much rehandling of turf, there are certain bogs that I know in which it would be <Col N="2098" /> disastrous to leave the turf and where it would be better even to risk whatever loss would be involved in throwing it down in a certain place and having to reload rather than to risk loss by having the turf left completely in the bog in such a condition that it could not be removed.</P>
    <P>It has been remarked that the ordinary lorry will not convey more than three or four tons of turf at the outside.  I am wondering if it is not possible, by attaching trailers to these lorries, to increase their capacity.  If it is possible, it would be an enormous saving of fuel and of time, and would relieve very greatly the problem of transport.</P>
    <P>Another matter which has engaged much attention and which has involved a good deal of contention in many districts is the question of piece work.  Of course, in the type of bog that exists in Wicklow and Carlow, where the surface is very irregular and the amount of turf is very varied, it is absolutely impossible to have turf cut by piece-work, but I think that in bogs which are of a uniform character there should be no difficulty in applying piece rates, and I think it should work out satisfactorily both to the Parliamentary Secretary and to the workers.  There is always the alternative, which is found by local authorities to be advisable in some cases, the alternative of soliciting contracts for work.  I am not suggesting that the contract system should be substituted for direct labour, but it is always desirable to have several alternative methods of work and to compare production by the various methods so as to achieve the greatest measure of efficiency.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>My intervention will be very brief, but there are a few points I would like to mention to the Parliamentary Secretary because I think they are important.  Firstly, there are the turf counties where small farmers and people who have a good deal of turf accommodation have extended themselves and have cut a certain amount of turf over and above their usual amount of cutting and it is on their hands at the moment.  I have <Col N="2099" /> been asked if the county surveyor could be used as a kind of central purchasing agent for the purpose of storing turf.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Cogan has pointed out, if they have to take it home, as they must, if they cannot otherwise dispose of it, it will mean shifting it back to the gardens and possibly shifting it to the railway station later on.  The county council has a good deal of turf on hand and right beside it we have people who have turf for sale and who have not got private customers.  I think that the county council authority, which is working so very excellently, I must say, with the Parliamentary Secretary, should be depended upon to act in this matter and to buy the turf for the Government.  Those people who cut the turf were assured of a market. Now that they have the turf saved and clamped and fit for delivery there is nobody to deliver it to.  There is no doubt about it, turf will be required later on but the question is what are they going to do with it at the moment. I put it to the Parliamentary Secretary that he must set up some kind of organisation to deal with that particular matter.  If people have to take it home and rehandle it, there is serious loss in deterioration.  Something ought to be done in the way of authorising the county surveyors in the various counties to deal with this matter in the interests of the Government. I do not see any other way of dealing with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another matter to which I would like to call the attention of the Parliamentary Secretary.  I did not hear it referred to.  I feel that the cutting of turf this year is at an end. At least, there is great risk from this on.  From all appearances, the emergency will continue beyond this year, and we will have to go full steam ahead for next year.  I regard this Estimate as covering that, but to what extent it is going to be effective is quite another matter.  The main thing that is required in the West of Ireland is drainage, and while the Parliamentary Secretary and the county surveyors, jointly, have done very good work, generally speaking, they are hampered because many of the bogs in <Col N="2100" /> the West of Ireland, at least, lie along the banks of the rivers and the rivers are not drained and are not able to take the water from the bogs.</P>
    <P>It is a very big matter for the Parliamentary Secretary but we have a report from the Drainage Commission, and my attention&mdash;and I think possibly the attention of the Parliamentary Secretary&mdash;was drawn recently, by way of resolution from the Boyle Parish Council in the County Roscommon, to the fact that they cannot hope to get anything like the supply of turf from the bogs around Boyle until certain work is done on the Lough Arrow drainage which is held up at Lecarrow. They believe down there that if, possibly, £500 was spent there it would at least drain the bogs of two feet of water.  I have heard engineers discuss this and I have heard them being contradicted by the local people as to what the effect of it would be, but I mention it to the Parliamentary Secretary. We have such conditions all over the Suck, the Shannon, the Boyle River and all these rivers and our bogs are on a level.  The Drainage Commission has made certain recommendations. Possibly, some of them might be partially put into operation, because there is no use in making a drain around a bog and creating an outlet for the water unless you can get it away. That is the difficulty we are up against.</P>
    <P>When I was speaking here a couple of weeks ago I expressed my opinion that the transport problem ought to be tackled at once, that turf ought to be brought into Dublin at once and should be continually brought in because I feared congestion in the transport problem.  From what I am told by the county surveyor in Roscommon, who has done excellent work in this direction, I believe turf is being brought in at the moment and I am very glad that that is so.  Even if there were an abandonment of every other activity, the amount of transport that there is could not bring enough turf into Dublin in the specified time.  Whatever the risks may be, the turf transport into Dublin must be maintained from now on.  I rose, in the first place, to draw the Parliamentary Secretary's attention to the private turf owners, <Col N="2101" /> and I hope that he will think over the points I have put and find some remedy.  If the turf is not taken off these people's hands, they will have to take it home and they will lose a certain amount of it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGovern" hpid="Mr. McGovern Mr. McGovern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGovern</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to say a few words on this question before the Parliamentary Secretary replies.  I agree with the point made by some Deputies with regard to getting the turf, wherever the proper qualities can be had, at the point nearest to the city and so save transport.  In view of the Taoiseach's statement here, that the problem of transport was a really serious one, and that he believed there would be sufficient turf if it could be transported to the City of Dublin, everything should be done to secure the greatest amount of turf possible at the point where it can be transported most easily.  There may be difficulty about finding labour in Kildare, but there are other counties where I believe there is turf of a superior quality and an abundance of labour at the same time. That applies in West Cavan.  I do not say that it would be convenient, but at least it would be 100 miles nearer than Donegal, where there is a lot produced. I believe there is no better turf in Ireland than that in West Cavan, and it is fairly well served by a main road, though it is in a mountain district.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Most of this is virgin bog and that is one of the difficulties, but being mountain bog that is shallow, it requires very little drainage.  I was of the opinion that it would not be a success to get turf from virgin bog, until this year has proved otherwise, whether that is due to the good season or not. I am told that the Cavan County Council got very good turf in a virgin form. I know that there are hundreds, and perhaps thousands, of acres of the same class of bog, and it would be well worth while for the Parliamentary Secretary to consider the development of that bog.  There is no doubt about the quality.  If it cannot be done now, it should be drained for next year, as next year it may not be as good in some places, and this bog would be a safeguard against a bad season.  It would enable the Parliamentary Secretary to get turf which he could not expect <Col N="2102" /> elsewhere in unfavourable conditions.</P>
    <P>With regard to the drainage of bogs, I think that the Parliamentary Secretary is a bit lax&mdash;although a great deal of money is being voted&mdash;about relieving bogs by drainage, where a very small amount of money would be necessary. Two or three weeks ago I was asked to try for a small drainage grant for a place where there are 20 families getting turf, and where twice as many more could get turbary if the place were kept in fair condition, with the drains open.  Where there are 40 or 50 people, and it is every man's business in general to see that that is done, and no man's business in particular, the bog is not kept in good condition.  All they require is a lead, and they would be prepared to help.  I went to the Board of Works and made an offer, that these people would be prepared to do even more than half the work if they got a lead, and if the Board of Works put in a ganger and a few men.  It might cost £4,000 or £5,000, but that would not be much in comparison with the result. In the absence of anyone responsible to give a lead to these people, nothing has been done, though it may be the intention to go on with it.</P>
    <P>We must remember that drainage work can be done only at certain times of the year&mdash;when the water is low and when people are not too busy with other work.  When the harvest rush comes along, the men may not be able to co-operate with the Department as they would now.  For that reason, a matter like that should not be neglected or put on the long finger.  Where so little is involved and where so much can be saved and such important results achieved for a small outlay, it should not be neglected.  Not only could the 15 or 20 people who are getting turf in that bog secure it, but twice as many could get it next year.  Many others, who are growing potatoes and oats nearby, would be served by the same drain, and it might be worth 50 times what it would cost to clean it. The Parliamentary Secretary used to ask us to co-operate, and to point out schemes and show where he could spend money that would give the best results, but, unfortunately, I am afraid he does not co-operate when he finds <Col N="2103" /> people prepared to co-operate with him.  That is why I bring this matter to his notice.</P>
    <P>I notice that the burning of lime comes in on this Vote.  This is a very important industry.  Any class of moory land is wonderfully improved by lime.  There is a scheme in West Cavan &mdash;in all Cavan, but in West Cavan in particular&mdash;and the district is very suitable for lime burning; but some of the lime burners are held up at present as they have to apply for licences to purchase coal, and when they make the application they have to wait from week to week before it is granted.  I suppose that eventually licences will be granted, but there should not be this delay.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGovern" hpid="Mr. McGovern Mr. McGovern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGovern</NameTxt>
      <P>Very well.  If the Parliamentary Secretary has nothing to do with it, we cannot hold him responsible. It is important, however, and perhaps he would touch up the Department which is responsible.  I see a sum of £395,000 down here in connection with the Farm Improvements Scheme.  I believe that that is a valuable scheme but, like many other things, it moves too slowly.  It is not commenced in time and it is not stopped in time.  If these schemes are forced on people at a time when they want to be putting in or taking out their crops, they may do more harm than good.  Farmers in a certain district which I know were not able to <Col N="2104" /> get on with this work when the spring work commenced.  Extra crops had to be put in and they commenced their work early.  They did not neglect the crop for the sake of improvement work that could afford to wait.  They have to follow that up by the saving of the crop and the saving of turf, and they cannot complete the improvement work in time.</P>
      <P>I think the Parliamentary Secretary and the Minister for Agriculture, if he were here, would agree with their action in that respect.  It is important that they should not be pressed in connection with this Farm Improvements Scheme and that the time should be extended until the crops are all saved and it is convenient for them to resume this work.  As regards the scheme for completion next year, I suggest that it should commence on the 1st November, at latest, and let the farmers in their own time carry out the improvements.  It is not right that their men should be disemployed for the winter and that this work should come on in the spring when they are preparing for the ordinary farming operations.  I hope that these points will not be lost sight of but that the point referring to the Farm Improvements Scheme will be brought to the notice of the Minister responsible for its administration, so that the period will be extended in the case of farmers who made application in time but who did not get started on the work in time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I often think that if a debate goes on long enough it is not necessary for the man in charge to reply because, as a rule, nearly everything that has been raised is replied to by some other Deputy.  A good example of that is furnished by the complaint made by a couple of Deputies, including Deputy Norton, that the turf was not being removed off the bogs.  At the same time, we have the latest neophyte of that particular Party, Deputy Hannigan, complaining bitterly that the turf had been removed off the bogs too early.  We had Deputy Cogan crying out, in the interests of Wicklow, that they should be allowed to remove the turf off the bog when it was the turf which was removed from <Col N="2105" /> the bogs in Wicklow too early of which Deputy Hannigan was complaining. One is between the devil and deep blue sea.  You can remove turf too early or you can leave it until it is cured.  Assuming for the moment that the particular sod that was selected for the purpose of analysis was a correct, average sample of the whole consignment, it is clear that Grangegorman Asylum had turf which, by way of answer to Deputy Cogan and Deputy Norton, had been removed too early. In these cases, you find that the best is always the enemy of the good.  You cannot always do what you want to do. At the present moment, there is not a great deal of turf ready.  Turf began to come forward, at the earliest, at the beginning of this month.  Those were exceptional samples.  It is beginning to come forward in a steady stream and it ought to be coming forward at the rate of from 80,000 to 100,000 tons a week at the end of this month.  But the amount of actually finished turf in the country ready to be shifted is not great and I think that that amount is being shifted.</P>
      <P>Our task is not to ascertain the amount of turf that Dublin is entitled to have.  That seems to be an obsession&mdash;that Dublin is entitled to lay down a regulation requiring so much turf and that Dublin must get that amount.  When it is not there, Dublin cannot get it.  What has happened up to the present is that the turf areas have sacrificed the whole of their right to domestic coal for the benefit of the eastern counties.  In return, they have been told that if they will, by their own energy, produce the amount of turf that will give them fuel, they will have left them a reasonable supply of fuel for the winter. There is no machinery by which more than that could be taken from them. This is not turf which is, in the main, produced by hundreds and thousands of tons from factories.  It is being produced by 30,000, 40,000 or 50,000 separate producers all over the country and it is being produced by a series of county councils which have a duty to their own counties.  The House has to recognise that these responsibilities will have to be met.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2106" /> Once we know what the actual position is, we shall estimate how much turf is available for the non-turf producing areas to supplement the whole of the domestic coal which is segregated for these areas.  Then, that turf has to be divided up and got in reasonable proportions to these districts.  That is going to be done and the whole of the transport system, so far as it is available, will be used for that purpose.  So far as I know, everything that it is possible to do now is being done.  I have a county in mind which has not got sufficient turf for its own requirements, although it is scheduled as a turf county.  Yet, the people in that county are hungrily looking for licences to get the turf out of the county because they think it may command a good price in some neighbouring district.  I know cases of contiguous counties which could feed each other and make that position balance and the tendency is not to do so.  The licence they are asking for is not to transfer the turf to the neighbouring county that wants it, but to transfer it out of the turf area into the coal area for the sake of price. Deputies will all hear of cases of grievances of that kind.</P>
    <P>As I have told the House before, it is my business to be an honest broker and to find out as fairly as I can what is intended to be done with the turf. If the transfer of that turf is in the national interest and in the social interest, then that turf is moving now and will continue to move, but to the extent that in my opinion it is not in the social interest or it is not in the national interest, I am not going to move that turf at all.  The present intention is to shift surplus turf into the eastern areas, into the boroughs and places of that kind to be kept until such time as real necessity arises. Whatever necessity there may be now, it cannot possibly be as acute as it will be later, and I think that it is not merely my own policy in the matter, but clearly it is the sense of the House that it is our business, to accumulate that stuff and to hold it until such time as acute necessity arises.  The transport system of the country will carry a good deal <Col N="2107" /> of stuff, but it will not carry in any one week or in any one month the amount of fuel which will be required in these eastern districts in that particular week or in that particular month.  Therefore, if we are going to stave off the real acute difficulties of November, December, January and February, it means that we must put in during these months turf which we will not consume now.</P>
    <P>The next thing you have got to face is that turf and coal are not only going to be burned over the country during those months; they will be required right through the year.  Some people seem to have the idea that this is a sort of harvest to be reaped and brought into barns in a few weeks.  It is physically impossible to do anything of the kind.  It is going to be a question of a long series of months' steady and unbroken organisation, of an unbreakable organisation of transport. The stuff can only leak through&mdash;I am using that phrase deliberately.  Compared to the amount of stuff that has to be moved and the maximum necessity with which we may have to deal, it can only leak through.  A figure of 1,500,000 tons has been mentioned for Dublin.</P>
    <P>No man who has any knowledge of the transport problem suggests that 1,500,000 tons can be brought over the present system within the time required. Then it is suggested that we should pick up all the lorries there are and shift it with them.  Again, we have to make a proper and provident use of the petrol and the stuff we have.  In my opinion, that is being done.  We do not know the whole of the problem by any means.  It is only within the last two or three weeks that the picture of production and consumption has begun to emerge.  I have a fairly good idea of where the turf is and I am beginning to have an idea of how much of it I shall have to leave there.  As soon as the whole picture comes out, we shall know where we stand.  In the meantime we are moving everything we can, because we know that the maximum movement will not be more than sufficient, to put it in the most optimistic way.  For that reason, we have no hesitation in shifting the stuff <Col N="2108" /> as early as we can, but the Government's guarantee was not to buy everybody's turf at once.  The Government's guarantee was not to the man who had turf first saved or who had it in the condition in which he was prepared to let it go off the bog whenever he could get whatever fancy prices were available for a quick market. The Government have guaranteed to provide a market at reasonable prices for all merchantable turf which is being produced this year.  That guarantee will be taken up and that is quite sufficient for anybody.  It is a better guarantee than has ever been given before in relation to a matter of this kind by anybody.</P>
    <P>Deputy Norton raised a very sensible question when he said that while there had been an energetic attempt to work the bogs in Kildare by local officers, they had in fact failed to produce the goods.  There is a huge area of bog in Kildare, quite good bog, but the total amount of labour which was available was somewhere about 400 or 500 men, as against 4,000 in Donegal, and the men in Donegal probably were cutting twice as much per man per day.  Our difficulty at the present moment is that we have big quantities of turf in the remote areas.  It would be excellent if they were near Dublin, but I have got to face the facts; that is where they are and that is where it has got to be shifted from.  There are only two possible ways to develop turf production nearer Dublin.  That is by sending urban labour on to the bogs or bringing labour from Donegal or Mayo to cut turf in the bogs in Kildare.</P>
    <P>That raises problems both of transport and of accommodation which are very difficult problems to face.  I do not pretend for a moment that it is a simple problem.  I do not know at the present moment with even a 50 per cent. degree of certainly, if I can get the mere physical material with which to build the accommodation which is required for them.  That problem has to be investigated and will be dealt with to the best of our ability.</P>
    <P>Deputy Norton said that somebody had been buying turf in Kildare at £1 per ton and that the fixed price in Dublin was 45/-, so that he was making 25/- a ton.  What evidence has Deputy <Col N="2109" /> Norton that that stuff was sold in Dublin?  That turf cannot come into Dublin without a licence.  There is no intention that turf will come into Dublin to be sold at an exorbitant price.  There is nothing in the world to prevent anybody going down to turf-producing districts, offering a price for turf, and selling it in the turf-producing districts, but the surplus stuff which is going out, goes out on licence and we shall know where it is going and why it is going.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon in one of his usual speeches in which he objected even to my drinking water, said that I was out to abolish the Comptroller and Auditor-General. All I can say to that is that it is the usual sort of cod.  What we are out to do is to get rid of unnecessary delays, and everything that is in this Vote will go before the Comptroller and Auditor-General in exactly the same way as our Votes have always gone.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hughes raised quite a good point.  He said the difficulty was that our fuel consisted of coal which was landed at the principal points of consumption and only a very small part of the total imports had to drift over the transport system into other places.  The result of our first year's effort has been to produce practically the whole of the surplus turf in areas which are the furthest possible points from the points of previous high coal consumption.  If it were the other way about, perhaps it would be very much better.  Take the ordinary consumption of fuel coming into a place like Dublin.  The storage requires to be the minimum, because the incomings and outgoings were normally the same.  There was an absolutely continuous flow of fuel in and fuel out and the result was that the storage capacity did not happen to be even one-twentieth of the total consumption.</P>
    <P>In the case of turf, we will not be able to supply it at the rate at which it is consumed in the high consumption months.  It has to be accumulated and stored to a very considerable extent.  It has to be stored in what would represent, at one particular moment, very considerable proportions.  It would occupy a space three or four times as much as coal for the same calorific <Col N="2110" /> value.  The storage problem in relation to turf in the eastern area is relatively appalling.  It is not going to be possible to store under cover the amount of turf which will require to be stored.  Reckless improvisation will have to be made.  Even if we filled the Dáil Chamber, and did reckless things of that kind, we still would not be able to get sufficient accommodation for turf. That is one of the problems we have to face.  We are not complaining about it. We are simply stating that those are the facts, and we must do our best to meet the situation.</P>
    <P>The question of gas-producers on lorries has been taken up, and is being actively pursued, both in relation to finding an alternative fuel to turf&mdash;on which I am not completely hopeless at the moment, though there was not much hope of doing anything this year &mdash;and also from the point of view of the use of anthracite.  There is definitely a shortage of the amount of material which could be used.  Every piece of material we want is needed for some other purpose.  The Minister for Supplies, when he is asked to provide X tons of some particular material, has to choose between its various uses.  I had my eye on some material for the purpose of providing accommodation in Kildare or some other place for western turf-cutters next year, and I find I am fourth down the list of competitors who want to get possession of that material.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mulcahy wanted a constructive approach to a general scheme.  I invite him, in relation to the proposal he made of an extension of the activities on the agricultural side, to come down to brass tacks and give us a scheme which he thinks might be worked.  Any proposal of that kind will be treated very sympathetically, but it is not the faintest use for the least agriculturally-minded man in the country to pretend to express an opinion along the lines of some general idea that money should be spent on agriculture.  The Minister for Agriculture is actually spending £395,000 under this Vote on the way he thinks best.  There is money spent on lime, the reclamation of land and compulsory tillage.</P>
    <P>The Minister's technical advisers <Col N="2111" /> have not missed anything which is obvious in the matter of using money for the purpose of agriculture.  Any scheme put forward to me would have to be vetted by that Department before it was considered from the point of view of a Vote of this kind.  There would be nothing that would give greater joy to the Minister for Finance than to find a scheme for the use of money in agriculture which would definitely and demonstrably give a productive return commensurate with the increase.  That is a problem that I would be glad to see Deputy Mulcahy or anybody else tackle.  I said that I would sit at the Deputy's feet and learn with very great pleasure and very great gratitude.</P>
    <P>Deputy Davin said the value of turf was not discovered until this year.  It is an amazing thing that, in some ways, it was not.  It was practically impossible to sell turf up to December, 1940.  Everybody thought there was something wrong with it.  As regards the turf sold by the Turf Development Board from Clonsast, more than three-quarters of it was sold in the two or three months after December.  You could not get people to believe that turf was worth burning.  It is amazing the conversion that has taken place within the last few months.  Everybody now believes that it is worth burning.  In the eastern areas, where the people are accustomed to coal, turf is an absolutely new discovery.</P>

The suggestion was made that we should have spent, in the last four or five years on all the bog roads in areas in which no one was prepared to produce or buy turf, the money which we now know to be desirable because everybody wants it.  It is the easiest thing in the world for the whole of us to be wise after the event.  At the present moment, in relation to the money which is required for the purpose of producing turf, in a quantity commensurate with its cost, in 1941 and 1942, there is no difficulty in getting the money.  I have lists here of the different counties in which it has gone out.  Nearly £100,000 has gone out altogether.  There has been no delay or difficulty of any kind.  As I told the House before, I am not going to go into the case of a particular bog road and express an opinion on it. To do that would be to interfere with the sense of responsibility of those who are charged with that duty.  What I have done is this: I have examined a dozen or so typical roads and I am satisfied, from my knowledge of them and of the circumstances, that the treatment of those particular roads is right.  That makes case law for the other things that are done, or that are going to be done, in the same spirit of fairness, with the idea of getting production and a total disregard of any special pressure of any kind.  Certainly the last place to put pressure on is here.  My opinion is that, at the present moment, the thing is being fairly and expeditiously done and I am satisfied that will continue to be so. These, I think, exhaust the matters that were raised on this Vote.  As Deputies know, it is an emergency Vote.  It covers a variety of things. We must only do our best to meet new emergencies and new difficulties as they arise.</P>

      <P>That, towards making good the Supply granted for the Service of the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1942, the sum of £24,420,829 be granted out of the Central Fund</P>
      <P>This is what is officially known as the Ways and Means Resolution.  It is complementary to the individual Supply Resolutions which have already been agreed to by the Dáil.  It is a necessary step in the process of making money available out of the Central Fund to meet the supply granted by the Dáil for the present financial year.  The Central Fund Act, 1941, which was founded on a similar Ways and Means Resolution, authorised the issue out of the Central Fund, for the Service of the current year, of a sum of £12,350,000&mdash; the amount of the Vote on Account. The sum of £24,420,829, mentioned in the present Resolution, represents the balance of the amounts granted by the Dáil for the several Supply Services for the current financial year; and, when that Resolution and the Ways and Means Resolution in connection with the Excess Votes for 1939-40 in respect of Old Age Pensions and Gaeltacht Services have been agreed to, the Appropriation Bill will be introduced.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to oppose the final passage of this Bill, because I believe it is based on bad advice, bad information and on wrong conclusions, and that it contains principles which have never been applied to any other section of the community since the Constitution was passed.  At no stage in the discussions on the Bill did the Minister attempt to make the case for it that it was of urgent public importance, or attempt to justify the statements he made that it was brought in by the Government for the purpose of organising the trade unions of the country on modern lines.  The Minister quoted from documents issued by the Trade Union Congress in 1935 and 1936 to show there was a strong feeling for it.  I admit there was a strong feeling inside the trade union movement that the number of unions was unnecessarily large, and that certain friction had arisen at the time, due to the competition and jealousy which existed principally among the smaller unions that were affiliated&mdash;and some that were not &mdash;with the Irish Trade Union Congress. I suggest that the conditions that existed in 1935 and 1936 do not exist today and have not existed to any extent since the emergency arose here.  There is no justification, as far as I can see, for the introduction and passage of a measure of this kind, especially at a time when national unity was never more necessary in the country.  Its introduction has created more disunity <Col N="2115" /> amongst the working-class people of the country than any other measure, that I know of, introduced here since the Dáil was established.  Can the Minister even now tell the House, and the country through the House, the number of strikes that have taken place during the past 12 months, because that appears to be his main reason for the hurried passage of this Bill through the House?  So far as I know there has been no strike of any importance during the last 12 months in which any large section of workers in the country has been involved.</P>
      <P>Out of 500,000 wage earners in this country only 10,000, according to the figures given by the Minister, have received any increases in their rates of remuneration since the emergency. Would the Minister tell us the figure by which the workers' wages were increased during that particular period?  Of course he quoted cases to show where workers in the cement industry had received increases of about 11/- a week, but he did not tell us of the cases where hundreds of thousands of workers, organised and unorganised, had received no increases whatever in their rates of wages or remuneration during that period.  I speak with some knowledge&mdash;perhaps not with all the knowledge that the Minister has at his disposal&mdash;in regard to the activities of trade unions over a period of 34 or 35 years.  I know of no time during that period when the organised workers of this country were lying down like lambs as they have been doing during the past 12 months; there were many cases where the organised workers, through their representatives, made demands for increased rates of wages, but did not pursue them, and I know of no case of any importance where they were pursued to the extent of causing a strike.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main reason given by the Minister for the introduction of this measure was the loss of working days involved by strikes which it was alleged had been brought about as a result of jealousy between trade unions and union officials.  I stated at one time during the proceedings here that this <Col N="2116" /> Bill was inspired and was being pressed on the Minister by the bad employers of this country. Deputy Mulcahy rather resented that suggestion, but I made that statement on the strength of the information which I had received from reading the official journal issued by the different employers' organisations of this country over the past year or two. Since I made that statement I find that the journal which purports to speak for the Federation of Irish Industries has published a stronger article than it had ever previously issued in connection with the contents of this measure.  I think it is no harm that the contents of that article, or of portion of it at any rate, should be put on the records of this House in justification for the statement which I made at that particular time.  The Federation of Irish Industries is a big organisation of employers, consisting mainly of the leaders in our new industries, but consisting of many men who are not Irish nationals.</P>
    <P>We had statements made here in this House by the Minister, and I think it was rather unfortunate that they were made, about the power of British-born trade union officials over their Irish members, but there was not a word about the power&mdash;and it is far greater, as far as I know&mdash;of the British-born leaders and managers of many of our industrial concerns here, whose views are expressed, and I think very properly expressed, in the article which appeared in <i>Irish Industry</i> for the month of July.  I want to say this to Deputy Mulcahy, that I know a number of decent-minded, good employers, men associated with the Federation of Irish Industries, who would not say that the views expressed in this article are their views, and who would not stand for the policy contained in this Bill, which apparently has the good-will of the leader writer in this paper.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>Here is what it says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;We have indicated quite clearly that we have one fault to find with the Trade Union Bill&mdash;it does not go far enough to remove the admitted and glaring evils which made its introduction necessary.  Nevertheless, it is a step, if only a step, in the right direction, and for that the Minister for Industry and Commerce deserves all the support possible.  He is all the more deserving of support and congratulations because of the manner in which that Bill is being opposed, because of the unnatural combination of voices raised in opposition to it.  In all that combination there was not even one to put forward an alternative constructive proposal by which the admitted evils could be remedied.  The Opposition is all vague, woolly, destructive&mdash; devoid of even one constructive proposal.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Mind you, the editor is wrong there, because the Minister has already brought in 35 amendments to the Bill, and the writer of this article did not know that.  The article goes on:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;It is admitted that the organised workers need a little `tidying up'; it is admitted that the trade union movement itself failed to do that, and it was pointed out long since that unless trade unionists put their own house in order it would be done for them.  It is being done and they do not like or approve the process.  It had to be done and the <Col N="2118" /> Minister who is doing it is accused of being a Fascist or on the way to be one.  We wonder whether it is the Minister or his accusers are tarred with the brush of Fascism. We have seen an usherette in Dublin denied the right to earn her livelihood unless she did it in the way and manner dictated by a labour union.  She had no fault to find with her wages or conditions of employment, but yet she was forced to walk out on the street or her employer be forced to close his business. That was done by a labour union.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The union is not mentioned, and the period is not mentioned either.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We have seen business premises picketed to compel the staff to join a union.  That staff enjoyed better, or as good, wages as were laid down by the union and their working conditions were better than those postulated by the union.  There was thus no cause of complaint against the firm, but yet it was picketed to compel the firm and its staff to adopt a line of conduct they saw no necessity for or no intelligible reason to adopt. We have seen lorries burned on the streets of Dublin&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>the Minister has seen that too&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;we have seen the loads which these lorries carried destroyed in order to compel compliance with the demands of a trade union or members of a trade union.  If all that is not a Fascist or dictatorial procedure we do not know the meaning of the word.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was not always done by trade unionists, or not on the instructions of their trade union officials, at any rate.  The article continues:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Then we have the unedifying spectacle of the Fine Gael Party, with two or three exceptions, joining that baiting of a Minister because he has made an attempt, even a small attempt, to stamp out that terrorism which is eating into the vital life of the country.  That Party likes to pose as the guardian and defender of the business and commercial elements of the community, <Col N="2119" /> and their interest in defending these elements is shown by their attitude on that Trade Union Bill.  That attitude is determined by the rules of the dirty game, politics.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Of course, the Minister is not a politician.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;As a Party they hope to gather a few votes at the next election, and for the purpose of catching these problematical votes the Party is ready to pander to the perpetuation of the undoubted existing evils of the trades union movement.  That Party is ready to sell the interests of the people for whom they have always liked to pose as defenders.  It is by no means the first occasion on which that Party, or members of it, have followed a similar line with little advantage to themselves.  That Party was responsible for tearing the 1932 Control of Manufactures Act to pieces and we are not aware that such conduct availed them much as a Party.  Then another member of it went around for months with a magnifying-glass and a pointer dog searching for `back-room factories' in Dublin and elsewhere.  The result was not very advantageous to the individual or the Fine Gael Party.&rdquo;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;We trust that the commonsense business people of the country will appreciate at its true value the attitude of that Party on the Trade Union Bill and act accordingly.  That Party, or some of its members, hope to gain a little tactical advantage over the Minister, who is attempting, even in a small way, to protect the business people of the country from <Col N="2120" /> the terrorism and threats of ill-directed trades union organisation. We trust the business people of the country will speak out and let that Party know that wallowing in the dirty game of politics does not always ensure financial, moral or personal support at election time.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now, here is the spicy piece, in conclusion, and I should like to hear from the Minister what was the result of this very valuable suggestion.</P>

      <P>Here is the concluding portion of that article:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Meantime, we trust the Minister will receive all possible personal expressions of support in order to counter the operations of that unnatural combination to which we have referred.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wonder how many hundreds, or even thousands, of telegrams the Minister received from the bad employers who were responsible for the production of that article?  If that is the source from which he gets his advice and his information in connection with trade union matters, at this period of the history of the country, then I sympathise with the Minister, but his name will go down in the history of this country for having brought in a measure which has done more to destroy the national unity of the country than anything else <Col N="2121" /> that I know of at this critical period. The inspiration, we now know, behind the writer of that article&mdash;and the Minister knows it better than I do&mdash; comes from people who are not all Irish nationals.  If Deputy Corry wants to know who was responsible for the export of scrap iron I can tell him that the same gentleman has something to do with what is contained in that article.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not have mentioned this, Sir, were it not that the Minister went out of his way to try to persuade the people who read what he says that the British-born trade union officials are the only people who are against this Bill.  The Minister has also endeavoured, both here and elsewhere, to give the impression that there are in this country responsible trade union officials who are in favour of the proposals contained in this Bill.  I have stated here in the House, and I repeat it now, that I do not believe, and never did believe, in the existence or the necessity for four or five trade unions for the purpose of catering for the interests of any one group of workers engaged in any industry.  Personally, I believe in industrial trade unionism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe that all the railway workers, in the traffic grades of the railway service, should be in one union, and I advocated that as far back as 30 years ago.  I do not know what personal views the Minister for Industry and Commerce has in regard to this, but he should have held some view in matters of this kind when he was an honoured member of the Independent Labour Party in Belfast.  The very fact that we believe that there can be a certain amount of reorganisation of the trade unions in this country is no <Col N="2122" /> justification for suggesting that any responsible official of the trade union movement in this country will stand up and defend the proposals now contained in this Bill.  The editor who talked about this being a poor attempt at interpreting the views of employers certainly did not know that the Minister had such bad advice and information tendered to him in connection with this matter that he had to bring in 35 amendments to the Bill on Report Stage.  Imagine a Minister having had this whole matter under consideration for 12 months, and having more information at his disposal than is at the disposal of any other citizen of the State, at the same time having to confess that he knew so little about the matter that, on Report Stage, he had to butcher the Bill beyond recognition.  It was only when the Bill was circulated on Report that Deputies could really understand what was contained in the Bill.</P>
    <P>I read an article&mdash;as I read most articles&mdash;in the <i>Irish Press,</i> published yesterday, which was headed &ldquo;A Sorry Spectacle&rdquo;.  No doubt, that article was inspired by the active mind of the Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>

I thought that Deputy Corry would have had a consultation with the Minister in the meantime, and have found out for himself, as he should have found out for himself, what were the proposals submitted by the Minister's officials to the conference at that particular meeting, and compared the proposals submitted by the Minister's officials to the executive of the Irish Trade Union Conference with what is even now contained in this Bill.</P>

      <P>This Bill contains several sections which are highly objectionable, and for that reason it is impossible for any trade unionist, who believes in the rights of Irishmen under the Constitution, to vote for a measure of this kind.  The tribunal set up by the Minister under the Bill has no relation to the functions of any tribunal properly constituted. Certainly the appeal board set up by the Minister in an amendment brought in on the Report Stage is a type of appeal board hitherto unknown in this country.  I daresay it is the type of tribunal which, in the opinion of the Minister, is eminently suitable for dealing with the grievances of trade unionists, and to that extent it proves that this is class legislation of the very worst type.  The amount of the deposits to be paid by unions which will recognise this Bill when it becomes law also gives it the hallmark of class legislation of the very worst type.</P>
      <P>The Minister, by his interruption, apparently intends to make it clear that some things happened at the recent Irish Trade Union Congress which would give him adequate authority for pushing this measure through and putting it into operation.  I have as good information as the Minister, although I was not present at the congress, on that particular matter, and I know of no delegate to the recent congress who, when challenged, was willing to stand up and say that he stood for the proposals in this Bill.  In conclusion, I wish to say that whether or not this Bill was justified by the conditions prevailing in 1935 and 1936, the conditions which were said to prevail in 1935 and 1936 have not prevailed in this country for the past 12 or 18 months.  The Minister, by bringing in this measure and creating the disunity which has been created as a result of its introduction and its forced passage through this House, has done a disservice to the people of the country at a most critical period in the history of the nation.</P>

      <P>The proposals in this Bill, which it is now proposed to <Col N="2126" /> pass through the House, I believe are disastrous proposals not only for the workers, but for the employers and for industry generally.</P>
      <P>The manner of the Minister's approach in bringing the proposals before the House, and his general attitude during the discussion of the measure, were simply in keeping with the proposals, and will tend to add to the disastrous and disruptive effect at a time when, as Deputy Davin pointed out, we want the most complete understanding among all sections of the people, and the most complete cooperation between those who have anything to do with production.  The Minister has sown the seeds of misunderstanding and distrust, and has set out to disrupt organisations that, however they may require to be improved and bettered, have grown up naturally here.  The members of these organisations have grown up together, worked together, and achieved things together, both on the workers' and the employers' side, and have made a contribution to the development of Irish industry and to the harmonious carrying on of industry here, no matter what may be said with regard to disagreements and disturbances that have occurred from time to time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The very attitude that Deputy Davin takes up with regard to the employers at this particular stage shows how far the proposals and the discussions and the attitude that the Minister has taken on them have spread the area of distrust. Deputy Davin takes it that employers generally are behind this Bill, and are the people who forced the Minister into bringing forward the proposals. He mentioned <i>Irish Industry,</i> and quoted some things from that publication as bearing out what he feels.  I want to deny, from my knowledge, at any rate, that the Federation of Irish Manufacturers have anything to do with this publication. So far as I know, it is the product of an individual, and however an individual, when he sits in the editorial chair, may wish to speak for all and sundry, I think it would be a disaster if that, as well as the Minister's attitude here, or the attitude of any other person, <Col N="2127" /> should bring about a position in which it would be possible for anybody representing labour or labour interests in any authoritative way to make use of them as a reason for taking up an anti-employers' attitude.</P>
    <P>I do not think that in a normal atmosphere any great section of workers could be got to say that there was a divergence of interest between the workers on the one hand and the employers and the organisers of industry generally on the other.  I think that both the employers and the workers realise that their interests are very closely knitted and that neither section can prosper or add anything to the general well-being of the country except by working hand in hand with the other.</P>
    <P>The Bill, as well as bringing about this atmosphere of distrust and ill will and, I believe, disparaging, demeaning and lowering Parliamentary institutions in the eyes of the workers, contains provisions which put it into the Minister's power, if he puts the Bill into operation, to wipe out of existence organisations of workers which have brought harmony, progress and good-will into many parts of the country. As we have pointed out, some of the smaller town unions, which are valuable centres of sound harmonious working, and which have kept the peace and helped to improve conditions generally for the general run of town workers in various parts of the country, will be put out of existence under this measure.  It was pointed out that craftsmanship is going to suffer at the hands of the Bill by the wiping out of craft unions.  It establishes the power of the purse and is an invitation, shall I say, to the boss type, whether amongst workers or masters, to try to get control of organisations, and to do that by means of the purse.  It is a very great mistake if it is attempted to put it into force.</P>
    <P>If that is the foundation upon which organisations, either of masters or workers, are going to rest in the future, then it is not peace but strife this Bill is going to bring into the lives of workers and of employers, and into <Col N="2128" /> industry generally.  Deputy Davin referred to the appeal board.  The tribunal as now remodelled by the Minister, is as fantastic a thing as was ever conceived, so fantastic that it would be well worthy of being included in the Bill, as originally brought before the House.  The Minister is doing a very sorry thing for Irish industry.  It is a very sorry day for the harmonious ordering of our lives here, whether socially or industrially, and I sincerely hope that wiser counsels will prevail.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>This is apparently the last stage of the steam-rolling process upon which the Government relied in order to try to pass this Bill.  As I stated on the Second Reading, this is an unwanted Bill.  Good-class employers have not asked for it, and the trade unions have not asked for it, as the Minister very well knows from what happened at Drogheda.  If there are any Fianna Fáil Cumainn left in the country, we have no evidence from them that they want it, and they are usually organisations which can be induced to pass resolutions on request. So far as public opinion is concerned, there has been no public opinion expressed in favour of the introduction of a Bill of this kind.  Yet, notwithstanding the fact that there has been no demand for the Bill, not even a mild demand, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, particularly in present circumstances, insists on wasting the time of this House in discussing a Bill of this kind, and using his Parliamentary majority to force it through the House. All this is taking place at a time when the whole nation is looking to this Legislature to give the country a sound lead on such problems as shortage of food, shortage of fuel, the emigration of tens of thousands of our people to the bombed cities of England, and control of prices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In another State, when the people asked for bread the Emperor gave them circuses.  Here, when the people ask for food, for fuel, when we have high prices, and the drift of our manhood and womanhood from the country, the best the Government and the Minister for Industry and Commerce can <Col N="2129" /> offer the country is a Trade Union Bill, on which to dissipate its energies at this critical time.  No Bill ever came before this House based on such false pretences.  Deputy Cooney and Deputy Corry will vote for this Bill on the grounds that it will help Irish unions. That is the bait held out.  That is the carrot to get them into the Division Lobby in favour of the Bill.  Everybody who knows anything about trade unions &mdash;as Deputy Cooney does&mdash;must know that one of the immediate effects will be to put a number of small organisations out of existence because they cannot pay the deposit required by the Minister.</P>
    <P>The organisations that will not be able to do that are solely Irish trade unions.  Every Deputy on the Fianna Fáil Benches with any experience of Irish trade unions knows full well the truth of what I am saying.  If there are English organisations that want to comply with the provisions of the Bill, there is no doubt that every one of them can do so, so far as making the deposit is concerned.  There are some small Irish organisations, which have rendered excellent service to their members, which have helped to raise the standard of living of members, which rendered good service to the nation, and helped to create the State, which will be seriously affected, if the provisions of the Bill are put into operation and if they are compelled to comply with its provisions.  The excuse given by so-called nationally minded folk on the Government Benches is that this Bill will put non-Irish unions&mdash; British unions&mdash;in their place.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce almost declared war on them during the Committee Stage discussion.</P>
    <P>Everybody who knows the facts of the situation knows perfectly well that in the main this Bill if put into operation will do irreparable damage to the smaller Irish trade unions which have not the deposit demanded by the Minister. One would imagine that at a time when small countries are toppling over each week, when their independence is being trampled upon, their liberty stifled, and when life is really becoming a struggle, the Government <Col N="2130" /> would realise that it was nationally unwise to introduce this measure, and that what we needed more than anything else was the welding together of our people so that we might present a united front in the face of any external menace or any internal difficulties. When national unity was so essential, that is the time selected by the Minister for Industry and Commerce to introduce a measure of this kind.  Since the outbreak of war nobody has done more to create disunity and discontent, or done more to sabotage efforts to promote national unity, than the Minister for Industry and Commerce. No one has rendered greater disservice to this nation, and no one has committed a greater crime against the organised workers than the Minister for Industry and Commerce has by the introduction of a Bill of this kind. The Minister may now imagine that with the passage of the Bill he can proceed to make war on the trade unions.  He may imagine too that he will make war on the Irish trade unions.</P>
    <P>Though I do not feel disposed to help the Minister in connection with this Bill, even at this late stage, I strongly advise him to abandon it.  If his political face must be saved, well and good.  We can understand the Bill having to be passed through this House in order that no further smudges may appear on the Minister's political face. The Bill might then be treated in the same way as the Minister on another occasion treated the Valuation Bill, which has been three years on the Order Paper, and in respect of which no steps have been taken even to proceed with the Committee Stage.  The Minister was wise then.  He told this House that the Valuation Bill was a vital one, that it was urgent that it should be put into operation, and he intimated the inestimable advantages which would accrue to poor people by its passage.  Either the Minister got wise or his political chief developed a sense of political fear.  Whatever the cause, the result was that the Minister was told to abandon the Valuation Bill.  He might well do the same now. He might on this occasion not be rebuked. <Col N="2131" /> He might now intimate that he does not intend to proceed with this Bill.  The sooner he gives intimation of that fact to the country, the sooner will he repair some of the damage which his swashbuckling speeches in this House, and his obviously hostile attitude towards trade unions, have created, at a time when an entirely different atmosphere is necessary.  If the Minister wants to be the martial Minister, and if he wants to fight trade unions, and to fight the workers at this time, then he is welcome if he likes to try that forte.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I want to say that when an unscrupulous gang of employers in this city, aided and abetted by all the forces of the State, tried to smash the workers in 1913, and to use the weapons of starvation against them, they failed.  What they failed to do in 1913 this Minister for Industry and Commerce in 1941 will fail to do much more signally than the unscrupulous employers of 1913.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I approached the consideration of this Bill with as open a mind as any Deputy, but if I had an inclination to vote against the Bill at the beginning, nothing has occurred during the debate to change that early opinion, which might have been changed.  Rather have I been induced to oppose the Bill with much greater force than I should have opposed it at the beginning.  So far as I can gather, there was not, from anybody in the South of Ireland, employer or employed, any demand whatever for this Bill.  We have in the South of Ireland a number of small unions which worked very effectively on behalf of workers and without any serious disabilities to the employers, and, in fact, many of them, in their own way, have acted as peacemakers and have settled disputes in a very excellent manner. We feel that the abolition of these unions will not serve either the cause of the employers or of the many industries in the country, but rather that the extinguishing of these unions, and the compelling of their members to become members of one or two great unions, will do a disservice to these interests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2132" /> The Minister waxed furious on the question of English unions and, at one point in the debate, I came to the conclusion that it was because of the English unions that the Minister brought in the Bill and that it was his intention to clip their wings, if he could not altogether extinguish them.  If the Minister was aiming honestly and definitely at furthering the cause of Irish unions, and at preventing as many Irish workers as he could from joining English unions, I should be with him wholly, and in any action which the Minister could take in that direction I should support him strongly, but the Minister made no case for his argument against these unions.  If anything, there is a preference in the Bill for the English unions in relation to a great number of Irish unions, because this is largely a question of £ s. d.  Many small unions will be unable to put down the deposit required, but there will be no such difficulty for any of the English unions that I know of.  The deposit required of them will not materially affect them, and they will not give it any consideration, so that while, in effect, there is a provision in the Bill wiping out certain Irish unions, it may have the effect of driving their members into the English unions the Minister is so anxious to get rid of.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in making his case against the English unions, quoted a rather unfortunate instance, so far as his case was concerned.  If his idea was to change the views of any of us who were dubious about the effects of the Bill, he selected a very unfortunate case.  He instanced a case in Cork of the member of a certain Irish union of woodworkers who, the Minister said, was refused work because of his membership of that union, at the instance of one of the great English unions, and he said that it was to remedy that state of affairs that he brought in this measure.  Instead of remedying that grievance, the Minister has accentuated it, because the very union which he is out to protect and about which he waxed so furious will probably be one of the unions which will cease to exist.  I am told that it is one of the small unions which may cease to exist, so that the Minister by <Col N="2133" /> his intervention, will probably not only prevent the members of that union from getting justice as an Irish union, but compel them to enter the larger body in England.</P>
    <P>I believe we can go too far in the direction of centralisation in this matter, as in others.  I have been a consistent opponent in this House of the great trend towards centralisation in the State, and I believe that, in this matter of trade unions, we can go too far in that direction.  I believe that many of the smaller unions in the country towns and other areas, built up by workmen in their own interests, with a knowledge of the trade and the craft, were useful institutions and that their abolition will not tend to continue and extend the good relations which existed in the areas in which these unions were organised.  To a country mind like mine&mdash;and I believe my views are shared by a great number of people in areas outside Dublin&mdash; the centralisation of all workers in one or two unions, one of which may be an English union, will not tend to the effective settlement of disputes, to that intimate approach between employers and employed which the small unions gave us in the local districts, and that, instead of being a harbinger of peace, will have the opposite effect.</P>
    <P>In debates on important measures, when there is controversy as to the good or bad points of a Bill, we are wont to have the assistance of Deputies from all sides.  At the beginning of the debate on this Bill, I thought we might have continued that practice.  I listened to most of the speeches made during a very long and tedious debate.  The Minister has not impressed me and, with one exception, not a Deputy behind him had the courage to get up and make a case for the measure.  From my knowledge of members of the Government Party, I am quite certain that if there was any enthusiasm among them for this measure, the Minister would have had the consistent backing of at least four or five usually loquacious Deputies, but that backing was lacking on this occasion, and we can only assume that the measure of backing behind the Minister, if represented by the vocal support of his Deputies, is nil, and that <Col N="2134" /> the only reason for their support of him in this matter is the Party Whip. So far as we are concerned, we have been allowed to take our own individual views.  As I say, I approached this matter with as unbiassed a mind as any Deputy, and anything brought out by the debate, so far as my understanding of it is concerned, has been rather against the Minister than for him.  My opposition to the Bill has been increased tenfold by the conduct of the debate through the House and the lack of support for it from any part of the House, except from the Minister himself.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasKelly" hpid="Mr. T. Kelly Mr. T. Kelly">

      <P>I should like to give my view.  My view is given of my own free will.  There was no attempt whatever, either expressed or implied, to prevent members here from making speeches on this Bill.  My reason for backing up this Bill is that I am for the Government, and at this juncture, when there is such an inferno raging all over the world, I am not going to do anything which would even loosen a screw in the machinery of the Government. That is my reason.  I did not enter into the merits of the Bill at all.  I did not read it.  I am not a bit ashamed to confess that, not the slightest bit.  I have an impression of trade unions, formed many years ago.  It is a long time since 1885.  In that year a special commission was set up by the British Government for the investigation of the housing of the poor.  That commission appointed members to meet in Dublin.  There was only one Irishman on it, but he was a good one, Edmund Dwyer Gray.  The commission sat for a long time.  It brought in a Bill enabling corporations of the three Kingdoms to have legislation passed to help them to carry out the designs of this commission. Later on, in 1897, a Bill was passed in the British House of Commons again extending local government to this country.  A year later, 1898, an election was held, and, for the first time, the working-class citizens of Dublin got the chance of electing the corporation and minor local bodies. They never had the franchise before. The corporation previously was elected by a very restricted franchise.  The trades council then put up candidates <Col N="2135" /> in each of the 15 wards of the City of Dublin.  There were three other candidates put up by other working-class institutions.  I was a member of one of them.  A very elaborate and fine programme of social reform was brought in by the trades council.  The election was held.  I was a candidate, although not originally intended to be one.  The man we had selected in our institution was one of those splendid, naturally cultured, Dublin workmen.  He had no chance of great education, but he was an extremely cultured man.</P>

      <P>The condition of the city was as I have stated.  The corporation met in the council chamber and began its work.  That was in January of that year.  I must say that in the beginning they showed up well. Two or three very necessary social changes were made and, indeed, to mention them here would throw more light on the condition of this city.  One reform was the introduction of an ambulance service.  There was no ambulance service then of any description. There was the &ldquo;sick car&rdquo;.  You know what that means.  Another reform was that the dead poor in the workhouses might be burried with religious ceremonies.</P>

      <P>I cannot come to the Bill for a little while longer, if you do not mind.  Ten minutes is not too long. I really did not want to speak.  I did not come here prepared to speak.  As a matter of fact, I do not want to speak in this House at all.  There was a time I thought I might like it, but I did not like it and I left it there.  Another proposal was that the examinations for clerkships in the council should be competitive.  That obtains to-day.  That was all very well, but a few months later the tempter came.  There was great work to be done in Dublin, more especially in connection with the conditions in which the poor were living. They could have succeeded very well, but the tempter came and his temptation was this&mdash;make one of the members lord mayor.  We were only three or four months in the council chamber altogether and they fell for it&mdash;one of the members was selected to be lord mayor.  The selection used to take place in June and the actual election in December.  The mayoralty then carried a salary of £3,650&mdash;an immense sum. We had the members deciding that they would contest the next election on those grounds only&mdash;that one of the members should be lord mayor.  That is what they did.  Unfortunately, they were tempted and, being only human, they fell for it.  But we, who take a keen interest in the city and the city's affairs&mdash;and more especially in the question of social reform&mdash;remember it too well.  It was years afterwards before trade unionism was able to recover itself in the city.  Just remember what a power it would have been then. I would advise members here who are not past advice to remember that incident in connection with this country. It may well prove a charter for trade unions, and put them in a much more substantial position than at present. Here is a plain question.  How is it that the Labour Party consists only of a handful of members here?</P>

      <P>I doubt whether any measure introduced here throughout the period of the emergency has aroused such widespread condemnation as the Bill which we are asked now to pass.  Even the nimble mind and brazen tongue of the Minister for Industry and Commerce have not proved equal to the task of slipping this Bill across.  In fact, were it not for the docile, well-oiled voting machinery which the Minister has at his disposal, the Bill never would have reached this stage at all.  As has been asserted over and over again throughout the course of the debate, this Bill is unwanted by anyone, with the possible exception of the Minister and a few of his colleagues who are privileged to sit with him on the Government Front Bench.  Might it not be too much to hope that, even at this late stage, the Minister will see his way to withdraw the Bill?</P>
      <P>In view of the recent opposition to it in the House here and in view of the manifold protests that have been made throughout the country on behalf of working class interests, one might well ask if the Minister is not allowing his personal conceit and vanity to usurp his judgment in forcing through a measure of this kind.  The Bill has been rushed through its various stages with indecent haste.  No plea of urgency was put forward by the Minister for taking the successive stages of the Bill at such short intervals, nor indeed could there have been any such argument to support that plea.  So far as I can see, the only tangible result that will accrue from the enactment of this measure will be the creation of widespread disorganisation of hosts of workers throughout the country.  This Bill will sabotage and destroy the goodwill and co-operation which have been so eagerly promoted and so assiduously fostered by trade union leaders throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2139" /> The fog and haze which enveloped the Minister's mind in pressing this measure forward were demonstrated by the fact that he found it necessary to table no less than 35 amendments to the Report Stage.  The Minister need not think that the slender modifications in the Bill as it at present exists will make it one bit more acceptable to the people.  This vicious child of the Minister's imagination, this monstrosity let loose by the Minister on the working classes will, I hope, meet with the same political fate as awaits its master.  Instead of dissipating his energies in trying to force this Bill through, the Minister might, with advantage, have turned his attention to many reforms which are urgently required.  We are all aware that there are many points crying out for attention.  The Minister's time, and the time of this House, would have been better used in dealing with these matters than in dissipating energies in dealing with what is now commonly known as this anti-Trade Union Bill. When the Minister is but a faded memory in this House, the trade unions which he now seeks to destroy will remain and the principles of collective bargaining which have their roots in the craft guilds of the Middle Ages, will still obtain.</P>

      <P>At this stage of the Bill anybody is entitled to ask a question, and I ask for the production of the evidence that warrants the Minister in introducing and forcing through a measure of this character.  When we are passing through an emergency, legislation of various kinds may be called for in the interests of the country and its various constituents.  I think that the citizens of the country and Deputies of the House are entitled impartially to ask the Minister to produce the evidence and to show the volume of it, to warrant the forcing of this Bill through the House.  If pressure comes from the agricultural community or from any other section, obviously one expects the volume of pressure from that particular section of the community to demand legislation of a particular type.  Can the Minister produce to this House any demand of the <Col N="2140" /> workers of the country, industrial or rural?  Deputy Mulcahy says that, as far as he knows, the employers themselves have not put it forward.  I cannot speak for them, but I think we are entitled to get a statement from the Minister as to who is responsible in driving him to put this forward.  On other stages of the Bill, he has stated in some fashion that certain trade union leaders insinuated at least that they were in favour of the Bill.</P>
      <P>Deputy Corry was sufficiently unwise to-night&mdash;having learned nothing since the Committee Stage and having forgotten something&mdash;to suggest again that there was some volume of opinion from the trade union leaders in support of this measure.  The only thing he could do was to quote from a document of last November.  If he had not such a short memory, he would have kept away from that incident, as his suggestion was publicly repudiated by the Minister and by this House as being a falsehood.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>It was repeated to-night by Deputy Corry, notwithstanding the lesson he got on the last occasion. That is the reason for my reference. Deputy Corry has learned nothing and forgotten something.  I challenge the Minister and the Government to produce any evidence of support for the introduction of a Bill of this character from any trade union leader in the country.  Trade union leaders were prepared to admit that there was room for improvement in the organisation, so as to prevent the overlapping that was taking place.  That was put to them and they did not succeed in bridging the differences.  As a matter of fact, as time has gone on, these difficulties have not shown themselves in anything like an acute form.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the commission report, from which the Minister has so copiously quoted, nothing has happened of a character which would warrant any interference with the trade union movement. That has been particularly noticeable since the commencement of the period of emergency.  Yet, the Minister is not content with introducing a Bill which we consider unwarranted; he introduces a Bill of a most objectionable character.  It is not a Bill to promote unity and harmony in the trade union movement, but one to promote discord.  It indicates that the Minister has no sympathy whatever with the trade union movement.  That is disclosed, too, by his attitude and statements during the progress of the Bill.  The Bill itself was bad, but the statements which the Minister has made will remain as cankers in the minds of trade unionists as long as he remains in office.  Workers cannot look with confidence to a Government of which he is a responsible spokesman as having any sympathy with trade unions or what they stand for.  There is a very serious divergence at this juncture on the part of the Government when they say that the trade union movement, with its admitted faults, is not an admirable and necessary <Col N="2142" /> instrument in the conduct of industrial affairs.</P>
    <P>We say that this Bill, even in the amended form in which we are asked to pass it to-night, does not aim at the improvement of the trade union movement but rather at its disturbance and dislocation.  With its penalties, the Bill is going to drive small unions out of existence, without providing any suitable machinery to replace them. Small unions in the cities and towns carried on good work unostentatiously. They did not figure very much in the limelight, but they conducted their affairs well and succeeded in building up and maintaining reasonable standards for their members.  Disputes were avoided by their wise and timely intervention between the workers and their employers.</P>
    <P>These unions will cease to function for one reason only&mdash;that they cannot put down the necessary deposit.  They are being driven out of existence.  I have already spoken frequently on behalf of the old craft unions, and I shall not repeat what I have said.  An effort has been made to render their position less impossible by reducing the deposit figure, but the figure will, in my opinion, still be impossible, and many of them will go by the board.  The Minister has no regrets in that respect. If the Minister has no regrets for the passing of these old craft unions and the disappearance of local unions and trades councils, which did so much to promote industrial peace, the country, as a whole, will have reason to regret that they were put out of existence.</P>
    <P>The Minister showed no evidence of preparedness for the realities of the situation when he found it necessary to make so many amendments to the Bill while it was passing through the House.  These amendments may have eased the pressure, in some instances, but the vital defects remain.  Fundamentally, the principle on which the Bill is built is the placing of a premium on non-unionism as against trade unionism.  That principle cannot be obliterated by any amendment.  It puts a premium on house unions and com pany unions, which will be the property of the boss.  It is designed to increase the slave mind, one of the things which <Col N="2143" /> the trade unions have endeavoured to combat.  They are proud of having imbued the workers with a spirit of independence and manhood.  Now, the workers are being driven into the hands of the boss.  They can negotiate with the boss, but they know that they have no weapon or machinery left to enforce their demands, no matter how just or right they may be.  They cannot have recourse to the strike or the picket.  They have been robbed of these rights during the progress of the Bill. Deputy Kelly went back to 1885.  It is a pity that he was not more relevant, because I should like to hear the completion of his statement.  The Minister goes back to 1825 and robs the workers of the hardly-won rights obtained by them in successive measures during the years that have intervened. I wonder how Deputy Kelly, with the sympathy he has expressed with trade unionism, and which I believe he feels, can conscientiously square his support of this Bill&mdash;which, he says, he has not read&mdash;introduced by the Minister&mdash;a Bill which strikes at the heart and vitals of the trade union movement&mdash; with the support of that movement which he helped to build up himself.</P>

      <P>Many other Deputies on the Fianna Fáil Benches are equally sympathetic with the trade union movement and what it stands for but they are being steamrolled by the Party machine as we are being steamrolled here.  The Minister was looking for some kind of public utterance which would give him courage to put this Bill through.  He was looking to Drogheda last week and he referred to-day, in passing, to something that happened at Drogheda.  I was at Drogheda and I am prepared to grant him any satisfaction he can get out of the proceedings there.  The opposition of Labour's Parliament to this measure was unmistakable and unequivocal. The floor denounced the platform because we did not take sufficient steps in opposition to this execrable Bill and its accompanying Order No. 83.  Not one out of the 206 delegates had any <Col N="2144" /> use for the Bill, even in its amended form.  The Minister has, probably, received private reports regarding the proceedings at Drogheda.  I challenge him to produce any evidence to show that he has the backing of any trade union or trade unionist for this measure.  If that be so, where are we under a democracy?  Are we, in the name of democracy, to force on, probably, 250,000 workers an unwanted and objectionable measure of this kind, for which there is not a title of demand or support at a juncture when the Minister would be better employed endeavouring to smooth the hard path which the emergency and the war situation have opened up for our people.  On previous occasions, I told the Minister what I thought of his action.  I tell him now that he is doing a bad thing for the country.  The trade union movement will survive this Bill and all the machinations in connection with it and will be thriving when the promoters of the Bill shall have faded away.</P>

      <P>We have; after a stormy passage, reached the final stage of this Bill in so far as the proceedings in this House are concerned.  It will later go to the Seanad and after that one wonders what is going to happen. If I know the trade unionists of this country&mdash;and I think I do&mdash;I think the Minister is going to have a very unhappy time as soon as this Bill becomes the law of the land.  During the course of Deputy Davin's speech, the Minister made certain jibes about the Irish Trade Union Congress which met in Drogheda during the past week. I know there were differences, material differences, amongst the delegates in Drogheda last week&mdash;healthy differences, differences arrived at in an effort by every delegate there to do something in the interests of the working class but there was no difference whatever, not a title of difference, in the minds of delegates as to what they thought about the Bill that is being now pushed through this House.  Every delegate there who spoke on the Trade Union Bill, without equivocation of any kind, denounced the Bill and every section of the Bill and demanded that the new executive of the Trade Union <Col N="2145" /> Congress, when it was elected, should take all steps necessary to prevent the Bill from being put into operation. There was no question at all about the reception given to the Bill.</P>
      <P>As I said a moment ago, the Minister made certain jibes about the Trade Union Congress.  The Minister of course was not in a position to know what actually happened at the Trade Union Congress because, as we all know owing to the scarcity of newsprint at the moment, proceedings of that kind are not getting the publicity that one would like to see.  It is therefore impossible for anybody who was not at the congress to understand what really happened at the congress.  What I want to emphasise however is, that the jibes of the Minister are in very bad taste.  The jibes of any Minister of the present Government would be in very bad taste so far as the Trade Union Congress is concerned.  I remember in 1919 or 1920&mdash;I forget exactly the year&mdash;I was present at a meeting of a Trade Union Congress held in the Mansion House in Dublin when An Taoiseach, or Deputy de Valera as he then was, came there and got a good reception as the head of the Sinn Féin movement of that time.  He told us that he did not want to interfere with our deliberations but he asked for the co-operation of the trade union movement.</P>
      <P>He got the unanimous co-operation of the trade union movement, and if he did not get the unanimous co-operation of the trade union movement, Mr. Seán MacEntee would not be here to-day as Minister for Industry and Commerce, piloting a Bill through the House to cripple the trade union movement. Therefore, I say that it comes very badly from the Front Bench of a Party which asked for and got such co-operation from the Trade Union Congress in 1919 when it was so badly needed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the course of the Committee Stage of this Bill, the Minister in one of his fits of temper, told us that the object of this Bill was to strengthen Irish trade unions and that he was doing something to clip the wings of the English trade unions.  But his immediate <Col N="2146" /> predecessor apparently thought differently.  Deputy Lemass at Waterford said certain things which would give the lie to the present Minister for Industry and Commerce.  I think I would be right in saying that Deputy Lemass, the present Minister for Supplies, had a good deal to do with this Bill before he left the Department of Industry and Commerce.  Certainly this Bill was not conceived only during the lifetime of the present Minister.  In the course of his speech at Waterford the Minister for Supplies said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is noteworthy that no critics of the Bill have particularised their objection to it except one union which objected because the Bill did not put an end to the operations of British unions here.  Despite that, I was surprised to note some officials of British unions associating themselves with the agitation.  It is common knowledge that these British unions expected that the Bill would put an end to their operations in this country and that their Irish officials were overjoyed to find that, instead of putting them out, the Bill recognised and consolidated their position.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think that gives the lie to the statement of the Minister for Industry and Commerce on the Committee Stage of the Bill.  I do not want it to be thought that I want to see any handicaps imposed on English trade unions because the so-called English trade unions operating here have Irishmen in charge of them, Irishmen who proved themselves Irishmen all through the years from 1916 to 1922-23.  We had men like the late Senator Thomas MacPartlin, who was secretary of an English trade union, the Amalgamated Society of Woodworkers, and who, I think we can say, gave his life in the cause of Irish freedom.  Although he did not actually die in the conflict, I think it can be truly said that he died in consequence of the strenuous work he did all through his life in the cause of Irish freedom.</P>
    <P>The same can be said, I think, of the late William Partridge, who had a long service in the movement and who was an official of an English trade union. <Col N="2147" /> We were lectured here this evening by Deputy Tom Kelly.</P>

      <P>I remember a famous occasion here when Deputy Kelly said, during an election, that his advice to the people was to vote early and to vote often.  Twelve months ago an appeal was made by representatives of all Parties sitting in this House asking for unity in the face of a common danger and asking that certain Defence Services should be set up here. This Party and the trade union movement generally, I think it can be said, entered fully into the spirit of that movement and made the appeals they were asked to make by the Government. The result was that all sections of the community rallied together and there were formations of the Local Defence Force, Local Security Force and Air Raid Precautions.  Quite a number of people of the working class also joined the National Army for the period of the crisis.  This Bill, since it was introduced, has been responsible for more disunity than has prevailed in this country for a considerable time. Those of us who are in the trade union movement and in the Labour Party, for the past three or four months since the introduction of the Bill, have found <Col N="2148" /> ourselves obliged repeatedly to ask people to remain in the Defence Forces and not to come out of them because of the fact that the Bill was introduced. That is the position in which we find ourselves now.  We do not want to see disunity in the country but we feel perfectly satisfied that if this Bill passes its final stages and is put into operation it is going to have a serious effect on the unity of the country.</P>
      <P>I think it was on the Financial Resolution of the Bill that the Minister denied a contention of mine that it had been agreed over 12 months ago that all contentious matters should not be discussed during the emergency period.  There are two Bills on the Order Paper for a number of years. The Valuation Bill has been on it almost four years.  That was a highly contentious measure, and there were very many disagreeable scenes in discussing a number of amendments that have been carried to it.  Another Bill which has been a long time on the Order Paper is the St. Laurence O'Toole Hospital Bill.  There was certainly a great division of opinion so far as that was concerned.  Certain people, especially Dublin Deputies, could not come to agreement on many points of the Bill, and it was agreed that, as it was so controversial, it be held up.  It was submitted by Dublin Deputies that it was absolutely necessary that the Bill should be passed through as quickly as possible in order to provide hospital accommodation. Nevertheless, although that was admitted by everybody, because of the fact that it was controversial it was hung up, and it is still hanging.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we appeal to the Minister to leave over the further consideration of this Bill because of its controversial complexion, he turns the deaf ear.  I suggest that he should leave the Bill as it stands, keep it out of the Seanad, and not have it further considered until the emergency passes.  I do admit that there is reorganisation required in the trade union movement, but the Minister knows the Irish people as well as I do.  He knows we always were, we are, and we always will be people with a rebellious spirit. We are not going to be coerced by the <Col N="2149" /> Minister or by any other person, so far as the trade union movement is concerned.  Arrangements are being made for a nation-wide rally, and the Minister will hear before very long the voice of the working-class people raised against this despicable measure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>As one who has some knowledge of the feelings of the workers with regard to this Bill, I seriously suggest that the Minister should suspend its further consideration until the country has passed through the present crisis.  I was in Drogheda in 1919 at a trade union congress, and I was at Drogheda last week.  The only trouble at the congress last week arose out of the delegates, the rank and file of the congress, finding fault with their officers for not acting more vigorously in their opposition to this measure.  I have some knowledge of the mentality of southern workers, and I know that day after day they have been pressing us to take more vigorous action against this Bill. Suggestions have been made as to what should be done about the working-class people who are in the Defence Forces, what should be suggested to them, and what they should do under certain circumstances.  We have members of various unions giving voluntary service in the Defence Forces, and they have expressed themselves very definitely with regard to this measure.</P>
      <P>We are passing through a very grave crisis, and we are likely to face a graver situation in the future, when we will have men and women looking for food, and for the fuel to cook that food.  In such a period I suggest that the Minister would be wise to suspend this measure.  I am appealing to him as one who has some experience of dealing with the working classes.  I have some knowledge of what they are thinking about this Bill, and in all sincerity I suggest to him that he would be very well advised to put this legislation aside for as long a period as possible.</P>

      <P>I wish to join with other Deputies in opposing this measure.  I think that the Minister should accept <Col N="2150" /> the advice that has been tendered to him by at least two speakers.  If he does not withdraw the Bill, at least he should not send it to the Seanad during the emergency period.  The Minister and his colleagues some two years ago asked for unity, and they got that unity.  I think the Government will agree that they got all they appealed for.  He now comes along with this measure which, I think, is the nearest thing to a dictatorship that was ever introduced&mdash;at any rate, it must be the outcome of a dictator's mind.  To me it appears to be a confiscatory measure, an effort to confiscate the funds of the trade unions, to value the work of the trade unions purely on their financial standing.</P>
      <P>We all know there are small unions representing various types of workers and these unions have done very valuable national work.  To my mind, this measure is a denial, a negation of liberty.  The Minister endeavoured to create the atmosphere that this Bill was going to stop strikes.  He said there were too many strikes in the country, and I think that was admitted by many Deputies, but there is nothing in the Bill to prevent strikes.  In conjunction with this Bill we have the Emergency Powers (No. 83) Order.</P>

      <P>I am afraid that when this Bill is passed other Bills of a similar character will follow.  When you take this measure in conjunction with the order to which I have referred, you realise the justification there is for the great resentment that has been caused all over the country.  I think, as Deputy Hickey has said, that the time of the Government would be better occupied trying to devise means to help those of our people who are suffering very great hardships.  What is the position existing to-day?  We have an increasing cost of living, a scarcity of fuel, a scarcity of light and growing unemployment.  The Minister and his staff would be better engaged trying to find remedies for these evils instead of, in a grave period of emergency, interfering with a movement that has done valuable work in days <Col N="2151" /> gone by for the people of this country, a movement which, I feel confident, will continue to do excellent work, irrespective of what the Minister may do in this House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill was designed to deal with one of the problems which affect the industry and commerce of the country.  The Minister indicated that the steps that are now being taken are designed to prevent stoppages of work, such as have occasioned very considerable loss to the country, to the people engaged in industry, and to industrialists generally.  To the average citizen it appears that whatever opposition to this legislation there may have been here on the part of persons closely in touch with the trade union movement, the opposition outside is even stronger than was originally expressed by Labour Deputies here. The Bill is going to become the law of the land.  Whether it will achieve the purposes the Minister has in mind, we shall have to leave the future to decide.</P>
      <P>I suggest to the Minister that he should not bring the Bill into operation for 12 or 18 months, and that, in the meantime, he would introduce a measure providing that before either a lock-out or a strike would take place the matters in dispute should be subjected to arbitration.  If, after the arbitration was held, there was dissatisfaction it should then be open to either party concerned to have the strike or lock-out, as the case might be.  That method has been tried in other countries.  In the case of one country it has been the law for some years.  The country in question has a population three times larger than ours.  Over the last five years the number of working days lost there has been less than the number lost here. The anomalies which this Bill is designed to remove are such as that, in the normal course, they ought really to fall for solution to trade union leaders and trade unions themselves.  If that has not been attempted up to this it may, to some extent, be said to be the misfortune of the trade union movement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill has been very severely <Col N="2152" /> criticised in the House.  Some of the criticism might be less severe if Labour members ever had responsibility for the administration of the country in the same way as the Party now in power has that responsibility.  Prior to accepting the responsibility of Government, partisans are disposed to put forward a cure for almost everything that affects the interests&mdash;individual, sectional, or national&mdash;of the country.  After the assumption of power people get sobered in their views with regard to finding an easy solution for all sorts of problems, and are perhaps less liable to make promises. It is the misfortune of the Labour Party that it has not had that experience. That is one of the lessons which has been learned by the Party now in office.  In consequence of their experience, the members of the Government have now quite a different approach to a number of problems which affect the country to that of ten years ago.  It is now the desire not only of the trade unions but of members on all sides of the House and, I should say, of practically every section of the community, that an effort should be made to compose those industrial disturbances which occasion such great loss to the families of those who are engaged in them and to the country as a whole.</P>
    <P>If some method, other than what this Bill proposes, could be found, it might help to bring about in a peaceful and amicable way a settlement of such differences as might arise.  My suggestion is that prior to a strike or a lock-out there should be arbitration. If the parties concerned consider that the terms proposed are unsatisfactory then let them be free to have either a strike or lock-out, as the case may be.  I think the Minister should try that method for 12 months.  If it is found to work well, it might be continued for another 12 months.  In the meantime it is possible, even probable, that the anomalies which it is hoped this Bill may remedy or improve might find their improvement within the ranks of the trade unions themselves. It is quite possible, even probable, that the Minister will not get any support for that suggested method of <Col N="2153" /> settling these matters from the Labour Benches, and for a very good reason&mdash;much the same reason as that which affects the settlement of disputes between nations.  When the representatives of nations assemble at Geneva or some other place they are all willing to settle, but their trouble is that when they go back to their respective countries they fail to carry the people with them in the settlements they are ready to make.  The suggestion that I have made appears to me to be much more likely to bring about industrial peace than the provisions in this Bill, and, on the whole, to receive a less hostile reception from those who have criticised this measure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. Everett Mr. Everett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister, when introducing this Bill, said that one of its objects was to prevent industrial unrest through the country.  During the whole of the discussions on the Bill the Minister did not give one single proof that there was any such thing as industrial unrest in Éire.  I know he takes up the attitude that when he introduces a Bill his aim is to see that it will be put into operation. At the same time, the Minister must be aware of the feeling that prevails amongst trade unionists at the present time.  On an earlier stage I indicated that so far as this Bill is concerned I was awaiting a decision from the men directly concerned&mdash;the Trade Union Congress&mdash;and would obey it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I realise that hard words have been spoken in the discussions on the Bill because members have felt that this was not the time to introduce such a measure, together with Emergency Powers Order No. 83 which prevents even the lowest paid workers getting an increase in wages.  My record will prove that I have never advised men to do anything that I was not prepared to do myself.  I am not now going to give any advice to the House in connection with the trade union movement. The Trade Union Congress got its orders, and the trade unions are going to consider what actions they will take in connection with the Bill.  That may create further trouble in the country, but that remains to be told.  The Minister <Col N="2154" /> must be satisfied that this Bill does not meet with the approval of any trade unionists in Éire.  It has met with no support from any Labour member.  The manner in which the Minister went about the Bill&mdash;the coercion&mdash;did not meet with the response that, in the beginning at any rate, he expected he would get for it. He is now going to get the votes of the members of his Party in support of it &mdash;most of whom have neither read the Bill nor any section of it.</P>
    <P>I have not made any threats in connection with it.  I have my own views about it.  If the Minister wants a continuation of the co-operation that the Government have received up to the present, if he really wants the co-operation of all trade unionists and is anxious that the Bill should meet with the approval of the trade unions, he should between now and the consideration of the Bill in the Seanad consult with the representatives of the Trade Union Congress.  He should endeavour to have a conference for the purpose of getting an agreed measure, one that would meet with the approval of every trade unionist and of the people generally throughout the country.  Of course the Minister may say that up to the present there has been very strong criticism of the Bill from Labour members not alone in the House but outside the House, but I am sure the Minister does not object to criticism if it is constructive.  Knowing the feelings of the people throughout the country, knowing that within the next week I will be engaged on work in connection with this Bill outside the House, together with all the Labour leaders throughout the Twenty-Six Counties, I join with Deputy Hickey in appealing to the Minister to postpone putting this Bill into operation until the obnoxious clauses have been removed and some agreement has been arrived at.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that this Bill is necessary, but every trade unionist has a different view, and there should be some endeavour to reconcile those two conflicting views.  It is not the first time there has been a conference when the unity of the nation required it.  We have those silent members on <Col N="2155" /> the Fianna Fáil Benches, who have never read the Bill before to-night, but surely it is not too late even now to have a conference for the purpose of arriving at an agreed measure.  There is no necessity for the Minister to read through all the reports of the Trade Union Congress.  The scoring of debating points on either side is not going to improve the position at the present time.  Criticisms from this side of the House or from the Minister in replying are not going to make the Bill any more acceptable to the trade union leaders outside.  If the Minister understands the situation he must realise that the only one who will have a grievance if this Bill is postponed is the briefless barrister who is to be appointed at £500 a year.  I am sure there is nobody either on the Government side or on our side who wants this Bill at the present time.  We have urgent work to do in the country in the next five or six weeks, instead of taking up the attitude which we will be forced to adopt if this Bill goes through.  I am not saying that by way of threat, but certain opposition will have to be made against this Bill outside the House.  Surely we do not want that in the next five or six weeks, when we could be engaged on more important work.  Is the Minister prepared to be a big man, to admit that there may be bad points in the Bill as well as good ones&mdash;we say that the bad points outweigh the good ones&mdash;and to do what Deputy Hickey and myself have suggested?</P>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave has talked about arbitration.  I have been connected with trade unions for 25 years, and I say that we have never objected to arbitration.  When there is a dispute between employers on the one side and workers on the other, we think it is a very good thing that there should be a delaying period, a steadying period; probably by the time you have arbitration, feeling on both sides will have calmed down, and you will get the acceptance which you would not have got at the outset.  Speaking for myself, and for the other members of this Party, I say that we have never in our lives objected to arbitration.  We have <Col N="2156" /> been prepared to do anything for peace.  We have never advocated strikes where they could be avoided. Having suffered as I have done in connection with disputes, I am the first to advise against them.  I know what it is to be in Mountjoy in connection with strikes.  I have had experience of the consequences of disputes under the previous Government as well as under this Government, but if this fight has to go on I am prepared to take my place.</P>
    <P>I know the serious effect this Bill is having in the country.  We know what may happen when the passions of 500,000 or 600,000 men are aroused.  I do not want any party outside this country to have any excuse for coming in here at the present time, and I say that the Minister would be doing a national work if he did not insist on forcing this Bill through.  He may put this Bill on the statute book, but he may not be able to put it into operation. I appreciate the Minister's difficulties, but he must appreciate the difficulties of the Labour members, and he has not smoothed them in any way by the introduction of this Bill.  Things have been said here which probably would have been better left unsaid. The Minister wants to get his pound of flesh by putting the Bill into operation, but it will not bring industrial peace to the country.  Its effect will be quite the opposite.  We know that there are certain people who have no love either for the Labour Party or any constitutional authority, and we know the advantage they may take of the position if the Minister tries to force this Bill through the House.</P>
    <P>I do not agree with anyone who says that trade unions will be suppressed; from my knowledge of trade unions and organised labour, I say that trade unions will not be suppressed.  In every walk of life you have people with Labour sympathies.  The Minister is aware that one of the leaders was prepared to resign from a very important organisation if this Bill went through. There is no use in the Minister saying that that was because those men were losing their jobs.  We do not want any more men losing their jobs at the present time.  The Minister has asked the co-operation of the Trade Union Congress <Col N="2157" /> in meeting the industrial situation in which large numbers of men will be thrown out of their jobs owing to the shortage of material, and I am certain that both sides will come to an agreement on that problem.  At a time when that problem is to be solved by agreement between all parties is it wise to bring in a measure of this kind which will not make for co-operation? I am not making any appeal to the Minister through cowardice, but because I know the serious effects which the putting into operation of this measure will produce.  Why put it into operation until there is a conference with men who can speak with the authority of the Labour movement of Ireland?  The Minister has met them recently on other matters.  Why not have a conference with them now, and postpone the putting into operation of this Bill until some measure of agreement has been arrived at in the interests of peace and, above all, in the interests of the country, which are more important than the interests of any Party?</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyLinehan" hpid="Mr. Linehan Mr. Linehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Linehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister, having heard the appeals from the entire Opposition in the House for the postponement of this Bill and the setting up of some kind of arbitration, particularly in the present emergency, would be very wise to take that course. Deputy Cosgrave has said that there has been even stronger opposition to this Bill outside the House than inside it, and to anybody who has any knowledge of what is happening in the country, that is perfectly apparent. Deputy Everett has suggested that it is a Bill which the Fianna Fáil Deputies do not want.  I do not think he is quite correct in that.  I would go so far as to say that the support of the Fianna Fáil Deputies was far stronger outside the House than inside it, because several of the Fianna Fáil Deputies flew into the highest flights of literary imagination in support of the Bill, and wasted quite a considerable amount of newsprint on it.  It is that type of defence of the Bill that has caused more doubts than anything else in the minds of the people who might have been prepared to accept the Minister's statements in regard to it.  There is one thing which I want to <Col N="2158" /> make quite clear.  It was suggested by Deputies in this House, and possibly the suggestion appeared more strong because there is no Labour representative in my constituency, that the workers there were in favour of the Bill.  I want to say strongly, and as strongly as I can possibly say it, that, as far as I know, the workers of North Cork, organised and unorganised, are every bit as vehement in their opposition to the Bill as anybody in this House or outside it.</P>

      <P>I had hoped that the Minister would have availed of the various stages of the Bill to have met, in some way, the protests he has received from all parts of the House. The Bill, as I stated when speaking in opposition to it on the Second Reading, is one that, in my opinion, is doing nothing more than giving a licence to work.  No cognisance at all is taken of the wonderful methods and the great constitution by which trade unions work for the protection of craftsmanship. The Minister has ignored that completely.  The Bill has had a very stormy passage, and one would have thought that the Minister would have made some effort, at any rate, to cover most of the points that were the chief basis of opposition.  Even now, I should be glad if the Minister could see his way either to hold up the Bill or to make some renewed effort or try to devise some means, which would be suitable to himself, to produce something that would be more acceptable, not alone to the trade union people themselves, but to industrialists.</P>

      <P>Naturally, when suggestions are made to me to meet the general view of the House in regard to any proposal, I would, if I could, accede to the request.  But I cannot agree to drop this Bill, to which a considerable amount of Parliamentary time has been devoted, for it, in my view, affords the only assurance the country can have that the Irish trade union movement, which is so vital an element in our industrial economy, will seriously devote itself to that task of rationalisation and re-organisation which every responsible representative <Col N="2159" /> of that movement admits to be overdue.  I cannot agree to drop this Bill&mdash;because that is what is being put up to me: to drop this Bill&mdash;which has the support of the Irish people.  Let us remember that if I am here as Minister responsible for this Bill, if the measure has reached the stage at which we are now going to decide whether it will pass or not, it has reached that stage because, in the Division Lobby, I have had the support of those who speak for the majority of the Irish people, no matter what the circumstances of today may be.  I am convinced that I have the support of the majority of the representatives of this House, not because they are bound to me by mere Party ties but because, having listened to this discussion, they do feel that there must be some instrument which will impel the Irish trade union movement seriously to consider its own condition and to remedy the abuses which, as I have said before, all admit to exist.</P>
      <P>Now, I have been told that the conditions in this Bill are completely unacceptable to the Irish trade union movement, but I read, upon the authority of a man who, in my humble view, has rendered as signal service to the workers of this country as any person who has been associated with it from its very inception&mdash;I have it on the authority of a person, who has been four times President of the Trade Union Congress, that no matter what Bill was introduced there would be opposition to it.  I am going to quote now from the report, which appeared in the <i>Irish Press</i> of the 17th July, of the speech of the presiding chairman of the Trade Union Congress, which is as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;They could understand that no matter what the proposals in the measure were there would be an outcry from the superfluous unions which they all wanted to see liquidated. These were sure to protest against the surgeon's knife, but apart altogether from these `fifth wheels of the coach,' and the grounds of their opposition, there was a strong feeling <Col N="2160" /> against Government regulation of trade unions.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>So, apparently, merely on grounds of principle, no matter how sagacious, no matter how prudent, no matter how easy the regulations which we proposed to introduce&mdash;and I contend that in this measure we are proposing the minimum that is necessary in order, as I have said, to induce the Irish trade union movement to do what it has so many opportunities of doing, but has signally failed to do&mdash;I contend that we are doing the very minimum, as I say, to secure that reconsideration of its own position by the movement&mdash;no matter what we do, no matter how far-sighted, how sagacious, how unirksome these regulations may be, on grounds of principle they would meet with a certain amount of opposition from those who represent the official side of the trade union movement in this country.  By their very nature they are bound to oppose any compulsion to make a change, and it is not to be wondered at that the official element in the trade union movement have opposed this Bill when the memorandum, to which I have so often referred, the Irish memorandum that was submitted to the special conference, had, as one of the points which was brought out in it, the difficulties which would be encountered from the official element in the trade union movement by any body of men who tried to get that movement to put its own house in order.  In that memorandum we have this statement:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In interpreting the terms of reference on the above lines, the commission were fully cognisant of all the great difficulties inherent in the proposals, not the least of which difficulties to be encountered will be the fitting into compatible office the various officials who will have to be moved about on the re-organisation.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Accordingly, as I have said, because those difficulties exist, as I think is admitted here, the movement of itself and of its own initiative has not been able to do what the far-sighted and the thinking men in the movement feel ought to be done if Irish trade <Col N="2161" /> unionism is to meet the changed circumstances of our times.  It is because of these personal issues that I feel, and I think most people who have considered this problem will agree with me, that the compulsion and the urge to bring that reorganisation about must come from outside.</P>
    <P>Now, how do we propose to create that compulsive force?  By the very simple expedient of saying to the multitude of unions, with all their conflicting interests, which now constitute the conglomerate of the Irish trade union movement, that there is one simple condition&mdash;the simplest that could be imposed; one which carries in it, I think, the least possible objection in principle&mdash;that you, an organisation purporting to represent a body of workers and proposing to serve their interests, can at least give this justification for your existence: if your workers have to call upon your organisation for help, you will be in a position to help them financially.  If we cannot conduct that sort of inquisition, which even the components of the movement itself have feared to undertake, into the individual affairs of each union, there must be some sort of public indication that the union concerned is a well-managed and effective organisation. The only sort of public indication that can be given in that regard is an earnest, if you like, of the union's financial stability, which, to my mind, carries with it, too, an implication that the affairs of the union have been conducted in a responsible way.</P>
    <P>That is a test which is not applied to the trade union movement alone; it is a very common test in all the affairs of life.  If people propose to undertake works of responsibility, they are often asked to give some bond, some indication, some earnest, some financial guarantee of their ability to fulfil the responsibilities which they are taking upon themselves.  A contractor has very often to enter into a bond, to give some financial guarantee; an insurance company has frequently to do it.  All sorts of people entering into all sorts of contracts have to give that sort of indication as to their financial stability and as to their capacity to fulfil their <Col N="2162" /> undertakings and their engagements to those with whom they make them. That, as I say, is a very common thing. I do not think that any thinking worker, any reflective man in the working classes of this country&mdash;and it is full of them&mdash;will say that the Government are doing any injustice to the workers of the country when they require that those who purport to organise the workers of the country should at least show to the workers themselves, as well as to the Government and to all others with whom they may be concerned, that they have so managed their affairs that they are able to fulfil the simple financial requirements of this Bill.</P>
    <P>If an organisation which purports to speak on behalf of 5,000, 10,000, 15,000 or 20,000 workers is asked to put into the custody of the court a sum varying from £1,000, as it is now in the Bill, to £10,000, how does that adversely affect the interests of its members?  Is it any injustice to an organisation with a membership of 20,000 workers that at least that organisation should be in a position to put down £10,000?  That £10,000, remember, remains the property of the members of the organisation, and I think that the fact that it is there is some guarantee that that organisation will fulfil its obligations to its members as well as to everybody else.</P>
    <P>I cannot for the life of me see how the fundamental proposal in this Bill, that before a body purports to represent the workers of this country, purports to take a very active part in determining the course of the industrial development and organisation of this country, it should put down a substantial sum of money, can possibly be misrepresented as an attack upon the rights and conditions of the workers of the country.  I am perfectly certain that if this issue were put to the Irish working-class people&mdash;mind you, I have a fair idea of what has been happening in Dublin and elsewhere&mdash;they would say that, at any rate, the Minister was only asking what they themselves would ask their unions to do if they had the power, as this legislation has the power, to compel them to do it&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The fundamental principle in the Bill is that before trade unions exercise their powerful influence on the lives of everybody in this country, trade unions which operate, not merely to affect the lives and the livelihood and the interests of their own members, but the reactions of whose policy may be experienced in every household, they should deposit moderate sums, ranging from £1,000 to £10,000, before undertaking the very important task of organising the workers of this country into sectional organisations which admittedly have one purpose.  I am not suggesting it is an ignoble purpose, that of organising these workers in their own sectional interests.</P>
      <P>I am not saying that it is an ignoble process.  It is a humanitarian ideal to lift people of one's own class, to improve the conditions of livelihood, to get for them the best that can be got out of this life, and particularly when it is confined mainly to industrial workers, as the Irish trade union movement, of necessity, must be. Nevertheless, it is a sectional interest, and that is the whole justification for its survival, and the force which makes for its survival is that these sectional interests should predominate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that, when we look at the position and power of the trade union movement in this State, and when we realise the reactions which its policy <Col N="2165" /> may have on the lives and livelihood of every household in Ireland, we must, at least, ensure that there will be a sense of responsibility in the Irish trade union movement, and in all the components of it.  In saying that, I am not suggesting that, as a whole, the trade union movement is not a responsible movement.  I say quite readily&mdash; and I repeat very readily and very sincerely what I have said since the debate on this Bill began&mdash;that it has shown, since the outbreak of war, at any rate, a deep sense of responsibility. I do not believe&mdash;no matter what has been said here for the purposes of the inner politics of the trade union movement, or what may be said from trade union platforms in Dublin, Drogheda, or elsewhere&mdash;the workers of this country, no matter what firebrands may say, are going to lose that sense of responsibility.  I have heard repeated in this House short-sighted statements, ill-considered statements, suggesting that, if this Bill is passed, the Irish workingmen who have gone into the various defence organisations in this country, and who have banded themselves, not to protect me, not to protect Merrion Street, or Leinster House, but their own homes and their own families, are going to withdraw.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>In Dublin during the past couple of weeks I have been stopped by housekeepers who informed me that they found great difficulty in getting paraffin oil or candles.  The difficulty may not have been noticed very much because of the long evenings.  In four or five weeks, however, the evenings will be growing darker, and those who have no electric light or gas in their homes will be left without candle light or lamp light of any description.  Those of us who know the tenement houses and their rickety staircases must imagine what is likely to happen if our people find themselves without either candle light, paraffin oil, or any kind of illuminant in their rooms.  They will not have even firelight, as they will have no fuel.  I raise this question in order to ask the Minister if he has any plan to provide lighting or heating facilities for our people, and if he has a plan whether he will let it be known before it is too late.</P>
      <P>It is well known&mdash;and it has been stated here&mdash;that the raw materials essential for candle manufacture are not in the country.  Otherwise, I would ask the Minister to speed up, if it were possible, the manufacture of very large quantities of candles at home in our own country.  Failing that, I ask him if he will take steps to import sufficient candles&mdash;if he cannot get the paraffin oil&mdash;to overcome the difficulty I have mentioned in the city of Dublin.  It may not be known to the House that the Gas Company is not in a position to take on new customers.  The electric light undertaking is not in a position to do so either, and they have asked for at least a 25 per cent. reduction in consumption. This terrible danger has been noticed in Dublin during the last couple of weeks.</P>
      <P>There may be a rush on the stock of candles.  I would not mention this at all had I not seen a rush on candles already in stock.  In one street candle prices went up within 48 hours from 2/- a lb. to 3/6.  That is an appalling state of affairs for our people in this city.  I know that other members can speak of the difficulties of the country. I ask the Minister if he will take steps immediately&mdash;if it were possible, to do it to-morrow morning&mdash;to arrange the price of candles already in stock and see that there is no additional charge on the people because of the scarcity. How the Minister will do it I have not the slightest knowledge, but I think some warning should be given that there shall be no increase in prices and that those who are already provided with gas or electricity should not buy the candles that are in the city at the present moment.  They may make them more scarce by doing so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I mentioned the question of lighting by coal and by fire-grates and the little light in the tenement quarters.  That matter of fuel was touched on to-day <Col N="2181" /> and I do not intend to go into it in detail at all, but it is appalling to think, in six or eight weeks from now, as I said before, as well as having empty fire-grates and empty lamps, the people will have empty candlesticks also.  I ask the Minister to let the House know of any programme he may have in regard to this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to tell the Minister that I have my own experience on this matter.  I understand the Minister is just as keen to rectify this state of affairs as I am. Things are rather serious as far as the poor people in the cities are concerned. I noticed an incident in Cork about a fortnight ago when a cargo of coal came in.  The merchant in question, undoubtedly, gave coal to the poor people, but other merchants would only supply those who were registered with them.  The merchant who gave out his coal had to call on the Guards for a few days afterwards.</P>

      <P>I am sorry.  I have seen a similar situation with regard to paraffin oil.  The footpath outside a shop which was selling paraffin oil was crowded by people waiting to get a supply and a Guard had to keep order. The traffic was held up.  If those scenes were to continue, they might develop in a serious way and the sooner the position is dealt with the better.  While we all recognise the difficulties, the sooner we deal with these matters and introduce some method of controlling the supply to these poor people, the better we shall be able to deal with them as time goes on.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Some Deputies may not be aware that in parts of rural Ireland <Col N="2182" /> there has not been a candle for two months.  That is not the Minister's fault and I do not see the point of making representations to the Minister unless one can make suggestions as to how the hardships can be mitigated. There are, I understand, six ships on our register, some of which will reach this country soon.  I understand that the Minister attaches prime importance to the cargoes of wheat which these ships are to bring but there are certain commodities, amongst which I put paraffin wax, of which one cargo would be sufficient for 12 months' supply and I deliberately suggest to the Minister that, in regard to one mixed cargo, consisting of things like paraffin wax, anaesthetics and things of comparatively modest bulk, a cargo of which would give us about 12 months' supply, we should, if necessary, forego one week's supply of wheat, which would be about 6,000 tons, and make up our minds that there are certain things such as paraffin wax which we must bring from the U.S.A. as urgently as wheat.  I should be glad if the Minister would tell us what are our annual requirements of paraffin wax in the form of candles within the restricted scheme and whether one cargo would not bring to us sufficient paraffin wax for the candles we require or sufficient, at least, to provide one candle for every kitchen or tenement room where the circumstances require it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Hannigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I merely want to ask the Minister when he became aware of the shortage of raw materials for the manufacture of candles and what steps, if any, he has taken since to deal with the shortage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Minister for Supplies (Mr. Lemass) Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Supplies (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Byrne will understand that other members of this House are fully aware of the inconvenience which a shortage of these two commodities&mdash; candles and paraffin oil&mdash;means to <Col N="2183" /> household which are not equipped for the utilisation of electricity or gas for illumination purposes, and that we are all as anxious as he is to remedy that position&mdash;if it is possible to remedy it. There is not much use in Deputy Byrne, or other Deputies, asking me to import materials for the manufacture of candles, or to import paraffin oil to make good the deficiency now existing. I shall import them if I can.  The question is whether it will be possible to do so, and I can only inform the House of what the prospects are, because there can be no certainity that any arrangements made for the importation of any commodity will, in fact, work out successfully.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In answer to Deputy Hannigan, the shortage of paraffin wax began when the British Government decided they would sell no more to us.  From that period until now no paraffin wax has been imported from Great Britain, nor has it been possible to import any paraffin wax from elsewhere because of the absence of shipping facilities to countries other than the United Kingdom. Because of the imminence of a shortage, arrangements were made with the candle manufacturers to conserve existing stocks.  We standardised the production of candles to the maximum possible extent, eliminating the manufacture of certain types of candles altogether in order to make the best use of the available stocks.  The manufacture of candles was restricted to 50 per cent. of the normal output, and that restriction upon deliveries by manufacturers to their customers has now been in operation for some months.  The full effect of the restriction was not felt by consumers because stocks in the hands of traders were finding their way into consumption. These stocks have, presumably, become exhausted now.  We have investigated the possibility of substituting native tallow for imported materials used in the manufacture of candles and the manufacturers are agreed that while it would not be possible for them to produce an all-tallow candle, they can use tallow in substitution for imported materials to <Col N="2184" /> an extent ranging from 20 per cent. to 50 per cent. according to the type of the candle.  Arrangements for that substitution are at present in operation. The existing stocks of candles, or of materials for the manufacture of candles, in the hands of manufacturers are sufficient to meet about two months' normal consumption.  On the basis of the existing restrictions on deliveries, that supply will keep production going for four months.</P>
    <P>The normal production of candles in this country requires the importation of 3,650 tons of paraffin wax per annum. Other materials than paraffin wax are required in lesser quantities&mdash;but required nevertheless.  Having regard to the existing restriction on the sale of paraffin for household purposes, the demand for candles would, if it could be satisfied, be far in excess of the normal.  Arrangements are being made for the shipment of a quantity of paraffin wax by neutral vessels to the port of Lisbon, whence it is hoped to transport it in Irish owned vessels to this country.  The earliest date by which these arrangements could produce a sufficient quantity of paraffin wax to affect production here would be towards the end of October.  It is exceedingly difficult to expedite these arrangements, having regard to the difficulty of procuring space in ships to Lisbon, the difficulty of procuring storage in Lisbon and the restricted shipping facilities we can make available for the transport of goods from Lisbon.</P>
    <P>I do not want to discuss at any length Deputy Dillon's suggestion that wheat cargoes should be substituted by cargoes of paraffin wax and other commodities in short supply.  It is very easy to decide in prospect to do without some commodity when there is no shortage of it at the moment in order to get supplies of another commodity of which there is a shortage but I think the fundamentally sound policy is to make sure of our wheat position before utilising any of the shipping space at our disposal for the importation of other goods.  I think our wheat position is such that we can utilise the Lisbon route entirely for the importation <Col N="2185" /> of goods other than wheat but it is an expensive method of importation. There are not merely considerable difficulties in operating it but there are very considerable risks involved which somebody has to carry and private interests are sometimes reluctant to take these risks without an assurance that the shipping accommodation required for transportation from Lisbon can be made available very shortly after the arrival of cargoes in that port.</P>
    <P>That is the position.  Nothing can be done that I know of to remedy it.  We have a sufficient number of candles in the hands of manufacturers and a sufficient stock of materials for the manufacture of candles in the hands of manufacturers to maintain a 50 per cent. production for four months.  By the end of four months we may, if we are fortunate, have succeeded in bringing in from America supplies of materials sufficient to improve the position.</P>
    <P>So far as kerosene is concerned, nothing can be done.  The quantity of kerosene which we can import is not under our control.  It depends entirely on the facilities which the oil companies can place at our disposal.  The existing stock of kerosene in the country is sufficient to provide the requirements of harvesting machines.  I think all Deputies will agree that it is essential that the kerosene required for the operation of tractors and harvesting machines should be made available so that the harvest will not be lost.  It was in order to ensure that a sufficient stock of kerosene for the requirements of the harvest would be available that it was necessary to take the very drastic step of restricting deliveries to traders selling paraffin for household purposes.  When the harvesting operations are completed, or when those operating harvesting machines have had delivered to them a sufficiency of kerosene to enable them to complete these operations, and if supplies arrive in the meantime, it will be possible to resume deliveries of kerosene to traders for sale for domestic purposes on some restricted basis.  I cannot guarantee that supplies will arrive.  We <Col N="2186" /> have reason to think they will, but the situation has become so uncertain that there can be no guarantee that they will come.  Supplies of all petroleum products have been very irregular and uncertain for a number of weeks past, and unless the oil companies are able to make good the deficiences in their delivery programme in the very near future, there will be a really serious situation not merely in respect of paraffin but in respect to all petroleum products.</P>
    <P>The price of candles is fixed.  I cannot say offhand what the price is, but it is fixed at so much per lb., and if Deputy Byrne finds that overcharges are taking place for candles on the part of particular traders, if he will give me the names of traders I shall see that the necessary legal proceedings are taken.  Reference has been made to the possibility of introducing a rationing scheme for candles and kerosene.  I do not want to say that it is impossible to ration one or other of these commodities, but Deputies who speak lightly of the introduction of a rationing scheme had better understand that it is not at all an easy thing to operate.  So far as I know, no country has succeeded in devising a satisfactory scheme for rationing commodities of that kind, commodities which are used by a minority of households. Clearly if you fix a flat rate per head, everybody will avail of the ration and it will have to be fixed at a very low level, much lower than would be possible if you could confine the distribution of these commodities to those who really need them.  On the other hand, the preparation of a list of households where candles and kerosene are essential because of the absence of other means of lighting would involve a house-to-house inspection of the country which would have to be resumed periodically, which could not be undertaken without very elaborate organisation and which would take a very long time.  My officers are trying to work out some system of controlling distribution so as to ensure that a supply will be available where that supply is a necessity, even if the scheme we can devise will not be completely foolproof <Col N="2187" /> or knave-proof.  I cannot at this stage say whether we shall be successful in devising such a scheme.  If any Deputy has ideas to offer as to how a system of rationing, or rather how a system of controlling the distribution of candles and kerosene can be worked out, I shall be very glad to receive their ideas.  I confess myself that the difficulties which appear inherent in perfecting such a scheme are very great and I have not been able to see my way clearly through them.  The very best I, or any officer in my service, can do is to devise a system which might work out with a 50 per cent. degree of accuracy&mdash;certainly not more than that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That, of course, does not get over the difficulty with which Deputy Byrne is concerned&mdash;the city difficulty.  It is, of course, possible to work out a system which would require a great deal of time to operate or a very large number of officers to make effective.  Any such system cannot be adopted at present as it would not be <Col N="2188" /> practicable to devise it within a reasonable time.  The position is that an attempt is being made to work out a rationing system.  A rationing system does not mean that there will be supplies and a rationing scheme, of course, will be ineffective unless supplies are available.  So far as supplies are concerned I hope that we shall be able to resume the delivery of kerosene to traders for sale for domestic purposes during the month of September. So far as candles are concerned supplies are available for a 50 per cent. distribution during the next few months and we hope to continue these supplies for a further period if we can import the necessary quantity of paraffin wax from America.</P>
