      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether the Government have considered the reports of the Banking Commission, and, if so, whether he is in a position to indicate the Government's policy in relation to the several reports.</P>

      <P>I would refer the Deputy to my reply to a similar question by Deputy Davin on the 2nd October last.  I regret that I am unable to add anything to my statement on that occasion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the Minister's reply, would he tell the House whether he proposes at an early date to indicate the Government's attitude to the several reports submitted to him by this Banking Commission which exhaustively reviewed the whole financial position of the State over a period of some years?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have said here before, several aspects of the recommendations <Col N="2" /> made by the Banking Commission have been under consideration by the Government, but in view of the upset in normal business during the period of the emergency no conclusions have been arrived at with regard to quite a number of the matters which have been under consideration.  On some of them there have been conclusions arrived at, and it is hoped that at some date in the future&mdash;I will not say an early date&mdash;legislation may be introduced in connection with them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance (a) when was the report of the Drainage Commission submitted to the Minister; (b) whether the Government has yet considered that report; (c) when the report will be published; (d) whether the Minister is in a position to state when he expects action to be taken on the recommendations made by the commission.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>The report of the Drainage Commission was presented to <Col N="3" /> me on the 16th August, 1940, but consideration of the report by the Government has not yet been completed.  It is not, therefore, possible to indicate when the report will be published, or when such action as may be considered desirable on the commission's recommendations will be taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Do I understand the Minister to imply that the report has been considered but it has not been fully considered?  The language used by the Minister was that it has not been completely considered. Does that imply that it has got a considerable amount of consideration from the Government?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, the fact is that it has got some consideration departmentally, but none by the Government as a Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a matter which was looked on as of considerable urgency for a variety of reasons.  Does not the Minister consider it is urgent now, as more damage is being done every year owing to the fact that no work is being undertaken, pending action under this report?  Has the Government not considered it worth its while in the last seven or eight months to give any consideration whatsoever to this report?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be wrong to say that the Government did not consider it worth its while.  I have not had time, as Minister for Finance, to examine it, and until it has been examined by my Department and by myself, and until certain recommendations which I will probably make to the Government have been prepared, the Government itself cannot consider it, and it has not arrived at that stage yet.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the Minister's reply, will the Minister advert <Col N="4" /> to the fact that the work which might probably be undertaken on the recommendations of the Drainage Commission would contribute more materially than any other scheme to the relief of unemployment, which has been exacerbated by the crisis, and bearing that in mind will he expedite consideration of this report and action upon it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid I cannot accept the Deputy's premises, and therefore I cannot accept his conclusions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the drainage work envisaged will employ a very large volume of direct labour?  I think the Parliamentary Secretary will say that drainage work is one thing which consumes more labour than almost any other relief scheme.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">

    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>In addition to the matter of unemployment, I would ask the Minister to consider this point &mdash;I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary will at least agree to this&mdash;that every season which passes creates more damage in a number of the rivers of this country, and consequently will pile on the expenses if the Government ever finds time to consider this report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he is aware that the Barrow Drainage Ratepayers' Association gave evidence before the Drainage Commission with reference to their case for a reduction in the drainage charge, and, in view of the unsatisfactory state of this problem and the possibility of the Drainage Commission having dealt in their report with this aspect of the case, he will have the report published immediately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the first part of the question is in the affirmative. I am not in a position to state when it will be possible to publish the Report of the Drainage Commission; as already indicated in my reply to Deputy Davin on the 5th February, the question of publication must be deferred pending consideration of the report by the Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Fogarty</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if he is aware that notice was issued to the tenants of 18 new houses built by the board of health at Templetwohy, Templemore, County Tipperary, to have their plots tilled, and whether he is further aware that these tenants have no plots.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>In a circular letter issued by my Department on 31st January last it was suggested that the board should advise the tenants of labourers' cottages to till their plots to the fullest extent possible.  The issue of such notices is entirely a matter for the board of health.  As regards the latter part of the question, I am aware that of the 18 cottages provided at Templetwohy the gardens are small, but I understand that the six largest plots which comprise 16 perches each are well tilled.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health whether he is aware that the Balrothery Board of Guardians have on several recent occasions made a nomination to the vacancy for caretaker in the Balrothery Dispensary, and if he will state why he insists on declining to allow the appointment to be made.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Dr. Ward)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is assumed that the Deputy refers to the appointment of a caretaker for the Balbriggan Dispensary and in that event the reply to the first part of the question is in the affirmative.  When the post of caretaker in Balbriggan Dispensary became vacant application was received from the Balbriggan Nursing Association requesting that the living rooms in the dispensary be given to the Jubilee nurse.  This application was supported by the recommendation of the dispensary medical officer.  The Jubilee nurse does general nursing, tuberculosis work and public health work.  The rooms which she <Col N="7" /> occupies at present are small with no water supply, and no sanitary accommodation. She is unable to attend her patients in those rooms and the medical officer gave her permission to examine and dress her patients in the living apartments in the dispensary, where she sees patients from 9 to 10 o'clock every morning and at any other time during the day that her services are required.  If anyone else is appointed as caretaker and occupies those apartments the Jubilee nurse will be unable to attend her patients there.  It is for these reasons that it was suggested to the board that the vacancy for a caretaker be filled by the Jubilee nurse, and I see no reason why the board of assistance should not comply with that suggestion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>

      <P>The Minister has explained that an application was made to him for an increase in the price of flake oatmeal on the ground that the cost of the oats had gone up and there was a decrease in the price of offals.  He stated that he had considered those representations and had authorised an increase.  I am now asking him what were the offals&mdash;what was their volume and how much did they go down in price?

As regards the second part of the question the Deputy will have observed that for September, 1939, and subsequent months, a summary only of imports and exports has been issued.  On grounds of public policy, it has been decided not to publish for the present, in any form, more details than are given in this summary.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Supplies if he will state whether he is aware that workers in the City of Dublin who depend upon bellmen distributors of coal, are still not able to get their normal quantities of coal, are unable to use the quantity of slack that is included, and are not able to obtain turf, and if he will receive a deputation of representatives of the bellmen for the purpose of discussing and removing the causes of this unsatisfactory state of affairs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware that the position is as stated in the first part of the question.</P>
      <P>Arrangements have now been made by my Department with the Dublin coal merchants to ensure adequate supplies of coal and turf for the poorer classes of the community in Dublin who normally purchase their coal supplies from bellmen or hucksters.  The arrangements are calculated to give these consumers first preference both in regard to quantity and quality, and to maintain prices at the lowest possible level.</P>
      <P>While every effort is being made and will be made to have coal of a suitable quality supplied to bellmen, our efforts in this respect must be governed by the type of coal available.</P>
      <P>A deputation from bellmen was received in my Department a few weeks ago when the difficulties experienced by these traders were fully discussed.  Since then no complaints have been received in my Department nor any request to receive a further deputation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it is necessary for the Deputy to ask that question.

Is he further aware that some of the coal they have had to distribute to their purchasers cannot be burned, that in a ton of it, it is not possible to get a dozen two-inch cubes of coal, that the greater part of it is slack, that before a woman attempting to light it is able to get it lighted, it has fallen through the bars of the grate, with the result that a number of bellmen have been asked by the people whom they supplied to take it away and that that is the position in spite of the fact that, in the last two months, the price of coal to bellmen has gone up by 11/-?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is correct that we cannot now obtain in this country the qualities of coal which we were accustomed to purchase.  We shall have to take whatever qualities of coal we can get.  We have made arrangements to ensure that a full 100 per cent. of supplies will be available for bellmen in Dublin, that a proportion of every cargo that comes in will be allocated for the purpose of supplying them. The price at which the coal will be given to them has been fixed by order and the price at which they will sell the coal has been fixed.  All possible arrangements so that first preference in relation to quality, quantity and price will be given to the poorer consumers who buy from these traders have been completed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me say this: The bellmen, when they were conducting discussions with my Department, were quite reasonable in recognising that some quantity of slack would have to be taken with coal, and they themselves suggested that they would be agreeable to take up to 50 per cent. in certain circumstances, but objection was taken to having to take more.  The arrangement which was made, and which they regarded as satisfactory, did provide for some quantity of slack being provided.</P>

      <P>Perhaps the Minister might indicate what would constitute an emergency service.

Is there any indication to these people as to what would constitute an emergency service?  I will give the Minister a case I have in mind.  A bomb drops in Terenure.  There is no state of war.  There might conceivably be an emergency service there. If a bomb dropped out in Inchicore, would there be an emergency for the man in Terenure?

      <P>My difficulty in answering Deputy Doyle's question was my inability to understand what type of emergency service he had in mind.  If the Deputy is thinking of ambulances, fire brigades and vehicles used for services of that kind, arrangements have been made to ensure that their petrol supplies will be provided. Arrangements have also been made in various parts of the country to ensure that certain stocks of petrol will be available for use in cars placed at the disposal of other Government services.

Further measures to secure the fullest possible utilisation of turf by fuel-users in the turf-producing areas are being prepared, and will be announced in due course.

      <P>As the Deputy is, no doubt, aware, the duty on horse-drawn mowing machines was imposed as a protective measure in connection with the production of agricultural machinery generally in this country.  I have no reason to believe that the number of mowing machines in the country, together with the output of our manufacturers of agricultural machinery during the present year, will not be sufficient to meet the demand for these machines for the harvest.  At the moment, therefore, I see no reason to recommend the removal of the duty, but I am keeping the position under close observation.</P>
      <P>I may mention for the information of the Deputy, that the position regarding agricultural machinery was considered shortly after the outbreak of the war, and, with a view to facilitating the farming community in the effort for increased food production, the duty on agricultural machines was amended, so as to secure that all parts of agricultural machines (other than plough parts) would be free of duty, if the value of the parts did not exceed £2.

Is he further aware that some of the largest manufacturers of mowing machines have indicated that they will not attempt to jump the tariff barrier this year, and will not send any new machines, because it is not worth while, even if the tariff barrier was not there, as they can sell their entire production in England without facing any tariff?</P>

      <P>It is not proposed to publish the report of the commission which was set up to investigate the deposits of calcium phosphate which exist in County Clare as the facts disclosed in the report relate in part to property which is in private ownership. As regards the other part of the question the information asked for involves certain difficulties, and I would be glad if the Deputy would repeat the question in about a week's time.</P>

      <P>In regard to the latter part of the reply I appreciate what the Parliamentary Secretary says, and I will be glad to have the question repeated, but, as to the first part, surely the fact that valuable mineral deposits are in private ownership is no reason why their nature should <Col N="22" /> not be communicated to the House and to the community, inasmuch as Oireachtas Eireann has invested in the appropriate Minister power compulsorily to acquire the property if the Oireachtas thinks it so desirable.  How are we to make up our minds as to whether it should be acquired for the benefit of the State if the Minister will not tell us what the nature of the report is?  In the case of Slievardagh deposits action was taken.</P>

I do not think that we are entitled to disclose facts which affect people who are not in the public service or in regard to deposits which are on private property.  I do not think we are entitled to disclose the private affairs of any man in this House.</P>

Will the Parliamentary Secretary, who is apparently looking for information to investigate the matter, ask the Department of Justice to obtain the information for him, because then he will have authoritative information and official information?</P>

    <Speaker pid="TimothyJosephODonova" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture if he will state whether in view of the shortage of potassic manure this season, together with the possibility of a further curtailment of supplies in the future, he will take immediate steps to have the 1941 crop of seaweed harvested for kelp manufacture in April and May next when the weed is at its best, thereby ensuring a sufficient quantity of this valuable product for the 1942 season.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan) James Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>Previous experience of the cost of harvesting seaweed and converting it into kelp for the manufacture of iodine showed that the by-product, kelp potash, could be made available at an economic price for manurial purposes. It is understood, however, that a remunerative market is not at present available for iodine and, accordingly, that if the unextracted kelp is used for manurial purposes, the entire cost would have to be borne by the farmer.</P>
      <P>Having regard to the comparatively low potash content of ground kelp, it is not considered that farmers would be justified in paying for this product a price commensurate with the cost involved in gathering the seaweed and in the subsequent preparation of the kelp.  Furthermore, it is considered that there will be an adequate demand for seaweed for direct application to the land within reasonable distance of our coasts and also for all the dried seaweed which is likely to be produced during the coining season.  Not only is the potash made available when the seaweed is used in this way, but the valuable organic matter, including nitrogenous compounds, which is lost in the manufacture of kelp is also retained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyJosephODonova" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister realises that without potash manures for beet, potatoes, wheat, or any other crops it will be practically impossible to grow them in the course of a year or two; that we are facing a situation in which we may not have any potash manures coming in for years; and that we are also facing a period of unemployment? <Col N="28" /> Along the seaboard where this kelp could be manufactured, even if seaweed is carried away for manurial purposes, there are thousands of tons still which could be used for the manufacture of kelp which would help us to produce the crops of beet and wheat required.  No matter what the cost is, it should be undertaken.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister consider a scheme of desiccation of seaweed for the purpose of transport inland if its conversion into kelp is considered undesirable, bearing in mind the fact referred to by Deputy O'Donovan that it may be years before we can get supplies of potash manures again?  Although it is true that we might be able to get root crops for a year or two years out of the accumulated potash reserves in the soil, I think the Minister will agree that after that it will be vital to provide some artificial potash.  Bearing that in mind, surely this matter of seaweed should be further looked into.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is being looked into and will be further looked into.  I think the Deputy will realise that, if it is possible to grow a root crop for this year without potash, it will be possible for seven or eight years to come, because very few farmers in this country will have so much tillage that they will have to go over the same land for seven or eight years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I will grow a rotation of crops.  But, if it is five years under tillage, surely in the last three years of that period it is going to be materially reduced in productivity if I exhaust the potash content of the land in the first two years and take no steps to restore it in the subsequent three years?</P>

      <P>Would the Minister not consider a scheme whereby seaweed would be saved, even if it is not economic?  We are doing a lot of things now that normally would not be considered economic.  What about the number of people who are on unemployment assistance and home assistance? Would it not be better for them to be gathering seaweed and selling it by auction to those who will buy it, even in its raw state?  Every bit of it will be bought.</P>

      <P>In the Dublin morning papers and the <i>Cork Examiner</i> of the 21st and 22nd February and the <i>Sunday Independent</i> of the 23rd February a special display notice appeared in which I impressed upon stock owners the necessity for reporting promptly any suspicious cases of the disease to the nearest Gárda Siochána. That notice also described the first symptoms of the disease to attract attention and urged stock owners to keep a strict watch for any of the symptoms mentioned amongst their live stock.  I propose to issue a similar notice this week.</P>

      <P>Hunting and coursing have been prohibited in the 11 counties which have been scheduled.  It is not proposed to take any general action in regard to racing under the rules or coursing held on enclosed courses except where such courses are in close proximity to farms on which outbreaks of foot-and-mouth disease have taken place, such as Naas.

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>As supplies of root seeds are still being imported, it is not possible to state the total quantity of such seeds that will be available for the coming season.  In spite of all the efforts made to obtain supplies, it is probable that the quantity procurable will be less than in previous seasons. With economy in use and particularly with lighter seeding, it is hoped, however, that the available supplies will be reasonably adequate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>If there is the danger of a scarcity, I think the Minister should take this opportunity of recommending farmers to grow other crops which will give a heavy yield, such as potatoes.  A statement appeared in the newspapers to the effect that the Minister's Department was of opinion that mangels could be sown at the rate of £5 an acre.  I think it would be impossible to do that.  If there is the danger of a scarcity of mangel and turnip seed, then farmers should be recommended to grow other crops.</P>

      <P>Surely the Minister is aware that no stocks of seed have come to the country this year from the original sources of supply, and that we have to depend on the United States for any mangel seed that we may get. Are farmers expected to sow a strain that they do not know anything about? They do not know whether it will grow <Col N="33" /> or not in this country.  I would not like to say anything that would embarrass the Minister, but really the position is serious for the country.  The sooner we know the truth the better.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture if, in view of the likely shortage of small seeds for future use, he will take immediate steps to prepare a plan so as to ensure the production of these seeds by selected growers in areas suited to the production of the specific crop and in addition provide the necessary technical information requisite for such specialised work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that root and vegetable seeds can be grown in all districts throughout the country and that seedsmen are making arrangements for the production of seeds for sowing in 1942.  I think, however, that in order to provide against a shortage individual farmers should be encouraged to provide their own requirements, particularly of turnip, mangel and cabbage seeds.  A special leaflet dealing with the production of root and vegetable seeds has, accordingly, been prepared and copies are now being distributed by my Department.  A copy will be sent to any individual farmer making application for this leaflet, and the county agricultural and horticultural instructors will give any further assistance required.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister consider the proposal embodied in my question, namely, that he should select certain individuals in certain areas to produce seed for the coming year in the same way that the Sugar Beet Company select beet growers to grow beet seed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as we could do it, a number of the seedsmen in the country have been encouraged to do that.  They are doing a certain amount.  It is possible, however, that they will not produce enough for some of the principal crops such as mangels, turnips and cabbages.  That is why we are advising farmers to produce their own seed.  If any Deputy takes the trouble to read the leaflet that has been issued, I think he will come to the conclusion that it is quite a simple matter to produce seed, and that farmers will not even require help from the county instructors.  Deputies will also, I think, come to the conclusion that the instructors will be able to do this without any further training.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Retail distributors of fertilisers have been advised by the manufacturers that available supplies of superphosphate and of compound manures should, as far as possible, be reserved for tillage crops.  State intervention as between the retail distributor and his farmer customer is not regarded as practicable.  It is, however, the desire of the Government that retail distributors of fertilisers should, as far as possible, distribute the available quantities among their customers proportionately to the requirements of each for tillage crops, and in this connection should have regard to the quantity supplied to each of their customers last season.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Generally, the retailers, as far as I can find out, have distributed these manures in a reasonably fair way.  Complaints have been made. Some of them have been investigated. If it is found that retailers are not distributing manures according to their usual practice&mdash;giving them in the same proportion that they sold them last year and on the same terms roughly&mdash; then I intend to have these cases brought to the attention of the manure distributors.  I do not know if the manure distributors can take any action against these retailers this year, but I hope they will be able to take appropriate action against them next year if they are not acting fairly towards their customers.  With regard to Deputy Hughes's question, 50 per cent. has been distributed.  There will be more, but I am not in a position to say what it will be.</P>

The Parliamentary Secretary may say that is not primarily a matter for his Department; but the island of Cape Clear is purely a Gaeltacht area, one of the few surviving strongholds of the Gael in that part of the country, and I think the Parliamentary Secretary and his Department have some special obligations to the people there.  The distance between Cape Clear and the mainland is about <Col N="43" /> nine miles.  Even in tolerably good weather it is a dangerous passage.  For the last year and a half owing to the absence of a suitable boat, the passage has been made by people at very considerable risk.  I think the Parliamentary Secretary would bring a good deal of credit to his Department, or at least dissipate a good deal of the prejudice that prevails against it, if he did something practical to remedy that matter, which has been brought to the notice of the Government time and again. There has been an almost endless stream of correspondence between the local priest, the board of health, the Gaeltacht Department and the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  I should like to know the reason of the delay and if anything has been done within recent months to give facilities to the islanders.</P>
    <P>I am not satisfied with the position of what are described as rural industries; I do not believe they are being carried on with the necessary degree of interest or enthusiasm.  There have been complaints in certain places in West Cork, where the industries have been established, regarding the buildings in which they are housed and the general equipment, and it has been said that the general atmosphere of desolation that surrounds them makes it impossible for any enthusiasm or interest to be sustained.  I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will give some indication of how we could endeavour to offset in some way the terribly devastating effects of unemployment. Unemployment is daily increasing and perhaps we could, to some extent, at least, counter that by endeavouring to foster employment in the Gaeltacht areas.</P>
    <P>In a great many of the Gaeltacht areas after this week people in receipt of unemployment assistance will get no further assistance of that sort.  Certain areas have been scheduled as exempt from that provision, but a great many of the people in those areas will have no prospect of assistance unless they make an application through the home assistance officer to the board of health, a body already considerably <Col N="44" /> burdened.  I think the Parliamentary Secretary should avail of this opportunity to show, in the existing situation, what steps his Department will take to increase employment and do something for people who are abandoned, people to whom we give lip service occasionally at meetings, telling them how bravely they are carrying on the old Gaelic traditions and then giving them, as a reward for that, the cold shoulder and ignoring every reasonable demand they may make. This Department ought to disappear if it does not do something to justify itself.  I cannot see any evidence, from the contact I have had with the Department, that it has justified itself or that it is entitled to the consideration or sympathy of the Dáil.</P>

      <P>I wish to draw the Parliamentary Secretary's attention to a certain grievance that he may not be in a position to deal with directly, but I should like him to use the good offices of his Department in trying to get it remedied.  I refer to the transportation of fish from the Aran Islands to the mainland.

I do not know if they are being shown, but I have not seen one new design this year.  One would have expected the new patterns and designs <Col N="46" /> for the current season to be shown before now, but any pattern I see is last year's.  One shop in O'Connell Street last year had a splendid selection and I have been watching those windows and hoping to see something new, but I have not seen them at all this year.  Our friends in Nassau Street are showing them, but so far as I can see, these also are last year's designs. Money is provided here for designs and I should like to hear what the Parliamentary Secretary has to say about them.  Are they manufacturing tweeds this year at all?  Is this yarn for the manufacture of tweeds for commercial purposes or solely for the purposes of the Army?</P>

      <P>With regard to marketing, one item which, I suppose, could be discussed is the provision of facilities for getting to these central markets.  Deputy Murphy has raised the question of facilities for getting from Cape Clear Island to the mainland, and I may be referred back to another Department in this respect because, from time to time, there was a boat service which began with the Posts and Telegraphs Department, then went to the Fisheries Department and finally the Parliamentary Secretary's Department was responsible for its upkeep.  Between the lot, the service has got into a very bad position and I want to suggest here that, if it is within his province, the matter should get careful and prompt consideration from the Parliamentary Secretary.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanOGrady" hpid="Mr. O'Grady Mr. O'Grady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Grady</NameTxt>
      <P>Firstly, I should like to apologise to Deputy Murphy if he did not get a copy of my statement, as I understand is the case.  The translation was to have been circulated. This is a mere token Vote of £10 to authorise my Department to expend certain sums which come in by way of Appropriations-in-Aid, the money being required principally to enable us to lay in stocks of essential materials to meet the expanding market for our industries. I am glad to inform the House that the market is growing and the volume of business increasing.  It has increased considerably during the past few years.  In reply to Deputy Murphy with regard to the boat service between Cape Clear Island and the <Col N="48" /> mainland, I should like to point out that the service terminated because the boat had got into a state of disrepair. It had become unseaworthy and it was necessary to have it repaired.  That work was undertaken some considerable time ago, but it has taken a considerable time to have the repairs carried out.  They have, however, now I understand, been completed and it is only a question of providing the necessary life-saving apparatus for the boat in order to put it into operation again. As the Deputy pointed out, the matter concerns another Department as well as mine, but I can assure him and Deputy O'Neill that there has been no unnecessary delay.  As a matter of fact, I personally went down to the area, as the Deputy is aware, to look into the matter.</P>
      <P>Deputy Bartley raised the question of the transport of fish from the Áran Islands.  I do not propose to go into that matter, except to assure the Deputy that anything my Department can do, in co-operation with any other Department, to help any such project will be done.  I should like to refer briefly to Deputy McMenamin's remarks with regard to manufacture of potash from kelp, although the matter might more appropriately be raised on another occasion.  Immediately on the outbreak of war, I convened a conference with representatives of the various Departments concerned with a view to having this potash produced. The matter was gone into very fully and we discovered that it would cost something like double the normal price at which this potash could be obtained elsewhere, and, because of that, it was considered inadvisable to proceed with it.  Deputy McMenamin inquired about designs.  I should point out that there our scope is limited because of the amount of material available.  But I think our designs are as good as any on the market.  That opinion is shared by others.  I am sure Deputy McMenamin will be amazed to learn that that is the opinion held by no less a person than one of his leaders, Deputy Dillon.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMenamin Mr. McMenamin">

      <P>We have changed the design.  That brought in new business and, as a result, our sales are increasing. According to the Report of the Public Accounts Committee for June 27th, 1940, of which Deputy Dillon is chairman, he said at that meeting:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;With regard to sub-head F (2)&mdash; Advertising and Publicity, we have often made severe criticisms of many Gaeltacht products, and I think it is right to mention now that some of the tweeds they are producing are beyond praise.  They are splendid tweeds.  Some of the stuff they did produce was awful.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>He stated later:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Despite my patriotic inclinations, I would not be wearing it unless it was first class.  Astonishingly enough, they are now competing, and competing very well, with factory products in Great Britain.  Some of their products are equal to the best products of some of the best factories in England, and they are beating them on the Continent.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I am sure Deputy McMenamin will be surprised to hear that tribute coming from Deputy Dillon.</P>

      <P>I certainly have. While I do not claim to be an authority, I have read the statement made by a leader of the Opposition who is an authority on the subject. The only other matter was that raised by Deputy Flynn with regard to housing.  Like every other Department concerned with housing we were up against difficulties which were not of our making.  They had reference to the provision of materials.  In this respect I think we have given a lead <Col N="50" /> to other Departments of State and to other people interested in building.  A number of houses of entirely new design have been erected by the Department in the Gaeltacht.  For that purpose we utilised entirely native materials, and excluded some materials hitherto considered indispensable, but which are now unobtainable.  A few houses have been erected in Deputy Flynn's constituency in West Kerry and others in West Mayo.  The design has enabled us to reduce the cost at which these houses can be erected, and incidentally made it possible for people still to continue to avail of the grant, despite the increasing cost of materials.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Broderick</NameTxt>
      <P>On this stage of the Bill I wish the Minister would clear up some points that seem involved.  They affect property that in all probability will change the amount of rateable valuation which will lose in capital value.  Take the question of the Agricultural Grant.  At the outset it was stated that all newly incorporated land would get the benefit of the Agricultural Grant announced in this Bill, and that the rates would be half the city rates, which are now 25/-.  That would leave a rateable charge of 12/-. I understand that the Agricultural Grant is a uniform grant over the entire State, approximately 6/8 in the £ on agricultural land.  In this case Cork City will be receiving 5/4 in the £.  Is there to be a special State grant to make up the Agricultural Grant or is the balance to be met by the ratepayers of Cork?  Is the benefit to be applied uniformly as in the case of the Greater Dublin Act?  By Section 67 of the Act of 1930 all agricultural type of land is to get the benefit of 50 per cent of the city rate.  I see nothing in the Greater Dublin Act that exempts any portion of land.  It refers to all land within the urban area and draws no distinction about land that is newly incorporated.  It affects Cork in a very acute way because up to 1919 the agricultural ratepayers were only liable for one-third of the rates.  Since 1919 they are liable for the entire rate.  It would be interesting to know under what circumstances the agricultural ratepayers were compelled to pay three times their former rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are three points on which I would like some information.  The first is, is the increase of the Agricultural Grant in the City of Cork from 6/8 to 12/- in the £ to be met from State funds by a special Agricultural Grant for Cork City, or is it to be met by a levy on the rates of Cork City itself? The second point is this.  In the Greater Dublin Act, which I assume is practically the same as this Bill, does the provision that agricultural land is to be only levied 50 per cent. of the rate of the city apply uniformly to newly incorporated land and the land already in the city?  The third point is one to which I am sure everyone <Col N="54" /> interested in this matter will be anxious that the Minister should give a very definite and categorical reply. Power has been taken under the Bill to set up an inquiry.  When the report of that inquiry is received by the Minister, the view held by many, although I do not agree with that view, is that the Minister can, in a mandatory fashion, on the report of his inspector, prescribe what the new boundary is to be.  Everyone interested will be anxious for the Minister to give a clear and definite undertaking that when the report is received any Order which is going to be made will be submitted for consideration and debate in this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyLinehan" hpid="Mr. Linehan Mr. Linehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Linehan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Broderick informed me when he raised these points on the Second Stage of the Bill that the Minister had given an undertaking of some kind or another that if an inquiry was held and a report made there would be some type of submission to the House of the findings of that inquiry before the Minister made the Order.  I suggested to Deputy Broderick that once this Bill was passed the Bill would be law, and any decision come to at the inquiry could be there and then confirmed by the Minister.  The reason I raise the point is that people who objected to the passing of this Bill at an earlier stage are under a misapprehension because, the Minister having given some undertaking, they were inclined to withdraw their opposition to it.  The position really is that they believe that after the inquiry is held the Minister will come back to the House and tell them what he is going to do and give them a chance of discussing it.  That is not the position.  I should like to know if it were the Minister's intention when he gave that undertaking that there would be some type of reference back. Is it not clear that when the Bill is passed and the inquiry held the Minister can make an Order extending the boundary without reference to anybody? I suggest that an undertaking of that kind is of very little practical importance.  It is just the same as suggesting that, if the Minister brought in a Bill containing a penal clause for prosecution and gave an <Col N="55" /> undertaking to a Deputy that he would not be prosecuted under that clause, that could be raised as a defence in court.  I am afraid that would not work.  I want to make it clear that, if the people who were opposed to this Bill on the Second Stage were under the impression, because the Minister gave an undertaking, that this matter would be referred back, that that is not so, and if they want to get something more definite they must still oppose the Bill.</P>

      <P>I agree with Deputy Broderick that by the extension of the borough boundary hardships may be caused to certain ratepayers.  But I also want to bring to the notice of the Minister and the House the very severe hardship that is being inflicted on certain classes of people owing to the non-extension of the boundary.  An Employment Order is being made somewhat similar to the Employment Order made last year.  That order will apply to tenants of corporation houses living immediately outside the city boundary. I refer to places like Spangle Hill and Horgan's Buildings, immediately outside the city boundary, where city workers have been transferred owing to the operation of the Housing Acts in Cork City.  I have raised this matter several times in the House.  These people are being deprived of unemployment assistance from now until October.  They are married men with families, and, on the admission of the Minister himself, are regarded as city workers.  Being deprived of unemployment assistance, these people will be thrown on to home assistance at the expense of the ratepayers.  The hardship caused will be a double-edged one.  These people will be deprived of unemployment assistance because they live immediately outside the existing borough boundary.  There will also be a hardship on the ratepayers, because somebody must surely come to the help of these people, as they cannot be allowed to starve.  Somebody must make up to them for the amount they will be deprived of under this Employment Order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I submit to the House that that is a <Col N="56" /> reason why the borough boundary should be extended, and why the proceedings with regard to the extension of the boundary should be expedited. I put it to the Minister that he has a responsibility to see that the extension of the boundary will be expedited. There is no doubt about the facts I have put before the House.  The only remedy put forward to us time after time was an extension of the borough boundary.  I sympathise with the point of view put forward by Deputy Broderick.  I know that people who have built houses in the areas outside Cork City, and who have gone to a great deal of expense, will suffer hardship; but I think there will be a way out for them.</P>

      <P>In my opening statement in opposition to the Bill, I stated that one of the difficulties I laboured under was that I did not know whether it was merely intended to incorporate districts where there were working-class houses and places where there is a large concentration of unemployed at the moment.  I can see no reasonable objection to that.  My objection is not to that particular form of extension, but to the possibility of an extension over a much greater area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JeremiahHurley" hpid="Mr. Hurley Mr. Hurley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hurley</NameTxt>
      <P>There is nothing between us as far as that is concerned.  I can see that point of view.  A very important section of the Bill is based on sections of the Greater Dublin Act, and I take it that at the inquiry the inspector and the other people concerned will advert to that Act.  I think that greater hardship is caused by the non-extension of the boundary to places where you have hundreds of people living.  Deputy Broderick is the Chairman of the Cork County Council and he is interested in the affairs of the South Cork Board of Assistance.  He knows, from his own experience, that the demands on that board through the operation of this Employment Order on people whom it was never intended to affect will be a very serious thing for the ratepayers.  I cannot see the justice of removing the burden from the national Exchequer and putting it on to ratepayers.  But that is <Col N="57" /> what has happened, and it is happening now on account of the operation of this Employment Period Order.</P>
      <P>I want to say to the Minister that there should not be any delay in putting Section 7 of this Bill into operation. I want him to appreciate with me the hardships caused to those people who are being deprived of unemployment assistance.  It is tantamount to telling them that, so far as the national Exchequer and the national Assembly are concerned, they can starve from now until next October.  I want to pay tribute to the board of assistance for their action. They took up the burden last year, but I am not able to say how far they will be able to go this year.  What I want to impress on the Minister is that he should exercise the powers given to him under the Bill to expedite the extension of the borough boundary so as to include those people who are city workers and who, due to the operation of the Housing Acts, have been removed outside the existing borough boundary.  I want to get from him a guarantee that every possible step will be taken to expedite the enforcement of that part of the Bill.</P>

      <P>My objection to this Bill is that it is going to impose further hardship on the ratepayers of the county to the extent of something like £58,000 a year.  While the Cork County Council and the ratepayers of the county will be expected to keep up all the social services that we are maintaining, they will now have to carry this much greater burden.  I think the Bill is most unjust in that way.  While I sympathise with the aspect of the matter that has been put before the House by Deputy Hurley, I think a far greater hardship is going to be imposed under this measure on the poor ratepayers of the County Cork.  They will be expected to foot the bill and to keep up all the social services, despite the fact that the county council will have to carry on with £58,000 less than they were receiving prior to the passage of the Bill.</P>

      <P>As to the other matters the Deputy raised, when the inquiry is held they will be looked into.  All the relevant circumstances and matters will be considered at the inquiry.  Deputy Broderick raised three points.  His third point was emphasised by Deputy Linehan.  They made reference to the agricultural grant and the halving of the rates on the land coming in under this Bill.  They asked whether the grant, or the rates, was going to bear that reduction.  The difference between the cost of relief and the grant which the city will get will be comparatively small, and the rates will, of course, have to bear that.</P>
      <P>The question was asked, why the position in this Bill was different from that in the Greater Dublin Act.  In connection with the latter, a number of considerations had to be taken into account.  Two local bodies&mdash;Rathmines and Pembroke Councils&mdash;had to be considered, and a different set of circumstances had to be dealt with.  In order to get them in, they were given a static rate for five years.  As recently as 1919, as Deputy Broderick is aware, differential rating of land was abolished in Cork City.  Hence, I do not think there is any case now for revising what was done then.  The main question that I understand Deputy Broderick is concerned with, is that relating to the making of provisional orders.  As the name indicates, they have to be confirmed in some way. Any provisional order extending the boundary must be confirmed by Act of the Oireachtas.  The matter is put beyond all doubt in sub-section (3) of Section 21 of this Bill, which reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;A provisional order under this section shall not have any effect unless or until it is confirmed by Act of the Oireachtas, but if and when so confirmed it shall have effect according to the terms thereof.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. Ruttledge)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  The purpose of this Bill is to extend the Seeds and Fertilisers Act passed last year to the provision of seeds and fertilisers by county councils during the present season.  The <Col N="60" /> Bill contains the necessary adaptations of last year's Act.  At the commencement of the season suggestions came from several quarters that the same facilities that were provided last year should be made available this year. There is even greater necessity this year to do whatever can be done to help those who are able and willing to engage in food production, and it was decided to instruct county councils to consider the adoption of schemes. These instructions were issued on 20th December last, and in the meantime all but two county councils have taken action.  Applications for seeds are, I understand, more numerous than last year.</P>
      <P>The Bill is necessary in order to validate the action taken by the county councils.  These bodies can proceed in two ways.  They can sell seed on loan terms or give guarantees to seed merchants. In either case the recipient is required to repay after the harvest the cost of the seed supplied.  Where guarantees are given, they become operative only when the merchants supplying the seed are unable to collect the cost.  Seed schemes are of special value in counties where small holdings predominate.  Past experience has shown that where precautions are taken to ensure that recipients are trustworthy and are genuinely in need of credit, county councils would be at very little loss.  In several counties that had schemes in former years there has been no loss whatever&mdash;every penny was repaid.  For that reason I do not think there is any necessity for Government guarantees in connection with these schemes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TimothyLinehan" hpid="Mr. Linehan Mr. Linehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Linehan</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the Bill last year was there any real demand in general throughout all the county councils for the application of this scheme <Col N="61" /> for giving seeds on credit?  I have a feeling that the very people to whom the Minister is referring, the labourers and small holders, are rather doubtful of the advantages of the scheme, and are slow about making applications at all.  Deputy Hurley was blaming the Minister for not expediting things, but I should say that the county councils do not always seem to expedite them either.  There is one point which I want to make.  You are passing a Bill this year to provide the same terms as last year, and the Minister's whole case is that it provides seeds for people who otherwise would not be able to get them.  That will affect a lot of people in this country, cottage holders, labourers, and possibly unemployed people who have allotments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Has the Minister taken any steps to see that they will have seeds to distribute? The Minister must be aware that, as far as seeds and manures are concerned, a case has been made in this House, as in the case of everything else the supplies of which are short.  I suppose that, at the present time, they are available in large quantities to cash customers, and not at all for credit customers.  It is a perfectly reasonable assumption that, if a man has to pay cash for his goods, as in the case of seeds and manures, he will sell them to the cash customers, because he cannot afford to wait for payment.  Nobody can blame the retailer for doing that, because otherwise he could not carry on at all. When this Bill is passed, does the Minister really believe that the county councils, having adopted the scheme, will be able to induce seed merchants to supply seeds on terms like these? Last year, and the year before, and the year before that and the year before that, seeds and manures were supplied by the wholesalers to the retailers on terms which gave the retailers credit until the harvest.  If they paid sooner, they got a very good discount.  The position this year is that the retailers are paying cash in advance for seeds, and they are paying cash within ten days for manures. Will the county councils be able to ask the seed retailers in the country to supply these seeds on those terms?  If <Col N="62" /> the Minister wants to make the Bill effective in providing seeds for poor people who want to get credit for the purchase of their seeds, I think he should consult the Minister for Agriculture and find out whether such seeds will be available, because I think it is a great pity that anything should happen to put this Bill out of action.  I am quite sure the Minister will realise that if, in any particular town or county or district there is a certain amount of seeds available, he will not be in a position to ask any wholesaler or retailer to hold those seeds for the credit scheme when they can sell them for cash.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister to explain Section 4 of this Bill, which says:</P>
      <P>(1)  Section 3 of the Principal Act is hereby amended by the insertion therein of the words and figures &ldquo;or, in the case of a sale in the year 1941, before the first day of January, 1942,&rdquo; immediately after the words and figures &ldquo;January, 1941,&rdquo;.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I was wondering whether it was intended&mdash;I am not satisfied that it fills the gap&mdash;to repair a hiatus that was in the original Act.  The original Act and this Act begin to operate on 1st January and expire on 31st July. As I read the Principal Act and this Supplementary Act, there is no Seeds and Fertilisers Act in operation from 1st August to 31st December in any year.  Will that be the position still? If so, the Minister is depriving the staff of life in this country of fertilisers and seeds at the sowing period.  It does not make seeds or fertilisers available for the sowing of winter wheat.  No county council can help a farmer when he is sowing winter wheat, and, despite all the authorities and scribes we have now telling us when we can sow winter wheat with success, we all know that winter wheat must be green overground by Christmas Day if there is to be any hope of a full crop. If we are going to sow winter wheat at the right period and have it green <Col N="63" /> overground on Christmas Day, well then the Seeds and Fertilisers Act will not help us, and I am sure if this Act is intended to help any crop it is intended to help winter wheat.</P>
      <P>This matter arose in County Dublin last year when we were sowing the present season's winter wheat, and we were confronted with legal opinion that the county council could not help the farmers to buy fertilisers or seed for winter wheat in October, November and December, because they had no Act.  The question was put up to the Minister's Department, and I must say that every promise was held out that it was safe, but in law we had not the power.  Speaking from memory, I think an assurance was given that the county council would be indemnified for anything it would do.  If that is the spirit, why not have the substance? Why not have an Act to cover the period from 31st July to 31st December? Why have a broken period at all?  If it is going to be an annual affair, why not have it from 1st January to 31st December instead of to 31st July?</P>
      <P>I should like the Minister to deal with that.  I do not see any insuperable obstacle in the way of my suggestion&mdash;to make it the 31st December instead of 31st July.  I was very strongly in favour of the Act that was passed through here last year.  We applied it in County Dublin with good results. I think the Minister is more in favour of it this year than he was last year.</P>

We went out purely for food production; we did not penalise people who had not a clean sheet in connection with annuities or rates, as we considered that these were the people who most needed assistance over the stile.  We gave it to them, and I do not think the results were bad.  I could not understand the point made by Deputy Linehan.  Our operation of the Act involved paying cash to the merchants. We arranged a certain rate of interest for an overdraft, and we charged the people to whom we gave the seeds, and we charged the merchants 1 per cent. over what we borrowed at&mdash;that was to cover working expenses.</P>

I should like the Minister to have the best possible results from the operation of this legislation.  If it is good for portion of the year it should be good for all the <Col N="65" /> year, especially the early portion of it. I suggest that the period between 31st July and 1st January should be filled in and let the Act run for the whole year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in agreement with Deputy Belton on this matter.  There does not seem to be any reason why the period should end in July of any year.  I come from an area where numbers of people are interested in sowing winter wheat, and they may want credit at that time.  I do not see why this should not be made a three or five year Act, and so avoid bringing it forward every year.  There does not seem to be any necessity for many amendments to last year's Act, and why the legislation should not be made a permanent feature I do not quite understand.  It really should be extended to cover the whole year.</P>
      <P>I think the Minister should insert some safeguard to cover a possible failure of the crop.  There is a need for such a safeguard.  Under the Act councils may give a loan or supply seeds, but there is nothing to safeguard them against the failure of a crop.  They should not be held responsible for the crop, for the fertility of the seed supplied, or the manner in which the seed was sown.</P>

      <P>In view of the absolute necessity for getting all the food that can be grown in the country grown this year, I should like to know from the Minister whether there are any steps he could take to compel those two county councils to grant facilities to the people in their areas? In a county like Donegal, where there are so many smallholders, and where, perhaps, this scheme would be of as <Col N="67" /> much benefit, if not greater benefit, than most other counties, it seems an extraordinary thing that the county council there have made no effort to provide facilities for those who are anxious to take advantage of them.  If there are any means at the Minister's disposal whereby he can ensure that these facilities will be given to people in Sligo and Donegal, I suggest that he ought to put them into operation very quickly.</P>

      <P>I welcome this Bill. Nothing that I know of has contributed so much to the security and welfare of the people as this Seeds and Fertilisers Supply Act.  Men who a few years ago were very much in arrear with their annuities and rates, whose credit was gone, and whose lands were to a great extent derelict, are now, largely because of the operation of the Act, in a reasonably affluent position. I hold strongly that in our area the one thing which has contributed to our financial position and to its remedying in the last five or six years was the introduction of this Bill; but, like other Deputies, I hold that it ought not to wait until February or March, or even as late as the announcement of the Minister for Agriculture in January that people could be sure that the Bill was to come into operation.  The Minister for Agriculture, who I am sorry is not here, twitted us and said that if there was any delay in the scheme&mdash;he was referring to the Cork County Council&mdash;it was our own fault.  As a matter of fact, the Minister was notified last November that our scheme was ready and awaiting his sanction, but we had to wait until the middle of January for it.  I support the point of view put forward here, and held, I think, very strongly here, that the Bill ought not to be of an intermittent nature, and that there ought not to be any uncertainty as to when it would come into operation.  The people who want to avail of it ought to have a reasonable assurance that the measure will be available at a particular time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Broderick</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no doubt that Deputy Belton made a very strong <Col N="68" /> point, that if one is to be reasonably successful in wheat growing, one has to consider having the wheat well over the ground in the early days of December.  Without a Bill such as this, many people cannot do so.</P>
      <P>I do not know whether the other point to which I want to refer is appropriate at this stage, but, a few years ago, local authorities were induced to take up this scheme on the undertaking that 50 per cent. of any deficiency would be met by the State.  In those years, production was merely of a local nature and the production of food had not the same degree of importance it has to-day.  The State has called strongly through its Ministers for production and, speaking a short time ago, I referred to the Minister for Agriculture as the most important man in the State, and said that he had far and away the most important job, with or without invasion, that is, the feeding of the people.  How he has carried out that job is a question which can be debated on another occasion, but to show how far the people have gone in support of the Minister in his drive for increased production, how far they have realised the necessity of producing food, our normal advances to assist people in former times ranged from approximately £900 to £1,100 a year, whereas we have advanced up to this £6,700 odd and we expect that by the time all the seeds are planted and we have met our full liability, it will be not less than £10,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That liability is being incurred because of the earnest demands and requests by the State and because of our very acute sense of our responsibility. In doing so, we had to take certain risks, in the belief that, even if we were never paid, it was essential in the interests of the State to produce food, and because we realised that by penalising or refusing the man whose credit was bad, who, as Deputy Belton pointed out, might not have a clean slate in respect of either annuities or rates, we were denying the State the productivity of whatever holding he had.  We took that risk in the interests of the State, and I think the State has its responsibilities also.  It is only right that the State should revert to <Col N="69" /> the original form of the Bill and undertake the 50 per cent. liability which they formerly undertook.  I hold that this Bill has done more to make people solvent who, a few years ago, were practically destitute, and has done more to produce revenue, to produce food for the State and to meet normal liabilities of annuities and rates than any other activity of the State, and I welcome it strongly.  I will possibly, however, put down an amendment to deal with the matter of the 50 per cent. liability, on the ground that we have incurred this liability and we expect the State in return to incorporate in the Bill the clause which formerly appeared in it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MatthewOReilly" hpid="Mr. O'Reilly Mr. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill, and I agree fully with what Deputy Belton, and especially Deputy Allen, said in connection with the degree of permanency which this Bill has not got.  Farmers, like merchants and other people, have to do a considerable amount of budgeting, and it is not when the operation of sowing seeds should take place that they should make their arrangements.  Last season, for example, winter seed wheat was purchased at very reasonable prices, and I think the desirability of having winter seed wheat in the ground at least during the month of October is now fairly obvious.  If a measure such as this, giving credit for the purchase of seeds, is not made permanent, a number of farmers, and especially those who have not got credit, whom we want to assist, will be in great difficulty as to what exactly to do.  If the Bill became a permanent measure, these people would be able to purchase seed possibly at a much lower price.  They would certainly be able to put seed in the ground at the proper time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with the last speaker when he says that this measure has done quite a lot of good and is likely to do an immense amount of good in putting farmers on their feet who otherwise would not have been put on their feet. I believe that if it were made permanent for a period of three, four or five years, the farmers would be in a position to take full advantage of it. <Col N="70" /> I think they have not been able to take the advantage I should like to see them taking of it this year mainly because there was a good deal of uncertainty and because county councils introduced their schemes rather late. The spring has not been very favourable so far for the sowing of spring wheat and I know quite a number of farmers who, if they had had the opportunity last October or August, would have made preparations and we would have had a great deal more winter wheat in the ground, with extremely good results, than we have to-day. Consequently, I suggest that the question of permanency should be examined.</P>

      <P>I have always felt, and I still feel, that this is not the type of work which should be the responsibility of a local authority.  I feel that it does not go to the root of the problem of credit facilities for agriculture at all.  While I admit that it is of some benefit in a very limited way, it does not touch the real problem of credit.  The information at my disposal is that in most counties the amount of credit is limited to £5 per applicant.  If there is talk of financing the seed wheat scheme or the early sowing of wheat, the amount of credit should not be limited to £5.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informing the House of what obtains throughout the country.  The reason that that is so is that normally a man who is credit-worthy can go to local merchants and obtain certain facilities.  I do not agree with Deputy Belton that such facilities will be more costly when dealing with local merchants than with local authorities.  In the majority of cases local merchants extend reasonable credit facilities to most people.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>County Dublin is not the only county in Ireland.  A man who is not credit-worthy has to go to the local authorities for a loan and has to provide solvent sureties.  For that reason I say that this proposal only provides credit in a very limited way, and not for the type of people who require it to sow early winter wheat.  It only deals with credit for a small farmer to secure seed potatoes or a barrel or two of seed grain.  I should like to have information as to the limit set in the different counties or if there is an average limit.  Taking into account the limit laid down in most counties, the amount available does not really provide the credit that is essential for agriculture, if we are to make use of our productive capacity during this emergency.  It really does not attempt to deal with the problem of credit in the proper way.  The House will appreciate that as local authorities have to shoulder heavy burdens at the present time, many of them working on overdrafts, they will be slow to shouder any further financial liability. I should like to join with Deputy Broderick in asking for the insertion of a provision that was omitted last year, whereby 50 per cent. of the repayments would be guaranteed by the State. The State should finance the tillage drive in that limited way.  It is unreasonable to ask local ratepayers to shoulder the full burden.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this Bill, as I believe it will do more to increase the area under tillage than any other measure or appeal made to the people. It is a good Bill.  I appeal to the Minister to make it a permanent measure. The point raised by Deputy Belton was an important one, that winter wheat should be sown early in November or late in October, and should be grass corn by Christmas.  If this Bill was made permanent it would enable people to have winter wheat sown at <Col N="72" /> the proper time.  Deputy Hughes referred to the case of a man&mdash;one of many at the present time&mdash;who is not credit-worthy.  Unfortunately, large numbers of farmers are not credit-worthy through no fault of their own. They have gone through very bad times.  It is not because a man is not credit-worthy that he should not be helped.</P>
      <P>That is the type of man who should be helped.  If a man has not his annuities paid to date or if he is in arrears with rates he should not be deprived of credit either by county councils or by a State Department.  If this Bill is operated by local authorities in the proper way it will help such people.  I believe they will be helped this year and, as a result, I hope they will not need further assistance in other years. Deputy Broderick mentioned men who are now in fairly comfortable circumstances, because for the past three or four years they availed of this Bill and had good harvests.  Like the majority of farmers, if they get any chance they always make good and pay their way. I know farmers who availed of this measure and of loans from the Agricultural Credit Corporation.  All of them have done well and paid back the amounts they owed.  That is why I appeal to the Minister and to local authorities to see to it that the man who is not credit-worthy, but who can be depended upon, is helped if he tries to avail of the advantages of this Bill. I believe this is a good Bill and that it will do very good work for the country.  I ask the Minister to have the clause that was withdrawn from the Bill re-inserted whereby the State would bear part of the financial responsibility involved.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to endorse the remarks of previous speakers particularly with regard to people who have been described as not credit-worthy. In the emergency that we are passing through I do not think the country can afford to ignore the services of any section that is capable of producing food.  There are, however, other people than the farmers who have been spoken of, who are not credit-worthy this year, nor were they any year, <Col N="73" /> and these are unemployed persons in towns and villages.  I appeal to the Minister to think of that section of the community.  Boards of health have certain functions and certain authority, enabling them to procure loans to provide plots and allotments.  County councils have schemes by which they are able to make loans for seeds, but sureties have to be secured.  The people I am referring to, in conjunction with non-credit-worthy farmers, are non-credit-worthy labourers.  How will they fare under this Bill?  Is there any possibility that they will be covered by it?  Provision is made for rated occupiers of land and for cottiers in my county, but I am appealing on behalf of people in the villages and towns for whom provision has been made under the board of health scheme, but who do not seem to be covered with regard to free seeds or loans for seeds.  In municipal areas we are able to provide seeds, manures and implements free, and a plot for the nominal rent of 1/-.</P>
      <P>Certain efforts are being made to provide plots for people in the rural areas.  I want to know if any provision is being made for free seeds or loans for seeds.  I have an idea that under some old measure it is possible for the Minister for Agriculture to come to the rescue of those people, but I am not sure about that.  I should like the Minister to say if there are any means by which the unemployed labourers in the villages who are anxious to participate in food production this year can be assisted by free seeds, or loans for seeds without having to procure security which they cannot get, to enable them to take the part which they are willing to take in this very necessary food drive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support the appeal made to the Minister to provide in this Bill a guarantee to the local authorities that at least 50 per cent. of the liability incurred will be borne by the State.  Most of the criticism of the Bill last year was based on the fact that local authorities have not the financial strength to operate a measure so comprehensive as this.  We all know how difficult local authorities find it to meet their current demands, <Col N="74" /> and even to collect their current rates. Therefore, anyone can understand how reluctant local authorities are to take big risks in order to finance a scheme of this kind.  If, even now, the Minister is prepared to say that the Government will guarantee half the liability incurred, I have no doubt that local authorities would be prepared to say: &ldquo;We will go further than we intended, and we will make this scheme available to more people who are not credit-worthy.&rdquo; The position at present is that local authorities, having regard to the difficulty they find in meeting their obligations, have been forced in common prudence to restrict their schemes to a very great extent.  They have been compelled to restrict the amount advanced to any individual applicant, and to impose very stringent restrictions in regard to solvent securities. If the Government were prepared to come forward and bear half the risk I have no doubt that, even where schemes have been drawn up, the local authorities would be prepared to amend those schemes so that they would be available to a larger number of people, and would have the effect of bringing larger areas under cultivation.</P>
      <P>I am disappointed that the Minister did not state the number of applicants who availed of this scheme last year. He did not state the amount advanced in each county; neither did he state the amount of the advances made last year which has been collected.  This information, if it had been given by the Minister, would be very useful to the House in deciding its attitude towards this Bill.  I hope when he is replying that the Minister will be able to supply that information.  There is a natural inclination on the part of local authorities to go all out in order to help in increasing production.  At the same time, there is a feeling amongst local councils that they should not be compelled to bear the entire burden.  If the State were to meet them by bearing half the burden, I am sure they would go much further and make this scheme available to every person who requires credit facilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my opinion this scheme was not availed of to a great extent last year <Col N="75" /> in a great number of counties because the county councils found the risks they were asked to take were too great. Therefore, they imposed restrictions in regard to the amount they would advance and the security which they would require.  The result was that the scheme was only availed of to a very limited extent.  It would be a generous gesture on the part of the Government to say now: &ldquo;There are two bodies interested in this matter, the local bodies and the central body.  We, as the central body, are prepared to bear half the burden and we expect that the local bodies will bear the other half.&rdquo; I am sure the local authorities would have no hesitation in doing so.  I think it is only right and proper that this Bill should be extended to cover the full 12 months of the year.  The springtime has always been looked upon as sowing time.  But events have rather altered the conditions, and now the main crop, the crop upon which we have to rely for our bread supplies, must be sown in the autumn.  For that reason I am sure the Minister will have no objection to extending the scheme so as to cover the full 12 months of the year.</P>

      <P>This measure is not really an emergency or food production measure, and there is no use pretending that it is.  I hope it will not be regarded as the comprehensive measure which some Deputies referred to.  It is really a kind of stop gap to assist people in poor circumstances. To that extent it has been successful.  I am glad to be able to give Deputy Cogan the information that in Roscommon it was operated last year and the year before.  Its operation the year before last was only on a small scale; it only amounted to a few hundred pounds.  But when the secretary was asked the following year what the bad debts were, he said there were none.  This year, when putting it into operation, the secretary was asked how did the council stand in regard to the matter, and he said that all the money was paid with the exception of a few pounds, which were safe.</P>

Let us not pretend that this measure is going to bridge any credit difficulties that may exist. It is true that it will enable people, in poor circumstances, to get seeds and manures that they otherwise could not get.  To that extent it is useful, and I hope it will continue, because, I suppose it is true to say, you will always have people who will want assistance of this kind.  If the measure were made a permanent one it would, possibly, be all to the good.  Let us not, however, delude ourselves into thinking that we are doing something very big.  We are not.  I agree that we are doing something useful, but if there has to be any big credit system established in this country it is through the Government that should be done and not through the ratepayers.</P>

      <P>Deputy Brennan is right in saying that this measure was never intended to be the big comprehensive one that some Deputies seem to have in mind.  I do not want to be guilty of misquoting what any Deputy has said.  I think, however, it is correct to say that the speech we had from Deputy Hughes this evening was more or less on the lines of the speech made last year on a similar Bill by Deputy Belton.  The Deputy's speech was to the effect that this was not a comprehensive measure, that it could not deal with the position, and was, in fact, practically useless.  Bills of this sort originated away back in 1880. They were passed into law in what were considered to be bad years.  There was no such Act in operation here from 1933 to 1939.  I said last year that the Bill was not intended to be what some Deputies had described as a comprehensive measure to deal with credit for farmers.  Its purpose simply is to enable people to procure seeds and fertilisers, people whose circumstances would not permit them to do that immediately out of their own resources.  Its operation in the congested areas is of considerable benefit to small farmers.  No restrictions are imposed with regard to the type of securities to be provided for the sums advanced.  It is for the local authority to devise the type of security required. Losses have been small except, I think, in one county.  The position there is that whatever the loss is it can be collected in the rates next year.  But, except in the case of that county, the losses under measures similar to this have been inconsiderable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>I would prefer not to.  That county has still the opportunity of collecting whatever sum may be outstanding.  Therefore, I do not think it would be right to utter any criticism of it.  It has been urged that we should advance 50 per cent. against the losses in the various counties.  I <Col N="78" /> have already pointed out that there has been very little loss.  If counties were to be given a guarantee of recoupment of losses, they might not be as vigilant as they are when they have to meet the full amount of whatever loss there is.  I do not suggest that if the guarantee were given there would be any relaxation on their part, but still there is the danger that they might not be as careful as they have to be under the present arrangement.  I have no evidence from any public body that difficulty has been experienced by trustworthy applicants in obtaining the guarantees required by the local body.</P>
      <P>As regards the cost of the seeds and fertilisers supplied to applicants, a limitation has been put on the amount of the advances by various counties. The Carlow County Council, for instance, decided, one member dissenting, that the advance should not exceed £10 in each case, and that defaulters under the 1940 scheme, or ratepayers who had failed to pay their rates by the 31st March, 1941, should be ineligible under the scheme.  There was a similar sort of scheme adopted in County Wicklow.  There various conditions were laid down.  They decided that the maximum amount of a loan to any one applicant should be £15, that the amount advanced should vary according to the amount of land in the possession of an applicant; that persons with under five acres, cottiers and others, should be able to secure seeds to the value of £1, and so on.  In Cork it was decided that the maximum quantity of seeds and fertilisers obtainable under the scheme should be 12 cwt. of seed potatoes, 16 cwt. seed oats, 16 cwt. of seed barley, 16 cwt. of seed wheat, and 5 cwt. of fertilisers.</P>

The reason that the period from July to December was regarded as closed was the reason for which those Acts were brought in originally, that is that the people who had to avail of it were the small farmers who were trying to provide food for themselves and were trying to get credit.  There is no objection whatever to advising or directing or communicating with the county councils to ask them to enable this thing to be done if conditions warrant it.</P>

      <P>The objection to its being dealt with at all is that this form of legislation was never intended to deal with the sort of credit that the Deputy has in mind.  The small farmers and other people who are not farmers, cottiers and so on, who had difficulty in getting credit in the ordinary way, will be able to make arrangements with the county councils, but there is nothing to prevent the county council from borrowing the money and paying the merchants immediately they get delivery of the seeds.</P>

      <P>It is probably a good thing that it does keep marching on. Some question was raised here as to the warranty of seeds.  That is a matter, I think, that can always be dealt with by the county council getting a warranty from the person who supplies the seed.  There are only, I think, four or five counties which used the authority they had to any reasonable extent at all until last year. There was considerable improvement last year.  I think the total cost that I mentioned was £14,699, and the number of recipients was 2,912.  Any person who is credit-worthy can get credit from his merchant in the ordinary way.  It is only people who are not able to get credit in that way that this Bill is intended to meet.  Otherwise, it should come from the Department of Agriculture and not from the Department of Local Government. This is to deal with a matter that may be regarded as a matter of distress.  I agree that, in the present circumstances, it may be extended, that it is being extended in those circumstances, and that this year we have urged the county councils more strongly to avail of its provisions than we have in other years.  Deputy Morrissey asked me <Col N="81" /> about Donegal.  So far as Donegal is concerned, we have not got any indications that they have difficulty there in procuring seeds.  We have communicated with them and we have communicated with Sligo, which are the two counties which have failed to put the scheme into operation this year.  The Sligo County Council, we understand, are considering the matter again.  It is a matter for themselves, and I do not think we can take any effective steps to make them do it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: That the Bill be now read a second time.  The Minerals Development Act, which became law on 14th November last, contains provisions for (1) the compulsory acquisition by the State of minerals in private ownership which are not being worked or which are not being worked efficiently, and, (2), for the development of deposits so acquired <Col N="82" /> either directly by the State or through lessees.  The House will, perhaps, recall that on the Second Reading of the Minerals Development Bill I expressed the view that, left to private enterprise, there was a possibility that such minerals as we possess may never be developed.  I suggested also that perhaps the first project in regard to which it might be found necessary to utilise the powers sought by the Minerals Development Bill would be to secure the development of the Slievardagh coalfield.</P>
      <P>This coalfield is situated in County Tipperary, some ten miles south-west of the town of Thurles.  The nearest railway station to the mineral area is Laffan's Bridge, on the Great Southern railway, some three miles from the southern end of the deposit. The field itself is approximately six miles in length by two miles in width, and there is a deposit of anthracite coal.  According to geologists, the Slievardagh field originally comprised eight seams of coal.  With the passage of time, the five uppermost seams were largely almost completely eroded, leaving only small outlyings which are found in the vicinity of Earl's Hill and Mardyke. These outlyings have been extensively worked in the past, notably between 1831 and 1891, when the field was worked by a company known as the Mining Company of Ireland.  The remaining three seams, with one of which the Bill is particularly concerned, are Pat Maher's vein, which is estimated to be eight inches thick, the Upper Glengoole, supposed to be from 18 to 20 inches, and the Lower Glengoole seam, which is 10 inches thick. Of the three, the most important is the Upper Glengoole seam, occurring at about 928 feet from the surface.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Except at isolated points where these seams outcrop, they have not been worked.  The Mining Company of Ireland, as I have indicated, ceased to work the Slievardagh coalfield about 50 years ago.  Subsequent to 1891 work was carried on by Messrs.  Dobbs and Young and by Mr. Langley, but the operations of these parties ceased about 1916.  Between 1916 and the present date small quantities of coal have been <Col N="83" /> raised from time to time by miners working individually or in small groups.  I should say it is doubtful whether these operations were covered by a proper title to work the property. An interest in the Mineral rights over a great part of the area is claimed by private interests, and this claim will be dealt with by the machinery set up under the Mines and Minerals Act of 1940.</P>
    <P>In 1933 the Government, having decided to investigate the possibilities of this field, requested a reputable firm of mining engineers to survey it and report on its possibilities and, accordingly, an extensive boring and prospecting programme was undertaken in the coalfield in the years 1934 and 1937.  As a result of these operations, the consultants reported that the principal reserves of coal left in the field are confined to the Upper Glengoole, or the second lowest coal seam which, in their opinion, averages 18 inches in thickness and contains reserves estimated at 5,500,000 tons.  That is sufficient to yield about 125,000 tons of coal per annum for a period of 40 years.  The consultants further stated that analyses of the samples taken from the different borings indicated that the Upper Glengoole coal is a seam of consistently good quality, and they expressed the opinion that commercial exploitation of the field was warranted.</P>
    <P>I should, perhaps, mention here that it has been suggested that this report was somewhat optimistic in averaging the Upper Glengoole seam at 18 inches, and in assuming the reserves in that seam at 5,500,000 tons, and that estimates of 16 inches and 3,500,000 tons, respectively, are more likely to be correct.  Unfortunately, one of the more discouraging features about our coal resources is to be found in the fact that the more closely they are investigated the less optimistic our estimates of them become.  Thus, in regard to the field which we are now considering, Professor George Seymour reported that there were 12,000 acres of the Slievardagh coalfield coal-bearing, that the thickness of the seams varied from 22 inches in the outcrop to six feet in the base, and that the coal <Col N="84" /> available from three particular seams alone amounted to over 90,000,000 tons. That estimate was made about 1921.</P>
    <P>In 1932 the Slievardagh coal deposits, according to another authority, were estimated at 20,000,000 tons.  It was suggested in 1933 that the reserves amounted to about 15,000,000 tons, and, in a preliminary report on Slievardagh presented to the Minister for Industry and Commerce in 1934, the consulting engineers estimated that the quantity remaining in the central and eastern areas of the field may approximate to 10,000,000 tons, a figure which would be subject to revision when the results of the borings were known.  In the light of these dwindling figures, it will be appreciated that we must not be too optimistic as to the output and value of the field.</P>
    <P>On the conclusion of the boring programme, statements of the facts which were revealed by the survey were deposited in the office of the geological survey and made available for inspection by any parties who might be interested in the development of the field.  Notwithstanding this, the deposits remain unworked, except for the small-scale operations which I have already mentioned, and nobody with the requisite financial and technical resources has come forward with satisfactory proposals for the development of the property on a feasible basis.  It is true that various propositions relating to the field have been submitted to my Department from time to time&mdash;since 1922, in fact.  Unfortunately, however, from the viewpoint of the general public interest, all of those submitted have undesirable features of one sort or another.  Some might be said to be company-promoting rather than coal-mining ventures.  Others proposed that the State should take an undue proportion of the financial risks, while leaving to the promoters an equally undue share of the profits.  None of them, in my view, was such as the Government would be justified in sponsoring or facilitating.</P>
    <P>In the national interest, however, the Slievardagh deposits cannot be allowed to remain dormant any longer. Accordingly, having given due consideration to all other proposals put <Col N="85" /> forward, the Government have decided to proceed with their development under the auspices of the State.  That decision, I may say, was reached many months ago.  In order to give effect to it however, not merely had this Bill to be drafted, but the Government had to prepare, and ask the Oireachtas to pass, the Minerals Development Act, 1940, so as to confer on the Minister for Industry and Commerce the powers necessary to take over on behalf of the State and to arrange for the exploitation of minerals in private ownership which are either not being worked efficiently or are not being worked at all, as is the case with the Slievardagh coalmines.  On 6th February, in the exercise of the powers thus conferred, I made an order under Section 14 of the Minerals Development Act, in respect of the Slievardagh coalfield.  The effect of this order is to vest in the Minister for Industry and Commerce, in fee simple, the minerals underlying the area defined in the order.  The dispossessed owners of the property under that order are entitled, of course, to compensation for the rights of which they have been deprived.  If the amount of such compensation cannot be settled by agreement, it will be settled by the Mining Board.</P>
    <P>The State having taken over Slievardagh coalfield, we have now to consider what steps should be taken to develop it.  I have already indicated that, even prior to the making of the order to which I have referred, schemes ostensibly having the development of the field as their main purpose but of a somewhat grandiose character, involving, as they would, the expenditure of several hundreds of thousands of pounds, have been proposed from time to time.  We are not, as I have already said, adopting any of these, for, in my view, a somewhat more cautious approach to the problem is desirable. I have already pointed out that it has been suggested that the estimate of 5,500,000 tons for the coal reserves is somewhat on the high side.  As to whether it is or not, we do not know. Only experience will teach us, and it is Just as well that the lesson, if its results are unfavourable, should not be too expensive.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. D. Morrissey Mr. D. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask if that suggestion came from experts?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>There is some difference of opinion between experts on both sides.  Geologically, the Slievardagh field is a highly disturbed one and, for this reason, and because of the existence of old unexplored and, perhaps, dangerous workings, its development may be very difficult.  We have also to take into consideration that there is no large supply of the necessary skilled labour immediately available.  Nor is there to hand the skilled management and supervision which is so necessary where, as in this case, danger from old workings is to be anticipated.  Bearing all this in mind, it is, in my view, necessary to proceed with prudence and with care in opening up the field, while, at the same time, of course, sparing no effort to win as much coal as is possible in the shortest practicable time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Whatever approach we may think ought to be made to this problem, one statement in regard to it is, I think, not likely to be challenged, that is, that the task is one which could not be undertaken by the ordinary machinery of the Civil Service.  Accordingly, it has been decided to operate through the agency of a company registered under the Companies Acts.  For the necessary authority to form and finance that company, the present Bill is introduced.  The intention is that the deposits acquired by the State under the recent order shall be leased to the company on the terms at which the State succeeds in acquiring them, and that the moneys needed by the company for the development of the deposits shall be provided by repayable advances.  An initial limit of £100,000 is being placed on these advances.  That amount, we think, should be sufficient to prove the field and to finance the primary development scheme which the company to be formed under the Bill will be required to undertake.  Should the results of these operations warrant it, a more extensive programme will be developed and pushed forward as rapidly as possible. We may take it that further capital will then be needed, and this <Col N="87" /> the Oireachtas will be asked to provide in due course.  An opportunity, will thus be given to the Legislature to review the results of the present venture and to decide whether it is desirable or warrantable to invest further money in the project.</P>
    <P>I should emphasise that, although the Bill contemplates advances totalling £100,000 ultimately, this amount will be made available only as the company needs it, and not immediately on the passage of the Bill.  The company will submit estimates of its requirements from time to time, and provision will be made in the Vote for the Minister for Industry and Commerce to enable the necessary advances to be made to the company.</P>
    <P>This, of course, will give the Dáil an opportunity, if it so desires, of deciding whether or not the project, on the results then shown, should be further proceeded with.  Though it is necessary for us to keep fairly strict control upon the financial aspect of this undertaking, I should like to emphasise that the company will be run as a commercial concern, divorced so far as possible from Ministerial interference. The Minister for Finance, as the principal shareholder, will appoint the directors, after consultation with the Minister for Industry and Commerce, but beyond being bound to have regard to the information available to the Government concerning the field&mdash;and this, of course, will be placed at the disposal of the company &mdash;and being enjoined to exercise such care and prudence as the speculative nature of the enterprise necessitates, the manner in which the task entrusted to the company should be tackled will be left for settlement to the directors.  The directors of the company, like the directors of, say, the Electricity Supply Board, will have in their own hands the general conduct of the company's affairs, and the engagement of the technical and other staff that may be needed.  While the development of the deposits of Slievardagh will be the principal task entrusted to the company, it will not be the company's solo task.  The services of the company will be availed of for <Col N="88" /> carrying on, in consultation with the geological service, exploratory and prospecting work at Slievardagh and other coalfields.  The money required for that purpose cannot, of course, be recovered from the company.</P>
    <P>The return to the State of this expenditure will be in the form of more accurate knowledge of the country's natural resources.  In its turn it is hoped it will result in increased development of these resources, increased employment, and reduced dependence on external supplies of fuel.  At the moment it is proposed to limit the amount the Exchequer proposes to advance to not more than £3,000 per annum.  The Bill provides that sums not exceeding that amount may be supplied annually by grants-in-aid to the company from the Vote for the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  As in the case of the main task of the company, should the circumstances warrant the Oireachtas will be asked to grant further moneys and to review the company's prospecting operations in due course.</P>
    <P>In what I have said in justification of the Bill, I have not laid undue emphasis on the need which exists in present circumstances of developing and utilising such of our coal resources as it may be possible to develop.  We all know that so long as the present war lasts there is very grave danger indeed that the country may be left without its normal supplies of imported fuel.  It is not merely for this reason, but because I feel that on its merits the proposal to develop Slievardagh coalfield is, on the whole, a sound one that I am submitting it for the consideration of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>The fundamental facts are&mdash;(a) the demand for anthracite cannot be met by the existing collieries; (b) the market for anthracite is a growing one.  Imports of the fuel in 1926 amounted to 41,622 tons, and in 1940 to 92,434 tons; (c) the existence of large reserves of anthracite in the Slievardagh area has been proved; (d) samples raised from the Slievardagh deposits were of uniformly good quality.  I do not contend that all these considerations would justify one in saying that large returns in the way of dividends may be expected from any moneys invested in the proposed <Col N="89" /> company.  I think they do provide sufficient justification for saying that there is a reasonable prospect that eventually this undertaking will be self-supporting, and having regard to the immediate importance of the problem from the wider economic point of view, that is as much, at this stage, as we are entitled to require.</P>
    <P>The main provisions of the Bill are as follows: Section 1 contains definitions. Section 2 provides for registration by the Minister for Industry and Commerce of the company under the Companies Acts.  Section 3 provides that the capital of the company shall be one hundred pound shares, all of which will be allotted and issued to the Minister for Finance.  Sections 4 and 5 require that the Memorandum and Articles of Association of the company be approved by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, after consultation with the Minister for Finance. Section 5 also provides that the company shall not have power to issue any debentures.  Section 6 provides that any alteration in the Articles of Association shall not be valid or effective without the approval of the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  Section 7 states that a loan to the extent of £250 may be given to pay the expenses of forming the company.  Section 8 provides that the company shall apply for and will be given a lease of the Slievardagh coalfield.</P>
    <P>Section 9 provides that the company may be given an advance out of the Vote for the Minister for Industry and Commerce, not exceeding £100,000 in all, for the purposes of its business. Sections 10 and 11 stipulate that advances made to the company shall be repaid with interest, but sub-section (3) of Section 11 provides that with the consent of the Minister for Industry and Commerce the Minister may waive altogether or postpone for such time as he thinks proper the payment of any half-yearly instalment.  Section 12 empowers the Minister to call on the company to carry out prospecting operations either at Slievardagh or some other coalfield with a view to determining the advisability of further developing these areas.  Section 14 provides that the shares of the company <Col N="90" /> will be held in trust for the Minister for Finance.  Sections 15 and 16 provide for the payment of dividends to the Exchequer, and obliges the company to furnish a balance sheet to the Minister within certain specific periods, and such balance sheet and profit and loss accounts are to be laid before Dáil Eireann in due course.  These are the main provisions of the Bill, and, as I explained to the House, I hope it will be possible to give it a Second Reading to-day.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the House ought to be satisfied that the Minister has endeavoured to give all the relevant information that is at his disposal. Of course, it is apparent to the House that from the information at his disposal he was not inclined to be overenthusiastic or optimistic.  He said that the Government were approaching this matter in a mood of caution and prudence. No one will object to that.  It is desirable at any time, and particularly in present circumstances, that whatever deposits we have, such as those at Slievardagh, should be explored. I think it would not be unfair, if one is to judge by the tone of the Minister's speech, to say that this is more or less a gamble.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister can choose the word.  &ldquo;Speculation&rdquo; I suppose is the proper word to use in connection with the formation of companies and so on.  But we are faced with this position.  We are told that there are from 5,500,000 to 20,000,000 tons of good anthracite coal in that particular district.  As the Minister stated in his speech, the consumption of anthracite has been increasing very rapidly in recent years.  Notwithstanding the fact that in another of our coalfields we have been producing as good anthracite as any we have been importing, in the last year for which the Minister was able to give figures we had to import about 92,000 tons of anthracite. As Deputies are aware, anthracite is the most expensive of all coal.  So far as I know, the price of anthracite in Dublin at the moment is about £5 per ton.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="91" /> The Minister mentioned that it is 50 years since these coal mines were worked by what was known as the Irish Mining Company.  Now, the Minister and the Government have certain difficulties to face.  I do not know to what extent records have been kept and are available of whatever work has been carried on there for the last 50 years; whether, for instance, there are drawings or maps or other records available to the Minister and his Department of whatever borings were made, whatever shafts, if any, were sunk, whatever passages were built up, or whatever tunnels or passages may have collapsed or may be on the point of collapsing.  Then there is, of course, the other point which the Minister mentioned in the way of anything in the nature of a large scale and rapid development, if such a thing were possible, and that is the scarcity, if not an entire lack of the skilled labour and technical staff essential to the successful and proper development of these mines.</P>
    <P>I do not want to be any more enthusiastic than the Minister was.  I do not want to leave myself open to the accusation that, because these mines happen to be situated in my constituency, I am going to ignore all the other aspects of the situation.  But, I have to face this fact.  Although the Minister, very properly, did not place any undue emphasis on the present circumstances, did not put them forward as a reason why the House should pass this Bill, we cannot ignore the necessity that there is, if it is possible for us to do so, for providing fuel in the nature of coal, which it is at present almost impossible to obtain from outside sources or obtain only in very limited quantities, and not only in very limited quantities, but very largely of a very inferior quality. There is also the absolute necessity for taking whatever steps we can take to provide for the inevitable great increase in unemployment.  I am afraid it is inevitable that we will have very greatly increased unemployment.  The only way in my opinion that it will be possible, apart from any question of the desirability of it, to provide for <Col N="92" /> large numbers of additional unemployed is by the provision of work.  I believe that in this project the Minister will have the goodwill and good wishes of every Deputy.  It is a national matter which we all hope will be successful.</P>
    <P>I do not want the Minister to misunderstand me&mdash;I am not trying to find fault&mdash;but as the Minister is going to put almost full powers into the hands of this company when established for the development of the mines, I should like to get an assurance that the Minister, and his colleague, the Minister for Finance, when selecting, as they will have to select I understand from the Bill, the directors of this company, will allow no consideration other than suitability for the particular job to enter into the selection of those directors; that so far as is possible, the board of directors will be composed of men who will be able to bring to the task expert knowledge, and, to put it in a nutshell, that no political consideration of any sort will enter into it. I want to make it clear that I am not suggesting that it is in the Minister's mind to do that.  But I do say that no political consideration, and no consideration other than that the best type of men available will be put on the directorate, should enter into it.</P>
    <P>There is one other point.  It is a small point, but it is small bits of grit in the machinery that very often create a lot of trouble.  I hope that neither the Minister nor the company, in the recruitment of the staff for these mines, whether it is the technical staff or, what is much more likely, the skilled, the semi-skilled, and the unskilled employees, will allow any question of politics to enter into it.  If I had my way, I would automatically disqualify any man who applied for a job armed with a recommendation from a T.D., or the secretary of any political club in this country.  That may appear to some people to be rather a small point to be making on the Second Stage of an important Bill like this.  I make it because I am desirous that this effort should get every possible chance of succeeding.  I am desirous that it should start off with the goodwill <Col N="93" /> of every person not only in the Slievardagh area, but in the whole County of Tipperary and the adjoining counties, and I would be the last person to wish that anybody could say there was anything in the nature of political favouritism or any political pull.  I do not believe the Minister would lend himself to that.  I want to say quite frankly that, on a matter like this, I do not believe the Minister would be so foolish as to do that.  If you like, I merely want to throw out a friendly word of warning to the Minister that such a thing may be done without his knowledge.</P>
    <P>So far as the project itself is concerned, I can only repeat that I think the Minister gave the House a very full statement on it.  He explained it clearly and did not try to paint the lily in any way.  I do not think he asked the House to accept this as being anything more than an experiment.  He is satisfied, and apparently the Government are satisfied, having regard to all the information they have been able to get, particularly from the survey undertaken between 1933 and 1937, which was the least optimistic of all the surveys made up to that date, that this State would be justified in expending at least £100,000 to satisfy itself as to whether it should go further with the development of this particular coal-mine or not.</P>

Some operations of this nature undertaken by the State have not been such as to encourage the Minister to go forward.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Nevertheless, I feel and I think the country feels, that in the circumstances of the moment the Minister is entitled to go forward and to take the risks postulated in this Bill. Since it is not possible for private enterprise to undertake work of this kind, and since there is an urgent need for an increased production of anthracite, it is only right that the State should undertake this.  The Minister gave some very strong reasons for this undertaking.  The first was the fact that the existing and working coal-mines are not adequate to supply the nation's needs; and the second was that there is a growing demand for this type of product.  At the present time, as we all know, anthracite is being used extensively not only for household purposes but as a fuel for transport as a substitute for petrol. Bearing those facts in mind, there is no reason why the Dáil should not give the Minister the powers he is seeking.  Perhaps the Minister, when replying, would make some comparison between the deposits which are available in this particular coalfield and the deposits which are being worked commercially in other areas.  That would enable members to form some idea of the prospect of success for this undertaking, and of the conditions under which mining work will have to be done.</P>
      <P>The Minister also stated that the new company proposed to carry out exploration work, and prospecting in the area in question and in other areas as well.  Having gained experience in this particular area, I wonder how far the company will be prepared to extend their activities to other areas.  There are certainly possibilities of development in other areas.  Some coal-mining development was undertaken in them by private enterprise.  It was not, I think, a success.  If this company is successful in its development work in the area in question, there is no reason why it should not carry out investigations in other areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The point raised by Deputy Morrissey in regard to the recruitment of employment in all branches of the work <Col N="95" /> to be done, was, I think, a desirable one, inasmuch as a definite statement from the Minister would strengthen the hands of the new company in resisting attempts on the part of people to secure employment by the use of undue influence.  For that reason I support the Deputy's statement, though I am sure that at the moment, the Minister has no intention of offending in that particular way.  The Minister, as I have said, made a good case for this Bill. I have no hesitation in supporting it, though, I confess, coalmining is a subject about which I do not know very much.</P>

      <P>Arising out of Deputy Morrissey's remarks, I would like to see this company avail of the services of a number of Irish nationals who, during the past 15 or 16 years, have had to migrate to England, and who are well experienced in coalmining.  I think if they have good recommendations from the collieries in which they have worked, it does not matter a straw whether they are supporters of the Government or of Deputy Morrissey and his Party.</P>

      <P>If you get experienced Irishmen you will find that they will give as good results as experienced Scotsmen, Englishmen, or even Americans. Since this State was set up, we have had experts from America, England, Scotland, and other places, and I think our experience has been that the Irish expert is as good as any other.  I think it can be said of him that he is more sincere in giving service to his country.  Therefore, I canvass the recruitment of coalmining workers from the colliery districts in England who have had to emigrate, and who, to my personal knowledge, have given good service in South Wales.  They occupy positions of importance in the collieries there.  As I have said, I would not object to their being employed if they were supporters of our friend, the enemy on the opposite side, or even of Deputy Cogan.  Therefore, I advocate that, as far as we can, we should get <Col N="96" /> our own nationals to work the coal-mine.</P>

      <P>I am compelled to support this Bill; I cannot do otherwise, as the money is to be spent in my own area, but I think the £100,000 at present voted is not sufficient.  At the outset, there is one thing which I should like to warn the Minister against, and that is disturbing the people who have been making a living on that coalfield.  They should not be disturbed until they get employment under, this Bill.  As the Minister is well aware, there are 60 or 70 people&mdash;perhaps, if you take their families, there may be 150 people&mdash;who have been making a living by poaching those coalfields during a number of years.  They have been earning a very good living, and their customers who bought the coal from them do not like to see them being taken off the road, as they say the coal will be dearer.</P>
      <P>I want to remind the Minister that those people have acquired rights there by the continual raising of coal, and that they ought not now to be disturbed. The Minister ought not to disturb them until he puts them into employment under this company which is being formed.  Also, outside the area of the coalfields there are people who have been making a very good living in raising coal.  It is a dirty, cold job for the ordinary farmer or farmer's son, but, in a bleak area with bad tillage, they are very glad to go down into a pit and make £1 a day.  The Bill gives power to the company to go outside and take over everything, and I want the Minister to see to it that whatever rights are acquired by those people are observed and continued, and that their condition when this company is formed will not be worse than before it was started.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I say, I have to support the Bill, because it concerns my own area.  I am dealing with people who think they are going to be millionaires when this thing is put through.  They have been led to believe that, not now but for years, from that side of the House. They have been told that when this mine is going they will all be wealthy people.  In their own interests I would <Col N="97" /> almost oppose the Bill at the moment, except that it is purely an experiment. I want to ensure that those people who have been making a fairly good living for the past four or five years, working those coalfields, will be continued in their livelihood when the company is formed.  I would ask the Minister to look into the whole matter very closely, and to see that this £100,000 is not completely wasted, or that it will not do more harm than good.  I am glad that those coalfields are going to be developed, but I think the amount of money voted at the moment will be too small.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Cogan said that private enterprise could not exploit those coalfields.  Did he ever ask himself why?  Was there ever any reluctance to exploit the coalfields of South Wales, or the coalfields in the Black Country of England or the coalfields in Germany?  On the contrary, there was always a fight that 40 could join in to see who would get the chance of exploiting them.  The reason why private enterprise cannot exploit those coalfields is provided in the significant words used by the Minister&mdash;the disturbed geological condition.  Now, we all know what that means; the coal seams are not economic coal seams.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. D. Morrissey Mr. D. Morrissey">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, I will come to the Shannon.  The reason those coalfields are not going to be exploited by private enterprise, and never would be exploited by private enterprise, is because they are the tail-end of the European coal deposit which was left after the glacier that slipped off into the Atlantic Ocean, and the disturbed geological condition to which the Minister refers is fully described in every elementary text-book on geology that touches on geology in this country. Of course, ten years ago the Minister for Industry and Commerce was denouncing Mr. Cosgrave because he did not exploit the mineral resources of this country, which were so abundant, so rich, and so unlimited. But, in ten years of office he has <Col N="98" /> learned sense.  He now comes before the House and says that the best recommendation he can give for this is that it is an experiment, and a very doubtful one at that.</P>
      <P>However, I think on the whole that this experiment is worth making.  The quality of the anthracite coal coming from Kilkenny is very good, and I suppose we may reasonably expect that the quality of the coal in this coalfield in Tipperary will approximate to it.  In those circumstances I think where you have a national resource there under your feet, even though it is not strictly economic to extract it, you can justify it on a variety of other grounds, and I am reassured by the approach of the Minister to this problem, because I am satisfied that we are not going to be led into a bottomless morass of expenditure in connection with this attempt. That we will lose money on it is virtually certain, and I think it would be wrong to suggest to the House that there is any prospect of making a mercantile profit on this enterprise.  I think the House ought to go into it in the full knowledge that it will be a subsidised industry as long as it continues to function.  With that fully in mind &mdash;provided the subsidy is kept within a reasonable limit&mdash;considering the amount of employment which will be made available, and considering the compensating advantage of a reduction in our external purchases in the troubled world in which we live, I think the experiment could be defended, but if we are going to embark upon it let us at least take the elementary precautions to make it a success.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is an immense amount of sound common sense in Deputy Ryan's representations here to-day.  All of us know that in the Pennsylvania coalfields a most acute problem was created by an attempt on the part of the coal owners in that area to ignore the acquired rights of what Deputy Ryan, for want of a better word, described as poachers. There was a very large number of families who made a living out of poaching coal on the Pennsylvania coalfields.  You cannot justify poaching coal out of another man's mine, but it is foolish to stick your head in the sand, to walk into an area where a <Col N="99" /> custom is well established and simply expect that you can wipe it out overnight and upset the finances and the whole economic organisation of a large number of families.  We have allowed that practice to grow up in the Slievardagh area, and we ought to take cognisance of it if we are going to regulate the working of the Slievardagh coal-mine.</P>
    <P>The proposal put forward by Deputy Ryan is a most sensible one; that is, that if these people are prepared to be reasonable with the State, the State will be reasonable with them, and that preference will be given to members of families who the State are satisfied were living out of this business, by employment in the coal mines, if the development of the mine results in the abolition of this trade to which Deputy Ryan referred.  There is a sound analogy for that in the practice of the Land Commission, where they give special consideration to the employees of an estate if that estate is acquired for distribution amongst the neighbouring uneconomic holders.</P>
    <P>Samuel Gillette made a fortune by discovering the simple doctrine that you could not make money on safety razors, but you could make millions on safety razor blades.  It was a good practice, he found, to give away razors; in fact it was good practice to pay people to take the razors away, because if people once got into the habit of using them, he argued, the demand for blades would enable him to make a satisfactory profit for an indefinite period.  People forget how to use the old-fashioned &ldquo;cut-throat,&rdquo; and are constrained to buy razor blades, whatever price the seller may want to charge for them.</P>
    <P>If we intend to develop the use of anthracite in this country, we ought, as part of the activities of our company, promote the sale of anthracite-burning stoves and ranges.  Would it not be worth our while to consider the advisability of an agreement with the manufacturers of Esse stoves to give a concession to this coal company to sell or promote the sale of these stoves, boilers or ranges in this country, and might it not be good to subsidise, out <Col N="100" /> of the company's revenue, the sale of these articles, because once you have put a house or an institution on an anthracite-burning basis, that house or institution is your customer for good? The anthracite plant will not burn soft coal, whereas if you leave these institutions with soft coal-burning appliances, these appliances will never satisfactorily burn anthracite coal.  The fact is that the Kilkenny coal burns in the modern Esse and Aga equipment as satisfactorily as Welsh anthracite coal, and we all know that the immense increase in the consumption of anthracite coal is largely due to the installation of Aga and Esse ranges and stoves all through the country.  The scope for expanding the use of these is immense.</P>
    <P>What I am afraid of is that, after we have sunk our money in Slievardagh, some warrior will call on the Minister and announce that he is going to make anthracite stoves in Ballydehob, that he wants a tariff of 95 per cent., a quota, a guarantee of profit and an ample expense account for himself, his niece, his two first cousins and an aunt&mdash;which he will get&mdash;whereupon anthracite stoves will become too expensive for anybody to buy.  Our money will meanwhile be invested in the Slievardagh coal-mine and the net results will be unsatisfactory for everybody. Can we assume now, if we are going to give the money to the Government to sink in Slievardagh, that they will do the best they can to sell the maximum amount of this coal so that the enterprise will be given the best possible chance of success, or are we to assume that, having sunk public money in developing this coal-mine, the equipment necessary efficiently to burn the coal is going to be made subject to tariffs and restrictions to such effect that we will ultimately end up by having no suitable equipment to burn the coal except what can be provided only in the houses of millionaires?</P>
    <P>I should like to see this coal produced and made the fuel, not of the select few, but of the masses of our people, and I should like to see the stoves requisite efficiently to burn it made available for even the poorest houses.  If that is done, then we will feel that we <Col N="101" /> are doing something useful.  There is this danger.  Other interests may prevent that coming to pass.  Will the Minister give us an assurance that in future his primary concern in regard to anthracite coal will be to secure the maximum consumption at the lowest possible price, and that that will go not only in respect to the coal but to the stoves in which to burn it?</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to welcome the departure which this Bill indicates from the previous practice of relying exclusively on private enterprise. So far as the exploitation of our mineral resources is concerned, private enterprise has hopelessly failed.  It is true, as Deputy Dillon says, that the disinclination on the part of private enterprise has been due largely to fears that the mineral deposits are not marketable and that the expenditure of money on the exploitation of minerals is likely to be accompanied by a prolonged period of financial headache, with the possibility that in the end all the money invested will be lost.  There is little doubt that private enterprise would never go into the Slievardagh coalfield, just as private enterprise has been reluctant to go into other coalfields, except on a restricted scale.  I am glad the Minister has recognised that these deposits can only be exploited under the aegis of the State and, in so far as they will be exploited and will produce fuel for the community and give much-needed employment, I welcome this Bill as a progressive measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope the Minister will not be content with the development merely of the Slievardagh coalfields.  There are deposits elsewhere which, in peaceful times, and if we were afflicted with a wave of prosperity, we could afford to leave untouched, but, in existing circumstances, it is absolutely imperative, being in the blockaded position in which we are to-day, to develop every possible mineral deposit in the country. Not merely must we do that in respect of minerals, but we must do it in respect of every other commodity which we formerly imported, and which we cannot now import because of lack of shipping facilities.  I hope the Minister will not content himself with exploiting <Col N="102" /> the Slievardagh coal deposits, but that he will insist, as he has the power to do, on the directors of the company to be established under this Bill prospecting in other areas, and, if coal is found in circumstances which justify its exploitation, I trust there will be no hesitancy about developing such deposits to the fullest extent.</P>
    <P>There are extensive coal deposits in the Carlow area.  Rossmore colliery has been worked on rather rudimentary principles up to the present, but, if the viewpoint of local people is to be accepted, and their memories go back a considerable number of years, there are very large deposits there, not merely of coal, but of other minerals which are usually found in close association with coal.  The Minister is aware, and so is his Department, that efforts have been made to exploit these coal deposits by private enterprise, but it is not possible at this stage to say whether these efforts will be successful. If, however, they are not successful, I urge the Minister to bear in mind the extent of these deposits, and to utilise the instrument provided in the Bill to ensure that these deposits, like those of Slievardagh, will be exploited to the fullest, so that we may, so far as possible, relieve the chronic fuel famine which will undoubtedly ensue if we are unable to import fuel from other countries.</P>
    <P>This Bill, of course, brings to the fore, as other Bills in other circumstances have done, the question as to the manner in which the coalfield is to be exploited and the affairs of the company directed.  We have a number of boards in this country which have been established under legislation and under Votes of money provided by the House, many of the directors of which are simply political nominees&mdash;ex-Deputies, ex-Senators, folk of one kind or another who do not commend themselves to the electorate, hard-luck cases which occur after every election and somebody feels that there is some necessity to try to Find a board on which these people can be put.  We put them on these boards and we pay them very handsomely.  I think that practice savours of the grossest nepotism, and I do not think we are <Col N="103" /> doing any credit to the State, or reflecting any credit on our legislation or parliamentary practices, by loading up these boards with either active camp followers of the Party in power or the casualties that occur at election times.</P>
    <P>I hope this board is not going to be a political board as some of them already in existence are.  If you take the Hospitals Commission, the Turf Board, the Agricultural Credit Corporation and the Sugar Board and look at the directors, you will find a common streak through them all&mdash; political nominees.  I am not saying that the same thing was not done when the Cumann na nGaedheal Party was in office, but I do say now that if Cumann na nGaedheal started it, this Government have brought it to a fine art in so far as the limited field at their disposal is concerned.  I am opposed to that practice.  I think it a disreputable practice which merely means loading people into jobs.  If we are going to develop turf, we ought to find people with the ability to do it, and if we are going to develop coal, we ought to get technicians to do the development.  What we ought to try to do is to get away from the unsavoury practice of putting camp-followers into positions as directors of these boards.  I hope that that odious practice, which has continued in this House for the past 18 or 19 years, will not be perpetuated in the present instance, and that it will not be resorted to on future occasions, either.</P>
    <P>The Minister is empowered to require the board, under Section 16, to furnish a balance sheet in such form as he decides and that balance sheet shall be laid before the House, which, of course, means that it is laid in the Library.  One does not get a sufficiently extensive picture of the activities of a company merely by looking at its balance sheet, and I think that what the Minister ought to do in connection with this section is not merely to require the board to present an audited statement of accounts and a profit and loss account, but to produce as well a reasonably concise report as to its activities, so that we may not merely know the purely cash transactions of <Col N="104" /> the board, but may have some idea as to the nature of its activities, the policy it has pursued and its programme for the future.  A reasonably brief statement on these lines would, I think, be helpful to the House and to the country, and would help to throw some light on the activities of a company in respect of which the public are going to put up £100,000.</P>
    <P>As I said at the outset, I welcome the Bill.  I think it is a useful departure from the previous policy of leaving the development of such resources to private enterprise which failed&mdash;the circumstances under which it failed are immaterial&mdash;to develop these deposits. I congratulate the Minister on having the courage to come to the House to ask for money for a purpose of this kind.  I hope that the exploitation of the coalfields will be a success and that it will help to dissipate a good deal of the doubts and misgivings which every pioneer of mineral development in this country meets, even in high places, when he attempts to suggest that our mineral deposits should be exploited for the benefit of the nation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the House for the reception which the Bill has received.  I have endeavoured, in putting it before the House, to be quite candid in regard to the problem which we have to face in undertaking the development of the Slievardagh coalfield, but I should not like the House to think that, because I have been cautious and conservative in my description of this venture, it is entirely in the nature of a gamble.  It is, I think, a legitimate speculation.  We may go in there and because the field is a faulty field, and because the difficulties have been intensified by reason of the old workings to which Deputy Morrissey referred, and of which, I should like to say, we have no record, we may not succeed in proving the field to be a practicable one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is a fact which I felt it necessary to put before the House in order that everybody might understand that we could give no guarantee that this £100,000, no matter how judiciously handled, would be a safe venture.  I hope the risk we are taking will be <Col N="105" /> justified and I hope that, in consequence, we shall be able to provide employment here for perhaps 500 or 600 people for 30 or 40 years; but that is a hope.  It is a hope which justifies the expenditure we propose to undertake, but I have no certainty that the hope will be realised, and I want that to be quite clear.  I think it desirable that we should, all of us, know what the situation in that regard may be.</P>
    <P>With regard to the board, I shall endeavour to select a board which will be capable of doing its job and, having selected them, I intend to tell them that full responsibility for the success or otherwise of this undertaking rests with them, bearing, of course, in mind that I am familiar with the difficulties with which they may have to contend, but that, nevertheless, they will be held responsible, if they select people who are unfit for the tasks which are going to be entrusted to them.  Beyond that, I can say that there will be no interference on my part with this company in its operations.  But as, naturally, I have, with the Minister for Finance, to carry public responsibility for this undertaking, it will be clear that my judgment will have to carry in selecting the personnel of the board.  I can say to the House that it is my intention that those selected, so far as we can procure them in this country, will be particularly qualified for their task.</P>
    <P>Bearing in mind what I have said, Deputy Ryan will understand that I can give no guarantee as to how the board may deal with persons interested, but I hope that, being composed of competent men, it will recognise as Deputy Ryan and Deputy Dillon have recognised, the advisability of ensuring that, so far as possible, the existing interests on the field are not disregarded. Again, I do not propose to tie the hands of the board by making any declaration here.  Matters will have to be left to the judgment of the board.  That applies also to the question which Deputy Kennedy mentioned, the position of Irishmen who might be particularly qualified for work in the mine, who may be abroad, but may seek employment.  We know that one of the difficulties in getting any enterprise <Col N="106" /> going in a rural, or indeed in any circumscribed area in Ireland, arises from the fact that sometimes it may be necessary to bring in labour, and that difficulties may be created by that. I shall have to depend in regard to that matter upon the judgment, good sense, and competency of the board to do what is in the best interests of the company and, of course, of the country as a whole.</P>
    <P>I have no difficulty in giving the assurance which Deputy Dillon mentioned in precise terms when he was sitting down, that the primary job of the company will be to push and to secure the sale of anthracite coal to the maximum extent possible.  That, of course, will be borne in mind by me in regard to any proposal which may come before me, if one of the effects of it might be to restrict the sale of anthracite. It will be one of the functions of the board, as soon as it gets going, and as soon as we have satisfied ourselves that it has justified itself, and has a proper organisation, to undertake the work of investigating and exploring other coal deposits in this country.  I should like to say that the first task of the board will be to try to open up Slievardagh coalfield and get it going, and the rest of its activities at the moment must be subsidiary to that.  Accordingly I should like Deputy Norton not to be under the misconception that the moment we get this company formed it is going to start exploring other coalfields simultaneously with its attempt to develop the Slievardagh coalfield.  I do not think that would be fair to the company, or that it would be likely to be productive of the best results from the point of view which the Deputy has in mind.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cogan asked me to tell the House how the deposits at Slievardagh compared with Castlecomer.  According to the report of the consulting engineer the quality of the coal at Slievardagh is comparable to the coal at Castlecomer.  In some respects, as far as I know, it is not quite the same standard, though the difference is very slight and we may find in the actual working of the mine that the seams <Col N="107" /> may improve as developed.  In any event, it certainly is not, according to the analysis, an inferior grade of anthracite, and if we can extract it from the mine in sufficient quantities to make medium scale working possible it will be a valuable asset.</P>

      <P>Some are 16 and some are 18 inches.  They vary.  The thickness of the seams would be about the same.  The only thing is that the Slievardagh field is more faulty, so that the Castlecomer coalfield may be less difficult to work.  The extent of the coal measures is more certain at Castlecomer than at Slievardagh.  The consulting engineer reported that in this particular area, in the seams worth developing, there are about 5,500,000 tons. Some people think that estimate too high, that it might be about 4,000,000 tons.  It is something between these figures.  On the other hand, I gather that at Castlecomer they have proved reserves of over 5,500,000 tons.</P>
      <P>In the case of Arigna, the position is that there are about 8,500,000 tons of coal there, consisting of main coal and crow coal, the latter of which is estimated at 4,500,000 or 5,000,000 tons. Arigna coal is semi-anthracite, a steam coal, but it is not the same high carbon content as Slievardagh and Castlecomer, though it is a steam coal, and burns easier.  It is fair coal and I only wish we had more of it in this country.  The only other deposit of any significance is that in the Munster coalfield and that field is of so faulty a nature that no one has been able to express any authoritative opinion as to its value or possibilities.  Perhaps, when the new company gets going it may be able to undertake work which it has not been possible to get done in any sort of regular way, and that is to examine that coalfield also.</P>

      <P>Go ndeontar suim bhreise ná raghaidh thar £303,741 chun íoctha an Mhuirir a thiocfaidh chun bheith iníoctha i rith na bliana dar críoch an 31adh lá de Mhárta, 1941, chun Tuarastail agus Costaisí Oifig an Aire Talmhaidheachta, agus Seirbhísí áirithe atá fé riaradh na hOifige sin, maraon ie hIldeontaisí-i-gCabhair.</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £303,741 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending 31st March, 1941, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for Agriculture, and of certain Services administered by that Office, including sundry Grants-in-Aid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Estimate is for £303,741, but of this sum £238,000 is offset by a saving of the same amount on sub-head A of the Export Subsidies Vote (No. 68). The main items of the Estimate are: sub-head M (7), £238,000, and sub-head N (1), £64,500.  I want to give some details in connection with these two sub-heads.  The big item is in connection with the provision of butter for winter requirements, £238,000.  It is estimated that the creamery butter production for the year ending 31st March, 1941, will be 655,000 cwts., as against 714,000 cwts. last year.  The production of butter during the last 12 months, including the month of March on which we have now entered, was lower than during the previous 12 months by about 60,000 cwts.  Practically all this reduction occurred in the four months, August, September, October and November.  In the months of April, May, June and July last, the production was about the same as <Col N="110" /> during the corresponding months in 1939.  It was only towards the end of August that the returns coming in from creameries showed that there was a decline in production.  That decline continued during the four months, August, September, October and November.  In fact, the production was lower by 55,000 cwts. than it was for the corresponding four months of 1939.</P>
    <P>When these returns were received by the Department the position was reviewed, and exports were stopped. There was no export of butter from this country after the 31st August, except about 1,000 cwts. which were allowed out to complete certain contracts which had been entered into.  In fact, the amount of butter exported during those 12 months was lower than during the previous 12 months by a considerable quantity.  The amount exported during the year 1939-40 was 240,000 cwts., and the amount exported this year was 227,000 cwts., so that we did in fact export 13,000 cwts. less than in the previous year.</P>
    <P>These figures do not in fact give a true picture of the situation, because our usual carry-over of butter on 31st March always ranged about 8,000 or 9,000 cwts.  The carry-over on the 31st March, 1940, that is the beginning of the present year, was over 20,000 cwts. So that if there had been the usual export the year the war commenced, and if we had carried over the usual 8,000 or 9,000 cwts., the difference in export in the two years would be much more marked than the figures I have given show.</P>
    <P>Another point is, that taking our other exports of dairy products&mdash;condensed milk, dried milk, cheese, and non-creamery butter&mdash;we exported in the year 1939 54,000 cwts. of butter fat in the form of condensed milk, cheese, etc., and in the present year we only exported 38,000 cwts.  I mention these facts because it was alleged by people interested in this matter that we had exported much more butter this year than we did previously.  That is not true.  As a matter of fact, in making up our programme for the year in April last, the amount that we intended to export was reduced by about 10 per cent. on that of the previous <Col N="111" /> year, as we had forecast a certain reduction in production.  The dry season that came later in the year effected a very much bigger reduction than we anticipated, and it was owing to that fact that we were left short of butter during the winter.</P>
    <P>Now I come to the price.  The production from 1st April to 30th November, 1940, was 609,000 cwts.  The delivered statutory home price for this period was 154/- per cwt., less levy 9/- and freight 2/-, making a net 143/- per cwt.  To this has been added a production allowance of 6/ per cwt., owing to the lower production, and that makes a net total to the creameries for butter during that period of 149/- per cwt.</P>
    <P>The production from 1st December, 1940, to 31st March, 1941, is estimated at 46,000 cwts.  The delivered statutory home price for this period is 154/- per cwt., less freight 2/-.  There was no levy.  That gives 152/- per cwt.  It is proposed to pay an allowance of 18/- per cwt. on this production, making a total of 170/-per cwt. for that period. Therefore, the average value for the whole year will be 150/4 per cwt.</P>
    <P>As to sub-head N (1) &mdash; Diseases of Animals Acts, etc., £64,500, the main items under this are £22,500 for the employment of temporary lay assistants, and £40,000 compensation for animals slaughtered in connection with the outbreaks of foot and mouth disease.  Owing to the extent of the area covered by the standstill Order made under the Diseases of Animals Acts, the Department found it necessary to employ men to assist the Gárda Síochána in patrolling the districts affected.  About 2,000 men will be employed at 7/6 per day.  The number of outbreaks that have been notified so far is 53.  The number of cattle affected by these outbreaks was 2,112, sheep 1,440, goats 44, and swine 130.  The estimated value of these animals is £38,499, and the amount provided in the Estimate for compensation is £40,000.  It is probable, however, that this amount may be exceeded, but the excess will not be required before 31st March.  I shall come back to foot-and-mouth <Col N="112" /> disease again, but I want to go through the other sub-heads.</P>
    <P>The first of these is B&mdash;Travelling Expenses, £3,000.  The additional provision is required for the payment of travelling and subsistence expenses of veterinary inspectors on foot-and-mouth disease duty.  The next is G (3) &mdash;Fertilisers Scheme, £9,000.  In the year 1938-39 the amount paid in subsidies and fertilisers was £84,959.  In the year 1939-40, the amount was £76,394.  For this year, to the end of January, the amount paid was £37,189. The expenditure in the current financial year has been £37,271 in respect of the 1939-40 season, and £37,189 in respect of the 1940-41 season.  It is estimated that a further £14,540 will be required up to the 31st March, 1941, making a total of £89,000 for the year.</P>
    <P>The next sub-head is M (1) &mdash;Miscellaneous Work, £2,500.  This money was spent on a scheme for advertising Irish eggs in Great Britain.  It was estimated that the cost would be about £5,000, but the scheme was terminated on 30th June, 1940, consequent on the measures taken by the British Ministry of Food to control the importation of eggs, which rendered an advertisement campaign on our part unnecessary.</P>
    <P>Sub-head M.5 &mdash; £10,000 &mdash; improvement of the creamery industry.  The additional sum is required for the purchase of two creameries.  Sub-head M.11&mdash;farm improvement scheme &mdash;£9,900.  This is the amount required for the payment in the current financial year of the wages, travelling expenses, etc., of the farm improvement supervisors and temporary agricultural overseers employed in connection with the new farm improvement scheme.  I should say that the amount which is now sanctioned for payment on that scheme is £180,000.  I do not know if all that will be paid within this financial year.</P>
    <P>I come back now to the foot-and-mouth disease, and may commence by saying that it is undoubtedly the most serious outbreak that we have had in this country for a century.  I am convinced that the policy of eradication which is being followed&mdash;it has always been followed here as long as this foot-and-mouth <Col N="113" /> disease has had to be dealt with&mdash;is the proper policy.  Some people seem to have a doubt about the advisability of dealing with the foot-and-mouth disease in that way, people who are actuated, I think, by motives, whether misplaced or not, of humanity and so on.  They think that it is a very cruel thing&mdash;they even think it is a great economic loss&mdash;to slaughter so many animals in order to get rid of this disease.  The argument has been put up by many people that the disease is curable.  As a matter of fact, dozens of people have called to see me and to see the officers of my Department to tell us that this disease can be cured.  No doubt it can.  As a matter of fact, a lot of those animals would probably get well if they were left alone, but if they were left either to get well themselves or to be treated in any way, we would have an appalling spread of the disease.  I think there is very little doubt that it would spread over the whole country and affect every single beast, whether cattle, sheep or pigs.  What is worse, it is adisease that does not confer immunity for very long.  If we could be assured that, if we allowed the disease to run through our flocks, we might then be immune from it for some years, there might be some reason to consider the argument, &ldquo;let it spread&rdquo;, but it is not so.  The immunity is of very short duration, and wave after wave of the disease would spread throughout the country if it were not tackled with the least possible delay.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is anybody in this House who has suggested that we should deal with the disease in that way, but there are people outside the House who think that we have tackled this disease blindly, doing what our predecessors did before us, and doing what our neighbours do in Great Britain, without giving any thought whatever to the problem.  I can assure everybody that the matter has been very carefully considered, both by our veterinary advisers and by those who look at it even from the economic point of view.  They have taken the view that eradication is the only way of dealing with it.  We also get letters <Col N="114" /> from time to time from people who say that they can immunise cattle against this disease.  I do not know if that is true.  I do know that immunisation has been tried on the continent of Europe and has not proved very successful.  But, in any case, the same objections would hold: that while we were immunising our cattle and so on, the spread of the disease would be taking place and there would be enormous economic losses.  It is very hard to calculate what that loss might be.  It is held that it puts cattle back at least a month or two in condition. Even if they are only put back a month in condition, we can all imagine what the loss would be if the disease were to spread through, a considerable proportion of our flocks before we could get after it.</P>
    <P>I have also been criticised for not having done some research in this disease.  Well, we have not done research either with regard to the cure or immunisation because, as I have said, we were convinced that the proper way to deal with it was to eradicate it; but a considerable amount of research has been done in countries where it is endemic&mdash;on the Continent&mdash;and no great progress would appear to have been made.  The next point that I want to make clear is this, although I think it should be clear to every farmer in the country, that if the farmer reports, where he has any suspicion that his cattle are affected, and if it is afterwards confirmed that it is really foot-and-mouth disease, he will be fully compensated for all the cattle, sheep and swine that may be slaughtered.  I have not heard a complaint from any owner that he was badly treated in this respect.  I think every Deputy will agree with me that, if any farmer thought that he had not got proper compensation, I would have heard about it before now.</P>
    <P>I think there need be no anxiety amongst farmers that they will not be fully compensated if the disease is reported in a proper way.  What is more, I am quite prepared to make allowance for a farmer being unaware of the existence of the disease for some time, even though he did not report it as promptly as the farmer who had his <Col N="115" /> wits about him would.  On the other hand, where cases are concealed, and unfortunately there have been attempts at concealment, in my opinion, in this particular outbreak, I want to point out that it is an offence to make any attempt at concealment.  A farmer can be prosecuted for doing so.  Apart, however, from the question of a prosecution, I have full discretion in awarding compensation in such cases.</P>
    <P>As I have said, the policy that we have pursued here in this outbreak is the policy of eradication.  In attempting to eradicate the disease we must take drastic measures.  I have, in all cases, in consultation with the veterinary advisers of the Department, sanctioned any drastic measures that they have thought necessary.  On the other hand, I would like to say that the veterinary officers, wherever they thought they could possibly permit it, have avoided imposing any unnecessary hardships on anybody in dealing with the outbreak.  There is criticism, naturally, of the way in which this outbreak has been dealt with.  I say &ldquo;naturally&rdquo; because I can understand farmers who are upset in their business being impatient and anxious, blaming officers and so on, if they think that they are not carrying out their business as they should.  The criticism would seem to come from two directions; some say that the regulations are far too strict, and some say that the regulations are far too lenient.  I do not want to avoid any responsibility as regards anything that may be done. I would, however, like to say this, that when dealing with an outbreak of this character I must be guided entirely by the veterinary staff in the Department. When the chief veterinary inspector comes to me&mdash;he consults, I presume, with his own veterinary staff&mdash;and says it is necessary to take some very drastic step, I have invariably done what the chief veterinary inspector asked me to do.  I think I would be very foolish to do otherwise, because if I did otherwise the chief veterinary inspector would feel that he was not getting the full co-operation which he would require in dealing with this very serious position.  On the other hand, <Col N="116" /> if the chief veterinary inspector is inclined to allow a certain function to take place, whatever it may be, and if he sees no danger in such a function taking place, I am not going, of my own volition, to stop such a function for the sake of meeting public opinion. I am guided entirely in those matters by the chief veterinary officer.</P>
    <P>Let me deal with hardship first. Undoubtedly there is hardship, and hardship of a kind that cannot be compensated for.  First of all, let us take the farmer who has an outbreak on his farm.  I have said that he is very well compensated on the present value of his animals, but I am sure that even that is not welcomed by any farmer at the moment.  A farmer does not look on an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease amongst his own flock as a stroke of good fortune, even though he does get the market value, or even a bit more than the market value for his cattle, his sheep, and his pigs, because he is put out of the business of farming for some time to come, and he is not compensated for that consequential loss.  Apart from the farmers who are affected, you have the farmers in the restricted area, and they are suffering in many ways.  For instance, there is the farmer who may have a good milch cow to sell; he cannot sell that milch cow because he cannot move her, and by the time the restrictions are lifted she will be no longer a new milch cow, and will not be worth the money she is worth at the moment.  There are farmers also who had fat cattle ready for sale, and who had to hold them over.  Those cattle, after being held over for seven or ten or fourteen days, will probably not be worth any more than they were worth when he had them fit for sale, although he will have had the expense of giving them additional feeding. There are farmers who perhaps have had to use up now the very necessary feeding stuffs that they had intended to hold over for other stock by getting rid of their fat cattle, and they will be put to the expense of buying more feeding stuffs when they get the opportunity. All those things are annoying, and indeed very hard on the farmers concerned, but still I think that the farmers as a whole will suffer those <Col N="117" /> inconveniences and even suffer those losses in the hope that we may be able to deal with the outbreak as effectively and as rapidly as possible.</P>
    <P>Then there are other classes; there are, for instance, the men who made their living as dealers.  Now, they arc completely demobilised, and they are the people, unfortunately if you like for their sake, in regard to whom we are most careful that they must remain out of the business for the time being. A lot of the regulations that we have made are made for the set purpose of preventing the dealers from going around from one farm to another to buy cattle, but in the dealers own interests it is better that we should deal with this thing as drastically as possible, so that they may get back to their means of livelihood as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>Then there is in this city, and I suppose in the towns to some extent, quite a number of butchers, quite a number of drovers, and quite a number of people who were employed in the making of sausages and the canning of meat, and who are now unemployed. All I can say is that the more drastic we are in keeping those regulations there&mdash;regulations which are very much to their disadvantage at the moment&mdash; the better for them in the long run.  We must at this time be drastic; we must not have either misplaced or foolish sympathy for certain classes; we must not make the mistake of being too lenient, and thereby perhaps spread the disease again.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, there is no reason at all why we should be panicky.  There is no reason why we should do things that are unnecessary, or that put unnecessary hardship on any class or on any individual.  I will take the instance of dog races and horse races.  In some cases they are prohibited, and in some cases they are not.  Open coursing in the restricted area is forbidden; open coursing outside the restricted area is not forbidden.  Point-to-point races are discontinued.  There was no order made in that case, because there was only a limited number of them; the committees were got in touch with in each case, and agreed to postpone their <Col N="118" /> point-to-point races for some time.  All dog races and horse races on a confined course are allowed, except in cases where those courses are close to an infected farm.  In this particular instance, I personally had some doubt as to whether or not we should permit the races to go on, but I was informed by my veterinary advisers that they could give no veterinary reasons for stopping those horse races; that they could give no more reason for stopping those races than, say, for stoppings football match, because the congregation of people is undoubtedly somewhat dangerous, but we might just as logically stop a football match or even stop people from going to religious services as stop people from going to a race meeting or a dog track. The dogs and the horses themselves are not more likely to carry the disease than the men and the women who go to those races; in fact they are less likely, because dogs and horses are not permitted off infected farms, while it is very difficult to stop humans from infected farms from going to any gathering whatever, whether it is a football match or anything else.  In those matters I should like to say that the veterinary officers decide on scientific and rational grounds.  They are not affected in any way by public opinion, and are not actuated by any other motive.  In a case like this, I think it would be a pity that veterinary officers, or in fact any men who have to decide on a scientific basis, should by any sort of agitation be compelled to how to public opinion.  It is much better that they should go entirely on their own judgment in those cases.</P>
    <P>There have been other complaints made which are more specific.  For instance, a complaint was made to me from at least two or three sources that we were very slow in the slaughtering of animals on the affected farms.  However efficient we may be, or however anxious we may he to deal with this outbreak in an expeditious manner, it takes some little time to get all the preliminaries carried out and to do everything that is necessary before we slaughter the animals.  I have looked <Col N="119" /> up a number of time-tables and I have found that from the time the case is notified to the Department until a veterinary officer from the Department calls it is, as a rule, only a matter of a few hours.  He may have to go back the next day before he is prepared to verify a case.  Every case reported to us is not a case of foot-and-mouth disease.  There have been dozens of cases notified to the Department as suspicious which have not turned out to be foot-and-mouth disease and it is not surprising, therefore, if a veterinary officer from the Department examines a beast under suspicion, that he may not be able to pronounce there and then that it is a case of foot-and-mouth disease.  He may say it is suspicious and in that case he serves an order on the owner to keep the flock isolated.  He goes back the next day and then he is usually able to give a definite opinion.  If it turns out definitely to be foot-and-mouth disease, the necessary preliminaries are gone through as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>The slowest job is the digging of the hole necessary to hold these animals.  I do not know if people realise how careful we have to be in burying animals.  The hole has to be nine feet deep, seven to eight feet wide, and roughly a yard is allowed for every animal, so that with a fair-sized farm you have to dig a hole nine feet deep, seven or eight feet wide and perhaps 100 yards long, and that takes time.  We had to depart entirely from the practice of getting the labourers on a farm to dig the hole, because that took far too long. The holes are made by the military and in that way we get the job done very much faster.  Comparing the time we take here with the time that was taken on former occasions in this country, and with the time taken in neighbouring countries, we are far quicker.</P>
    <P>It was suggested to me by one individual&mdash;and I may say that all these people want to be helpful&mdash;that we might slaughter these animals and then wait for the hole to be dug. <Col N="120" /> There, again, we have a most difficult problem, because Deputies from the country know that when the animals die they become swollen in the body and very stiff in the limbs, and if we were to adopt that suggestion the hole necessary would have to be probably 50 feet longer.  The only possible chance we have of packing all the animals in is to have them slaughtered and put into the hole while they are hot and soft. Another complaint made to me was that we were not sufficiently drastic about disinfection and isolation.  I was trained in the medical profession and I have some knowledge of disinfection. I am perfectly satisfied from what I have seen that there is no ground for that complaint.  Every officer of the Department has been most particular about this matter of isolation and disinfection. As a matter of fact, no case has been spread by any officer of the Department or through any laxity in taking the measures necessary with regard to isolation and disinfection.</P>
    <P>Necessarily, we had to allow a certain amount of meat into Dublin, if that could be done with safety.  We consulted the veterinary staff and they said they were satisfied that it could be done under certain conditions.  The one thing they wanted to avoid was having dealers going from farm to farm looking for cattle, sheep or pigs. We had to adopt some system under which we would get the producers to send the cattle direct to Dublin without any dealers calling on them, except under control.  It was an urgent matter and we had to set up some machinery within a number of hours. It was suggested to me that we should select as a committee the Chairman of the Cattle Traders' Association, the Chairman of the Dublin Butchers, and three members who were somewhat more prominent in the dressed meat trade than any of the others engaged in that trade.  I agreed to that committee being set up.  That committee has to buy all the cattle and sheep. It is done in this way.  A producer will apply to the Department for a permit to sell his cattle or sheep to this committee.  The committee will then send a buyer, who is accompanied <Col N="121" /> by an officer from my Department, an officer who is not a veterinary surgeon. Both of them are thoroughly disinfected before entering and before leaving the farm.  The buyer purchases cattle and sheep at a price which the producers know they must accept and these animals are then sold according to grade to the butchers in Dublin.</P>
    <P>The principal object of that arrangement was to supply Dublin with meat, but the scheme was also drawn up in order to avoid as far as possible dealers going from farm to farm when they were not under proper control. This is only a temporary provision, and as soon as the veterinary staff will permit it, as soon as they think it is safe, we hope to depart from that system and go back to the regular way of trade.  It would be more acceptable to the butchers and to everybody concerned if we could get back to the live-stock market.  We mean to do that as soon as we can.</P>
    <P>I want to give a little history of how these outbreaks took place, so that Deputies may have some idea of how it spread from one place to another. We can only give an opinion of how it spread in certain cases; in other cases I think it can be stated fairly definitely how it spread.  On the 16th January the Department was informed by the Northern Ministry that foot-and-mouth disease had been confirmed on premises about eight miles north-east of Derry and, as a result, the Department immediately made an order prohibiting the removal of animals from Northern Ireland into this State.  On 17th January, the next day, the disease was confirmed on a farm in Derry within two miles of the Donegal border.  Immediately, an area in County Donegal, lying roughly north of a line running from Strabane to Letterkenny and bounded by Lough Swilly and Lough Foyle, was made a restricted area.  Next day, 18th January, the Department received a report of a suspected disease on a farm premises in County Donegal.  Inspectors from the Department were already on their way to Donegal, owing to the outbreak in Derry, but they had difficulty in getting through, owing to a very severe <Col N="122" /> snowstorm.  The disease, however, was dealt with pending their arrival. On the next day, 19th January, the Northern Ministry informed my Department that visits had been paid to a number of premises in County Donegal by a person who had been in contact with the disease in County Derry, and that, of course, is what spread the disease to County Donegal. On 20th January, disease was confirmed on premises in County Donegal lying within the scheduled area, and, since that date, eight further outbreaks have been confirmed in Donegal. The source of infection in the Donegal area was obviously traceable to the infected centres in County Derry, but it is hoped that the disease in County Donegal is now well under control.</P>
    <P>The first outbreak was in County Donegal on 18th January.  On 24th January, disease was confirmed on a farm premises in the vicinity of Abbeyleix and, since that date, six further outbreaks have occurred in that area. It appeared to be under control until, on 9th February&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is one of the things we cannot say definitely.  There are various theories, but I cannot say definitely. On 9th February, the S.S. &ldquo;Kilkenny&rdquo; left Dublin for Birkenhead with 753 animals.  On 11th February, two days after, the British Ministry informed the Department here that one of the animals landed from the S.S. &ldquo;Kilkenny&rdquo; was showing suspicious symptoms of foot-and-mouth disease, and, as a result, an order was issued from Great Britain prohibiting the landing in Great Britain of all animals shipped from Northern Ireland and Eire.  That was reported as a suspicious case, but, on 12th February, the disease was confirmed, and on that date an order was made prohibiting the holding of markets within the borough or county of Dublin.  The Department at once began tracing the home farms of all the animals shipped on the S.S. &ldquo;Kilkenny&rdquo; and this work was completed by 17th February, five days later, no evidence of foot-and-mouth <Col N="123" /> disease being found on the farms visited.</P>
      <P>I want to stop at that point for a minute.  There seems to be some opinion that we should have acted more drastically at that point.  If we had foreseen what was to come, there is no doubt that we should have done so, but it has happened before that animals landed at an English port have contracted foot-and-mouth disease within 48 hours of landing there, that is, contracting the disease there and not bringing it with them from this side, and the veterinary officers of the Department were inclined to think it might be possible that that was the case in this instance.  Having traced all the contacts of these cattle which went on the S.S. &ldquo;Kilkenny&rdquo; and having found that there was no trace of the disease in any of the contacts, they were inclined to think that the theory that the cattle had contracted the disease on the other side was correct. However, we are convinced now that that was not true.  The disease was brought from this side.</P>
      <P>On 19th February, eight days after the disease was confirmed in Birkenhead, a case was found in animals slaughtered in the Dublin Abattoir. These animals came from a lairage in Prussia Street and further investigations showed that they were purchased at Birr fair on 11th February.  When tracing the animals exposed at Birr fair it was found that a farmer on whose premises foot-and-mouth disease was subsequently discovered had exposed cattle for sale at the fair and it is presumed now, and supported, I think, by very good evidence that these cases in Dublin came from the same source, that is, the Birr source.  On the same date, further cases of foot-and-mouth disease were discovered in a private slaughter house in Dublin in animals which had come from the same lairage as the diseased animals found in the abattoir. Since that date, 32 outbreaks have occurred in the city of Dublin and vicinity, and the disease is still active in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 21st February, two days later, the <Col N="124" /> disease was confirmed on premises in County Kildare.  On 23rd February, the disease was confirmed on a second premises in County Kildare, the owner of which had exposed cattle at the Naas fair on 19th February.  As a consequence, five further outbreaks have occurred in animals exposed at that fair.  The Department are tracing all animals exposed at the fair and keeping them under veterinary supervision. The two big sources of the spread of this infection were the Birr and Naas fairs.  Immediately after the discovery of the first case in Dublin, an order was made prohibiting markets, fairs and sales of cattle, sheep, goats and pigs in Carlow, Clare, Kildare, Kilkenny, Galway, Leix, Offaly, Roscommon, Tipperary, North and South Ridings, and Westmeath, that is, an extension of the order already made and, on 24th February, extending the prohibition to Counties Meath and Wicklow.  On 26th February, this prohibition was extended to all the other counties.</P>
    <P>The present position is that, judging from the reports available in the Department, we have, I believe, probably got the disease under control in Donegal, Leix, Offaly, and in the Naas centre of County Kildare.  There may be further cases in these counties, but I think it has been got under fair control and that it will be cleared up in a reasonable time.  There is a very much worse position in North Dublin, including the city, and the adjoining portions of Meath.  There is a line running roughly from Dublin City and Finglas, through Castleknock and Blanchardstown to Dunboyne and, in that area, the disease is at the moment on the increase. It is hard to say when we may begin to hope to have it fairly well controlled. We have taken measures which have not, I think, previously been taken in this country and which would not have been taken if we looked on this as an ordinary outbreak.</P>
    <P>We have, for instance, not only slaughtered all the cattle, sheep and so on which were affected and in contact here in the City of Dublin, but we have slaughtered all the cattle, even those which remained free from <Col N="125" /> the disease, in that whole Prussia Street and Dublin market area.  Some of the herds were perfectly free from disease, and would probably have escaped, but we thought it better to clear all cases, as otherwise they might be cropping up again in a fortnight or three weeks' time.  I should like Deputies to realise that if I am asked, as I have been, to do certain things about allowing certain fat cattle into the Dublin area for slaughter, or allowing dressed carcases in, or allowing certain sales and fairs to be held, or even to allow certain races to be held, or not to allow certain races, I would like to say that I am entirely dependent on the advice which I receive from the veterinary staff.  If I am asked to do anything in the way of allowing certain fairs or certain markets, then they will be allowed or permitted as soon as the veterinary staff are satisfied that they can be allowed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The first thing that falls to be said on this occasion is that it is the common interest of all that this outbreak should be got under control. We are either going to control this outbreak by the joint counsel of 138 inexperienced and well-intentioned ladies and gentlemen who are Deputies, or we are going to get the most excellent advice we can get and act upon it.  If we have a relative who is in imminent danger of death we do not call in the whole family and debate amongst ourselves what is the best remedy to apply.  We choose a physician arid we lay upon him the terrible responsibility of taking the decision, and forewarn him that whatever his decision may be we shall abide by it.  We must not close our eyes to the fact that it is a dreadful responsibility to lay upon an independent party, but those who accept responsibility, physicians or veterinary advisers in the Department of Agriculture, accept responsible posts in the full knowledge of the serious burden they may from time to time have to bear, and it is only Dáil Eireann can say&mdash;I think it ought to be said now&mdash;that having chosen veterinary advisers in the Department <Col N="126" /> of Agriculture and given our confidence to them we expect them to do their best.  We do not expect them to be magicians, prophets or soothsayers, but we require to be satisfied that they have done their best and, so far as I am concerned personally, I am satisfied that the veterinary staff of our Department of Agriculture is as good a veterinary staff as could be got.  If I can be satisfied that they are being permitted to do their best, then I am satisfied that the best is being done in the circumstances in which we find ourselves.</P>
      <P>I think there rests upon the Minister a very grave responsibility to satisfy the House&mdash;and he has tried to do that so far, but he may have to go into a little more detail when he is winding up the discussion&mdash;that there is no interference with the expert decisions taken from time to time by the experts of the Department.  I understand, and it is right that it should be stated publicly, that cattle were exposed at the Naas fair for sale which had been purchased or shown at the Dublin market; that they were brought to the Naas fair from the Dublin market after the Department was notified of the fact that there were beasts in the Dublin market which were suspect, if not actually diseased.  It is suggested to me that beasts from that Dublin market, which the Department had knowledge contained beasts that were suspect or actually diseased, found their way down the country.  If that is so, it calls for explanation.  If the Minister considers the situation grave enough&mdash; and I think he is right in believing it to be grave&mdash;&mdash;to exterminate every herd of cattle in the Prussia Street vicinity, whether it is diseased or not, how is it that vigilance was not sufficient to prevent cattle from going down the country which had been exposed at a fair where it was known diseased or suspect cattle were exposed, as in the case of the Dublin market?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to say very emphatically that I am convinced the policy of eradication is right.  I know there are people who think it ought to be cured, and <Col N="127" /> that there are people who believe in slaughter against infection.  I think the Minister has a perfect right to say that that is a theory which we cannot afford to experiment with.  In a country where the live-stock trade means so much, we are entitled to be old-fashioned in regard to that.  We must be absolutely certain of the efficacy of any remedy before we put the entire live-stock industry of this country into jeopardy by trusting to the safety of new-fangled devices.  That does not mean that a day will never dawn when a satisfactory immunising agency will be available.  It may come, and we hope it will, but pending exhaustive and conclusive tests under practical conditions elsewhere, I certainly endorse the Minister's resolution to adhere to the policy of eradication for the control of foot-and-mouth disease.</P>
    <P>I have emphasised my view in this matter by approaching it with the resolution that the recommendation of experts should be carried into effect, whatever the cost in money or in popularity. No matter how difficult the Minister finds it to make Draconian regulations or to do a Draconian deed, if the experts in the Department recommend it I assure him from this side of the House that all he need do is to hold out his hand and it will be done. It is a good thing that the 138 well-intentioned ladies and gentlemen in this House may offer suggestions that may occur to them from their experience down the country for review by experts of the Department and possibly subsequent action.  We are very scrupulous at the present time about preventing individuals from going on to affected premises or moving outside the 15 miles area laid down.  We are particularly solicitous to ensure that no live stock will pass from a scheduled area into an unscheduled area.  Has anyone taken any precautions to deal with itinerant tinkers who move frequently from 20 to 30 miles in a night, with donkeys, horses, goats, dogs and all the <i>lares et penates</i> of such establishments? I have seen no efforts to control the movements of these people. It seems to me that when they are <Col N="128" /> moved from one area into another they may prove a very fruitful source of infection. In any case, I think our sympathetic consideration is due to the unfortunate farmer, with perhaps 120 or 130 valuable beasts on his land, who sees one of these caravans arriving to camp on his mere, not knowing whence it came, but perfectly certain that before night has long fallen the donkeys and the horses will be across his fence careering about his land and coming in contact with his animals.  Therefore, I think energetic measures should be employed to ensure that those people do not move their stock or their persons or their caravans from scheduled areas into unscheduled areas.</P>
    <P>I am sometimes a little amused at the suggestions made that the whole population should be penned up in their houses and nobody ought to move at all.  In the desire to co-operate to the limit in the eradication of this disease it is possible to go too far. Supposing we did pen everybody and everything else up, how can you pen up the rabbits and hares which are careering about infected lands?  If we could, we could give the public a great deal more liberty.</P>
    <P>I imagine that one of our greatest difficulties in controlling this disease is the movement of the <i>ferae naturae</i> of the land from one place to another. What can more readily carry this disease from one district to another than a rabbit or a hare?  I think that problem is so grave that it is deserving of special consideration.  Is it impracticable to fence off infected farms for the purpose of preventing rabbits and hares passing between infected land and uninfected lands?  Normally we would recoil from the idea of putting netted wire all round an infected farm. But, when we come to digging trenches 100 yards long, nine feet deep, and seven feet wide in order to slaughter all the cattle on a man's land and to slaughtering every herd in the Prussia Street area, I do not think we ought to baulk at wiring off large areas.</P>
    <P>I remember driving through Australia and seeing up in the district <Col N="129" /> behind Sydney, up beyond Bathurst, that every farmer worthy of the name had his land wired all round, and that the hallmark of the ne'er-do-well was to point to his land and say, &ldquo;There is no wire on it.&rdquo;  There is no decent farmer north-west of Bathurst but had his land wired against rabbits and the fences sometimes run to 22 miles and are maintained.  Fortunately, we are not under that obligation here, and it might be impracticable to attempt it. But I would be interested to hear from the Minister when concluding as to the practicability of wiring off areas to prevent the free passage of rabbits and hares, and possibly rats, who would spread the disease despite the best precautions that one might take for the immobilisation of stock and human beings.  Therefore, I feel, so far as foot-and-mouth disease is concerned, that the Minister need not be in the least degree reluctant to take whatever steps may be necessary to control the outbreak and that the only time he must walk warily is when he is tempted to take a risk.  I do not think the people will readily forgive him if he takes a risk and proves to be wrong.</P>
    <P>We can all sympathise with the natural optimistic self-deception in the earlier stages of the outbreak which could induce the veterinary experts to believe that beasts acquired foot-and-mouth disease in Holyhead while we know that the disease was raging in Abbeyleix and Donegal.  It is easy to be wise after the event.</P>
    <P>Looking back on that, it seems to have been a very imprudent risk to take.  Possibly if I were in the position of not foreseeing the extent of the outbreak that was going to come on me I might have allowed the wish to be father to the thought that these beasts had taken the disease at Holyhead. After an error of that kind let energetic measures be taken now to correct the consequences.  Do not let any error of that kind recur.  Let us err in future on the side of undue caution, and nobody will find serious fault with the Department for doing so.</P>
    <P>It is true that foot-and-mouth disease <Col N="130" /> preoccupies the minds of most Deputies at present.  Grave as that problem is, however, let us not forget that there are other matters that require to be looked to.  There are several matters under sub-heads M (5) and M (12) to which I should like to turn this evening, but I am not going to do so because I think many Deputies will want to engage in the discussion on the principal subject.  But I cannot allow sub-head O (5) to pass, because I want to direct attention of the Minister to a very great hardship resulting from the mal-administration of the Pigs and Bacon Act for which money here is appropriated.  We were told when we were passing the Pigs and Bacon Act that its purpose was to ensure that a man who reared pigs would have full notice of the price he might reasonably expect to get for them when they were ready for the market and that we would stabilise the price so that a level price would be paid all over the country for the pigs that were offered.  In fact, 88/- was being paid for pigs not many weeks ago and within seven days the price had gone up to 118/- in Claremorris and a price of 108/- was being paid in Dublin.  Hundreds of pigs were sold at 88/- which farmers could have kept and got 118/- for if they were given any reasonable notice of the prospective rise in price.  Farmers in Mayo were getting 118/-, while farmers in Dublin and Wicklow were getting 108/-.  So far as I can see, a carriage and pair and a cart and horse have been driven through the provisions of the Pigs and Bacon Act.</P>
    <P>What astonishes me mostly is that the Minister himself has been apparently forced into the position of declaring that the fixed price under the Pigs and Bacon Act was a minimum price, when he knows that he himself in this House stated most categorically that it was not a minimum price.  It was a fixed price above which or below which no one would be allowed to go, because to go above it was to facilitate the person who wanted to establish a monopoly for the subsequent exploitation of the pig producers, and to go below it was to deprive the pig producers of the return which they were entitled to get <Col N="131" /> for the pigs produced.  I consider that the way the pig producers have been treated within the last six months is absolutely scandalous.  I know one man who, on the Minister's advice that pigs were then a public menace in that they were consuming essential feeding stuffs, sold his 60 pigs at 88/- per cwt. and ten days later could have got 118/-, so that he lost £90 on the 60 pigs.  That is enough to crush any man, and the man who has had that experience once will not dare for years to touch pigs again.  That kind of incident was due to the mismanagement by the Minister of the pig situation in this country, and it is a thing which reflects most gravely upon his administration of the Department of Agriculture.</P>
    <P>I shall reserve for the main Estimate or some other suitable occasion a discussion under sub-head M (12) of what will come to be known in this country as the Belgian butter farce. That story requires to be told and written in red letters on the records of this House.  I have had an opportunity of putting it in black letters on the records of the Public Accounts Committee, but it yet awaits to be told in the Oireachtas of Éire.  It is worth the telling, and worth listening to.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened carefully to the Minister's speech.  I think he explained things very well as far as the cattle were concerned.  In my <Col N="132" /> opinion, conditions have improved in the last few days as regards the way the Department are carrying out their duties.  I think they mismanaged things in the beginning, perhaps not through any fault of theirs.  It may be that they did not think the position was so serious.  It was unfortunate, I think, that they allowed two markets to be held in backyards in Dublin&mdash; the disease had been notified at the time&mdash;because that helped to spread the disease.  I am not blaming the Department although, as I say, I think they mismanaged things in the first two weeks.  While the markets were supposed to be closed, they allowed these markets to be held in a backyard.  That was much worse than bringing cattle to a public market. Five of the beasts brought there had to be killed ten days afterwards.  I do not want to blame anyone.  I suppose the Department did their best.  I think that when the first outbreak was discovered, a stand-still order should have been made.  There is no use now in crying over spilt milk, but, in my opinion, failure to take that precaution was the real cause of the spread of the disease.</P>
      <P>Deputy Byrne has referred to the Prussia Street area.  I was on a deputation to the Minister this day week about that.  He said that he would look into it.  I believe he sanctioned the slaughter of a number of cattle to-day. I think they should have been slaughtered immediately.  Even to-day there were some cattle in Prussia Street.  We asked the Minister to do away with every beast in Prussia Street because we felt that would be the wisest course to adopt.  The Minister said he had not the power to do that.  I think he should have got the power to do what we suggested.  If some of the animals there had been slaughtered on that day £4 or £5 each might have been got for them.  I understand some of them contracted the disease later, and, of course, had to be destroyed.  As far as I know the Government have the situation in hand now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are some things which they <Col N="133" /> are doing that I do not agree with.  I think that enough animals are not being slaughtered.  I have heard of some out at Dunboyne that were obviously suffering from the disease. They have not been slaughtered up to to-day.  They should have been shot, no matter what it would cost, because the spread of this disease threatens our greatest industry.  Cattle that are suspected to be suffering from the disease should not be allowed to roam about for a day or two.  They should be slaughtered immediately.</P>
    <P>I have to complain also of the methods employed at present to bring cattle to Dublin so as to make meat available for the Dublin butchers.  I know the Department have difficulties to contend with and are doing their best, but, according to advertised figures, they have put three or four men in the position of being able to earn between £4,000 and £5,000 a week. I heard of one case to-day.  A butcher went to the abattoir to buy a beast.  He reckoned its value at so much deadweight, and calculated that the man selling the beast to him would have a total profit on it of £4 17s. 3d. When attention was called to that, the Department pointed out that that might be only one case.  But even so, that is too big a profit to have on one beast.  The Dublin butchers require over 700 cattle a week.  If we knock off the 17/3 and say there is a profit of £4 on each beast, it means that those three or four men have £2,800 a week to divide amongst themselves. That is, so far as cattle are concerned.  The figure given does not include the number of sheep killed.  I know those men are decent men and I am not blaming them for earning any money they can.  The Department promised to look into this.  I think they should take a serious view of it. The butchers have complained.  They should be afforded an opportunity of purchasing the class of meat that will enable them to meet the reasonable demands of their customers.  Unless they are enabled to do that, they cannot carry on their business.</P>
    <P>I realise that there are difficulties in the way of doing all those things, but this is a matter which should be <Col N="134" /> looked into.  Another matter is that they advertise a price of 53/- a cwt. to farmers for their cattle.  Everyone knows that people who are buying cattle all their lives are experts in the business, and 53/- a cwt. is not the price which should be given to farmers at the present day.  It might have been all right three weeks ago.  I have a list here showing that the price available for our cattle in England for the period up to 10th March is 57/6 per cwt.  I think 53/- is not enough to give the farmers.  They should be getting at least 55/- if the market were running normally.  There have also been complaints made to us at our meetings by butchers' firms in Dublin, who buy nothing but the best meat, in connection with this price of 10½d. per lb.  Personally, I am not concerned with the butchers, but I think the farmers are not being paid enough at 53/- a cwt. for their cattle.  The Minister for Agriculture should communicate with the Minister for Supplies and allow the butchers to increase the price of meat.  I know it is very hard to say that under the conditions which obtain in the city at the present time, but, as far as I know, the price has not been increased for some time, and a number of butchers are going out of trade in Dublin owing to the way matters stand at the moment when they have to adhere to a fixed price.  I should like to impress upon the Minister the necessity for clearing out Prussia Street and disinfecting the streets. There have been a number of complaints about the mode of disinfecting. I think the old way was the best, but I am not an expert on those matters. The Minister referred to the employment of 2,000 men at 7/6 a day.  I hope that work will not be given only to members of Fianna Fáil clubs; I would like everybody to be able to avail of it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought it well to mention the matter, as I have had so much experience of the way in which <Col N="135" /> those things happen.  There is also another matter to which I should like to refer.  The butchers in Mullingar complain that they must get a licence to buy a beast, but if they buy it two miles outside the town they must bring it in by lorry.  There is no such thing as a lorry for hire in the town of Mullingar.  The railway company refuses to carry the beasts if they are two miles outside, and they cannot get a lorry, with the result that the butchers have to go out and walk them into the two mile limit.  The railway company say that they cannot do it without an order from the Department of Agriculture.  I think it is due to a mistake that there is nobody with a haulage licence in Mullingar at the present time.  The man who had a haulage licence has gone out of business, with the result that there is no lorry for hire in the town of Mullingar.  There are some people looking for a licence, and, if the Minister would expedite the granting of that licence, this difficulty could be cleared away.</P>
      <P>In regard to this whole matter I should like to say that everyone concerned is anxious to do everything possible to stamp out the disease.  We realise that drastic measures must be taken.  The standstill order must be enforced, no matter how drastic the regulation may seem, because the time is coming for the opening of the store-cattle trade, and until we have a certain disease-free period in the country there will be no shipping of cattle, so it is up to everybody concerned to help the Department.  We in the cattle trade would like to help in every way.  There is another matter which I almost forgot to mention.  The salesmasters have practically been put out of business.  We were completely passed over when a body of men were being appointed to bring meat into the butchers of Dublin.  Our whole livelihood has been upset, and it would be quite an easy matter for the salesmasters to lose contact with the farmers and go out of business altogether.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>When we consider that <Col N="136" /> the approximate value of our live stock is £60,000,000, apart altogether from its potential value, and that the great bulk of our exportable produce comes from the live-stock industry, we begin to realise the grave menace which is endangering the economic structure of the State at the present time.  I am one of those people who believe in the policy of eradicating the disease.  I think it is ridiculous to talk about isolation and cures and all that sort of thing, because we are in a different position altogether from other countries where the disease is endemic, and where they simply try to let it run its course.  I am inclined to think that if we were so unfortunate as to have the disease endemic in this country the mortality here among the live stock, especially during the late winter and early spring period, would be very high.</P>
      <P>The Minister said he was aware that there was a good deal of criticism in regard to the regulations at the present time.  He said that some of the criticism was to the effect that the regulations were too drastic, too severe, while others thought the regulations were not sufficiently drastic.  I am one of those who believe that the regulations were not sufficiently drastic and that the veterinary inspectors failed to appreciate the gravity of the position in the earlier stages.  I am not inclined to agree with Deputy Dillon when he suggests, more or less, that so far as this House is concerned, it should be a matter of hands off the veterinary inspectors of the Department, that they are specialists in their work.  I admit they are specialists, but they are human beings, and it is quite possible they have made mistakes.  I believe they have.  We here as representatives of the people have a right, not only to criticise the Minister in his capacity as Minister for Agriculture, but we also have a right to criticise the officials of his Department, and some criticism of how the greatest industry in this country has been handled by his officials might be healthy.</P>

    <P>Deputy Dillon referred to the general belief that animals that were exposed for sale on the Dublin market, or at all <Col N="137" /> events animals that were in the vicinity of the Dublin market&mdash;in Prussia Street or in the market area&mdash;and that were brought to the Naas fair, were responsible for spreading the disease.  A great many people in North Kildare and Dublin, people in the cattle trade are of the opinion&mdash;I do not know what the Minister's information on the matter is&mdash;that there was a leakage there and that that is where the outbreak did spread.  That is the general feeling among people who are in a position to know.  This outbreak did not become really serious until the disease was discovered in the abattoir.  I am told that when the inspection was made by a veterinary officer of the Department there was no proper discretion exercised, that the inspection was carried out in a very careless manner, and many butchers and cattle dealers were permitted to enter the abattoir and in that way they carried the disease away.</P>
    <P>It was the visit of a cattle dealer to a farm in Meath that actually caused all the trouble that was on that particular farm.  This is a really serious matter and the House ought not to gloss over it lightly.  If an official is placed in a position to safeguard the live-stock industry the responsibility is on him as well as on the Minister to prevent the spread of such a very infectious and dreadful disease.  Farmers generally feel that the outbreak, particularly in Dublin, North Kildare and Meath, was very badly handled.  There is quite a lot of talk in the country about sabotage, but I think there is no doubt that most of the disease resulted from contact and that that can be proved.  I had a question on the Order Paper to-day asking the Minister to take what I consider is a very necessary safeguard&mdash;the prevention as far as possible of any public gatherings.  I was amazed, and so were people who take a very serious view of this situation, to find last week that the Government permitted coursing to take place at Clonmel.  I am aware that a particular individual, probably through sheer ignorance of the menace he was with infection on his own farm, was present at the national coursing meeting in Clonmel.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>Anyone who realises the gravity of the situation cannot fail to appreciate the menace that individual was, in the centre of such a huge gathering as was at Clonmel.  I do not care what the veterinary inspectors say, I am firmly convinced that it was absolutely wrong to permit that coursing meeting to take place.  It was a meeting for all Ireland, dogs being drawn from 96 clubs, and they were sent there to a coursing meeting lasting three days.  If it was a purely local meeting with local dogs the situation would not be nearly so bad, but there were some dogs actually taken from the infected areas and they were accompanied by people from infected farms.  The Government should have banned that coursing.  The threat is such a serious one, from the point of view of the whole country, that there should not be any public gathering allowed until the disease is eradicated. There are unfortunate people who cannot sell their live stock because fairs are not permitted.  We have that sort of protection on the one side and then we become quite careless and permit people from infected areas to mix freely with others from non-infected areas.  There is no commonsense in that and it should not be allowed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the subject of conveyance, not only in the infected scheduled areas but outside, lorries are used for transporting live stock.  Very often you see a butcher's lorry taking a load of skins&mdash;God alone knows where they come from&mdash;and delivering them to the railway and then going to the country for sheep or cattle.  There is no question of disinfection.  I suggest that every vehicle carrying live stock, even in the remotest district of County Kerry, should be disinfected.  It is only by drastic action that we can stamp out the disease.  I do not think it has been handled in a sufficiently drastic fashion.  Foot-and-mouth disease is unfortunate at any time, but it is particularly unfortunate that it should occur at this period of the year when we usually export thousands of stores.  It is the period when the store-cattle <Col N="139" /> trade is at its best.  It has a special effect on the tillage areas.  If we are not able to clean up this outbreak and get an opportunity to export our cattle before the feeding runs out, the position will be much more grave.  There is no provision for the grazing of cattle on most farms. A big problem will arise in the tillage areas where the food produced through intensive tillage must be consumed during the winter and spring in order to have sufficient farmyard manure.  The cattle are usually sold and exported at this period.  If this situation is not remedied, where are those cattle to be put?  Where will we get grass for them?  Is it not worth while sacrificing any sport in order to ensure that we will eradicate this disease as quickly as possible?</P>
    <P>I am not satisfied, if Deputy Dillon is, that this matter has been properly handled.  It is a crime against the agricultural industry that it has been handled in such a careless manner.  I know definitely that in the case of one very big farm in County Kildare, on which there would be approximately 200 cattle, and from which cattle were on the boat to which the Minister referred this evening which produced the case at Birkenhead, an inspector was sent down at four o'clock in the evening to inspect the cattle.  This happened a month ago and Deputies will realise the number of cattle he could inspect in, say, the hour and a half between four o'clock and dark. He went in a very casual way through these cattle and satisfied himself in that hour and a half that the cattle were free from the disease.  It could not be done at all in that time.  That man should have gone back to his hotel and spent the night there, and spent the following day on the farm. If this job is to be done right, it must be done thoroughly, and it is not being done thoroughly.  There are any number of people in the country to-day who are most indignant with the way the position is being handled&mdash;allowing coursing, racing and all sorts of &ldquo;gallivanting.&rdquo; On the other side, when they handle a position such as this, they do it more drastically.  They <Col N="140" /> batten down the whole job and do not permit these gatherings to take place.</P>
    <P>The Minister has admitted that this is the most serious outbreak which has visited the country in a century.  For God's sake, do not let it come to our generation to fail in respect of a disease which our people through all the years were quite capable of stamping out.  I do not think that anyone can say at the moment that the position is well in hand.  The Minister admits that in an area on a line from Dublin to Dunboyne, the disease is not under control.  The sooner it is got under control, the better for this country.  Let there be no nonsense about it; let there be no saying that times are so serious and there is so much dislocation and unemployment in the country already that we must have as little more dislocation as possible. Let there be all the dislocation necessary. Nobody will criticise the Minister or his Department for causing it, if it is going to have the effect of stamping out the disease as soon as possible.  That ought to be the policy instead of mild regulations.  The remedy must be drastic because drastic diseases require drastic remedies.</P>
    <P>I should like to touch also on the matter referred to by Deputy Fagan, that is, the employment of four men by the Minister to supply meat for the City of Dublin, because representations have been made to me with regard to it.  I wonder is the Minister aware that none of these men was actually in the Dublin trade?  Some of them are attached to foreign firms, buying cattle for export, that is, employed by English firms for the purpose of exporting live stock to England, and none of them had anything at all to do with the Dublin trade.  They did buy cattle for export, but I am informed that none of them bought for the Dublin trade. I do not think it right or proper to put four men over the heads of people who normally provide the Dublin trade with meat, and if there was any preference in the matter, people in the trade should have got it.  I agree with Deputy Fagan that the margin between what these people are supposed to pay&mdash;and <Col N="141" /> I stress the word &ldquo;supposed&rdquo;&mdash;and the price at which the butchers buy that meat is altogether too wide and is going to leave a very handsome profit to these people.</P>
    <P>That is not at all as it should be and it is not on that basis that these men should operate.  Their duty is to provide meat for Dublin and it ought to be done on a commission basis of so much per head, instead of giving four men a monopoly to do what they like in respect of supplying meat for the city.  They have paid for cattle at less than 10½d.&mdash;we have proof of that&mdash; which stretches the margin still further and the Minister ought not to forget the time he attempted to fix prices at 25/- before.  He ought to remember the experiences of the time when his arbitrary attempt to fix prices failed completely. The cattle were bought at whatever price they liked to pay&mdash;at times a long way below 20/- a cwt.&mdash; and to give a monopoly on that basis to four individuals is absolutely wrong. If these people are to operate, they should operate on a commission basis, and on a commission basis only.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether these men at the moment are permitted to export any dead meat and I do not know what the Minister proposes to do about the exportation of dead meat, if the situation should improve somewhat.  We should like some information on that point, because if we are going to export dead meat, we ought not to put its export in the hands of three or four individuals, and especially on the basis obtaining at present.</P>
    <P>I realise the difficulty of the Minister and his Department in that responsibility must be narrowed to three or four men.  If you do that, I suggest you do it on a totally different basis.  It will free the public mind of suspicion, and of more than suspicion &mdash;it is an actuality&mdash;that the profit is altogether too much.  Even on the figures fixed by the Department, there is too great a profit.</P>
    <P>There are other matters in this Supplementary Estimate to which I should like to refer, but, like Deputy <Col N="142" /> Dillon, I think this problem is so outstanding and there are so many other Deputies anxious to give expression to their views that it would be unfair to take up the time of the House any further in dealing with them.  Although some of them are important, they simply fade into the shade beside this all-important problem, and so as not to minimise the importance of it in any way, I do not propose to refer to them.  We can take another opportunity of doing so, but I do say to the Minister that not only am I expressing my own feelings of dissatisfaction with regard to the manner in which this whole matter has been handled, but I am expressing the opinion of thousands of men in the country who are capable of forming an opinion.  This is not a highly technical type of question at all, but a matter of sound commonsense and judgment as to what steps should be taken to safeguard the interests of a vital industry. Let us hope that we shall see an improvement in the near future and that we shall have some hope of saying: &ldquo;Thank God, the Department is getting this under control and it is not going to become endemic.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHarris" hpid="Mr. Harris Mr. Harris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harris</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Hughes stated that the views he expressed were the views of thousands of people in the country.  I am living in an affected area, within five miles of where several outbreaks have taken place, and if the policy that Deputy Hughes recommended was carried out, I would have to stay at home.  The farmers I have met, even farmers who have been affected because the sale of their stock is held up or who are inconvenienced in many ways, have expressed the opinion that the officials of the Department have a very difficult task, and that they are doing it as well as possible.  The one anxiety I heard expressed by almost all the people with whom I came into contact, was as to whether the farmers would co-operate with the officials.  If people suspect that animals have the disease they should report it.  Those I move amongst feared that the disease spread, largely because of want of sufficient co-operation, or, in fact, <Col N="143" /> owing to carelessness in some instances in reporting it to the officials.</P>
      <P>Deputy Hughes stated that people from the infected areas should not be allowed to mix with others in non-infected areas.  If that suggestion was enforced Deputy Belton and other Deputies who reside in affected areas would not be able to attend this House.  As far as I know, all possible precautions have been taken.  I do not think wild speeches are helpful. What we want is to get people to have confidence in our officials and to support them.  As the Minister and Deputy Dillon pointed out, we have experts in the Department.  If any of our relatives were stricken with fever or with any dangerous disease, we would place the case entirely in the hands of, medical experts.  It would be a queer thing if we started disputing at such a time, whether the experts were right or wrong.  We should ask the people to co-operate in every way with the Department and its officials.  I know that the farming community are in difficulties owing to shortage of feeding stuffs and being unable to sell their stock, but the only way to deal with this scourge is by co-operation and confidence in those who are there to advise us.</P>

      <P>It appears to be the point of view of Deputy Harris, no matter what the Department or the Minister think, that in a case like this, which is so serious for this country, the best thing to do is to keep quiet. I hope that anything I shall say will not be considered to be what Deputy Harris would describe as a wild statement. Nobody on this side of the House made a wild speech.  Deputy Hughes criticised certain things, and if he did I think he was quite right in doing so.  It is helpful to do that. If mistakes are made, either by the Department's servants, by the Government, by a Minister or anyone else, there is no gain in closing our eyes, but rather in exposing them, because there are still pitfalls ahead.  I must say frankly that I was very disappointed at the Minister's statement <Col N="144" /> to the House on this subject.  The Minister knows quite well&mdash;it was apparent from his speech&mdash;that criticism is levelled against him and the Department with regard to the spread of the disease in Dublin.  It cannot be said that it spread from an isolated part of the country or that it took time to find it out.  I would be charmed if the Minister could justify the detailed steps the Department took when they found the disease at the abattoir.</P>

      <P>Deputy Harris said that the Minister and the Department called in experts to deal with the disease.  We all bow to that decision. It is not a question of experts dealing with the disease, as far as meetings are concerned, for the purpose of getting away from contact with it.  That is commensense.  But the Minister ought to take his responsibilities and not allow such a gathering as a coursing match to be held at Clonmel to which people were drawn from every end of the country, and to which they brought dogs.  I think that was a shame and that there was something very much remiss in allowing it.  The Minister ought to stand up to and take the responsibility, and not say: &ldquo;The Department officials told me it was all right.&rdquo;  That is not good enough.  The country ought not to take that.  The Minister should set an example to the officials and tell them that, no matter what they thought, he had made up his mind that slaughter was the right thing, that he accepted that advice, and that that ought to be done at once. He should have said: &ldquo;As far as contact is concerned, I take responsibility for all the steps taken in that respect.&rdquo; It has been stated with regard to the outbreak in Dublin, that a certain police officer was approached about having people who were in and around the affected positions disinfected, and that he replied that he had no authority.  I think he had no authority, and that he did not get it until 7 o'clock that night, when everyone was at home and brought the disease with them.  We have not got details from the Minister as to what happened with regard to cattle taken from Prussia Street and brought to Naas, and then brought to Longford and sold.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>My purpose is to point out that if a mistake is made it should be criticised so that it will not occur again.  That is my reason for making it.  The Minister says that it is advisable to slaughter cattle as soon as we can.  We are all agreed about that. He gave as an excuse that, because holes could not be dug fast enough to bury them, they have to be left there for some days, possibly.  I have information here of cattle which were detected and were not slaughtered for three days.  I have information about a farmer who had 75 cattle.  When these were examined, four or five of them were found to be suffering from foot-and-mouth disease.  They were not slaughtered for three days, and at the end of the three days 22 cattle were found to be suffering from it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During that time these cattle had been lying across hedges and walls and the saliva getting on to the roads and nothing done to prevent it.  I am also informed that cattle in Meath which were to be slaughtered and were <Col N="147" /> awaiting valuation were closed up in pens over which their heads extended out on to the public road with the saliva coining from their mouths.  If that is happening, it is a shocking state of affairs.  Even if the Minister had to employ the whole of the Army to do it, I think that immediately beasts are detected they ought to be shot.  So far as I am concerned, I am not asking for any release from restrictions. I had the same respect for the cattle trade in the past that I have to-day, but people on the other side of the House had not.</P>

But I think the <Col N="148" /> system under which four people buy cattle in the way in which they are being bought ought to be altered. Whatever you do, you ought not to have it thrown in your face that four or five people were making £3,000 or £4,000 a week upon the sale of meat in Dublin.

      <P>Yes.  In any case, there is a racket by a few people.  Possibly the Minister was in a cleft stick and could not get a better scheme, but that ought to be watched and not allowed to happen.  The Minister and the Department ought to make sure that wherever the disease is confirmed the beasts that are suffering from it ought to be slaughtered immediately because they are spreading the disease. Complaint was made to-day by a man on whose land the disease was confirmed a few days ago that the beasts are still roaming about his land.  When will that land be cleared?  I read in to-day's paper that a veterinary officer of the Dublin Board of Health complained to his board that, although it was his job to visit all the dairies in his district for the purpose of inspection, he had got no instructions from the Department.  There was no co-operation; he was not asked for any co-operation.  I think that is a shocking state of affairs.  A person in his position ought to be called in to assist.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am also informed that the Department is short-handed as far as veterinary inspectors are concerned.  That ought not to be.  There are plenty of veterinary inspectors employed by local authorities all over the country who are ready and willing to give their services.  I am also informed that cattle which are infected are awaiting slaughter because they have not been valued and that there is only one valuer employed.  If, as a result of having to wait for that valuer, cattle are allowed to live for 24 hours pouring the disease on to the public roads and by-ways, that is a shocking state of affairs.  There are plenty of people who would give their services free <Col N="149" /> gratis and for nothing for the purpose of valuing animals.  These are the points which I should like to bring to the Minister's attention.  I do not do so, as I said, for the purpose of throwing dirty water on anybody.  We do not want to show up the dark side of the picture.</P>

      <P>What we have heard to-night is only what we might expect. The blame for everything that happens in this country is put on somebody and an effort is made to prove that matters are not as they should be.  I have listened to Deputy Brennan's yarn, and it is on all-fours with the yarn I heard in my part of the country when there was supposed to be an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease at Rathcormac.  The yarn was that there was an aeroplane over the district the night before and that the Germans were dropping some kind of germs.  That yarn was circulated all over the County Cork.  That is on all-fours with Deputy Brennan's story.</P>

It will take them all their time to do so and will need the full co-operation of the people.  Deputies should feel a sense of responsibility. They should not come into the Dáil to retail old women's stories, heard through the country, and seek to throw the Dáil's cloak of respectability over them.  It is time that that should stop. If Deputy Belton thinks the situation is as dangerous as he says, then he should have remained at home, and not be sitting so close to Deputy Hickey in case the disease should spread to Cork.</P>

      <P>There are different stories as to where it came from.  The suggestion that I make to Deputies is that they should let the Minister and his veterinary officers handle the job. It is their job.  It is a long time since they have had one like it, and I hope it will be a long time before they have a similar situation to deal with.  It would be much better if they were allowed to go ahead with their work instead of having old women's tales, which simply create confusion amongst the people of the country, recounted in the Dáil.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a matter that ought not to be treated in a flippant way.  I am sure there is scarcely a member of the House who does not realise the seriousness of the position and the effect which this outbreak would have, if allowed to develop.  I am quite satisfied that the Minister is as anxious as any member of the House to see an end to it, and that his veterinary and other officers are doing their best to eradicate the disease.  We are not likely to get anywhere by entering into a debate on what has happened or as to how it happened.  The fact is that the disease is more widespread than any of us would like to see it.  The most effective contribution that we can make to the debate is to offer whatever information or assistance we can to help prevent its further spread.  The Department's experts, veterinary and others, ought to be the best people to give advice as to what should be done. I do not know that they are really the best people to give advice to the Minister.  I, myself, am a firm believer in the application of very drastic remedies: in the prohibition, for example, of all public assemblies <Col N="152" /> such as coursing and racing events.  I say that, even though I am as much interested in these two branches of sport as any member of the House. There should be prohibition except where the events are of a local character.  When I say local, I mean events held in a district where there is no prevalence of the disease.  If important public functions are held, it is almost certain that numerous people from even disease-affected areas will attend, with the consequent danger of being carriers of the disease. Some Deputy said that if we were to go that far we should prohibit the ramblings of hares and rabbits.  I think the 15 mile limit effectively disposes of that argument.  The hares and the rabbits are not likely to travel that distance.  At any rate, other countries have succeeded in preventing the spread of the disease without going that far.  Hares and rabbits may be possible carriers of the disease.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe myself that the disease is more easily carried by humans than in any other way.  On that, I am reminded of what I was told by my father when I was a boy.  He had a home farm and another farm 20 or 30 miles away.  There was an outbreak of the disease on the out-farm.  He was a very careful man.  He did not want the disease to spread to the home farm and took every care to prevent contact between the two holdings.  This happened 65 or 70 years ago.  My father told me of it about 50 years ago, and of the precautions he took to prevent the spread of the disease to the home farm.  He had a pair of boots and an overcoat which he changed every time he came home.  Nevertheless, in spite of his precautions the disease broke out on the home farm in the course of a couple of weeks.  I do not say that will happen in every case, but I suggest there is grave danger of innocent people carrying the disease.  We had a big coursing meeting held last week. I hope nothing will happen as a result of it.  There are other public events announced to be held.  We do not want to stop them.  I am as anxious to see them held as any member of the House. Even though the experts have advised <Col N="153" /> the Minister that there is no danger likely to arise from visitors coming to attend a certain event next Saturday, I believe there is a danger.  We read in the newspapers this morning that the ladies, and others, attending it are to dip the soles of their shoes in a saucer of disinfectant.  If there is no danger of the infection being carried to the race meeting why ask ladies to go through the farce of dipping their shoes in a pan of liquid of some sort?  I believe the only method that would make people absolutely immune is not some of the modern ones but rather the old one of fumigation.  There would then be no possibility that they could spread the disease afterwards.  In every area where this disease is, I should like that every person who could probably or possibly come into contact with the place would have to undergo some such precaution.  It should not be possible for any man, woman or child to get into one of those places and get out again without having some such precaution taken.  I should like the Minister to say that apparatus is provided at each of those places for some such form of disinfecting.</P>
    <P>As I said at the beginning, I only mean to be helpful rather than critical. Personally, I do believe that even though the course which the Minister might take might not be absolutely necessary, still if there is the merest chance that such gatherings would be dangerous they should be stopped.  It would be only a temporary stoppage in any case, and, as the Minister said in his own speech, thousands of people will have to suffer from the spread of this disease besides the farmers themselves, and, if people have to suffer through the temporary suspension of a few public functions then, much as we regret it, I think that if they are the source of the slightest danger they ought to be prevented.</P>
    <P>I was interested in the speech of Deputy Fagan when he said that the price of 53/- is perhaps not enough. If there is a possibility that the price which would now prevail would, as Deputy Fagan said, be more than 53/-, and that they might reasonably expect <Col N="154" /> for good cattle 55/- or 56/-, I do think they should be paid that price as compensation for the cattle slaughtered now, for this reason, that whatever price you pay the farmer for the cattle slaughtered, even though you pay him to the extreme limit, nobody can possibly say he got too much.  There cannot be any criticism that the farmer has been paid too much for the cattle slaughtered, when it is remembered that not alone are you killing his beast and paying him for it, but you are suspending his operations for perhaps three or four months.  I am not sure of the time, but you are suspending his operations for a period which you cannot estimate, so I do hope that the figure paid will be the top-notch market price.  So much has been said on the matter that I do not want to say any more, except that I personally am in favour of the most drastic measures that can be taken to prevent the spread of the disease.  I do not want to indulge in any criticism of what has happened; perhaps some of it was inevitable.  I do think the desire of every one of us ought to be to co-operate with the Minister in every possible way to prevent the further spread of the disease.  There are items in the Estimate that we are supposed to be discussing which I should like to refer to, particularly in regard to the creamery industry, but I think we will have an opportunity in the near future for discussing those matters, so I do not want to take up the time of the House in discussing them now.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyLinehan" hpid="Mr. Linehan Mr. Linehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Linehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was rather disappointed at the Minister's reference to the advice tendered to him by his veterinary staff as regards functions; he remarked that he hoped the staff would never be impressed too much by public opinion in the carrying out of their duties.  My strongest objection to the holding of coursing meetings, race meetings or anything else, is not so much the danger of the things themselves as the very bad reaction they are having on public opinion in the country, and the Minister and his Department should listen to expressions of public opinion.  The national coursing meeting was held at Clonmel, <Col N="155" /> and as we all know there were 96 dogs running in the Oaks and Derby.  There were 32 dogs in the National Cup.  That meant that there were cars and people and dogs from practically every electoral division in Ireland.</P>
      <P>The experts may have been right when they said there was very little danger, but look at the reaction on farmers down the country in an area 150 miles away from an outbreak of this disease when their pig market in Cahirciveen was stopped on the same day that this coursing meeting was allowed in Clonmel.  With all due respect to them, I do not think the Minister's experts were right when they suggested that there was no danger in things like coursing meetings, because I certainly remember that on one occasion the Waterloo Cup meeting in England was abandoned on account of foot-and-mouth disease, and no doubt in their eyes the Waterloo Cup meeting was every bit as important as the National Cup meeting here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I go as far as saying that I was disappointed because the Minister did not tell us to-night that he had banned the race meeting which is to be held on Saturday.  This business about the people having to dip their feet in disinfectant is sheer nonsense, if there is as big a crowd at that meeting as there was at the last.  Like Deputy Bennett, I would be sorry to see those functions abandoned if that could possibly be avoided, but it is utter nonsense to talk about having all those people dipping their feet in disinfectant.  Considering that Leopardstown is in the middle of an area with foot and mouth outbreaks practically on one side of it, with this bad line running from Dublin City to Dunboyne, and with motor vehicles and horse-drawn vehicles coming through those areas, and horses and fodder being brought from all over Ireland into that area and being taken out again, if there is no danger in that I do not know what to say.  I think the allowing of those meetings by the Minister is a very bad policy to pursue. I agree entirely that he is right in stopping fairs and markets all over the <Col N="156" /> country, but, if fairs and markets are going to be stopped, assemblies like that should be stopped as well.  I do not think it would be any national loss to this country to stop every race meeting and coursing meeting until you could definitely say that you had this disease completely under control.</P>
    <P>After all, we have to think of the unfortunate men down the country who have been depending on the few shillings they would make on feeding 17 or 18 pigs, and who had those pigs practically ready last week, but will now have to hold them until the markets are reopened, seeing no possibility of getting any stuff to feed them with, and a great possibility of losing all the the money they have spent on feeding them up to now.  Their reaction to the holding of the Red Cross Chase is that simply because it is a big function it is in an entirely different category from a small pig market in the country.</P>
    <P>I am not saying that from any critical point of view.  Even if there were no danger in the holding of those coursing meetings and race meetings, I think it would be in the interests of the country to ban them altogether during the period of the emergency.  I do not think any reasonable man, whether he is a greyhound owner or a racehorse owner or merely a follower of both sports, could feel any grievance in the world if he were told that he would have to do without his sport for the next month.  I am quite sure that the racehorse owners and the greyhound owners of this country would be very much better off if their sport was stopped for a month and this disease wiped out successfully, because the presence of this disease would not help their trade any more than the cattle trade, even if the war was over and there was demand for horses and dogs again.  Even if the war were over and greyhounds were being freely exported, I am quite sure the people in England would not want to buy them if we had recurring outbreaks of disease here, so it is as much in the interests of the greyhound owners as it is in the interests of the cattle dealers to wipe it out as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="157" /> There has been a peculiar atmosphere about this debate.  First of all &mdash;I am sure the Minister was delighted &mdash;Deputy Dillon and the Minister were like the heavenly twins.  Deputy Dillon crowned it all when he said that the proper thing to do, in case of trouble, was to call in the doctor.  I do not agree that calling in the doctor, in the shape of the Minister, has meant or would mean the solution of all our agricultural troubles.</P>

      <P>After what Deputy Hughes said, Deputy Harris appeared to be frightened about the situation in Kildare.  Deputy Dillon agreed so much with the Minister that I find myself in complete disagreement with everything he said.  The one sensible thing he did say had reference to the tinkers.  I will give you an instance of how public opinion reacts, arising out of the order about the holding of fairs and markets.  There is an annual horse fair held in my town on a Sunday and Monday and, when the statement came over the wireless about the holding of fairs and markets, the local people were not sure whether it applied to horse fairs.  Those who would lose most if the fair were abandoned would be the publicans, because the annual fair was always regarded as their big event.  They had obtained an area exemption order for the occasion. Traders and farmers got together and they were quite satisfied, if there was any suggestion of danger, to cancel the horse fair.  They telegraphed to the Department and the Department told them to carry on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was a very large volume of opinion in that district, particularly amongst the farmers, opposed to the holding of the horse fair, even though the Department sanctioned it.  If everybody interested within a five miles radius had been approached, I <Col N="158" /> doubt very much if the fair would be held.  The traders and farmers were quite prepared to sacrifice their own interests as they felt it would be much better to forego the big day of the year rather than incur the risk of an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease.</P>
    <P>The main thing that is frightening farmers and others is the way in which tinkers are allowed to wander through the country.  This is the time of the year when we find them gathered in our area.  On the occasion of the annual horse fair they come from all over the province of Munster.  The Guards and the local people tried to keep them out.  Deputy Dillon has described how they break into fields the moment darkness comes and their animals mix with the farmers' cattle and sheep.  The people in my town tried to keep them away from the area.  If one saw the litter along the roadside where those tinkers draw up their caravans, one would not be surprised at the grave danger in having those people moving through the country.  I think the Guards should be authorised to warn tinkers that they are not to move from the district in which they have their caravans.  It might mean hardship to the tinkers, but that would not be anything to the hardship that might be caused to the people of Cork, Kerry, Waterford or any other areas free from the disease.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>It might be a hardship on the people of the district if the tinkers were left there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyLinehan" hpid="Mr. Linehan Mr. Linehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Linehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister should re-consider his decision with regard to various public functions. There are very few people, who, perhaps, for their own glorification or some other reason, are anxious just now to have race meetings or coursing. Most people realise how dangerous such gatherings can be at a critical time like this.  The Minister is relieved of responsibility in regard to open coursing meetings.  I have no doubt that there will be considerable resentment if greyhound racing is to be allowed in Dublin while the disease is so rampant in the city area.  The Minister will have the approval of the <Col N="159" /> majority of the people if he clamps down on those functions.  I would say the same with reference to football matches.  I do not mind local matches, but if I thought there was going to be a big football match here on St. Patrick's Day, to which people would come from all over Ireland, I would be in favour of stopping it.</P>
      <P>The inconvenience you would put some people to would be nothing compared to the ease of mind given to many others when they observe that everything is being done to stamp out this disease.  In the opinion of many people the Minister should have made a standstill order for the whole country when the disease was first confirmed.  Had he done so he would have had a better chance of finding out where the disease originated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is rather difficult to know how to approach this question. I would not like to be very critical of a body of men who are doing their best and have not an opportunity to reply to any criticisms that we may make here.  As an old civil servant I suppose I have a fellow-feeling in the matter.  I agreed with Deputy Hughes when he said that he did not admire the Minister for Agriculture adopting the rôle, more or less, of sheltering behind the officials.  The Minister should be a strong man.  He should get advice from his technical officers, then marshal the facts and be strong enough to say to his officials: &ldquo;I will do this, whether it is your opinion or not; I will take my stand on my interpretation of the advice you have tendered to me.&rdquo;  Foot-and-mouth is such a dreaded disease that one cannot be too careful in the treatment of it.  So far as the veterinary technique of the Department is concerned, I am afraid the officers did not show themselves prepared for an epidemic of this kind and, in so far as they did not show preparedness, they are to blame.  In the last 30 years we have had such experience of this disease, both in this country and Great Britain, that we should at least know the danger of infection and we should be able to take necessary precautions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="160" /> It is proposed to hold a race meeting in County Dublin this week.  As a representative of County Dublin I must protest against that proposal because of the danger of bringing infection to a portion of County Dublin where, at the present time, there is no trace of the disease.  I can say that no portion of this country holds so many milch cows as the Leopardstown area.  My land comes within two and a half miles of the Leopardstown Racecourse.  I wonder, if the cows in that area became affected, would the Minister be satisfied to slaughter them and give compensation at the current market price for such cows?</P>
    <P>Take the Dublin dairyman who has 50 to 100 cows in full milk, with a round of customers.  The property value of that business in respect of customers is far more than in respect of cows.  If the man's cows are slaughtered, his customers go to his competitors and he will never get them back again, and the Department will not compensate him.  They have not done so in the case of Clarke and Craigie of Finglas.  Is the Department, with its eyes open, going to allow this race meeting on Saturday?  Deputy Linehan referred to the danger of horses being brought there in boxes, with hay thrown in for bedding, whereas, at the moment, in this area, we cannot take a cwt. of straw on the road, except under permit.  Yesterday my man was taking manure from my dairy yard a distance of 200 yards away, and he was stopped.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="A Deputy A Deputy">
      <NameTxt>A Deputy</NameTxt>
      <P>And rightly so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Somebody says: &ldquo;And rightly so,&rdquo; which shows that he does not know the regulations.  It was one of the over-dutiful local Defence Force special constables to whom the Minister referred who did it, but a competent Guard came round this morning to apologise and to say that the other man was too zealous.  But that man merely misinterpreted his orders.  Hay and straw are stopped, but manure is not. They went out to-day under permit. Those are the restrictions in that area which is immune from the disease and <Col N="161" /> which is on about the 15-mile mark from the abattoir.  I think Leopardstown would come within the 15-mile mark and where we have restrictions within a 15-mile radius, we are going to hold a race-meeting.  I think it is well within the 15-mile radius and I presume horses will be brought in boxes from various parts of the country.  On nearly every farm in the Leopardstown area, right up to the mountains at Kiltiernan, on to Bray and round by Dalkey and Dun Laoghaire into Dublin, cows are kept and there are scores of yards where people keep up to 100 cows, in some cases, which have not got a sod of land at all.  These people have taken a life-time and, in some cases, it has taken two or three generations, to build up these dairy businesses.  They are now in danger of being swept away in a night and all they will get is perhaps the price of stripper cows, whereas the real property value is in their round of customers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We in Dublin have a definite grievance in this matter.  This night fortnight it became known in Dublin that the disease had been discovered in the abattoir, and I put it to the Minister that the Department inspectors knew, on this day fortnight, that the infection came from Birr. They knew who bought the cattle and sent them from Birr to Dublin.  Yet nothing has been done and I challenge contradiction of that.  It was then discovered in County Dublin.  Have we not got a good, efficient veterinary service in County Dublin?  We have a whole-time officer, Mr. John Flynn, chief veterinary officer for County Dublin, and we have three part-time officers covering the whole of the county.  Is it not extraordinary that, with that service, covering the whole of the county, paid for by the ratepayers, Mr. Flynn or his assistants were never consulted by the Department? At the meeting of the Dublin Board of Health yesterday, we sent for Mr. Flynn&mdash;it was I who moved that he be sent for&mdash;and he astonished us at the meeting when he told us that he was never consulted by the Department and that he knew nothing about the infection in County Dublin for which he is the veterinary officer, receiving <Col N="162" /> a salary of about £l,000 a year, with a car and travelling expenses. He did not receive even the courtesy of notification that the disease was there, and he first learned of it when he read it in the papers.  Is that true or is it not?  Mr. Flynn, of his own volition and acting on his own judgment, prohibited his officers from visiting dairy yards in County Dublin lest they should carry infection, but the parent body which was looking after the interests of the cattle of the whole country did not even tell Mr. Flynn he should do so, when they should have sent him a sealed order stating that these visits must be suspended.</P>
    <P>We are talking here about fencing in farms to keep rabbits and hares from going out and we are talking through our hats.  Could we do more to spread the disease?  I think an explanation is necessary.  As a representative of County Dublin, a member of the county council and board of health, a member who has always supported the maintenance of such a veterinary service, I think it extraordinary that we should now be told, in effect, that our veterinary service does no good and that we are taxing the ratepayers of the county to keep up a veterinary service which, in the opinion of the Department, is not worthy of recognition. The Minister has told us that the disease is fairly well in hand all over the country, with the exception of the area on a line running through Finglas, Blanchardstown, Castleknock and Dunboyne, which are all in County Dublin.</P>
    <P>The chief veterinary officer does not know that unless he heard it talked about.  Perhaps it will be announced on the wireless to-night or in the papers to-morrow, and Jack Flynn will know about it for the first time in that fashion.  Yet we are paying £l,000 a year with travelling expenses out of the rates for the upkeep of a service to look after the bovine interests of County Dublin.  Was there ever such a farce known before?</P>
    <P>So seriously did we regard this matter at the meeting of the board of health yesterday that we requested the Minister for Agriculture and the Minister for Justice, acting on the advice <Col N="163" /> of our chief veterinary officer that humans are potential carriers of this disease, to order that no human being should be allowed to walk on grass land, except those whose business brings them there, that it should be made a criminal offence and that the Guards should be directed to take action in any such case.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a criminal offence already.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>What is?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>To walk on any person's land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Because of the prevalence of foot-and-mouth disease?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  The Deputy should read the orders made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am tired reading orders, but I see none of them carried <Col N="164" /> out.  Will the Minister give me one case of a Guard &ldquo;pulling&rdquo; anybody for walking across grass land without authority?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Everybody is obeying the order, probably.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>What are the Guards doing and what are these special fellows to whom you are giving 7/6 a day doing?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>They did not catch anybody contravening the order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Why, a blind man could catch scores.  I move to report progress.</P>
      <P>Progress reported.</P>
      <P>Committee to sit again to-morrow.</P>
      <P>The Dáil adjourned at 10.30 p.m. until 3 p.m. on Thursday, 6th March, 1941.</P>
