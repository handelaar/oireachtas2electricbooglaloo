      <P>A Bill providing for compensation for injuries to property caused by the dropping of bombs from foreign aircraft and kindred incidents is now in draft and I hope to be able to introduce it in the near future. Compensation for death and personal injuries will be dealt with in a scheme, to be made in pursuance of an order under the Emergency Powers Act, 1939, which is in course of preparation.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister endeavour to have the coal shipped directly into a port like Wexford, where there are all kinds of facilities?  If the coal is brought into the port of Dublin and distributed from there, it will mean that in Wexford there will be an increase in the price of gas of at least 2d. per therm and a consequent increase in the price of coke, and this will react on the poorer elements of the community.  Will the Minister make every effort to have it shipped directly to local ports?</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonnONeill" hpid="Mr. O'Neill Mr. O'Neill">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Neill</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Supplies if, in regard to owners of private motor cars who had their cars taxed as &ldquo;hackney&rdquo; or &ldquo;commercial&rdquo; cars as from 24th March, 1941, he will state why no petrol allowance was made to the owners of such cars even where the conversion was genuinely founded on commercial necessity; and if he will now consider recommending to the appropriate Department a refund of the tax paid in such cases where the car was, owing to the refusal of a petrol allowance, laid up idle since the 24th March.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The quantity of petrol available for distribution generally is very limited and, consequently, the allowances to private cars have to be rigidly restricted.  Following on the suspension of licences for private cars at the beginning of the year, numerous owners converted the classification of their private cars to small public service vehicles or commercial goods vehicles, clearly with the object of securing petrol supplies.  A development of this kind would have serious reactions on our rationing system, and I decided that the allowances in respect <Col N="1828" /> of small public service vehicles would be confined to persons already engaged in the hackney business, and that the allowances in respect of commercial goods vehicles should be confined to vehicles which are <i>bona fide</i> intended for the carriage of goods and not capable of carrying passengers.</P>
      <P>In regard to the last part of the question, I cannot see my way to make such a recommendation inasmuch as all owners of private cars which have been taxed for the current quarter have received petrol allowances in respect of the months of May and June.</P>

    <Title>Local Government Bill, 1940&mdash;Committee Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>
      <Col N="1832" /> Debate resumed on amendment No. 21 :&mdash;</P>
    <P>To delete sub-section (1), page 11, and to substitute a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Where the appropriate Minister is satisfied that the holder of an office does not possess a qualification which has been declared (before the appointment of such holder to such office) under this part of this Act to be a qualification for such office, and it is in the public interest that the holder of such office should resign therefrom the appropriate Minister may require the holder of such office to resign within a specified period.&mdash; (Mícheál O Braonáin).</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Committee reported progress I was referring to amendment No. 21, in which the Minister can lay down as the essential qualifications for a public servant, that he should have red hair and, therefore, dismiss him because he cannot dye it in time to satisfy the Minister&rsquo;s new regulation.  I was directing attention to the fact that in the past, where a post in the public service has had to be filled by competition and examination, and the person responsible for filling the post desired to see a particular individual secured, it has been known that the particular individual&rsquo;s special qualifications have been examined and then there have been attached as conditions of appointment to the particular post in question just the qualifications that that particular individual has and that nobody else in the State happened to have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>You will find a gentleman being appointed as medical officer for Buttevant, and a proviso being attached to the appointment that the person to fill this office must have a degree in tropical medicine, because it so happens that one particular candidate for the post has a degree in tropical medicine, and that it is highly unlikely that anybody else going up for that post would have a similar degree. Those essential qualifications having <Col N="1833" /> been stipulated, all the form and paraphernalia of the Appointments Commission is set in force, and as the candidates present themselves they are eliminated one by one, until the unique candidate with the obscure degree emerges and is appointed, because he is the only man with this peculiar degree which has been declared by the requirements to be an essential qualification for the medical officer for Buttevant.  If we are to extend that procedure further by saying that, when an officer is in possession of a post someone can go down and examine that man&rsquo;s qualifications from A to Z, and make a regulation that the only person fitted to retain the post is one who holds qualifications which the present occupant has not got, and then proceed to call on him under this Bill to resign, in order to make way for somebody else who may be in a position to show this qualification, that is introducing an element into the public services of this country&mdash;whether in local administration or central administration&mdash;which is extremely undesirable.</P>
    <P>I do not suggest for a moment that it is the intention of the present Minister for Local Government and Public Health to bring in regulations of this character for the purpose I have outlined here, but I am saying that if, as the Minister himself says, the only reason the proviso is put in is to make provision for improvement in the event of some elaborate reorganisation being desirable in the future, cannot words to that effect be put in?  There is a provision in the Ministers and Secretaries Act or some such measure where, if it is desired to superannuate a civil servant who is not coming under one of the usual schemes of superannuation, the Minister can do it provided he can prove that the superannuation of that officer contributes to the more efficient working of the department from which he is being superannuated, but there is placed on the Minister the obligation to prove that a specific purpose is served before the superannuation will be permitted by the Comptroller and Auditor General of the State.  Surely there <Col N="1834" /> should be some provision in this Bill that, before the Minister calls upon an existing public servant to resign, he should have to satisfy some independent officer of State that this is being done in order to secure the more efficient or more economic administration of the department to which the official belongs.</P>
    <P>I do not think anybody in this House will complain if the Minister takes power under a code of this kind to remove officers whose occupations have become archaic, and give them full compensation by way of pension, but the power to do that need not go so far as to have anybody removed simply by making a regulation that certain qualifications are essential to the occupant of an office which he knows that an existing officer has not got.  It is quite true that no Bill introduced here can effectively legislate for the exceptional case, but there are certain underlying principles of legislation which should never be departed from, except in a time of emergency or when existing canons must be put aside to protect the State.  We had an incident recently in connection with the Finance Bill, when the Minister for Finance on reflection abandoned the attempt to introduce proposals for retrospective taxation. From the feeling that went through the House it was felt that however future tax burdens should be met it was an unsound thing to make them retrospective.  That should be the broad general principle of a Financial Resolution, and it should be the broad general principle in this kind of transaction, that where a man is doing a job according to the terms of the original agreement, it should not be in the power of anyone to require from him qualifications over and above those attaching to the office when he was appointed.  It is common knowledge that a man of middle age, who is doing his day to day work, is in no way fit to acquire academic or other qualifications that might be reasonably looked for if a new tenancy in the office was contemplated.  I suggest to the Minister that this amendment might be accepted, or the section withdrawn and recast so as to give power analogous to that of any Minister in regard to <Col N="1835" /> civil servants in the way of superannuation when a more efficient organisation is set up by the Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>I might shorten this discussion by intervening to point out, as I did on the Second Reading, that this was a machinery Bill, to make permanent a number of temporary provisions, and to legislate for certain statutory orders that have been made already.  In getting these temporary provisions or statutory rules into permanent shape, we found that certain interpretations were placed upon some of them, and that there were cases not provided for.  An Act was passed here that a female officer getting married should be entitled to a gratuity.  I believe the inference intended to be drawn, though it was not specifically provided, was that she should resign on marriage.  This section, as well as having in mind changes arising perhaps from reorganisation, was intended to provide for the particular cases of women who got married, as well as for general reorganisation. I agree with the Deputy that it is very objectionable to bring in qualifications subsequent to an appointment, and while I cannot accept the amendment, if the Deputy withdraws it now, I will try to meet it on the Report Stage.</P>

      <P>My fears about this section are that we are not going to have any statement from the Minister as to the reasons why he is dissatisfied with an officer.  If an official can be peremptorily discharged without any reason being given, it is a bad position and, from my reading of the section, it appears that that will be the position, if it passes in its present form.  If the Minister deems a person unfit to hold a position there is some valid reason and I maintain that somebody is entitled to know it.  We had a certain experience where, without any reason being given, a very high official was discharged, and that caused very grave dissatisfaction and a feeling of insecurity.  I do not want that to happen again.  The Minister should be able to say when he deems a certain person unfit to hold office.</P>

      <P>There is always an inquiry where an official is suspended.  Take a case where a person is charged with embezzlement and convicted by a court.  There is no point in having another investigation. In every other case when something comes to notice, if it is a serious matter, the officer is suspended, and <Col N="1839" /> the practice is that he is given an opportunity to send in an explanation or answer the charge.  Take a case where moneys have been embezzled, as often happens, and a person is convicted by a court, it would be only waste of time to have an inquiry then.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there anything unduly cumbrous about that procedure?  What are we going to save by this new power?  The only thing you are going to save is the procedure of notifying the officer, and the reason why the Minister is dissatisfied with him&mdash;of giving him a few days to make whatever case he can.  If he fails to make that case, then he is removed.  I agree with the Minister that in practice, in 99 cases out of 100, powers of this kind would not be abused.  May I be excused for intruding on the House an anecdote to illustrate my point?  My grandfather told me that when he went up to the court of appeal he found that the procedure there was extremely tedious and slow.  He complained to his colleagues on the bench that they <Col N="1840" /> took a long time to get through their business.  The Chief Justice, who was presiding, said to him: &ldquo;What you have got to remember, judge, is that in this court you have not only got to do justice, but you have got to persuade the appellant that he has got justice.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Now if you are going to try a man&mdash; and mind you this means trying a man on the grounds of incompetence to discharge his duties, or of unfitness for his position, and he is in a sense on trial&mdash;you have not only got to do substantial justice, but you have got to satisfy everybody that substantial justice has been done.  Surely, it is the very essence of doing substantial justice that the person to be condemned should be heard, that he will, at least, be told where he has fallen short, and will be afforded the opportunity of making representations to the Minister, or of giving an explanation, as to why he fell short.  If the Minister, having perused that, makes up his mind that the explanation is insufficient, and consequently decides to dismiss the official, then, at least, everybody knows that the man has had the opportunity of making his case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All of us in this House are familiar with the person who approaches one and complains that some grave injustice has been done to him, the person who says that the proof of that is that he has never been allowed to state his case.  The most experienced one amongst us will have felt, I think, that where a person has been able to convince us that he has never been allowed to state his case, it was rather unfortunate that, before a final decision was taken, the man was not at least heard.  The Minister has all the powers he requires at the present time to remove an unfit public servant. The only thing he is doing by this section is to short-circuit the procedure. Will the members of this House tell me that they want this precedure short-circuited?  I do not.  I think that, if you are going to remove a man from his present position of emolument on the ground that he is unfit and incompetent, we can well <Col N="1841" /> afford a few extra days to demonstrate to that man, to his neighbours and to everybody else that he has had a fair trial.  I can sympathise with busy civil servants who are anxious to expedite public business and who always want the shortest way to their objective.  I can sympathise with the layman going into a court of criminal law, feeling that there is a lot of abracadabra going on there that could well be dispensed with, but, nevertheless, those learned in the criminal law, and experienced in jurisprudence, will point out that the slow, solemn and involved procedure of the court of law which is determining a man&rsquo;s guilt or innocence, is of very great value in that it provides to him the utmost possible opportunity of stating his own case.  Whatever penalty be inflicted upon him, his neighbours and the public will have an easy conscience that the man got no more than his deserts.  Now, here is a very much shorter process which is being made even shorter still.  What Deputy in the House would deny to a public servant, who is about to be dispensed with on the grounds of incompetence or unfitness, the right to make his own case?  If all of us on all sides want him to have that right, why will not the Minister leave it to him?  Does the Minister want to deprive that public servant of the right to state his own case?  If not, what is the purpose of the section?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the section goes as far as the Deputy seems to think it does.  Under the Local Officers and Employees Act of 1926, there had to be an inquiry immediately after suspension.  This section does not repeal that.  If you did not have an inquiry, and did not inform a person of the reasons why he was being removed, I think that the courts, if appealed to, would hold that such a course was against natural justice. Under this section the person will be informed of the reasons why he is being suspended.  When a man is suspended &mdash;I am not thinking now of cases of embezzlement or charges of that kind&mdash; he is asked for an explanation.  It is only when the department is satisfied <Col N="1842" /> that the explanation is not sufficient; in other words, that it is not an explanation at all, that he is removed from office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Broderick Mr. Broderick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broderick</NameTxt>
      <P>Apart from officials charged with embezzlement, or with some other serious misdemeanour the procedure in the case of the ordinary official of a local authority who is suspended is this: that under the 1926 Act a sworn inquiry is held.  It is only as a result of that inquiry that the official can be removed from office. Does this section propose to alter that? The Minister put the case that if another procedure was followed, the courts might hold that the action taken was against natural justice.  I think that even if there was an omission in the 1926 Act the House might very well give way to the suggested amendment of Deputy Brennan.  The implication in it is, that before an official is removed, he will have the opportunity of either putting his case before a court or before a sworn inquiry.  I think the amendment is a reasonable one.  After all, a man&rsquo;s means of livelihood depends upon the position he holds, and he ought not to be removed until a full inquiry has been held into the whole matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Benson</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister&rsquo;s defence of this section is based on the 1926 Act, and he relates that to the case of an official who is suspended.  The suspension referred to there requires that a certain procedure be followed.  Surely this section, as it stands, does not deal with a suspension at all.  It deals with an immediate dismissal without any inquiry.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the point that has been raised about natural justice, there is nothing in the Constitution to prevent us from legislating against natural justice.  A right which a citizen would have, by implication, to natural justice we can withdraw from him by a specific enactment.  If we say specifically &ldquo;may, by order, remove the holder of the office from such office if the Minister deems the holder of the office to be unfit for or incompetent to discharge the duties of such office,&rdquo; no court in Christendom would hold that, <Col N="1843" /> that statute notwithstanding, the Minister might not remove the officer if he deemed him to be incompetent.  I fancy that, if I went into court, having been removed by the Minister under that section, all that counsel representing the Minister would have to do would be to produce a sealed and certified copy of the order deeming me to be incompetent and that would end the proceedings.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>The practice has been that, where a man is found unfit for his position, he is suspended.  That is usually done on the report of an auditor or some document of that kind. When he is suspended, the 1926 Act operates and there must be due inquiry.  This section does not take away his rights under the 1926 Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Provided there has been an initial suspension, he comes under the 1926 Act.  But suppose there is no initial suspension and a decision is taken by the Minister that the person concerned is incompetent or unfit and he is removed from office under Section 25 of this Bill, the 1926 Act never begins to function at all.  Deputy Brennan&rsquo;s proposal is to bring this section into line with the 1926 proviso so that, even if there is not an initial suspension, the inquiry-machinery of the 1926 Act must operate before the Minister makes up his mind as to the occupant&rsquo;s competence or fitness for the office. That seems reasonable enough.  Will the Minister consider it?</P>

      <P>I appreciate that the Minister will look into the matter between now and next stage, but there is one other thought I should like to put before him.  His objection to Deputy Brennan&rsquo;s amendment is that, in a case of embezzlement, or similar offence, tried by the courts, a further inquiry should not be necessary.  He has given his own objection away because a person guilty of embezzlement would surely be suspended and, under the 1926 Act, he has to hold an inquiry.  It seems to me that the objection to Deputy Brennan&rsquo;s amendment is, therefore, gone.</P>

      <P>What is the purpose of this section in relation to Section 25? Why is it necessary for the local authority to have power apart from the Minister?  Is it intended that the Minister shall initiate matters through the local authority?  If not, I suggest that the addition of the words &ldquo;if so requested&rdquo; after &ldquo;may&rdquo;, in the first line, would clarify the matter.  That would definitely mean that the local authority would approach the Minister instead of the Minister urging the local authority to take the necessary step.</P>

We introduce sections into Bills in which we say: &ldquo;If there is some other authority in the State which has to be complied with, this overrides it,&rdquo; although it does not specifically state that.  That has led to a very large extent to chaos in endeavouring to understand and follow Acts of the House.  I think the less we have of that the better.

      <P>Under Section 19, the Minister may make regulations for classes of offices.  He can make regulations fixing the remuneration for a body such as county surveyors or assistant surveyors, but you may have <Col N="1849" /> a case, for instance, of a county medical officer of health or some such office, where you may have to deal with the case as an individual case, not as a class.  County medical officer of health is, perhaps, a bad example to take, but there may be some major office in a county which you would have to deal with individually and fix the salary individually.  This section is intended to provide that when you have to deal with a case like that, it overrides the regulation that deals with the class, that is, the regulation made under Section 19.  That is the object of the section&mdash;to enable you to deal with an individual case.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>My reason for putting down amendment No. 32 is that the Minister is taking the right in his amendment to fix the total number of the members of every council of a county; to divide every county into county electoral areas, and fix in every respect other matters.  I want him to fix them in a particular way as regards area and population.  As a matter of fact, I do not see any reason whatever at the present time for a reduction in the members of the county council.  It has been freely canvassed for some time, even before this Bill came into print at all, that there was going to be a very drastic reduction made in the members of the county councils and, coincident with that, there was also the rumour that the county councils were going to lose all the powers they had, and that matters relating to county administration were going to be discharged by a manager.  If there is any force in the appointment of a manager in order to expedite county administration, there is no force left in the proposal to reduce the number of the members of the county council, because by their numbers they were in some way blocking administration.  It may be argued that because there were too many members in the county council it was unwieldy, and that it took a long time to discharge duties, and to discuss the matters that had to be discussed, and that, possibly, there was a lot of idle discussion.  That may be true, but that surely has all disappeared by the appointment of a manager, because the number of matters that would <Col N="1852" /> come up for consideration by a county council would be very few and far between.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have three Bills at the present time&mdash;the Public Assistance Bill, the Managerial Bill and this Local Government Bill, all supposed to be a part of each other.  They are all dove-tailed into each other.  It is very difficult for us to consider the implications of every Bill as a kind of joint administrative machine but if my recollection of the Public Assistance Bill is correct, we have been making provision in it for the appointment of sub-committees of various sorts and kinds all over the county for the purpose of carrying on administration as consultative bodies. If we are going to do that, is it not the best possible foundation we can have to have a pretty large elected body that will do the work?  You will then have people who were elected by the voters in the county on these sub-committees doing the work instead of having nominated persons who possibly might have not very much knowledge or might not be able to boast that they had been elected by popular franchise at any time.  I should like that, at least in the new election, there should be no reduction of members of county councils.  Consequently, I am asking in this amendment that the basis for fixing the number of members will be the same basis as was followed in the 1925 Act.  I am asking for no more than that.  I do not think it reasonable to insist on a reduction of members for county councils.  I think the more elected representatives you have the better off you will be.  At the moment, many of us are throwing our minds back even to parish councils. We have on one side a scheme of centralisation and on another side a scheme of decentralisation.  We should be consistent in some way. If the numbers of members of the county council are pretty high at the moment, we can make very good use of them and it is much better to appoint elected representatives to these various committees than to have them constituted of people nominated in some unsatisfactory way.  I am appealing to the Minister to retain the present basis <Col N="1853" /> of fixing the membership of county councils.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Second Reading of the Bill, I expressed more or less the same point of view as that to which Deputy Brennan has now given expression, namely, that it would be a pity to reduce to too low a figure the number of elected members of councils.  I think the experience has been that after a council has been elected for a few years the average attendance at meetings is from one-half to two-thirds of the full membership.  There is a very large number of committees to be elected from among the members of the county council-mental hospitals committees, vocational committees, agricultural committees, and so on, and some councils find great difficulty in finding members to represent them on these committees owing to the fall in attendance, say, six months or 12 months after elections.  If you reduce the number of members, as proposed in this Bill, I am afraid you will do a big injustice to many people.  It must be remembered that an electoral area for a county council covers a considerable area, and you may find very large districts in a county without any elected representative at all.  If you reduce the membership further, you will find that while comparatively small areas, owing to density of population, may succeed in being adequately represented, very often a large area which is sparsely populated may have no representative at all.  I know that a difficulty exists at present in counties, such as Cork, where there are very large councils but, taking the average county council, consisting of 27 to 30 members, I do not believe that they are unwieldy or incapable of transacting business properly.  The average attendances at meetings of such councils after a few months generally fall to about 17 to 21 members. Taking the home assistance committee, the public health committee and all the other sub-committees that must be set up under various Acts, if you are confined to a small number of members, you will have to co-opt outsiders to these committees, many of whom have actually <Col N="1854" /> no responsibility as public representatives. Sometimes, even the most desirable people, the very best administrators, who are co-opted in this way, will not take on the same responsibility as elected members.  That, I think, is the general experience and that is why I think the Minister should not too hastily enshrine in legislation this power to fix the number of members. It would be more desirable if the number could be fixed by order, as occasion arose.</P>

      <P>The Minister takes power in amendment No. 31 to divide every county into county electoral areas.  As far as I can read the amendment with the rest of the section, he fixes the number of members of a council on a certain basis, he fixes the areas, and he fixes the number of members to be elected by each area.  It would be possible in an extreme case, as far as I can read the section, for the Minister to divide the county into two areas, and to ordain that one member of a council should be elected from one of these areas and the rest of the members from the other area.  That is taking an extreme case.  I am not suggesting that any responsible Minister would do that, but reading the section with the amendment, I would say that the Minister has perfect power to gerrymander the constituency of a local authority without any guide whatsoever, by way of population or area, as to what should constitute the basis of a county electoral area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>To get some idea of the changes that have come about in representation on county councils and local authorities, one has to go back to the position pre-1925.  Pre-1925, the number of members was much smaller than at the moment.  In 1925, the functions of the rural councils were handed over to the board of health and the board of health, as you know, was elected from the county council. There were two members of each rural council, that is the chairman and another member, added on.  Since then the Public Assistance Act and the County Management Act have been passed.  Under the Public Assistance Act power is given to set up local <Col N="1855" /> committees to deal with particular matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>They did not seem to avail of it very much then.  Under the County Management Act, you have the county manager responsible for all executive functions so that councils will not have anything like the same amount of work they had to do when they had to deal with board of health duties and many other matters which will now be in the hands of the county manager.  There is no intention whatever to make drastic reductions.  In these orders the Minister will have to be guided by population and also by the convenience of an area.  I do not think, except in very few cases, that it will be necessary to interfere with the existing electoral areas.  Cork had 68 members, and subsequent to 1925, I think it was at their own request, it was reduced to 43.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Broderick Mr. Broderick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broderick</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>As a matter of fact under this Bill as it is drafted they would be entitled to more than 43, but they do not want more.  I could give examples of other councils, but there is only a provisional calculation as to how it works out.  Taking Deputy Brennan&rsquo;s area&mdash;this, again, is only a provisional calculation as to how it might work out&mdash;pre-1925 Roscommon had 21 representatives on the county council ; subsequent to 1925 they had 31 members, and the calculation at the present time is that they should have 26.  It may not be necessary to make any alteration in the electoral areas, or, again, it may in one or two of them.  Pre-1925, Wexford had 20 representatives; after 1925 it had 26 and the present calculation would show that they would be entitled to 21. There is not intended to be any drastic interference with the county councils. The Bill prevents that in any event. Some people believe that small councils do more work than large cumbersome councils, but there is no attempt being <Col N="1856" /> made under the provisions of this Bill to make any drastic change.  We are making only very small reductions in the number of members of the county councils.  I also believe that you will have more local committees set up to deal with local matters, and the work will be carried out under the direction and with the assistance of the county manager.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister, I am sure, will admit that our fears are not groundless with regard to the numbers, because the only guide we have is that set out in Section 35 in relation to borough councils.  That section says: &ldquo;if such number would, but for this section, be an even number greater than 19, one half of the said even number.&rdquo;  It is set down in black and white, hard and fast, that those local authorities are to be reduced by practically 50 per cent..  Surely our fears as to a reduction in the numbers are very well grounded, judging by that.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  That is quite true; I am sorry.  It says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;where...the total number of members of such council is a number less than 30, a number not less than 20,&rdquo;</P>
      <P>&mdash;so a council that might have 29 would be put off with 20. To my mind, the Minister has made quite a good case for retaining the number of members of county councils, in the same way as Deputy Allen and myself have tried to make it, inasmuch as under the Public Assistance Act it is necessary to make provision for the election of committees for the discharge of certain duties.  Has the Minister any objection to the members of those necessary committees being elected persons rather than selected persons?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course they can be too.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I know they can, but if we have only 21 to draw from instead of 31 then we will have less people <Col N="1857" /> to go around, and people with a much more restricted knowledge of the county than if we had 31 to pick from. That is the strongest argument I can use for the continuance of the present number of members elected to the various county councils.  I do not think the councils are unwieldy.  As committees are necessary in a county for the purpose of administering public assistance and other matters, we ought to have a wide number of persons with local knowledge, particularly of public assistance, and they ought to be, in so far as we can help it, people who are elected and not selected.  Consequently, I appeal to the Minister that, as far as possible, the members should be elected to the new county councils on something like the same basis that we have at the present time.  If he takes whatever the basis was under the 1926 Act&mdash;I presume it was the population of the area&mdash;and operates it in the same way, I have no objection whatever.  It may come down a peg or go up a peg, but I think it would be in the interests of public administration that we should have a large number of elected persons, with the responsibilities of being elected, rather than selected persons.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>You may do that, but every time I should prefer to have a person who was elected by the people, and has to go back again to be elected by them, rather than somebody who would have no responsibility.  In other words, I should like to have acting on every committee some person or a <Col N="1858" /> number of persons who were members of the rate-making authority.  I admit that we have very desirable persons on vocational educational committees and the county committees of agriculture. The county committee of agriculture in our area is composed entirely of members of the county council, but the vocational committee is not.  Again, if you reduce the number of members on the county council you are reducing the number of persons available for those particular committees.  That is my point.  You ought to keep them there, because you will want them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support Deputy Brennan&rsquo;s amendment.  I suggest that the number should not be reduced, for the reasons stated by Deputy Allen.  There is also another point which I wish to raise.  It is somewhat akin to the matter referred to by Deputy Esmonde, although I am not very much perturbed about gerrymandering, but I do suggest that the reasons in regard to the number of members under the present allocation would apply also to the divisions, with perhaps much more force.  The various county councils are divided into a number of electoral divisions.  A number of them are very cumbersome.  The Minister said there would not be much alteration, but I sincerely hope there will be changes in the electoral areas. Some of them in my county are particularly cumbersome.  I do not know why they were originally so framed, but they need to be changed.  I should not like the change to take the form of an enlargement of the areas, as would be possible under the Minister&rsquo;s amendment.  I would rather see them grouped into smaller areas and certainly not less in number than at present.  The Minister&rsquo;s amendment would make it possible to alter the number in a county like mine, in which there are five divisions, to three, and if there were to be any change, I would prefer to see the number increased to seven.  I should like to see all the amendments framed somewhat on the lines of Deputy Brennan&rsquo;s, that is. that, both in respect of number and area, they shall not be less than was set out in the previous Act.</P>

      <P>There is one point which the Minister ought not to overlook in this connection.  It is that the county manager, in being given very wide executive powers, is being handicapped in that he has not got that local knowledge which the local representative has.  He will be handicapped also in that he will not have the confidence of the people which the local representative will have.  If you are curtailing the powers of the local authority and putting their executive powers in the hands of the manager, there is all the more reason why there should be full representation, so that if the people in a particular locality have a grievance, they can go to their local representative and put their problem in his hands.  I think we ought not to overlook that aspect, particularly at present when the tendency in some countries is to destroy democracy and local representation altogether.  There is a bond of sympathy between the local representatives and the people which ought to be preserved.  If the local representative is doing his duty conscientiously and well, and looking after the interests of his people, they will have confidence in him, and there will be a bond of sympathy between them.  That cannot obtain between a paid official and the people, and in order to preserve the confidence of the people in the local authority to do the best they can in the interests of their people, you want full representation. I should not be inclined to reduce the number of representatives at all, and I think the Minister ought to be very slow to do so.</P>

      <P>Another point which I should like to put to the Minister is that this is a permanent measure, we hope, and I should like to see a certain fluidity by which the Minister would have the right, possibly at some future <Col N="1861" /> date, to alter the numbers according as population or some other cause warrant it.  Under this, we are fixed down to a certain formula and, if a council consisted of a certain number before this Act came into operation, the formula came into force and a certain number had to be fixed.  No other factors whatever could be taken into consideration.  If at present the number of councillors in a particular county is too high in proportion to its area or population, the new percentage under this formula will also be to high.  I should prefer to see the Minister accepting my amendment with the elimination of the words &ldquo;shall not be less in such regard than the numbers fixed under the Local Government Act, 1925&rdquo;.  If the Minister would simply have a section whereby we would have a guarantee that the numbers fixed by the Minister would be fixed in relation to area and population, I think we could rely on the Minister&rsquo;s fixing the right numbers afterwards, but I certainly object to a fixed number under a formula like this, without any regard whatever for the conditions that went before or that may follow.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Broderick</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it essential that you should retain sufficient to give you a majority on the various committees. Many of these committees, like mental hospital committees and technical committees, can commit local authorities to huge expenditure.  It may be said that, so far as the technical committees are concerned, they have to apply to the county council for sanction, but we all know how difficult it is to turn down the recommendations put forward by any of these committees. The people trusted by the ratepayers to spend their money properly, and to exercise proper control and a sense of responsibility, are the elected representatives, and on those committees, which have power to commit local bodies to expenditure, we should always provide for a majority of elected representatives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As to the various extensions of various committees that you suggest having, and which Deputy Allen pointed out we had power to set up under the Act of 1925, you may find them a very dangerous matter to handle.  After all, they will be more or less concerned with the social services, and I can visualise the unhappy lot of a local representative if he tries to comply with one-tenth of the regulations in connection with those committees. That is a matter about which one has to be extremely careful.  After all, the one thing that will ensure a sense of responsibility in a committee or local authority in the expenditure of rates is that the individual who stands over that expenditure will have to submit himself subsequently for sanction by the electors themselves, and to relieve him of that responsibility is an inducement to him to give way to sympathetic cases for which there might be no merit or foundation.  I speak with some experience, and, as Deputy Brennan said, I would much prefer&mdash;even if it meant a certain amount of unwieldiness&mdash;that the responsibility should be brought home to these people by having to face the electorate.  If they had to face the electorate you would be more certain <Col N="1863" /> of having that sense of responsibility than through nomination or selection.</P>
    <P>In saying that, do not think that I do not appreciate very much those who serve on technical committees because of their experience and special knowledge, or on agricultural committees, but particularly on technical committees.  They, however, are on an entirely different plane from those who deal with the social services and who have to face the importuning of people who may or may not be deserving, the cost of which cases will have to be borne by the public purse.  That is a thing which, if not carefully handled and controlled by the central authority, will leave us with a very much larger and undefined expenditure. It must not be forgotten that conditions have altered within the last few years.  You have the managerial system now, and you have the work of the board of assistance and board of public health being done by the county council.  I do not anticipate that there is going to be any reduction in the work, but rather that there will be very much more work concentrated on the people who will be doing it.  All those arguments go to show that the question of fixing the number of elected representatives is one that must be very carefully handled, and one headline that you must keep before you is that if any of these committees are to have the power of committing the council to expenditure you should have at least a strong majority of the elected members on it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is the usual experience that many members of a county council&mdash;I should say about 50 per cent.&mdash;generally refuse to act on any committee, and that leaves only a limited number of members who are called upon to attend to these duties. Often, it is a whole-time job for some of the elected members, with the result that the business is not done as it should be.  If you have not a certain number to volunteer or to draw upon, you will find it is almost impossible to get elected members, with responsibility, to serve on those committees.  I agree that you can get most admirable people by selection or co-option, but <Col N="1864" /> they do not act with the same sense of responsibility as the elected members, because the elected members are in closer touch with the finances of the councils, and know what it is to collect the rates and try to make their estimate fit in to their yearly budget.  They are more closely in touch with financial matters, and take a responsible outlook on all matters of expenditure whereas the other people, as I said before, while they may be very admirable, do not mind driving up expenditure without any consideration at all, because they have no reason to consider it.  That is why you need a certain number of elected members on each committee.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Broderick</NameTxt>
      <P>I was rather disappointed about one thing that the Minister said in connection with these sub-committees. I think he was alluding to those connected with social services and said that with the assistance of their managers they will be able to do a good deal of work that was formerly done by the boards of assistance and of public health.  Is it possible for these non-elected committees-selected, if you like-with the assistance of the manager, to commit the local authority to an expenditure over which the local authority would have no control?</P>

      <P>I do not think there is any point at all in trying to get a big council with a view to having a sufficient number ready to do their <Col N="1865" /> duty as councillors.  When it comes to a difference of five or six members of a council, I do not think it matters very much.  In any case, this is an experiment, and there is an amendment coming on which will enable this to be modified from time to time.  The reason we are reducing them at all is that there is a big amount of executive work that has been transferred over to the county manager.  He will have certain duties that used to take up a considerable amount of the time of councillors and members of the boards of health.  Deputy Broderick asked me would these people have the right to spend money with the assistance of the manager.  They may, but then the county council has the rating to do, and you cannot spend money unless you strike the rate for it, and the county council will always have that power.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 35:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To delete sub-sections (2), (3) and (4) and to substitute a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>The Minister shall by order fix the total number of members of any council of a borough, council of an urban district or commissioners of a town, define whether there shall be one or more electoral areas and the manner of election, including the number of aldermen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The section sets out: &ldquo;(a) if such number would, but for this section, be an even number greater than 19, one half of the said even number, and (b) if such number would, but for this <Col N="1868" /> section, be an odd number greater than 19, one half of the next whole number greater than the said odd number.&rdquo;  This represents a reduction of 50 per cent.  The Minister has not an amendment to this section of the same nature as amendment No. 34 and in that I see a very grave danger with regard to the fixing of the number of members for borough councils. It is much more important for the fixing of the number of members for borough council areas than for rural areas that the Minister should take the populations into consideration. The variations in rural populations are not very great from one year to another, but the position is different in a town of possibly 3,000 or 4,000 inhabitants. The population in such a town may, because of the loss of some industry, be reduced by 50 per cent. and the Minister would still be tied by this particular section; whether there was an expansion or a contraction in the population he would still have to have a fixed number of members on the borough authority.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether it has occurred to the Minister that, with the introduction of an industry into a town, there might be such an expansion of population as would justify an increase in the number of members of the borough authority.  On the other hand, there might be an exodus of people because of some mishap to a local industry and the Minister might have to have a contraction in the number of members of the borough authority.  The Minister should make some provision which will give him the right to alter the number of members rather than have a fixed number as is set out in the section.  In that sense the section as it stands is, in my opinion, definitely bad.  The Minister would be well advised to accept my amendment or introduce something similar which will give him the right to alter the number of members just as the population of a borough demands.</P>

      <P>Before Section 37 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>37.&mdash;(1) Where at the nomination of candidates at an election of members of a local authority either no candidates are duly nominated or the candidates duly nominated are less in number than the quorum for meetings of such local authority, such election shall not be proceeded with and Part IV of this Act shall have effect in relation to such local authority as if on the day on which such election was to have been held the members thereof had been <Col N="1871" /> removed from office under the said Part IV or, if such election is a new election within the meaning of the said Part IV, had again been removed from office under the said Part IV.</P>
    <P>(2)  Where in pursuance of sub-section (1) of this section an election is not proceeded with and such election would have been proceeded with but for a decision of the returning officer refusing to accept one or more nominations of candidates, the decision of the returning officer in respect of such nomination or any of such nominations (as the case may be) may be questioned by an election petition.</P>
    <P>(3)  Where the court trying an election petition in relation to an election of members of a local authority declares that by reason of a deficiency in the number of candidates duly nominated such election should not have been proceeded with, the following provisions shall have effect, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) the said election shall be deemed not to have been held and the persons elected at such election shall be deemed not to have come into office;</P>
    <P>(b) every act done during the period between the completion of such election and the determination of such election petition which was done by the persons or any one or more of the persons declared elected at such election and which purported to be an act of such local authority or an act done by virtue of the membership of such local authority of such one or more persons (as the case may be) shall be as valid and effectual as if all the persons declared elected at such election had been validly elected and qualified to act as members of such local authority;</P>
    <P>(c)  every such act which was done by an individual person declared elected at such election and subsequently declared appointed to the office of chairman, lord mayor, or mayor of such local <Col N="1872" /> authority and which purported to be an act done by virtue of the said office shall be as valid and effectual as if all the persons declared elected at such election had been validly elected and qualified to act as members of such local authority and such individual person had been validly appointed to the said office;</P>
    <P>(d) subject to the provisions of this sub-section, Part IV of this Act shall have effect in relation to such local authority as if on the day on which such election was held the members thereof had been removed from office under the said Part IV or, if such election was a new election within the meaning of the said Part IV, had again been removed from office under the said Part IV.</P>
    <P>(4)  Where the returning officer at an election of members of a local authority refuses to accept one or more nominations and by reason of such decision such election is not proceeded with and a court trying an election petition questioning such decision declares that such decision was wrong and that such election should have been proceeded with, the following provisions shall have effect, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  Part IV of this Act shall be deemed to have been in force pursuant to sub-section (1) of this section in relation to such local authority from the day on which such election was to have been held and shall continue so in force until the coming into office of the persons elected at the election held in accordance with the next following paragraph of this sub-section;</P>
    <P>(b)  the Minister shall, as soon as may be after the determination of such election petition, fix a day for the holding of an election of members of such local authority and such election shall be held on that day.</P>

The local authority consisted of members who tendered their services without any payment.  Now, if we are to have a manager, a secretary and a commissioner, all paid officials, it may be a very good system; but there is no doubt that it will give rise to grave criticism.  The manager will be paid a fairly good salary and, presumably, if only to mark the importance of the commissioner, the commissioner would have to be paid in excess of that.  In the present circumstances, there would be very grave criticism of that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We may assume that the dangers or possible temptations which would affect <Col N="1882" /> local authorities will be limited under the manager&rsquo;s care.  Viewing the matter from the administrative side the Minister ought to examine this matter again, if for no other purpose than to ensure that the managerial system will not start with a handicap.  I will not prophesy what is likely to take place in the future with regard to administration by local authorities, but one danger is that when members of these bodies have before them the possibility of being removed from office, if they find themselves in conflict with the Minister on a few occasions, the tendency is to increase rather than to diminish such difficulties.  The Minister knows well the marked difference there is in the Parliaments of the world which are subject to a veto on the part of the head of the State; that there is not the same responsibility usually borne by Parliaments in that position as by Parliaments where there is no overriding voice, where the head of the State as a matter of course signs Bills.  Between now and the Report Stage the Minister ought to review this section.</P>

      <P>With the managerial system in operation the commissioners would have very little to do.  The executive is run by the manager.  They would be paid, I imagine, very low salaries.  I cannot see any objection to taking three persons from a local body and appointing them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a very grave disadvantage.  If it were possible to envisage a situation in which four or five local bodies were deprived of representation, and that one commissioner could do the work of these bodies, then the salary question would not be so important.  For a start the Minister ought to consider whether it would not be as well to waive this proposal. If in the new measure the manager has extra powers for dealing with matters which give rise to a good deal of dissatisfaction from the administrative point of view, it is unlikely that the same opportunities will occur in the future.  There is one grave defect about the appointment of commissioners that we might face up to. <Col N="1883" /> If public representation is of a kind that super-action has to be taken in connection with persons exercising administrative responsibility, it is a grave defect in our character and one of the things that appear to me to lend a lever to and to accentuate that position is the fact that they can be removed. It so happens that every country, as well as every local area gets the character of representation it deserves. Our efforts should be directed towards making representatives realise the importance of their position, to look up rather than to look down, and certainly not to go on with the exercise of their authority with a fear always before them that there is a danger of a public inquiry or of being dissolved in a few days.  In this particular case, bearing in mind the new orientation which the managerial system is bound to effect, it might be just as well if the Minister for the time being made up his mind that he was not going to have commissioners at all.  If it transpires that it is necessary to change from that attitude, he would have to consider the question of a re-organisation of local government.  I put it to him from my experience of these matters that people will resent being governed locally by a paid official, however little time he may have to spend in that responsible task.</P>

      <P>In the past when a commissioner was appointed, and when a council was deprived of office, I understand the Minister had no power to reinstate that council without holding an election.  Would it not be well to take power to reinstate a council without the necessity of holding an election?  There is no reason why the manager should not act as the council in case of an emergency.  Why not make a manager a commissioner and let him perform the duties without having to bring in other people when a council went out of office?  When there is a manager I take it that councils will not go out of office in the same way as in the past, because the manager will be carrying responsibility for administrative acts, and these bodies will not be liable to be removed.  Why should not the manager assume the <Col N="1884" /> powers of the council by order of the Minister in such rare cases?  Perhaps the Minister would define the position of such councils, without having an election held after a certain period.</P>

      <P>I would be very glad if we could have the position that Deputy Cosgrave has in mind, that it would not be necessary to have commissioners at all.  I am afraid we cannot contemplate that at this stage, no matter how hopeful we may be about a new orientation under the managerial system.  It would be very desirable if it could be done, but we cannot, I think, face it just at the moment.  Even in this House I have heard some members express very strong views about the managerial system.  One member voiced such an intense dislike to the system that he said he would see it would not work in his particular county.  I do not know if there was much in that.  I think that when these schemes are put into operation people see the advantage of them.  One of the troubles that I sometimes come up against is that I find some local authorities, not very many, will not strike a proper rate. Some urban councils and town commissioners give a little trouble in that way. Naturally they do not want to face a high rate.  If you got the position in any county where a council got at cross purposes with the county manager, and in that situation refused to strike a proper rate to enable him to carry out his work, the position would be serious.  That is the sort of thing we want to provide against here.  I would be very glad to see the position in which it would not be necessary to appoint commissioners.  However, you always have to bear in mind that clashes may occur in some place or other, and we have to take steps to provide against them.</P>

I know one case that has caused a considerable amount of confusion.  The person in question is now pretty old.  She had been paying the rates direct to the town rate collector. The latter is now demanding the rates off the landlord.  There was no combined rent.  When the landlord demanded the rates from the occupier, she objected and said that she was quite prepared to continue paying the rates to the rate collector.  She objected because she thought she was going to lose something if she lost the status of a ratepayer.</P>

      <P>I do not think there is any need for me to remind the House of the very unsatisfactory and unsavoury results we had from the shipment of stock from one part of the country to another for the purpose of sale.  I think, at least, the owner of the stock ought to be entitled to have the stock sold or offered for sale within the precincts of the county where the rate is to be paid.  I think he is entitled to some consideration and, consequently, I am moving that the stock will be sold within the boundary of the county in which the liability to pay such rates occurs.  I think that is reasonable.  I do not see any sense in taking a man&rsquo;s stock from County Roscommon to Dublin to be sold in Dublin, putting the cost of transport on the unfortunate man from whom the stock was seized and causing a lot of trouble in that way.  I think we are certainly giving latitude enough in giving the rate collector the right to have them sold in any part of the county in which the rate is to be paid.</P>

I believe, from experience, and I think most county councillors know from experience, that if there is any use at all in the rate collector&rsquo;s warrant to distrain he should be able to dispose of stock in some market and very often they may not be disposed of in his own local market.  Most county councillors know that from experience.</P>

      <P>Arising out of sub-section (5), which deals with the number of days which a rate collector may keep stock which he has seized, without any extension of the existing provisions, it was generally felt that five days was rather too long a period.  The expenses of keeping stock for five days would be fairly considerable and would reduce the amount left to meet the demand for rates.  If the rate collector is compelled to keep, say, ten head of stock for five days, the cost of their maintenance would amount to a very considerable sum, and would certainly diminish the amount, if the stock had to be sold, that would be left to meet the debt.  That is a matter the Minister should take into consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Under sub-section (2) it would be possible for a rate collector to impound the car of a doctor who happened to be visiting the residence of a defaulting ratepayer at the time a seizure was made.  I think that there should be some correction made as regards that provision.  It is apparently intended also that any cattle found on the lands of a defaulting ratepayer may be seized.  In sub-section (7) of the section, the Minister presumably intends to empower a person whose cattle are grazing on the lands of a defaulting ratepayer and which are seized to satisfy a claim for rates, to take action against the defaulter to recover whatever loss he suffered.  There is the other case in which the rate collector may seize the wrong man&rsquo;s cattle.  In any case, this method of recovering from a person who is unable to pay rates is not a very happy idea.  The question arises as to whether this is really a moral law.  Some years ago, I think in 1920, when we found it rather difficult to collect rates, the late Chief Justice on being asked for a decree in a case <Col N="1899" /> such as this section is intended to deal with, refused to give a decree on the grounds that it was against natural justice.  I should like to know whether the Minister has taken any advice in regard to the extraordinary powers that are given in this section.  It is quite true that in non-Catholic countries this is the law and it was in a non-Catholic country that the Act of 1918 to which the Minister has just referred was enacted.  I have the greatest doubt, however, that the section as it stands would be regarded by any ecclesiastical authority as within the competence of Parliament to enact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like the Minister to give us his experience as a country practitioner and his view as to the equity or justice of this method of collecting rates.  I remember years ago a zealous soul in Ballaghaderreen wanted to collect a debt due to him. He got a decree and, under the then law, you could get yourself constituted a bailiff to enforce a decree by a certain procedure to which he resorted. He then started off with a horse and cart to collect fowl on the debtor&rsquo;s land.  While he was chasing the fowl around the field, a rate collector came along and seized the horse and cart to satisfy a claim for rates against the place.  The unfortunate creditor was obliged eventually to abandon his own seizure and to pay his debtor&rsquo;s rates in order to recover his horse and cart.  I suppose a good many of his neighbours were inclined to comment on that: &ldquo;The devil mend him,&rdquo; but it does seem to my way of thinking, and it always did seem to me, to be a very unjust method of collecting the local cess.  So far as I am aware it has been the law in this country for years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This section does not operate to change the law at all, but what I have seen happen not infrequently in the country is this.  The man who is going down, who is unable to meet his rates, is the kind of man who usually takes in grazing.  Ordinarily, in the West of Ireland people who put cows or cattle out grazing are small men, industrious small men who have managed to save a little money and who are in a <Col N="1900" /> position to buy more stock than they can graze on their own small holdings. They may put out two, four or six bullocks under a grazing agreement. Some fine morning the rate collector walks on to the farm where these bullocks are grazing and takes them away.  The only remedy open to the man who owns the bullocks is to proceed against the owner of the land from which the bullocks have been taken.</P>
    <P>Now, it is common knowledge that it is virtually impossible for any individual citizen of this State to recover a debt against a neighbour&rsquo;s land, no matter what measure of grievance he has against the man, but it is a comparatively easy thing for a public authority to recover a debt due by levying against a citizen&rsquo;s lands.  The traditional hostility to individuals in this country who levy against a man&rsquo;s land is a very natural survival of the land war when it was expedient for us to combine against the contention that any individual had the right to evict his neighbour and those who went in for eviction, or for distraining on a neighbour&rsquo;s land, were regarded as emergency men and were treated accordingly.  That healthy tradition has survived, but now the whole social situation in rural Ireland has changed. The landlords have been kicked out of the country and every man is his own landlord, but not infrequently the sense of public duty, which freemen ought to have, becomes confused by their recollection of the past and a legitimate distraint upon land is still regarded as being antipathetic to the sound instincts of the Land League.  Therefore, the poor man whose cattle are seized for the rates of the individual upon whose land he had them is virtually left without any remedy at all.  Why should the local authority be excused from the obligation of suing for the rates or from seeing that the decree is charged as a mortgage on the land and, if necessary, getting an order for the sale of the land?</P>
    <P>The Minister has as wide an experience of the West of Ireland as I have, and he knows that many cases of hardship have arisen as a result of the exercise of powers granted by this section. I should be glad if he would tell us <Col N="1901" /> from his own personal experience what he himself thinks of the merits of this method of recovering rates which are in arrear, because I have never heard anybody defend it.  I should be interested if any Deputy in this House who has experience of local administration would tell us, why in his judgment, the local authority who can sue with impunity, should be delivered from the obligation of suing and should be allowed to pass on that obligation to the defaulter&rsquo;s neighbours, who it is notorious are quite unable to sue, especially when these neighbours are probably the decentest individuals in the district&mdash;enterprising go-ahead men who are earning more money than the average fellow would earn on the holdings they have.  I really think the Minister should consider the whole question on the merits, that we should make up our minds that this is not a good way of collecting arrears of rates, abolish this procedure and avail of this occasion to revise the method by which local authorities collect these arrears.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnLymbrickEsmonde" hpid="Mr. Esmonde Mr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not like this section, and never did since the Bill got its Second Reading.  There is no doubt that the right to seize for rates has been given to rate collectors since as far back as 1836, but it was very infrequently exercised, for a number of reasons.  One of those reasons was that the act of seizure was hedged around with a lot of technical difficulties, and the rate collector had recourse to those methods only when he felt that that was the only way of dealing with the matter. The ordinary courts are open to the rate collector for the recovery of rates. What I object to about this section is that it is putting the rate collector into such a position that no matter how he carries out the seizure he is not going to be answerable to anybody.  First of all, he can summon to his aid the members of the Civic Guard and, secondly, by sub-section (8) of the section &ldquo;nothing done under and in accordance with this section shall be questioned on the ground that it is not done under or in accordance with any other enactment&rdquo;.  Something that the rate collector had failed to do, or something that he had done in defiance of another enactment, was usually a ground for <Col N="1902" /> bringing some proceedings against the rate collector for wrongful distress. The Minister recognised the right of the ratepayer to bring proceedings against the rate collector if anything wrong had been done.  He mentioned that in connection with the discussion as to reasonable costs.  But this section to all intents and purposes places the rate collector in such a position that he can snap his fingers at everybody, and go ahead.  The result will be that, once the rate collector realises his position, he will in practically every case have recourse to the powers given to him in this section.  For that reason I very strongly object to the section.</P>

      <P>I think most local authorities found it almost impossible to get the rate collectors to operate the power they had under the old legislation, when they could seize on their own warrant.  That was the difficulty with most local authorities in cases where it was necessary to make seizures, but I am afraid under sub-section (7), to which Deputy Cosgrave took exception, you are going to do damage to the rate collection.  Take the case of a man who lets all his land for grazing on the 11-months&rsquo; system.  That land immediately becomes immune; the stock on that land becomes immune from seizure.  That is the position under sub-section (7), as I read it.</P>

It is well known to everybody that a large portion of the land of this country has been paying neither annuities nor rates, and the Land Commission are the very people who have power to deal with the matter.  Our complaint as a local authority is that they do not exercise those powers and collect the revenue for the Minister for Finance.  A great many people in certain portions of land all over the country have not been paying any rates or annuities for the past 20 years or longer.  I know several holdings which owe a sum of £1,000.

      <P>They failed to get the rates through the operation of the law. They failed completely, and the land is there paying no rates and annuities. But the neighbouring farmers are paying those rates and annuities.  That is our objection all the time.  We blame the Land Commission for being negligent in their duty in acquiring that land when they know it has become derelict.  The local authority has grave cause of complaint against some Government Department on that matter. They find themselves powerless to do anything, and they think that the Land Commission and the Minister for Finance&mdash;who is most interested in getting some part of this revenue in land annuities&mdash;should take action in regard to those derelict farms.  Nobody has <Col N="1905" /> been living on a number of them for 15 or 20 years.  That is why I am not satisfied with this sub-section (7).</P>

We are going to have those powers given to the rate collectors at a time when there would be no public representatives to put on the brake.  Is that not the position? You are going to have managers with complete powers.  They, and they only, will have power to collect the money, and to spend it, and all the powers the representatives will have is to make the rate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, and appoint the rate collector, and, of course, when the rate collector is appointed, he becomes a law unto himself, and is given these powers to seize &mdash;I do not propose to go into the broad question&mdash;in the case of lands semi-derelict, the owner of which fails to pay his rates.  The rate collector can swoop down and collect the rates by distraint of grazier stock.  That is going to cause a very serious <Col N="1906" /> economic condition of affairs.  If that happens on a farm, the owner will not be able to let that farm the following year.  Nobody will put stock to graze on it, and no rates will be collected, by distraint or otherwise.  Then you are up against the position of disposing of the farm to get the rates.  I do not think the law as it stands gives precedence to rates arrears on land over a private or a bank debt.  That is one of the great troubles the county councils are up against.  After going to the trouble of securing a council against loss in respect of arrears of rates, they find that they have not got priority over private debts.</P>
      <P>As I understood the powers of a rate collector heretofore, he had power on his own warrant to seize, and I know several instances in which that power has been exercised.  The county council of which I have experience deprecates the use of that power, and have told rate collectors under their charge that they would wish proceedings to be taken in the courts to recover arrears of rates, although, of course, the collectors had power to throw the council&rsquo;s suggestion aside and take direct action himself.  They have, however, not done so.  I do not know if it is intended by this Bill to make it obligatory on rate collectors to proceed in this way, and if there is to be no alternative method as heretofore of taking the matter to court.  I should like the Minister to enlighten us on that point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the Minister&rsquo;s experience in this respect?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as my experience goes, there has not been, except in very occasional cases, much difficulty in collecting rates certainly in the West of Ireland but, on the other hand, that was the best area from the point of view of both land annuities and rates in the whole Twenty-Six Counties, due to some extent to the size of the holdings and the industry of the people, or perhaps to the size of the holdings being more suitable than in other places.  I acted from time to time for rate collectors in the court and the cases were mainly settled before reaching the court.  There are, however, certain individuals, as the <Col N="1907" /> Deputy knows, who will not pay until the last minute, and I remember cases long ago of people who would not pay land annuities until they got word from the postman that he had delivered the long envelope to a certain office.  There are very few of that type, but I have occasionally seen cases in which there was a good deal of evasion by the ne&rsquo;er-do-well type or by these people who are very cute and shrewd and who try to get away with it.</P>
      <P>I am not the judge of the morality of this matter.  I am merely trying to secure that in extreme cases the collector will not come along and say: &ldquo;We are supposed to collect our rates, but you have not given us sufficient powers to do so.&rdquo;  In the normal course of events, I assume that rate collectors will bring these people to court and sue them.  The ordinary procedure is to serve the demand notes and try to collect the rates.  Energetic collectors follow that course, but when they have difficulties in the rare cases, they are entitled to be provided with the machinery to enable them to see that the person who is perhaps dishonestly trying to evade responsibility does not get away with it.  This does not mean, as Deputy Belton suggested, that the ordinary method of procedure is removed, by which a demand note is served and the rates collected in the ordinary way by taking people to court, if necessary.  This, I assume, is only to be used in very extreme and rare cases.  There is nothing to prevent the county council following the normal procedure and taking people to court, but, in the 1924 Act, there was a provision which went as far as this, if it did not go further. Section 2 (1) of the Local Government (Collection of Rates) Act, 1924, says:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Immediately upon receipt from the Minister of a warrant under this Act, the under-sheriff shall proceed to levy the sum therein certified to be due by the defaulter by seizing all or any of the goods, animals or other chattels within his bailiwick belonging to the defaulter named in the warrant or to be found on the rateable property mentioned in the <Col N="1908" /> warrant, and for such purpose the under-sheriff shall have the like powers of seizing all goods and chattels found on the rateable property as a poor rate collector has under his warrant, and shall also have all such rights, powers and duties as are for the time being vested in or imposed on an under-sheriff by law in relation to the execution of a writ of <i>fieri facias.</i></P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>What does the Minister think of the fairness&mdash;approaching the matter <i>de novo</i>&mdash;of going in and taking a poor man&rsquo;s cattle in respect of the land owner&rsquo;s debt?  My experience&mdash;I see that Deputy Allen has left&mdash;on a local authority was that what in fact happened was that we gave a bonus to the rate collector, if he completed his warrant before a given date.  In practice, what happened was that the rate collector collected as much of the rates as he could.  He then borrowed <Col N="1909" /> from the bank, or from his friends, the balance of his warrant, lodged it on the due day, and proceeded to sue the defaulters, and he generally had no difficulty in recovering.  He could get a decree in court, and if the people did not pay he could either get it charged as a judgment mortgage on the land and sell the land, or hand it to the sheriff for seizure of goods, and if it were returned <i>nulla bona</i> he could get an instalment order.  If a man takes the job of rate collector and lodges his own money, not to qualify for his salary, but in order to qualify for a bonus, surely he is getting paid something, and what he is getting paid to do is to incur whatever odium or unpopularity the suing of a defaulting ratepayer may entail.  If he does not do that and if the rates are not paid, he can lodge a defective warrant and say that he has failed to get the rates, and the local authority, as far as I know, can proceed, through their own law officer, to recover, with the county council as the plaintiff.</P>
      <P>Why should the rate collector of a local authority have available to him machinery for the collection of a debt that no other citizen has?  Why should the rate collector of a local authority be able to do me an injustice that no other citizen of this State could do to me?  Let him seize Deputy Meaney&rsquo;s property to satisfy Deputy Meaney&rsquo;s debt, but why should nobody except a rate collector claim the right to seize Deputy Meaney&rsquo;s property to satisfy my debt?  There will be those who will say that if the rate collector goes to seize cattle on a man&rsquo;s property, and if he is confined to the seizure of the debtor&rsquo;s cattle, he never can tell whether any cattle on the land are, in fact, the property of the debtor or not, and that neighbours will come forward to claim the cattle as theirs in order to help the debtor, but that applies to us all.  If I sell one cwt. of flour to a man.  I have to get my money in some way.  If he fails to pay I can get a decree and the sheriff can claim his property in satisfaction of the debt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can go to the court and get a judgment, have it registered as a mortgage, get it declared well charged, seize the place, and I have all the <Col N="1910" /> other remedies of the law available to me.  Why must the local authority be given this additional power, more especially when its penal effect falls not upon the defaulting ne&rsquo;er-do-well but upon the <i>bona fide</i> neighbour whose only crime is that he is somewhat more industrious than the other people in the district?</P>

There was very much opposition to them.  I think it is a thoroughly bad principle that anybody in the State should be given the right to seize one man&rsquo;s goods in satisfaction of another man&rsquo;s debt, and I cannot imagine the Minister for Local Government and Public Health getting up here and saying: &ldquo;Well, I do not see anything wrong with it.&rdquo;  I think that, in the back of his own mind, he thinks it is wrong but that, somehow or other, it has been going on for so long he does not see any reason to change it now.  It does not seem to me to be fair and I should like to know if the Minister, from his own experience in the country, could say that he thinks it is fair.  We all know that it is a quick and an easy way for the local authority to get their rates, but is it a fair, just way?  I do not think it is.</P>

      <P>I do not mind, if you do that.  Section 58 is the section which gives the local authority power to collect its rate by this machinery and I think that this is unfair.  I think we ought to be allowed to proceed by way of judgment mortgage and sale. Deputy Belton says to me: What can they do supposing they find that there is a first, second, third, and fourth mortgage on the place already?  Very well.  I have no objection to putting a section into this Bill providing that a judgment mortgage, declared well charged, for rates, shall take priority over other charges.</P>

They can do that at any time, and I have no objection to giving the rates priority over other mortgages.  That does not <Col N="1912" /> say that it is fair to take Deputy Victory&rsquo;s cattle to satisfy Deputy Meaney&rsquo;s debt.  Provide the local authority with any power you like effectively to secure payment of the rates; let it be done at the expense of the mortgagees of the place because it is their duty to watch their mortgage and see that it is not imperilled by the non-payment of rates, but do not proceed by the method suggested here.  Would the Minister say, in his personal judgment as a practitioner familiar with these proceedings, that it is fair that Deputy Victory&rsquo;s cattle should be seized for Deputy Meaney&rsquo;s debt?</P>

My opinion is that if he saw me seizing Deputy Victory&rsquo;s cattle he would break his heart laughing at Deputy Victory.  Deputy Victory would feel sore, not Deputy Meaney.  My plan would be, if Deputy Meaney will not pay his score, to get a decree first of all, to bring him to court and have the decree well charged.  I would then raise the judgment mortgage, sell his place and present him with a bill for the costs, and I believe he would be the sorest man in North Cork when I would be finished with him; and the next time the rates became due I bet he would be running like a redshank to pay them.  It does not seem to me to be reasonable to lean on Deputy Victory because Deputy Meaney is not an honest man.  That is the whole burden of my case.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I regard this section as very objectionable and I considered it necessary to submit six or seven amendments to the various subsections. Apart from the controversial point raised by Deputy Dillon in relation to the method of collection by distress warrant or otherwise, there are very many objectionable features in the section.  Amongst other things the section provides that a rate collector <Col N="1914" /> may demand the services of a Guard and must get them.  He is not compelled to go to the superintendent or the sergeant.  He demands the services of a Guard and the Guard must attend. My point is that a Civic Guard is under discipline, under the discipline of his own officers, and he is probably sent out on some special duty, be that what it may&mdash;possibly to make a report on the movements of certain persons. Under this section a rate collector has the right to say: &ldquo;Come along with me,&rdquo; and he must go.  The Minister says that he must go.  I do not think that is fair to a disciplined officer.</P>
      <P>Further, the rate collector may seize stock off lands and he may detain the stock for five days in any place that he thinks fit.  That place might be 100 miles away or it might be in some backyard. So far as this section is concerned, there is no obligation on the rate collector to see that the stock are properly maintained.  There may be a section in some other Act covering that point, but there is nothing dealing with it here.  The rate collector may take them to any place he likes in order to sell them.  He may take them 100 miles away and put all the transport charges on the unfortunate man whose stock are being seized.  The first thing to be paid out of the price of the stock will be the costs, not the rates.  The animals will be sold and the costs may be so great that the price obtained will not cover them and the unfortunate man whose property is in question will still have the rates to pay, apart from whatever remains due by way of costs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The rate collector is being given authority of a very widespread character.   His powers are being made as wide as they possibly can be made. The Minister said there may be cases in which the rate collector will require extra powers.  In my experience I have never come across such cases.  I have never heard a rate collector complain that he had not all the powers he wanted to collect the rates.  We never have had much difficulty in the matter of rate collection in my county.  It was a kind of revelation to me to hear Deputy Allen saying that there are farms on which annuities and rates are due for at least 20 years.  I do not <Col N="1915" /> know of any farms in my county in such a position.  There may be a few tracts of red bog on which rates are not paid, and on which there is nothing to be seized, but otherwise the rates have always been regularly paid.</P>
    <P>The practice is that if a seizure is made the rates are promptly paid by the person whose property has been seized.  In some instances that person may not be the rated occupier and may be merely in the position of grazing the land.  In such cases arrangements are made for the payment of the rates. In my opinion there is no necessity to tighten up the machinery or give more powers to the collector to enable him to collect the rates.  On the whole, as Deputy Cosgrave has mentioned, unwarranted powers are being sought under this section.  It is giving to the rate collector wide powers to penalise the ratepayer, without placing upon him any responsibility.  For that and for other reasons I object to the section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>What objection has the Minister to putting a section in this Bill giving priority to rates over other charges?  He is quite well aware that judgment mortgages have been got in a certain county running into thousands of pounds, and there was a feeling when this policy was adopted in order to secure the rates for the council concerned that the rates, even as judgment mortgages, would have priority over other mortgages and charges.  In the course of time that became doubtful.  There is no other way except to seize the land.  I do not know if county councils have the power to seize lands and sell them.  It has been stated here that they cannot be cashed, so there is no remedy that way. The Minister knows that if land changes hands only two years&rsquo; arrears attach to that land and the other arrears attach only to the person who has passed out and who, in those circumstances, would be penniless and the council would lose the rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my opinion, rates and annuities should have a prior claim over any private debt or loan that might be on the land.  Why is that not perpetuated in the case of judgment mortgages?  In <Col N="1916" /> my county there are arrears running to over £100,000.  There is not a hope of getting thousands of that amount from current income, and the Minister knows that well.  We have registered thousands of pounds as judgment mortgages. If they must take their place at the bottom of the class, then that mortgage is not worth much.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>What objection has the Minister to giving priority to rates over other charges?  The rates were there before any debt was incurred on the land.  It is an annual charge, and the annuity is the same.  I do not see how the powers that are given here will help.  I am sure the Minister does not want to make any ratepayer bankrupt; he wants to get in the rates.  If the rates are not paid, that property should pay them.  It has been admitted here that you cannot cash them.  I do not agree with Deputy Dillon.  I think that is a great economic loss.  I hold that a farmer has no prescriptive right to protection that a shopkeeper has not.  If a shopkeeper does not pay his way, his creditors come and foreclose on him. the farmers should have no more protection in the economic world than the shopkeeper or manufacturer or anybody else.  If you rush to sell out now, there would be no buyers.  That has been freely stated.  Will the Land Commission buy people out of their land and out of debt, and take over the bill, and hand out that small or large holding, as the case may be, to landless men?  I do not think they will.  They should be helping the local authority to get arrears of rates that have accumulated through economic stress in the last ten or 20 years, through the deflation of the currency which piled on the millions of frozen debts that are on the land at the present time.  How does the <Col N="1917" /> Minister hope to get them out of these debts if he does not come to the assistance of the local authorities and of the farmers?  The banks are piling it on too strongly somewhere.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Following the suggestion of Deputy Dillon that priority should be given to judgment mortgages for rates, I think it has been held in a case in court that it is doubtful now whether a judgment mortgage, when registered, will have priority over a bank mortgage or other mortgages on the land.  I do not know whether I am speaking, on that point, from information about a case decided in the courts or from a legal opinion that came before me as a member of a local authority.  I think that it is doubtful, and that the judgment mortgage has to take its place behind the other.  Why does the Minister not tackle that?  If priority is given to it, that judgment mortgage will carry 4 per cent. interest. That ratepayer can pay his current rates and can pay the interest on the arrears of rates, and he is not a charge or a burden on the rest of the ratepayers. He is paying interest on his arrears and the time may come when he would be able to pay off the arrears of rates as well as the current rates. If that priority is not given to this charge, the local authority cannot wait and that man must be sold out and his land seized.  Then the Minister comes along and shoves in other people&rsquo;s stock there, in danger of being seized by direct action on the part of the rate collector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister quoted an Act passed in 1924.  I am quite sure he will admit that, in all the circumstances of that time, such action was necessary.  He remembers that all the big farms round <Col N="1918" /> Easkey were striped and parcelled out and allotted to local people by an adventurer who spent a couple of years afterwards in jail.  He got subscriptions from the poor people who expected to get land.  That was rampant all over the country and had to be put down by more or less wild West methods.  The procedure suggested here is more or less wild West methods. It is not giving the men who got into difficulties a chance to get out of them. It is not protecting the go-ahead farmer or farmer&rsquo;s sons in the country who take grazing and mind their business, who work hard and make a livelihood for themselves.  Through no fault of theirs in getting knowledge on this point, the rate collector may come and swoop down on their cattle and sell them.  To whom can they turn for compensation? To the man who cannot pay his rates and will not pay his rates?  There is no compensation to be got there.</P>
    <P>It is like something one would expect from Herr Hitler in occupied Europe to-day&mdash;something that you would do not to your own people but to a conquered people.  If that attitude is persisted in, I do not know where we will find ourselves but, certainly, it will not be in the position of self-sufficiency. I strongly urge the Minister to consider, on a future stage, this question of priority of a judgment mortgage for rates, making rates in any shape or form a first charge on the land.  If he would do that, well and good.  If he desires a bargain on that point, I would give him in this Bill even the direct method of collection, if he would do that to protect local councils and ratepayers who have got into difficulties.  He would be helping the country economically by considering it.  I would be glad to hear him on this point and, if he is not prepared to agree, to hear his reasons for refusing.</P>

      <P>I do not wish to say any more than this: everybody seems to be taking up the attitude that big powers are being taken under this Bill that do not exist already.

I am not going into the question of rate collection, but am trying to clarify the position and to make it easier and less costly for the ratepayer.  When one tries to do that, we are told that we are adopting Herr Hitler&rsquo;s methods or those of somebody else.  What will happen under the procedure that is being clarified is that a rate collector, instead of going to a solicitor&rsquo;s office and incurring expenses and piling up costs, will go to the man himself.  If the man does not pay after reasonable notice has been given to him, the collector will collect it or seize the stock.</P>

It is in order to overcome that difficulty that this amendment has been put in.

      <P>This section, as it originally stood, was, I think, bad enough in that it allowed a county council to delegate powers, even the institution of legal proceedings, to a parish council, a self-appointed body which came along and sought recognition from the county council.  The Minister, to my mind, is making the original section very much worse by this amendment, because now he is going to allow the county council not only to delegate its powers to the parish council, but he is going to allow the public assistance authority to delegate its powers to the <Col N="1931" /> same body.  We had a good deal of discussion to-day on the different ways in which elected persons and persons who are not elected have control in financial matters.  I think that the remarks made earlier would apply particularly to the point that we are now dealing with.  The position here is that the Minister is prepared to allow a parish council, which has not been elected by anybody and has no responsibility to anybody, to exercise the powers of a public assistance authority.  It seems to me that the one and only object of a parish council will be to secure for its particular parish the greatest possible volume of public assistance.  It has got no other interest.  It has not to provide the money.  It is simply there to spend money&mdash;and to see that the greatest possible amount of it that is available is brought into its particular area, so that the local persons may receive the greatest benefit.  That seems to me to be altogether contrary to any proper system of local government: that any body of persons who have no responsibility to anybody should be empowered to spend public money without having to account in any way for their actions.  If the Minister had not expressed his willingness to accept, in principle, the provisions for annulment, I think the matter would have been very much worse. Under the Bill, as it stands, with this amendment, an approved local council, once it is set up will be there for ever, and will go on spending public assistance money <i>ad infinitum.</i>  I think that is a very bad principle to introduce. It is surely quite contrary to what is normally understood by representative local government.  I move to report progress.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I move the Second Reading of the Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill.  The object of it, as is apparent from the title, is to provide better machinery than is extant <Col N="1932" /> at the moment in the provisions of the Constitution to safeguard the independence of the judiciary.  I should like to say, on my own behalf and, I think, also on behalf of Deputy Dillon, at the outset, that the introduction of this Bill is in no way intended to be in the nature of a criticism of the Minister for Justice in connection with his handling of the situation that arose in connection with a recent judicial problem. I want to make that perfectly clear.  While, to some extent, the circumstances of that case have given rise to the introduction of this Bill, yet it is not to be taken as in any way reflecting on the conduct of that affair by the Minister for Justice.  I am perfectly satisfied that whatever differences we, on this side of the House, had with the Minister were due, to a very large extent, if not entirely, to misunderstanding.  I think that the circumstances of that occasion do give rise to grave misgiving as to the effectiveness of the existing machinery in the Constitution.  We have now only very few days within which the Constitution may be amended by ordinary legislation, and we think that a matter of this kind is more properly dealt with by an ordinary Bill in this House, while the law permits it, than by the elaborate machinery of referring the matter to the people for amendment under the Constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The traditional method of securing the independence of the judiciary has, of course, always been to provide that a judge shall not be removable except by both Houses of the Legislative Assembly.  That method has been effective largely because there have been very few occasions on which the power of removal has been exercised.  Once such a power of removal has been exercised in a given case, it will almost certainly follow that the effectiveness of the guarantee will cease.  While removal by both Houses of a Legislative Assembly is regarded, from the point of view of tradition, as a great safeguard of the independence of the judiciary, familiarity breeds contempt, and once the thing has been tried out and it has been seen how easy it is, in fact, to operate, then the tendency <Col N="1933" /> will be, we fear, to operate it with greater and greater frequency.  Recent events do, I think, show that there is a problem to be solved.  There are two sets of facts to be considered: one is where a judge is guilty of misbehaviour or misconduct, and the other where he is incapacitated.  The same remedy is provided in the Constitution for both these sets of facts.  The problem to be solved by this complicated machinery is entirely different when it consists of misbehaviour rather than of mere incapacity. Under the system obtaining here at the moment, we have in the Dáil machinery of Government depending upon the Party system.  We have, therefore, the position that the Government is dependent for its life upon the majority of the House.  Under the system of election to the Seanad, it must necessarily follow that whatever Party, or combination of Parties, has a majority in the Dáil must have a majority in the Seanad.  The only possible safeguard of this principle of the independence of the judiciary, while the existing constitutional position remains, would be if the Seanad were differently constituted from the Dáil.  While the Dáil and Seanad are similarly constituted the safeguard has no real validity whatever.</P>
    <P>Once the existing machinery in the Constitution for removal of a judge is tested and it is found easy to operate, the tendency will be, or may be&mdash;I do not say for a moment that, with this Government, it will be, but we have to look to the future as well as to the present&mdash;to utilise that machinery more and more.  There is always the tendency for Governments whose policy, perhaps, is of such a character as to bring them, from time to time, into conflict with the law to be restive and irritable when legal decisions and judicial opinions and pronouncements hamper their operations and the working of their policy.  I think it is generally admitted&mdash;it is certainly admitted by all Parties in this House&mdash;as a fundamental principle that there should be some constitutional safeguard for the independence of the judiciary.  It is essential in a State such as we live in that that principle should be very carefully safeguarded. <Col N="1934" /> I think, as I say, all Parties are of the same mind on that principle.  We think that the principle has been shown to have considerable weakness as it stands at the moment in the Constitution.</P>
    <P>The Bill introduced by Deputy Dillon and myself is merely an effort by way of suggestion to provide a more adequate safeguard for the principle of the independence of the judiciary than exists at the moment.  I am not wedded to the plan that is in the Bill. It is merely put forward in my view as the high-water mark.  Views have been expressed to me, in fact, that the system in this Bill is a bad system from the point of view of safeguarding particular branches of the judiciary. The Bill is intended to cover all branches of the judiciary from the lowest to the highest.  As matters stand at the moment district justices are not within the constitutional provisions, nor are the circuit judges. District justices are subject to the Disciplinary Committee that was imported into the law by the Courts of Justice Act, 1936.  At that time I objected very strongly to setting up a committee which was designed to inquire into the conduct of district justices.  Anything that has since happened has merely confirmed me in the view I expressed then.  The circuit judges have no Disciplinary Committee, but I imagine it will be only a matter of time until some Government conceives the idea that as they have got some control over district justices through the Disciplinary Committee, it would be an advisable thing, from the official point of view, that some control should also be established over another branch of the judiciary, the circuit judges, by some similar committee. Then the process of eating into the principle of independence of the judiciary will go from district justices to circuit justices, from circuit judges to High Court judges and from High Court judges to judges of the Supreme Court, until the erosion into the system will crumble the whole structure.</P>
    <P>The provisions of this Bill contemplate that district justices, Circuit Court judges, High Court judges and Supreme Court judges should all get <Col N="1935" /> the same constitutional privileges.  I can appreciate the official point of view which displays irritation when a district justice fines somebody 2/6 who, the Department thinks, should get six months.  Perhaps a cumulative series of matters of that kind lead to the official attitude that these district justices are lacking in their duty and require some gingering-up and that the only way they can be gingered-up is by officials in the Department of Justice or some other Department.  I have always expressed the view that no Government can be sure of getting the best person for a particular judicial position, no matter what care is taken in the selection or no matter what the machinery of selection is.  At the present time, the machinery of selection is very largely based upon political considerations. It may or may not be a very bad system.  No system will ensure that the best man for the particular position will be picked, however much the Government may try, but whatever care is taken and whatever the system is, once the man is appointed you have to lump it.  He may turn out very good, very indifferently or extremely badly, but good, bad or indifferent he has to be accepted.  That is the only way in which the public interest, taking the long view, can be served.</P>
    <P>With that approach towards this problem I have always taken the view, even irritated, as I have been frequently, by judicial decisions and pronouncements, that the matter has to be approached along the lines I have stated.  A judge once he is appointed has to be given the status, the respect and the privileges with which the Constitution provides him.  Now, the question is, how best can this principle be safeguarded in future, because we are now faced with the last possible occasion on which this matter may be dealt with?  We are, in my view, committed to the system that exists in the Constitution as long as the present Constitution lasts, if we do not take any measures now to reinforce the safeguards which are in the existing Constitution.  As it stands at the moment, a political majority of one in this House and a political majority of one in the Seanad, can remove any <Col N="1936" /> judge.  I do not think that is a system that can be justifiably defended.</P>
    <P>It can only be defended on the basis that it is the traditional method, the method we got from the British unwritten Constitution, the method that had its validity merely from the fact that it was a power that was never exercised, or exercised only on two or three occasions in the whole history of the judiciary in the last 140 or 150 years.  I think in this country there has been only one occasion when a judge has been removed from office and then he was only removed after his conduct had been inquired into by an independent commission that had been set up. That system is based on political expediency, if it is looked at in its naked defencelessness.  It can only have any validity if there is general agreement amongst all Parties that resort should not be had to the removal of a judge except in the last extreme.  I doubt very much whether that principle will get practical recognition in the years to come in this country.  For that reason we are anxious that there should be some additional safeguard&mdash; not necessarily those we have suggested in this Bill&mdash;provided in the Constitution before it becomes as rigid as it will be in the course of a few weeks.</P>
    <P>The machinery that is proposed in this Bill is a two-third majority of both Houses, the Dáil and the Seanad.  It is also proposed that, before such a vote is taken by either House, the matter should be inquired into by the Supreme Court and an opinion given by that court.  A person who is charged with misconduct will then have an opportunity of making his defence.  A person who is alleged to be incapacitated may be able, if given an opportunity, to demonstrate the fact that within a short time he will be able completely to perform judicial functions or that within a short space of time there is a reasonable probability that he will recover all his faculties. Under the existing system there is nothing necessary to secure the removal of a judge but a vote of the Oireachtas, and if the Government recommends that a judge should be removed, that recommendation must be <Col N="1937" /> accepted by both Houses, otherwise the Government would have to fall.  I think that is a principle that should not be accepted in present circumstances.  I am very adverse to the system that is in vogue at the moment under the Courts of Justice Act of 1936 in reference to district justices and I would be still more strongly opposed to any proposal to extend that system.  At the same time, there is the problem that a judge who is about to be removed either for misconduct or incapacity, should in accordance with the ordinary principles of natural justice be given some sort of opportunity of making his case or his defence, if defence be needed.  There is no such machinery in existence in the present constitutional provision.</P>
    <P>The proposal in this Bill, that the matter should be inquired into by the Supreme Court, is an effort to suggest an appropriate tribunal where the question of capacity or incapacity, misconduct or innocence can be independently investigated before the matter is adjudicated upon by both Houses of the Legislative Assembly.  As I said at the start, I am not wedded to that system.  I regard the provisions of this Bill as perhaps the high-water mark of safeguarding the principle.  I would not be opposed to any reasonable suggestions that might differ in detail, provided the principle was fully recognised, that it should be difficult to remove a judge for misconduct or incapacity, that it should not be dependent upon a mere political majority in both Houses as it is at the moment and that, above all, there should be some machinery which would be of an independent character and which would give the person affected an opportunity of making his case and putting forward his defence, before he was tried in an atmosphere perhaps of political prejudice.</P>

      <P>I especially adopt the last words used by Deputy Costello.  I need hardly say that I entirely agree with all he said in introducing the Bill, but he dwelt for some moments, in conclusion, on the fact that he was not wedded particularly to the terms of the Bill, but was merely concerned for an explicit vindication of the principle <Col N="1938" /> underlying it.  Personally, my attitude in regard to this Bill is that I am not so deeply concerned to do something positive as to prevent the doing of something in the hereafter. The purpose which I feel this Bill serves is to direct the attention of the Oireachtas to a danger in the years to come of the independence of the judiciary being slowly frittered away, and my concern is to get some provision inserted in the Constitution which will make it impossible for anybody of ill will, in the times to come, to attack the independence of the judiciary, without going to the trouble of amending the Constitution and thereby directing public attention to the fact that he is concerned to make an attack upon the principle of the independence of the judiciary.  I feel that particularly because I am profoundly convinced that one of the greatest guarantees of a peaceful commonwealth is the assurance of the humblest citizen that there is a tribunal in existence in the State before which, in defence of his rights, he shall be equal to the mightiest in the land, including the Government itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I must only beg Deputies to believe that I am not in the slightest degree concerned to open up old sores in a matter of this kind, but we all remember times of fairly petulant and tumultuous political activity in this country, and I can remember as responsible a Deputy as Deputy Smith, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach, referring in terms of considerable indignation to &ldquo;these old men&rdquo; standing in the way of the steps necessary to preserve the public peace at the time. I suppose Deputy Smith was speaking in good faith, and under the stress of great emotion, but I remember feeling equally that, but for &ldquo;these old men&rdquo;, the Taoiseach would have us all in jail, and it was a source of considerable consolation to me that he was still sufficiently wet behind the ears in the office of Taoiseach that he did not dare to square off to the whole judiciary.  Deputy Smith seemed to think it was high time he did, and I must say that I think we kept the peace to the credit of us all in that time, because we felt that ultimately the rule <Col N="1939" /> of law was supreme in this State, and even those amongst us who were most convinced that the Taoiseach was an irresponsible and dangerous person were liable to say in times of stress: &ldquo;In any case, one thing we can say about the country is that there is still the rule of law,&rdquo; and when one spoke of the rule of law, it was indissolubly associated in one&rsquo;s mind with the independence of the judiciary.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Costello very effectively points out, we inherited from the British the guarantee of the judiciary which is inherent in the unwritten Constitution of Great Britain and dependent on the bare vote of two Houses.  When Saorstát Eireann was first set up, the Government of that day deliberately conspired to make the Seanad somewhat different in its personnel from the Dáil.  The Dáil was a purely representative Assembly, elected by the people on a popular vote, while the Seanad was deliberately established to represent elements in the community which could not reasonably expect to get much representation on a popular vote, and there was carried into our new Constitution something of the differentiation between the House of Lords, a non-representative body, in Great Britain, and the House of Commons, which was broadly representative. But, as Deputy Costello points out, a long-established tradition is, in itself, a great safeguard until it has been once broken.  The moment the necessity arises for departing from that long-established tradition, the danger is that further and further encroachments will be made until eventually the whole principle, once safeguarded by the tradition, will be eaten away.</P>
    <P>While entirely subscribing to Deputy Costello's opening observations, in the course of which he said that this Bill must not be taken in any sense as a criticism of the handling by the Minister for Justice of the recent judicial matter which had to be disposed of, it is true that once the question of removing a judge by resolution was adumbrated in this House and resulted ultimately in that judge retiring, we saw&mdash;and I am bound to speak bluntly <Col N="1940" /> because tact must not forbid references to real danger&mdash;that, within a month, a State solicitor got up in court and told a district justice that if he did not conduct himself better, he would report him to the Attorney-General.  At once, as prudent men, they realised that an exchange of that kind in public court was unbecoming; they made suitable reparation to one another, and the incident was closed; but remember that it was not closed to the country people who listened to it.  Here was a case of a judge going to be removed by Dáil Eireann, and, within a month of it, other judicial persons being told that if they did not conduct themselves on the bench, steps would be taken to civilise them.</P>
    <P>Remember that we are concerned to persuade not only ourselves but our people that the judiciary is sacrosanct, and that no matter how big the man is who attacks you, the judge on the bench is a bigger man, if right is on the side of the little man.  How can the little man be persuaded of that, if he once believes that, should a judge do something that vexes de Valera, by a simple Party vote of the Fianna Fáil Party, that judge can be kicked off the bench?  It may seem quite unlikely to us who are accustomed to Parliamentary procedure that such a thing could conceivably occur, but, in honesty, let us ask ourselves the question: would it not have been quite possible for some of us in 1933, if we really allowed our tempers to run away with us, to proceed to deal with the &ldquo;old men&rdquo; who were making the enforcement of the law then, as it appeared to the Government, so extremely difficult?  Fortunately, things never went so far, but it would have been very easy for them to go so far.  Can we bank with assurance on the restraint, born, I think, of a good deal of bitter experience in this House, to save the situation again in the future?</P>
    <P>Look at what happened in the United States of America recently when a clash took place between the Executive and the Supreme Court.  There you had the head of one of the greatest democracies introducing a Bill to wipe out the Supreme Court by the introduction of new individuals simply because the <Col N="1941" /> Executive had grown impatient of an independent judiciary.  The profound feeling of a great people checked that attempt on the part of perhaps one of the most popular leaders in the world, but still, there you had a great and influential man&mdash;and, one might say, perhaps as level-headed a man as there is in the world, the President of the United States&mdash;making up his mind that if the courts continued to block his path, he would sweep them away. It was the Constitution saved them, and but for the fact that there was a deep-seated conviction in the hearts of the people that you ought not lightly to interefere with the provisions of the Constitution of the Republic of the United States of America, the Supreme Court of the United States would have been swept away and something else put in its stead that would do, at that hour, what happened to be for the moment the will of the Executive.</P>
    <P>There is some confusion of thought when people come to reflect upon constitutional problems.  I am a bit unorthodox about constitutions.  There are some pious souls in the world who look upon written constitutions as a sort of insurance against revolution. I do not think they are anything of the kind.  I think that if people are going to &ldquo;revolute&rdquo; it would not worry them very much tearing up anybody&rsquo;s constitution&mdash;I never believed it would&mdash;but constitutional provisions, designed to protect the individual citizen against the Executive, whatever that Executive may be, may have great value indeed, and it is because of that character in this proposal that I believe it so valuable.  I do not believe that if the whole State is going to be overthrown by some future compulsion, it matters in the least what we put in this Constitution, but it matters a great deal that, if we have in the Constitution that a judge cannot be removed from office without the virtual assent of the whole Legislature then every man in this State will know that if the Executive of the day seeks to tyrannise over him or to deny him his constitutional rights, there is a tribunal there which has the power and the independence to tell the Government&mdash;in <Col N="1942" /> the vernacular&mdash;where to get off.</P>
    <P>I suppose some Deputies in the House would be a little embarrassed by these references to the immediate past, but I think we can learn from the past. Do Deputies remember the stormy days when gentlemen opposite were clapping us in jail and we were getting writs of <i>habeas corpus</i> every 24 hours until we had their heads reeling? Do they not realise how valuable that was and how often the lid might have boiled off but for the conviction that was carried to every element that no matter how often the Government appeared to us to be acting unjustly, the judiciary could be invoked and that the Government would give way, and that no situation could ever arise in which a judge would be afraid to do his duty? If the Government agree with me that that fact contributed materially to the preservation of the public peace, will they not also agree with the contention of Deputy Costello that an old tradition, albeit carried over from another dispensation, is in itself a great guarantee when the public attention is arrested by the facility with which the machinery for removing a judge can be set in motion?  Will they not agree with us that once that first incursion is being made, a great part of the value of the old tradition is gone?  The divinity that doth hedge a king is somewhat gone, so people return to the charge very much more lightly, and the course they are embarked upon suggests itself to the people&rsquo;s minds very much more readily than it ever would have done if the necessity for recourse to it had never arisen at all.</P>
    <P>If these facts be true, surely it is desirable that we should ensure for the future to substitute something for the age-old tradition which has served us so well?  I do not care what the guarantee is or what form it takes, so long as it is effective and so long as it provides against one thing and one thing only, and that is the doubt that might creep into the people&rsquo;s minds that the judges on the bench would hold their office at the pleasure of the Executive of the day.  That is the present position, in fact.  I think the <Col N="1943" /> public mind is awake to it now, and I do not think I would be right if, from a sense of delicacy, I refrained from painting the greatest evils that can arise.  Who amongst us who has lived in America has not had the experience of making the comparison in his mind between the municipal judge and the federal judge?  There, the municipal judge is a person who holds his office by the pleasure of the electorate. The federal judge is a life appointee who is regarded as virtually irremovable.  It is common talk that if you go before the municipal judge the verdict depends on the length of your purse, and that if you go before a federal judge the verdict depends on the merit of your case.  Now, my apprehension&mdash;one of many apprehensions that I at present feel&mdash;with regard to the present position, is this. As Deputy Costello points out, no matter how you pick your judges, they are not all going to be winners.</P>
    <P>You are going to get a certain proportion of disappointments.  Suppose the impression went abroad that interested parties could report judges to the Attorney-General and that there was any danger of action following on that, is there not serious danger that a weak judge, whose conscience, perhaps, was not altogether clear, might seek to make friends with the Mammon of Iniquity: that if he felt that he had given offence in a quarter, which might result in representations being made to the Executive for his removal, he might think it worth his while to conciliate another influential quarter in order to offset the influential person whom he had aggrieved? If that practice began to manifest itself, mark well that it would arise from the sense of insecurity in the judiciary itself.  I do not apprehend that it would happen to-morrow, I do not apprehend that it would happen next year, but I am looking forward to the long view of the road which the judiciary might travel, were their independence ever rendered insecure; and accepting Deputy Costello's thesis that what was an adequate safeguard in the past ceases to be that, once the machinery <Col N="1944" /> for removal is made to work, I take the long view of whither the judiciary may tend in this country, and I apprehend that once its security was seriously jeopardised it might travel the road of the municipal judiciary in America, and God forbid that any such system could ever obtain here.</P>
    <P>I want that independence, that absolute independence, restored.  I do not think that anybody in this House can contest the desirability of having an independent judiciary.  I do not think anybody in this House would contend for a moment that a judiciary, depending for its tenure on the vote of a bare majority of the Deputies present in the House, is a secure judiciary.  I do not believe for a moment that Deputies will believe that a judiciary, dependent for the retention of their office on the will of the present Taoiseach, is a secure judiciary because&mdash;let us face the facts&mdash;if the present Taoiseach introduces a motion to remove any judge on the bench, there is not a member of the Fianna Fáil Party that would dare stay out of the Lobby.  If the Taoiseach arrived in and said: &ldquo;Now, boys, either Judge So-and-so goes or I go; you can take your choice,&rdquo; there is not a single one amongst you&mdash;and you know it in your hearts&mdash;that would not shake his head and say: &ldquo;If we have to choose between Dev. and that &lsquo;ould cod&rsquo; it will be Dev.&rdquo;&mdash;and out the &ldquo;ould cod&rdquo; would go.  Is it not true?  Search your own hearts&mdash;is it not true?  But if some more prudent member of the Executive Council drew the Taoiseach aside and said: &ldquo;Maybe you can bring the sheep in to vote for shifting the &lsquo;ould cod&rsquo;, but if you cannot get the two-thirds majority there is no use in going into the House because Cosgrave&rsquo;s men are not sheep and they will not do your bidding,&rdquo; then the judiciary would be truly independent.</P>

      <P>The &ldquo;ould cod&rdquo; stays, exactly.  There is the very essence of it, the &ldquo;ould cod&rdquo; stays.  The fact that he is invested with a judicial function in this country renders his position secure on the bench, and because he was a good judge yesterday, <Col N="1945" /> because he did what the Prime Minister wanted him to do, but an &ldquo;ould cod&rdquo; to-morrow because he refused to do what the Prime Minister wanted him to do, he is still a judge, no matter what the Taoiseach thinks he is&mdash;an &ldquo;ould cod&rdquo; or a Solomon come to judgment&mdash;and, as such, is sacrosanct and cannot be touched.  Deputy Norton puts his finger on it.  A judge is a sacrosanct person so long as he agrees with the Taoiseach, but an &ldquo;ould cod&rdquo; the moment he disagrees with him.  Let us not dwell too much on the present occupant of the office of Taoiseach, but think of his successors, those who may reach his eminence in times to come.  Suppose one of them took that view, that a judge was an &ldquo;ould cod&rdquo; because he did not agree with the Taoiseach of the day and the Taoiseach of the day thought that the Leader of the Labour Party would be better in Mountjoy than abroad, and the judge was an &ldquo;ould cod&rdquo; because he did not agree with him and kept granting writs of <i>habeas corpus</i>, would it not be good to know that, when the Taoiseach of the day desired to keep the Leader of the Labour Party in Mountjoy, he was unable to get rid of the &ldquo;ould cod&rdquo; because he could not get two-thirds of Dáil Eireann to help him to do it?  Is that not the position?</P>

      <P>Surely the essence of <i>habeas corpus</i> is that there should be an independent judiciary to order the Executive to release a person whom the Executive thinks ought to be behind bars?  If you make a judge&rsquo;s tenure of office dependent on the pleasure of that Executive, it makes it more difficult for him to vindicate the liberty of the individual who appeals to him for protection. Surely that must be obvious?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All we say in support of this Bill is that we are not wedded to the terms of the Bill, but we are concerned to ensure that the judge who hands down a writ of <i>habeas corpus</i> ordering the Executive to undo that which they have done, to release that citizen whom they want to detain, shall be rendered absolutely <Col N="1946" /> immune from interference by way of dismissal or removal by the Executive which he has set at defiance. That is all we are concerned with, nothing else, and any machinery which will effect that, whether it corresponds with this Bill or otherwise, is perfectly acceptable.  Surely that is something Deputy Norton is as concerned to ensure as we are&mdash;or is it?  I cannot think of any free man having two minds about such a question.  What we are concerned with can be simplified to this.  We are anxious to ensure that the judge who hands down a writ of <i>habeas corpus</i> directed to the Executive to deliver the body of a person whom they seek illegally to detain should be immune from interference by the Executive.  That is all we ask for, and any machinery the Government devise to give effect to that principle will be acceptable to Deputy Costello and myself.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I imagine that when Deputy Dillon and Deputy Costello read this Bill in its printed form they were rather startled by the extent to which they were endeavouring to commit the Legislature to amend the Constitution in pursuance of their desire to render the judiciary independent of possible punitive Executive action, because Deputy Costello said that, while desiring to preserve the independence of the judiciary, he realised, at once, that this was the high-water mark of such independence.  It is just there that the Bill is objectionable, because in an effort perhaps to give the judges a greater measure of independence than they have, it seems the authors of the Bill have overstepped the mark, and, in a desire to give the judges a greater measure of independence, they want to tie the hands of the Executive&mdash;whatever Executive may be in power&mdash;and prevent them dealing with any case where action is obviously called for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Costello's amending Bill provides that before you can remove a judge for stated misbehaviour or obvious incapacity you have first to get a majority of the Supreme Court and nothing can be done unless you get a majority.  In other words, you ask five judges of the Supreme Court to sit in <Col N="1947" /> judgment perhaps on a judge of the High Court, a colleague and personal friend of theirs, one of the same vocation as themselves.  That is the first trial body.  Before you can get any verdict against the judge through the Legislature you must get a majority of the judge&rsquo;s own colleagues to agree that it is desirable to remove him for stated misbehaviour or obvious incapacity. I do not think it is right that judges should be permitted to sit in judgment in that manner on a colleague.  I do not think it is suitable machinery.  Human feelings being what they are, and human frailties being what we know them to be, you are quite unlikely to get a majority verdict in favour of the removal of the judge, no matter how obvious his incapacity may be, and no matter how great his misbehaviour may be.</P>
    <P>I think one of the defects in the Bill is that it proposes to set up in order to try a judge a body that is not, by the vocation of its members, a suitable body to try an offence of that character. Even if you could convince a tribunal of that kind that the judge was, in fact, guilty of such misbehaviour as warranted his removal, you then have to go to both Houses of the Oireachtas and get a two-thirds majority of the entire membership of each House.  Let us examine how the thing would work out in this House. We have had important Bills under discussion here during the past few weeks and approximately 90 Deputies participated in the divisions.  In order, therefore, to remove a judge, so far as this House is concerned it will not be sufficient to get two-thirds of 90 Deputies. If 90 Deputies were present out of the total membership of 138, every one of the 90 would have to vote for the removal of the judge.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Costello is, I am sure, an old Parliamentarian in matters of this kind and, being quite a skilful legal advocate, must know perfectly well that the case which was put up to-day in support of this Bill was built largely on fanciful fears.  He tried to make provision against a possibility that might happen but that is very far remote from probability. Even if the Deputy reads his speech he will see that he was guarding against a possibility, and from that foundation he built what, I am sure, he felt was a gigantic superstructure but that had no foundation.  It was the best case that could be made for the Bill.  It was not a good case, bearing in mind our long-standing practice with regard to the independence of judges.  Neither Deputy Costello nor Deputy Dillon quoted a single case to show that the Bill was necessary in fact in order to give judges a greater measure of independence than they have to-day.  Deputy Dillon made reference to one recent case.  Probably the less said about that case the better.  One thing it did establish, and that was, that the Minister for Justice, in my opinion, dealt with that case with infinite patience, with perhaps a patience that was not wholly justified in the circumstances.  That is a matter I do not want to go into.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, Deputy Dillon used the case to say that the introduction of a motion was followed afterwards by an impudent outburst in a district court by a State solicitor.  We have impudent outbursts by solicitors and also criticism of the Legislature by district justices.  Both are to be deplored.  It seems to me that one way to undermine the independence of the judiciary is the irresponsible statements made by some district justices; statements that are calculated to disturb the natural reverence which people ought to have for the independence of the judiciary.  When you get people deciding legal points, not according to law but by a condition of mental seediness, it seems to me you are doing much <Col N="1949" /> more violence to the independence of the judges than any provision in the present Constitution does to undermine the independence of the judiciary. I do not think any case has been made in support of the Bill.  I do not think our practice for the past 20 years justifies any suggestion that it is the desire of any Party to interfere with the independence of the judiciary. It seems to me that the best kind of independence which the judiciary could get would be the type of independence which they get from knowing that all Parties in this State subscribe to the idea that judges, as long as they are not guilty of misbehaviour&mdash;and in respect of a judge the misbehaviour must be obvious&mdash;they will continue to enjoy the confidence of the country and, at the same time, be free from possible punitive action by the Administration in office.</P>
    <P>There is one point we ought to consider. While Deputy Dillon talked about the need for safeguards for the independence of the judiciary, which is desirable, we ought not to carry it to the point that the State will have no safeguard.  Deputy Dillon said that he did not want judges holding office at the will and pleasure of some people.  Neither do I want them holding office in that way, if it means keeping the whip off the judges&rsquo; position, but we do not want to carry that to the stage that a judge will hold office to the displeasure of the entire community.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>In balancing things one must consider which is the worst. Deputy Dillon compels us to keep a majority of the judge&rsquo;s own colleagues as vocational relatives, I might say, to find him guilty, and then to have a two-thirds majority of both Houses&mdash; which is not a 66 per cent. vote, but, in fact, a substantially higher percentage vote&mdash;in favour of removing a judge. The mistake that has been made in this matter is that in endeavouring to give judges a greater measure of security the State is simply given no security.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I will come to that. The weakness of the Bill is that in endeavouring to protect the State you are giving the State no security against a judge when he is off the rails and, in addition, even in the case of district justices&mdash;some of whom have not distinguished themselves by the prudence of their utterances, but, as everybody knows, brought discredit on their colleagues&mdash;in this Bill we are going to take district justices into our arms and ensure that notwithstanding a tradition of intemperate utterances by some of them, they can go on and be as intemperate as they like, feeling that in future they have to be found guilty by a majority of the Supreme Court and by a two-thirds majority of the entire Dáil and Seanad before their removal.  Even Deputy Dillon will realise that that is really carrying matters to extremes.  It is undesirable that a judge considered to be guilty of misbehaviour should hear of that misbehaviour in the form of a motion for his removal in both Houses.  I would prefer if some type of tribunal were set up to inform the judge of the nature of the case against him, to enable him to bring evidence in his own favour for the purpose of a verdict, and then to have action by the Executive.  It might transpire that a tribunal of that kind would see the matter in a different light from that in which it appeared to the Executive, and possibly machinery should be devised to meet the situation.</P>

      <P>I am of opinion that in the endeavour to give judges a greater measure of security Deputy Dillon and Deputy Costello have gone very much further than they intended to go.  If the intention was to strengthen their hands it ought to be reasonable, and one that would give the State some safeguard against the possibility of a judge systematically misbehaving, <Col N="1951" /> while at the same time giving reasonable security to judges against punitive action by an Administration.  This Bill does not do that.  If I were a judge, having read the Bill, I do not think I would ask for any greater security than judges have.  The Legislature has to take a balanced view between what judges want for their safety, and what the Legislature is reasonably entitled to hold for itself in the interests of the community it serves.  The Bill has been drafted to make the position of judges almost impregnable against the State, and to give them a status and a power which might make it quite impossible for the State to ensure that law was administered in the manner that every fair-minded person wants to have it administered.  If Deputy Costello had aimed, not at the high-water mark but at the fair-water mark he might have got support for the Bill.  He would certainly have got it from this Party. That might have commended the Bill even to the Government Party.  The Bill has been drafted too widely, and if passed in this form would give the State no reasonable safeguard against the possibility of judges misbehaving themselves and doing so with impunity and with a Constitutional guarantee in respect of a continuance of that misconduct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one thing quite clear from the speeches that were made, and that is that there is common agreement on the principle that it is right that the judiciary should be independent, that a judge in performing his duties should be in such a position that he can do so without fear or favour.  The only difference between us is the question how that independence can best be secured.  My own belief is that it is sufficiently secured as the position stands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is the question of machinery to be considered, but, fundamentally, the independence of the judges is already secured by the fact that a judge, once he is appointed and once he conducts himself cannot be removed at all, because a case for his removal has to be made. It has to be proved before a wide representation <Col N="1952" /> in Parliament&mdash;before a jury of that sort&mdash;that he has not behaved properly, that he has been guilty of misbehaviour or else that he suffers from incapacity&mdash;that he is not able to perform his duties for some physical reason.  That is the provision in the present Constitution.  It is precisely the provision that was in the Constitution of 1922.  In that Constitution a judge could not be removed except for stated misbehaviour or incapacity, and then only by a vote of the two Houses.  That is the present position. There is no doubt whatever about it.  There has been no change.  During the short period when we had only a Single Chamber Legislature a change was made.  In that case, I think a majority of four-sevenths was required before a judge could be removed.  That was done to meet the view that something more than a mere majority was required.  I think I am right in my recollection when I say that, on that occasion, a case was made for a Second Chamber by Deputy McGilligan on the basis that a rigid figure like four-sevenths could work out badly.  It might be slightly too small or slightly too great.  The case was made that it would be very much better, instead of having a rigid fixed number of that sort, to have two Houses.  I confess that it was one of the few real uses that I saw for a Second Chamber: that if we had not a Second Chamber we would be forced to have rigid rules in connection with certain offices of that kind so as to prevent a mere majority of the elected representatives from being in a position to have their way too easily in matters in which it was desirable that there should be a check.</P>
    <P>We now have two Houses, and, therefore, we are back again to the original position.  It has been suggested here that the Second House is not now as different in complexion from the First House as it was in the past. Well, I beg leave to differ from that. When we were in opposition we certainly did not believe that there was very much difference between the votes that would have been cast for any particular proposition in the Second House and the votes that would have been cast for it in the First House.  We felt that the Executive, which had a <Col N="1953" /> majority in one House, was almost certain to have a majority in the other. Of course, with the change of Government, it might not have been so.  The suggestion now is that then you had the chance that the Second House might not be of the same complexion: that a resolution that you might get passed through the First House might not pass through the Second in a certain set of circumstances, but when the majority in the Second House happened to be the same as the majority in the Dáil, it was a different matter.  If, however, there was a change of Government, it might not have been so, so that the protection, so to speak, of the Second House only existed for a certain time following a change of Government.</P>
    <P>I think that the composition and general character of what the Seanad is likely to be has been misunderstood completely, or misrepresented, perhaps. It is not always remembered that nomination to it is from vocational groups: that, though the Dáil and local bodies are the final electorate, nevertheless, they can only elect those who have been nominated.  Therefore, if those nominating the groups do their duty in providing from amongst themselves the best and most independent types they can find to represent their views, irrespective of Party, you will have a Second House which may, on that account, be different from the First House.  There is as good a chance, at any rate, that you will have it for one-half of the time as there was under the other system.  Consequently, I think no good case has been made at all on the basis that such a change has been made in the constitution of the Second House as to render it of no value as a check upon, or addition to, the First House in regard to matters to be considered.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question of the independence of the judiciary, that is a principle that is generally accepted. It is accepted not merely in this country but in Britain, America and in the other countries that have been referred to.  The principle of absolute irremovability has not been found to work in practice anywhere.  Whilst in <Col N="1954" /> theory everybody agrees with the idea of the independence of the judiciary, so also, in practice, every country realises that there are cases when judges ought, in the public interest, to be removed, and provision has to be made for those cases.  Deputy Dillon&rsquo;s argument is that once you use any of these provisions you indicate a way, a method which will be followed, and that there will be an abuse of the power it gives. I suppose, to a certain extent, the road is indicated to the public, and there is a temptation for the time being to follow it, but, after all, the considerations which make the community value the independence of the judiciary will also be a check on any abuse of any method there may be in order to save the community from any dangers that it would have to face if judges were continued on when clearly they ought not to be judges.</P>
    <P>To come back then to the position. At present a judge can only be removed by a vote, first in the Dáil and, secondly, in the Seanad on a motion in which the incapacity will be stated, or else the misbehaviour. These must be stated.  I do not think that, in the period we have been here, there has been a suggestion from any side that the judges were in a position in which they were not independent. There has not been any suggestion of that.  In fact, I was greatly surprised at the introduction of this Bill at all. Then, as regards the recent case&mdash;I do not want to deal with it&mdash;it seems to me that it certainly was not one which would have justified any fears that there was going to be any abuse, or that the matter was introduced in an arbitrary way.  What did appear, of course, immediately to everybody was that there should be some sort of machinery in order to make this process work effectively and fairly. Everybody realised that, if we had to go on with that case and if the Dáil had to deal with the resolution, there would necessarily have to be some prior inquiry.  If the matter had proceeded, my suggestion would have been to set up a select committee of the House, consisting of members of all Parties, to examine this particular case, hear whatever evidence was to be given by <Col N="1955" /> those making the complaint and afford an opportunity to the person affected to appear directly, or by representative, in his own defence.  Some machinery in that regard will have to be devised but I do think that, on the whole, Parliament was wise in not devising that machinery in advance.  It was much better to regard this as a thing which was most unlikely to happen&mdash;something not so likely to happen as to justify the devising of machinery for it.  If the time comes when it is vital to devise that machinery, we can sit down and do so.  The Dáil can devise its own machinery under its Standing Orders or a resolution could be brought in, such as that which was brought in recently, providing for a special committee of inquiry. If it would shorten the process, we could have a select committee of the two Houses.  That would be quite feasible.</P>

      <P>Would the Taoiseach consider the question of a committee on the lines of the Public Accounts Committee, on which the Government has not the preponderance that it has on ordinary committees of the House?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>If I myself were bringing in a motion such as that with which we were faced a short time ago, believing there was a case in which action was to be taken for one sole purpose&mdash;the public interest&mdash;and that it would be advisable to have our hands strengthened, I would be in favour of a committee on which it could not be said the Government had a preponderance. I should be quite content&mdash;and I think, for general purposes, it would be very much better&mdash;to leave it to a committee of the two Houses, which could be selected in the usual way.  It is a very common practice to stress the sins of the majority Party but it is quite possible to imagine a minority guilty of the things of which we are supposed to be guilty.  Party feeling and Party prejudice do not lie completely on one side.  Consequently, you might have a case in which a small minority&mdash;one-third of the members, for instance&mdash;would interfere with the <Col N="1956" /> public interest and act in the opposite direction to that in which it is suggested the majority might act&mdash;that is to say, when a judge should be removed, by abstention from the meeting or, otherwise, preventing the removal taking place.</P>
      <P>Let us be honest and straight in regard to this matter.  I do not want to say anything against judges.  They have a very difficult task, but we all know that they are human beings and we know that human beings are all the better for having someone to keep an eye on them.  The public does that, but the public, of itself, cannot take action.  It is equally important that the reputation of the judges should be high with the community as the reputation of individuals in other institutions of the State.  From one point of view, it is more important, as they are out on their own.  The fate of a particular case depends on their judgment, honesty and capacity.  When you have 50 or 60 individuals, as we have, in that position, it is quite possible&mdash;taking averages, it is quite likely&mdash;that, now and again, you will have judges who will not be fully alive to the responsibilities of their position and will not, in fact, do their duty as they should do it in the public interest. It is well that, if things are not right, there should be power somewhere to bring them to book.  Consequently, it is wise that there should be some method of dealing with a judge who is either physically incapable of doing his work or, for one reason or another, is neglecting it or is careless of his responsibilities. You want to have that power but you want, at the same time, to make it difficult to bring this power to bear, so that it will not be abused, so that, if an Executive finds that some public policy in which it is interested is somehow being checked by judicial decisions, it will not immediately resolve to use this machinery to get rid of the judge who is imposing the check.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think that we are always fair to representative institutions in our speeches in this House.  I think that, taking human beings as they are, on the whole, our representative institutions do their duty by the public and <Col N="1957" /> are responsible bodies.  I do not think that it is right to talk about sheep and people who will not have opinions of their own but will do just what they are told.  I do not know if that is the experience of the Deputy in his own Party, but it is certainly not the experience in our Party.</P>

      <P>What I am interested in is that the reputation of this Assembly and of the individuals who compose it should not be lowered in the public estimation.  I do not think that it would be a good thing if that were done.  From experience, I am satisfied that the individuals who are elected to represent the people have as high a sense of their public responsibilities as it is reasonable to expect of people who are human beings and that that is so in the State as a whole. We have here 138 representatives of the community as a whole.  If they sit in judgment, as the community in miniature, upon a person who is accused of acting improperly, who is accused of misbehaviour on the bench or of incapacity, I am satisfied that their judgment, on the whole, will be a fair judgment.  I am quite sure that if an Executive tried to bring in, under false pretences, a motion to remove a judge, they would not be supported by their own Party and they, certainly, would not get a majority of the House. In these matters, when justice has to be done to individuals and to the community, the representative feels a very personal responsibility and that responsibility shows itself definitely in the vote.  I am not at all fearful that the position is such that it will be abused, but I do admit that there is a case for further machinery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am wondering whether it is not wiser to leave that machinery to be devised as occasion requires it than to set it up in advance.  I certainly would be prepared, and I am sure the Government would be quite prepared, to meet other Parties in the House in devising <Col N="1958" /> such machinery if Deputies think there is an advantage in having it set up in advance.  I do not think a purely judicial committee would be the wisest.</P>
    <P>That brings me to another question. There seemed to be a suggestion that there has been some change for the worse in regard to the position of district justices.  I do not think so.  The position at present is that complaints as to the conduct of district justices have to be brought before a committee consisting of the Attorney-General, the President of the High Court and the Chief Justice.  These are three judicial persons and the body, as suggested by Deputy Norton, is one of a vocational character.  These persons would be interested in safeguarding, not merely the interests of their brothers in the profession, but also in safeguarding the interests of the profession as a whole and in safeguarding the institution and the independence of the judiciary.</P>
    <P>With regard to regulations for the Circuit Court they are very much in the air.  If my view were to count in the matter, and if it should be necessary to take action on it, I think it would be desirable to have some such system as prevails in the High Court where the President of the High Court allocates the work and, at least, is in a position to know whether the work is being done or is being neglected.  I think it would be desirable, in the interests of the community, that there should be some committee or authority of that kind in relation to the Circuit Court or that some individual should have, in relation to the Circuit Court, something like the functions that the President of the High Court at present has for allocating duties to the judges of the High Court.  In other words he is in a position to see that a certain amount of work is done, that there are no undue delays and he has an opportunity in private of suggesting, if the convenience of litigants is not being reasonably met, that something should be done in the matter.</P>
    <P>The Circuit Court judges are not protected by the Constitution; they depend simply on an Act, but there again, although their protection depends upon an Act of Parliament, there has never been a suggestion that the <Col N="1959" /> security of their office has been interfered with.  We have here guarantees of independence for our judges as great as there are in any other Constitution that I know of.  Our judges are certainly as secure as in Great Britain.  In the case of Switzerland, for instance, I was rather surprised when it was brought to my notice that judges are appointed only for a period of seven years.  They are appointed by the National Assembly.  They are open to re-appointment, but any citizen at all can be appointed a judge, at least in theory.  In practice, however, it is only persons of high legal qualifications who are, in fact, appointed.  That does prove, however, that you can have in some countries the election of judges by the Assembly.  If we brought in a proposition of that kind, that judges should be elected for a period of seven years by a vote of this Assembly, I know what Deputy Dillon would say, letting his imagination run riot.</P>

If it were suggested that judges should be appointed only for seven years, it would be said that they would be <Col N="1960" />&ldquo;yes-men&rdquo; and that they would do whatever the majority wanted them to do.</P>
      <P>In fact that is not so.  However, with regard to this Bill, we are at one in the desire to have the judiciary independent. The only point upon which we differ is: what guarantees are we to give them which will not put them into such a position that they can afford to neglect their duties?</P>

      <P>If no guarantee is worth a hoot, what is the position in Great Britain?  They have a long tradition there.  We have a fairly long tradition in that regard, too, but in fact the tendency is to be long suffering and I am in favour of that tendency. I think that Deputy Costello was right in suggesting that, on the whole, the community gains rather by long suffering in certain cases than by taking the redress which would be open to it.  I mean that it is better to err on the side of putting up with rather indifferent service in some cases than to injure the institutions as a whole, by taking action which would seem to weaken the position.</P>
      <P>All I can say is that we do not propose to accept this Bill, as we do not see any improvement that could be effected by it from the constitutional point of view.  With regard to machinery for inquiry, we are quite open to adopt any suggestions that are made and try to come to an agreement on that matter.  We are prepared to meet Deputies on the opposite benches in that regard, but I would suggest that there is something in the point that it is better not to prepare the machinery in advance.  If you do so, it seems to indicate a readiness to apply the method, a readiness which is really not there.  Nobody wants to adopt this method of procedure or to take this remedy at all if it can be avoided but, as human nature is what it is, we cannot dispense with it altogether and it is necessary to have it there in the background to use it if the public interest should require its use.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach talked, as Deputy Norton talked, about judges being made absolutely irremovable.  This Bill does not make judges absolutely irremovable.  It sets up a judicial committee to inquire as to whether a judge is discharging his duty, and, if they come to the conclusion that he is not, and if two-thirds of the Dáil and the Seanad come to the same conclusion, the judge is removed.  That is not making him irremovable.  It is making him removable, but only removable after an inquiry by a competent body. The Taoiseach declared that, before the Dáil acted, a select committee should be set up.  There is no provision in the law as it stands for the setting up of a select committee.  As a matter of fact, we had a motion for the removal of a judge here quite recently.  The Taoiseach did not go into it, and I will not do so either, but there was no motion before the House for the setting up of a select committee of inquiry. There was a bald motion that the judge be removed, and that was the only motion tabled.</P>

As it stands at present, without any inquiry at all, on the mere <i>ipse dixit</i> of a Minister, the House can be asked to remove a judge.  That is an entirely unsatisfactory position, and we suggest that it should be changed.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach says that the judicial body suggested in this Bill is not satisfactory, but the moment after he said that, he covers with eulogy the method of removing a district justice, which is after inquiry by two judges and an Attorney-General.  He quotes that method with approval, because it is already in existence in the Constitution, and then, as soon as he is asked to have the opinion of the Supreme Court taken on the matter of the removal of a judge, he said that judges are not the best persons to inquire. If judges are not the best persons to inquire into matters of this nature, why are they appointed to inquire into the removal of a district justice?  The Taoiseach eulogised the appointment of judges to inquire with regard to district justices and condemns a commission of judges to inquire with regard to the Supreme Court.</P>

We are told that we shall be perfectly safe in that no political Party would obey the Party Whips, if a man were being removed from office unjustly. How are they to know?  The Minister gets up and says: &ldquo;I have made inquiries and I am satisfied that this man is not suited to hold the position of judge;&rdquo; he moves the motion; puts on his Party Whips; and the House is asked to vote with nothing but the mere statement of the Minister.

      <P>One of the cases which come to my mind of the removal of a High Court judge took place shortly after the Act of Union, when a judge was removed by vote of the House of Commons and House of Lords for a political offence.  He was removed because he wrote a pamphlet, under a <i>nom-de-plume</i>, in which he had the audacity to describe the Lord Lieutenant of the day as a respectable sheep-farmer from Lincolnshire. Owing to a pamphlet containing that slightly contemptuous but not very offensive description, he was removed from the Bench.  That was purely and entirely a political matter, and what happened once may very easily happen again.  It is admitted on all sides that the judiciary should be independent. It is admitted, if not by the Labour Party, by the Government Party, that the safeguards of the present position are not satisfactory, and that further safeguards are required.  Here are the <Col N="1964" /> further safeguards and, because the Government are in favour of the principle of the Bill as giving further safeguards to the judges, let them accept this Bill and amend it in Committee.</P>

      <P>The remarks I shall make in concluding on this Bill will be very short and, I hope, to the point, because I am not going to give myself any more blood-pressure than I have in support of the Bill, having done what I conceived it my duty to do, that is, to direct the attention of the Dáil and of the people to the problem which I believe exists and which, I think, the Prime Minister himself knows to exist. He has admitted that some sort of machinery is necessary.  One of the purposes of this Bill, its chief purpose, was to draw attention to that fact, and the effort in this Bill was merely directed towards putting down a form of machinery.  I have already stated that I was not wedded to that form of machinery, and I state candidly now that I do not like the machinery that I have provided in my own Bill, but I had to provide something, merely for the purpose of initiating a discussion with a view to seeing if anybody could suggest a different or better machinery. It was merely for the purpose of stimulating discussion that a particular form of machinery was provided for in the Bill, the principle in the Bill being that some machinery should be provided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, Deputy Norton said that if I had not taken the high-water mark of the safeguards, and if I had taken the fair-water mark of the safeguards, he would have supported me, but he himself had not thought of what either the high-water mark or the fair-water mark, or even the low-water mark of the safeguards was, and he came into this House here with one hand as long as the other and indulged in a lot of empty verbiage in opposition to this Bill without making any concrete proposal of any class or description as to the kind of machinery that might be set up.  All he did was to point to the obvious imperfections of the Bill which I was proposing&mdash;imperfections so obvious that I drew attention to them myself at the start.  I was even rather <Col N="1965" /> attacked by one of the judges for putting in this thing about a judicial committee, he holding that that meant handing them over to some sort of committee of judges which they might not approve, but my withers&mdash;whatever one&rsquo;s withers are&mdash;were completely unwrung because if I were a judge I should rather be in the hands of my fellow-judges than in the hands of some country Deputies who were merely, by virtue of an election, members of this Oireachtas for the Parliamentary term of office.</P>
    <P>I think that the tribunal&mdash;if you can call it such&mdash;provided by the Constitution at present is entirely inappropriate. I think it always was inappropriate&mdash;this business of the so-called safeguarding of the independence of the judiciary by the Constitutional convention, or the provisions of a statute, or the provisions of a Constitution, that a judge could only be removed by a vote of both Houses of the Legislative Assembly.  I hold that it was largely illusory as a safeguard. I say that it was illusory here from 1922 also, except this: that in the 1922 period and for some time afterwards there undoubtedly was a difference in composition between the Seanad and the Dáil, as constituted at that time. There is very little difference, to my mind, now between the Dáil and the Seanad, whatever the Taoiseach may say, but whether there is little difference or no difference I still think that this machinery of safeguarding the independence of the judiciary by a vote of both Houses is quite illusory.  It has a traditional sanctity, and it is the sanctity that gives the appearance of a safeguard.  Once the veil is taken away, once the illusion is exposed, it is no longer a safeguard and, in my view, the illusion has been exposed now in connection with a motion that was set down in this House.  Now I made it perfectly clear, and I do not want to have to emphasise it again, notwithstanding the somewhat provocative remarks of Deputy Norton, that I am not in any way criticising the Minister for Justice for his action in that particular connection. I have some little difficulty in refraining from replying to <Col N="1966" /> the provocative remarks of Deputy Norton, but in the interests of my blood pressure I shall refrain from doing so.  The illusion, in my view, as I was saying, has been exposed because a motion was put down in this House, sponsored by the Government, and it is perfectly obvious to anybody that that motion would have been ultimately voted upon under pressure from the Party Whips.  I want to say no more than that, and I am trying to refer to the case as inoffensively as possible, but I think that that is ultimately what would have happened. That, I say, is the exposure of the ineffectiveness of this system.  I merely want to direct attention to that while there is time to do something about it.  Any system that will provide some sort of safeguard which will not be illusory will satisfy me personally.  I have no desire to keep judges in office contrary to the public interest.  I sometimes feel very annoyed myself with judges, but that is not the point. The whole principle is at stake, and of course the principle is in the public interest and for the public interest.</P>
    <P>Again, I say that the Dáil and Seanad are quite an inappropriate tribunal to discuss the question of the misconduct of a judge.  It is a hopeless tribunal, a ridiculous tribunal, to have to sit on the question of the incapacity of a judge&mdash;whatever he is sufficiently ill or not to do his duty.  It is a cumbersome and, I think, almost ridiculous machinery.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">

      <P>Might I ask the Deputy a question?  As one who held the office of Attorney-General, suppose that in his time of office&mdash; the time of the Government in which he was Attorney-General&mdash;a motion of that sort had to be brought in in the public interest, would they not there and then have devised some machinery to deal with the matter?  It is obvious that there would have been some machinery devised.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be entirely different in the case of misconduct.  If there was any question of incapacity and if I had any influence&mdash;and I had a little influence with the last Government&mdash;my advice would be to pay the man his full salary and let him stay out as long as he likes and pay a substitute, rather than bring this matter before the Dáil.  That is so far as incapacity is concerned, and there was a very distinct precedent for that in this country where there was a certain judge who had long since passed his capacity as a judge, and the British Government allowed him to remain on rather than bring the matter before Parliament.</P>

      <P>Supposing you had a judge who was not prepared to fall in with your views in that regard, then you could not have that remedy.  What I want to point out is that it is clear that it was always understood that that would have to be implemented by some sort of machinery of investigation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I agree on that, but the point I am making at the moment is that getting rid of a judge for incapacity by means of a vote of both Houses is too cumbersome a machinery altogether, in my opinion. The machinery is inappropriate in the question of misconduct because, with all due respect to members of this House and of the Seanad, I do not think that they are a proper tribunal to try a question of misconduct <i>in absentia</i>&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;because that is what is happening, and if you were to have a committee set up, on the lines suggested by Deputy Dillon, such as the Committee of Public Accounts, or something of that sort, it is open to the Dáil afterwards to repudiate that committee.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>The other point I want <Col N="1968" /> to make is that I think there is only a little more than a fortnight left before the time for constitutional amendment by statute has expired.  I think there is no time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the very point I am going to emphasise, that any machinery which is not in the Constitution is of no earthly use whatever because if you have the procedure of this select committee agreed upon by this Parliament, let us say, and if there is a general election and a new Government comes in, they may say: &ldquo;We will have none of this select committee or its machinery,&rdquo; and unless you have some machinery of a constitutional character already set up, the other thing is not binding on the Government that sets it up and is certainly not binding upon the Government that follows.  Therefore, the only adequate manner in which to deal with this matter is by having it in the Constitution, and that is why I put it in here.  As I have said, I am not wedded to the machinery I have proposed.  I do not like it, but at least it has the advantage of being independent.  Deputy Norton, of course, rather sneered at the kind of thing proposed and suggested, if I might put it vulgarly, that dog would not eat dog.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>But if you cannot rely upon your Supreme Court to give an independent judgment, how much less could you rely on a tribunal such as this House where you have observations of the kind that were made by a Deputy opposite and where you have provocative observations of the kind that are frequently bandied about in this House.  I have used the expression &ldquo;dog&rdquo; myself, but I suggest that a judge would not have a dog&rsquo;s chance here once the thing started.  The Taoiseach, of course, would start off with the white garb of innocence around him.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>No, that would be nicely brushed back, but inside of an hour it would be knocked down when Deputy Dillon or I said something provocative. Inside two hours we would be all at each other&rsquo;s throats about it and the whole issue would be decided purely on a political basis.  We would all start out saying with unctuousness that we are all in favour of the independence of the judges.  The Prime Minister says we are all in favour of the independence of the judges, but that the machinery that we have at the moment is adequate.  I say it is not.  But when we get to a right-down, regular, royal now about a particular instance, the independence of the judiciary would vanish and the Party Whips would be <Col N="1970" /> scurrying all over the corridors for the purpose of getting Deputies of every Party to register their votes.  I have no doubt that would be the position.</P>
      <P>I repeat that the safeguard in the Constitution arises merely from its traditional character, arises from the fact of its not having ever been used in this country either by this Government, the last Government, or the British Government for the last 150 years. That is the sanctity that surrounds this particular safeguard.  Once it has been used, or once there has been an attempt to use it, it is gone as a safeguard. If you pass the next fortnight and leave this here, the principle of the independence of a judiciary is a mere catch-cry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Benson</NameTxt>
      <P>When progress was reported I was drawing the attention of the House to the fact that if this amendment is accepted it allows a public assistance authority, in addition to county councils, to devolve its powers and duties to a parish council, or approved local council, as the Bill describes it, and I was objecting to that in view of the fact that an approved local council has no responsibility to anybody.  The effect of allowing it to carry out the duties of a public assistance authority might be that it could distribute money in a more generous fashion than an authority which had a responsibility to those who elected it.  My fear is that the amendment, if accepted, would tend to increase the amount of public assistance distributed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>What might be delegated to an approved local council would be of a very limited character. The Deputy is concerned that if a public assistance authority delegates to a local council or to an approved council the latter might have power to give home assistance or to give relief. That is reserved to the manager.  When the County Management Act is operated that will be a function of the manager.  There is no need to worry about that.  It is dealt with in Section 29, sub-section (5) (c) of the County Management Act.</P>

How will that idea square with the idea in the Trade Union Bill?  In towns like Tipperary or Drogheda labourers&rsquo; associations may have been carrying on satisfactory negotiations with employers regarding wages but that is going to be practically forbidden in future by law.  It is hard to see where is the principle. In the Trade Union Bill there is a <Col N="1972" /> possibility of a new branch of activity being opened to the law.

      <P>The Minister attempted to torpedo my argument by stating that the disbursement of home assistance would be a managerial function when the Bill becomes operative.  Against the section that the Minister quoted in support of his argument, let me quote this for him.  Sub-section (3) of Section 16 of the County Management Act gives power to the Minister to transfer duties from the manager to the local authority&mdash;at least, so I read it.  It appears to me, therefore, that if for any reason an agitation were created in any part of the country, an approved local council could have this power of distributing home assistance. The Minister, under the sub-section I have referred to, could transfer the power to do so from the county manager to the public assistance authority which, in turn, could transfer it to an approved local council.  My objection to the Minister&rsquo;s amendment is, to a certain extent, tied up with my amendment No. 82, which seeks to remove the powers that the Bill allots to approved local councils.</P>

    <P>The object of the amendment is that I want to remove all power from the local approved councils.

I think those of us who attended the meeting held recently in the Mansion House&mdash; similar meetings have been held throughout the country&mdash;were much struck by the enthusiasm and keenness of the representatives of those parish councils who came there to try and solve some of the problems that they are up against.  It seems to me it is a great pity that the parish councils should not be left alone to continue their good work.  Apart altogether from the wisdom or otherwise of giving them the powers contained in the Bill, it is possible that the effect of giving such powers to parish councils may have the effect of bringing their work to an end.

      <P>Go ndcontar suim ná raghaidh thar £122,844 chun slánuithe na suime is gá chun íoctha an Mhuirir a thiocfaidh chun bheith iníoctha i rith na bliana dar críoch an 31adh lá de Mhárta, 1942, chun Tuarastail agus Costaisí i dtaobh Foraoiseachta (9 agus 10 Geo. 5, c. 58 agus Uimh. 34 de 1928), ar a n-áirmhítear Deontas-i-gCabhair chun Talamh do Thógaint.</P>
      <P>That a sum, not exceeding £122,844, be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending the 31st day of March, 1942, for Salaries and Expenses in connection with Forestry (9 and 10 Geo. 5, c. 58 and No. 34 of 1928), including a Grant-in-Aid for Acquisition of Land.</P>

    <P>An cor atá ar an saol de dheascaibh an chogaidh tá sé ag cur isteach ar chúrsaí foraoiseachta fé mar atá sé ag cur isteach ar chúrsaí eile raghadh chun leasa na tíre, agus tá a rian san le feicsint ar mheastachán so na bliana airgeadais seo.  An méid iomlán glan &mdash;£185,264&mdash;atá á lorg sa vóta so, is lugha de £43,991 é ná an tsuim do vótáladh in aghaidh na bliana so caithte.  Isé fé ndeár an laigheadú so ná cajteachas measta na bliana so do bheith laigheaduithe £23,881 agus méadú de £20,110 do bheith ar na fáltaisí le n-a bhfuil súil.  As adhmad a dhíol iseadh a thiocfaidh an chuid is mó de sna fáltaisí seo, ach fágann san go gcaithfear tarraing an-mhór a dhéanamh ar a bhfuil d&rsquo;adhmad inghearrtha ar láimh ag an Rannóig Fhoraoiseachta fé mar do rinneadh anuraidh.  Ní féadfar leanúint de shíor den tarraing seo agus is cinnte go raghaidh an t-ioncum a bheidh ag teacht aisti i laighead amach anseo, cé go mbeidh an-chuimse sparaí de bharr tanaidheachain le díol ach glaoch a bheith ortha.  Toisc a laighead adhmaid dob fhéidir d&rsquo;iomportáil le roinnt aimsire anuas, agus fós gan aon <Col N="1986" /> adhmad do bheith á iomportáil fé láthair, caithfimíd bheith i dtaoibh leis an méid adhmaid atá le fáil sa tír; agus tá an Rannóg Fhoraoiseachta ar a ndícheall ag cur adhmaid ar an margadh atá oiriúnach do shiúinéireacht.</P>
    <P>Do bhain dhá chonstaic mhóra le cúrsaí foraoiseachta i rith na bliana seo caithte.  Sa chéad dul síos, níorbh fhéidir leor-sholáthairt d&rsquo;eangach choiníní d&rsquo;fháil do réir mar bhí gá leis sna háiteanna bhí á bplanndáil.  Ní raibh an eangach le fáil ón Mór-Roinn agus ní raibh le fáil ón mBreatain Mhóir ach tuairim leis an gceathrú cuid den ghnáth-mhéid a bhíonn ag teastáil.  Táthar ag féachaint, ámh, le heangach d&rsquo;fháil o Ameirice agus tá dóthain dhá bhliain dá ordú.  Ansan arís, maidir leis na síolta le haghaidh na ngarraithe altroma, ní raibh fáil ar na caindíochta dhíobh a bhí beartuithe a chur, ach do cruinníodh an oiread síolta agus dob fhéidir in ár dtailte coille féin agus do slánuíodh cuid den easnamh ar an gcuma san.  Ni haireofar deasca an easnaimh síl i gceart go ceann cúpla blian no trí.</P>
    <P>Is oth liom a rá gur baol laigheadú do theacht ar an méid tailimh is féidir a chur fé chrainn, ach tá sé socair an oiread ullmhúcháin agus is féidir do dhéanamh i dtreo go raghaidh an phlanndáil i méid an túisce bheidh cúrsaí ina ngnáth-riocht arís, agus chuige sin táthar ag leanúint de thalamh oiriúnach a cheannach d&rsquo;fhonn gan aon easba tailimh do bheith ag cur isteach ar an bplanndáil nuair a bheidh caoi ann chun dul ar aghaidh i gceart léi.  Isé méid tailimh do fuarthas i rith na bliana dar chríoch an 31adh lá de Mhárta so caithte ná 9,483 acra; 12,739 n-acra do fuarthas i rith na bliana roimhe sin.  Do ceannuíodh 63 réimse (gan an méid a tógadh ar léas d&rsquo;áireamh) agus 135 acra is meán-achar do sna réimsí sin. Níl so chó mór agus a bhí coinne leis, ach tá margántaíocht atá ar siúl le Coimisiún na Talmhan agus le húnaerí príobháideacha i dtaobh líomatáistí móra do cheannach ag dul ar aghaidh go maith agus deallruíonn an scéal gur gearr go gcríochnófar í.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1987" /> Níorbh fhéidir, toisc a olcas a bhí an aímsir, an méid planndála bhí beartuithe le haghaidh an tsaosúir seo caithte do chríochnú roimh dheireadh na bliana agus leanadh leis an phlanndáil thar an ngnáth-am i mbliana.  Táthar ag súil go mbeidh suas le 6,000 acra sa mbreis curtha fé chrainn nuair a bheidh an phlanndáil sin críochnuithe, ach is lugha an t-achar san ná an t-achar a planndáltaí aon bhliain le roinnt bhlian anuas.</P>
    <P>Tuairim 146,275 acra de thailte foraoiseachta atá ar láimh anois agus tá 102,500 acra dhe sin planndálta agus 24,400 acra dhe nach féidir a phlanndáil. Tá 102 ionad foraoiseachta ann anois; agus ortha san tá ionaid fhoraoiseachta nua i Muine an Mheadha agus ar an gCreagán, Co. na Gaillimhe, ar Thulach na nAspol, Co. an Chláir, i gCluain na nGall, Co. Loch Garman, agus ag Ráth Naoi, Co. Chill Mantan.  Ar na réimsí atá ag gabháil le hionad Ráth Naoi tá líomatáistí do bhí ina gcuid d&rsquo;Fhoraois Ráth Droma; bhí an Fhoraois seo rófhairsing agus ró-scaipthe le déanaighe chun í mhaoirsiú agus í riaradh mar aonad amháin.  Táthar tar éis líomatáistí nua eile do fuarthas do chur ag gabháil le sean-ionaid ar féidir iad d&rsquo;oibriú go caothúil mar chuid díobh. Cabhruíonn so chun na costaisí maoirseachta do choimeád chó beag agus is féidir é.</P>
    <P>Tá an tsuim airgid atá á lorg fé gach altán den Vóta so luaidhte sna Meastacháin, agus tá beartuithe agam gan mion-trácht do dhéanamh ach ar na hítimí sin atá tar éis dul go mór i méid no i laighead i gcomparáid leis na hítimí có-réire i Vóta na bliana so caithte.</P>
    <P>Níltear ag iarraidh ach £20,000 i mbliana chun talamh d&rsquo;fháil.  Do fuarthas £45,000 an bhliain seo caithte. Os rud é gur i bhfuirm Deontais-i-gCabhair do gheibhtear na suimeanna vótáltar fén Altán so, ní deintear na hiarmhéideanna bhíonn ann i ndeireadh na bliana do thabhairt thar n-ais, <Col N="1988" /> ach bheirtear ar aghaidh iad go dtí an bhliain airgeadais ina dhiaidh sin. Timpeall le £6,036 d&rsquo;iarmhéid atá tugtha ar aghaidh ón mbliain 1940-41. Táthar chun an tsuim sin, maraon leis an £20,000 atá á lorg anois, eadhon, £26,036 ar fad, do chur ar fáil chun talamh do cheannach i rith na bliana so.  Ina choinnibh sin, ámh, tá an Rannóg Fhoraoiseachta tar éis socruithe cinnte do dhéanamh le roinnt únaerí talmhan chun 5,262½ acra do cheannach uatha ar £18,054 agus táid, freisin, tar éis a thairgsint do Choimisiún na Talmhan réimsí darb achar iomlán 3,549½ n-acra do cheannach uatha san ar £12,000.</P>
    <P>Ina theannta san, do fuarthas timpeall 46 tairgsint á thairgsint 13,859½ n-acra do dhíol leis an Rannóig agus tá molta an talamh san do cheannach ar £30,000.  Fairis sin, tá breithniú á dhéanamh ag an Rannóig Fhoraoiseachta agus ag Coimisiún na Talmhan le chéile i dtaobh 8,200 acra eile, adeirtear is fiú os cionn £26,000, do cheannach. Chífear, dá bhrí sin, má bhíonn aon choda móra de sna tailte atá fé bhreithniú réidh chun a gceannuithe i rith na bliana, ná beidh dóthain airgid ann le haghaidh na n-íocaíocht go léir. Ach is gnáth moill do bhaint le talamh do cheannach, mar is minic gur gá tamall fada chun na dteoranta do shocrú i slí le n-a mbeadh an dá thaobh sásta agus chun leor-chearta slí do cheapadh, agus mar sin de.  Uime sin, meastar gur leor an t-airgead a bheidh ar láimh i gcóir gach íocaíochta bheidh le déanamh i gcaitheamh na bliana cé go gcaithfear an scéal d&rsquo;aith-bhreithniú go cúramach o am go ham.</P>
    <P>Maidir le cúrsaí altroma agus cothabhála, isé cúis is mó atá leis an laigheadú de £4,078 sa tsuim atá á lorg fén altán so ná gan an oiread céanna airgid do bheith le caitheamh ar abhair fhálta ná ar phágh an lucht oibre bhíonn ag gabháil do shíol-chur agus do phlanndáil.  Do thráchtas cheana ar a dheacra atá sé leor-sholáthairtí d&rsquo;eangach d&rsquo;fháil agus ar an gceataighe do rinne an t-easnamh san maidir le planndáil i gcaitheamh an gheimhridh seo caithte.  Rinneadh iarrachtaí ar <Col N="1989" /> sholáthairtí d&rsquo;fháil as Americe agus, ar eagla na heagla, tá oiread agus a dhéanfadh an gnó ar feadh breis agus dhá bhliain á ordú.  Má eiríonn leis na hiarrachtaí sin, ní bheidh ár ndóthain airgid sa mhéid atá á lorg anois agus caithfear airgead sa mbreis do lorg ar an Dáil amach anseo.  Isé fáth gur laigheaduíodh an méid airgid le haghaidh lucht oibre ná ná rabhthas ag coinne leis an méid céanna planndála dhéanamh, ach má gheibhtear dóthain den eangaigh, agus é sin in am, féadfar planndáil bhreise do dhéanamh. An tsuim atá á lorg chun síolta agus planndaí óga do cheannach, tá sí ar có-mhéid le suim na bliana so caithte cé gur baol ná beidh sé aon bhlas níos éasca na nithe sin a cheannach feasta ná mar atá fé láthair.</P>
    <P>Ag cuimhneamh, ámh, ar an méid a chuirfeadh ganntan síl anois isteach ar chúrsaí planndála i gceann a dó no a trí de bhlianta eile, tráth a bheidh feabhas tar éis teacht ar chúrsaí, le congnamh Dé, déanfar gach dícheall chun leor-sholáthairtí síl d&rsquo;fháil agus ní tabharfar faillighe dá laighead san oiread síl agus is féidir d&rsquo;fhás cois baile.  Ní healadha do lucht foraoiseachta go mbeadh ortha de ghnáth bheith ag ceannach síoltán agus fásóga ach ní bhíonn leigheas air uaireanta, fiú amháin i gcás é bheith ar chumas na Roinne a cuid oibre altromais do leagadh amach tamall maith roimh ré. An saosúr so caithte do horduíodh timpeal le 868,000 síoltán agus 40,000 fásóga o fhásóirí in Éirinn agus do malairtíodh roinnt planndaí le Riaghaltas Thuaiscirt Éireann.</P>
    <P>Tá airgead le cur ar fáil fé altán C3 &mdash;adhmad do ghearradh&mdash;chun dhá mhuileann sheasta sháibhéarachta do choimeád ar siúl, ceann i nDún Droma, Co.  Thiobrad Arann, agus ceann i gCeapa na Corcóige, Cunga, Co. Mhuigheo, agus chun innill trasghearrtha bheaga áirithe a hoibrítear le comhacht mheicniúil do choimeád ar siúl freisin.  Sna muilte seasta gearrtar adhmad le haghaidh lucht na comharsanachta agus deintear geataí, cuaillí fáil, agus mar sin de, ionta i gcóir na Roinne féin.  Is chun abhar teine do <Col N="1990" /> dhéanamh as rosánach agus as adhmad eile ná bíonn aon tairbhe ann le haghaidh tráchtála a húsáidtear na hinnill trasghearrtha.</P>
    <P>Maidir le hAltán H&mdash;Leithreasaí-i-gCabhair&mdash;bhéarfar fé ndeár go bhfuil coinne leis na fáltaisí do dhul i méid go mór i mbliana.  Ní féidir agus an chaoi atá ar an saol, lastaí toirtiúla ar nós lastaí adhmaid d&rsquo;iomportáil feasta. Dá bhrí sin, beidh lucht úsáidthe adhmaid i gcleithiúnas an adhmaid dúthchais agus, ní nach iongnadh, nuair do mhéaduigh ar an nglaoch do mhéaduigh ar phraghsanna an adhmaid thar mar bhíodar sarar chuir an cogadh isteach ar an ngnáth-thrádáil. Ach cé gur féidir, de bharr an ghlaoidh mhéaduithe seo, cineálacha áirithe adhmaid do dhíol anois nárbh fhéidir a dhíol go dtí seo, tá a chontabhairtí féin ag baint leis an scéal. An méid adhmaid atá ar fáil&mdash;agus ní méid ró-mhór é&mdash;táthar á dhíthiú, agus is ró-bhaol go ndéanfar adhmad anaibidh, ba cheart d&rsquo;fhágaint ag fás tamall maith eile dá bhféadfaí é, do ghearradh in antráth agus gur measade sin amach anseo na tionnscail atá ag brath ar an adhmad dúthchais agus ina bhfuil roinnt mhaith daoine ar fuaid na tíre ag obair.</P>
    <P>Is mó go mór an méid adhmaid atá á dhíol ag an Rannóig Fhoraoiseachta fé láthair ná mar a bhí á dhíol aca go dtí seo.  Is mar mhaithe le cúrsaí tionnscail atá so á dhéanamh agus leanfar de faid a bheidh adhmad lán-aibidh le fáil ar thailte Foraoise an Stáit, ach amháin sa chorr-chás san ina gcaithfear na crainn a choinneáil ar mhaithe le cúrasí taithneamhachta.  Toisc a ghainne agus a dhaoire atá an gual, tá éileamh thar cuimse ar thein-abhar de shaghsanna eile.  I dtreo gur fearr-de a féadfar riaradh ar an éileamh san, glacann an Rannóg Fhoraoiseachta comhairle leis an Roinn Soláthairtí go minic agus tá an dá thaobh ag obair as lámhaibh a chéile d&rsquo;fhonn an connadh atá sa tír seo againn do chur ar fáil do réir mar a bheidh gádh leis.  Ní nach iongnadh, ní fuláir don Roinn Fhoraoiseachta déanamh mar a chítear don Roinn Soláthairtí is fearr maidir le <Col N="1991" /> habhar teine den tsórt seo do chur ar fáil don phobal.</P>
    <P>Isé rún do bhí leis an Acht Foraoiseachta, 1928, ná srian a chur le coillte a ghearradh as éadan agus a chur in áirithe go n-athphlanndálfaí talamh a ngearrfaí coill de.  Sa chaoi ina bhfuil an scéal fé láthair, is beag is féidir a dhéanamh chun cosc a chur le crainn lán-abaidhe do ghearradh gan cur as do shlí mhaireachtana an dreama bhíonn ag gabháil do thionnscail a bhíonn ag brath, go díreach no go neamh-dhíreach, ar adhmad do bheith le fáil.  Ach, chó fada agus is féidir é, tá srian á chur le crainn an-abaidhe do ghearradh agus táthar ag féachaint chuige go ndéanfar athphlanndáil pé áit ina ndeintear an choill ar fad do ghearradh agus fós ní ceaduítear fiú amháin crainn fháil ná crainn aonraic do ghearradh gan paiste de thalamh dhíomhaoin, má bhíonn a leithéid ann, do phlanndáil mar chúiteamh sa ghearradh san.</P>
    <P>Is maith liom a rá go bhfuil deireadh anois leis an mí-thuigsint do bhí ann tamall o shoin, nuair a bhíothas á cheapadh nár ghá áird a thabhairt ar fhorálacha an Achta so toisc an riachtanas mór náisiúnta bhí ann, agus go bhfuil furmhór na bhfeirmeoirí móra agus na gceannaithe adhmaid ag déanamh do réir mar a héilítear ortha leis an Acht.  Ina dhiaidh sin is uile, is minic fós do gheibhtear gearáin i dtaobh an tAcht do bheith á shárú, agus is beag gearán aca san ná bunuítear imeachta dlí mar gheall air má bhíonn fianaise chinnte ar fáil.</P>
    <P>Is mó scéal a gheibheann an Roinn i dtaobh gearradh na gcrann do bheith ag dul i méid ar fuaid na tíre agus á mholadh nár cheart a cheadú crainn ar bith a leagadh no ag gearán go bhfuil easportáil thar cuimse á dhéanamh ar an adhmad.  Maidir leis na gearáin seo, ba mhaith liom a rá nach buntáiste ar bith aon tráth crainn lánabaidhe d&rsquo;fhágaint gan gearradh ach amháin nuair ba dhochar an gearradh do thaithneamhacht agus d&rsquo;amharc na dúithche.  B&rsquo;fhearr é beith mar nós <Col N="1992" /> againn bheith ag gearradh diaidh ar ndiaidh agus bheith ag ath-chur do réir mar a gearrfaí.  Sa chaoi a bhfuil an scéal fé láthair, ámh, níl de roghain againn ach gearradh thar fóir anois agus socrú a dhéanamh chun coillte óga do chur, amach anseo, in ionad an mhéide gearrfar, no ár muilte sáibhéarachta go léir do dhúnadh go luath agus eirghe as gach obair inar gá adhmad d&rsquo;úsáid.  Measaim nach bhfuil ach an t-aon rogha amháin is féidir a ghlacadh.</P>
    <P>Maidir le hadhmad d&rsquo;easportáil, má bheirtear roinnt adhmaid chun siúil as comharsanacht áirithe, ní fhágann san go bhfuiltear á chur amach as an tír. Fé mar atá an scéal ag lucht muilte sáibhéarachta fé láthair, bíonn ortha dul níos sia agus níos sia fós o bhaile ag lorg adhmaid agus, ar aon chuma, tá dlúth-smacht á choimeád le tamall anuas ag an Roinn Soláthairtí ar easportáil an adhmaid.  Níor tugadh ceadúnaisí easportála ach amháin maidir le cineálacha áirithe adhmaid ná raibh ach fíor-bheagán glaoch ortha sa tír seo.  Bítear ag faire ar an gcúrsa i gcomhnaidhe agus tuigtear dom go srianfar an easportáil seo tuilleadh, má ceaptar gur gá san.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyJMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>The notes that accompanied the Minister&rsquo;s statement form very depressing reading, indeed. Forestry has got a great deal of public attention in this country in the last two or three years.  That public attention would lead one to think that it would be reflected to a considerable extent in this Vote.  It is very disappointing to find the exact contrary to be the case, because the whole note underlying the <i>apologia</i> for the Estimate this year is one of reductions&mdash;reductions right through&mdash;there being a total reduction in the Estimate of something like £44,000, and £24,000 of that amount represents a reduction in the labour employed.  I consider that that is a most depressing and disappointing result to present to the House and I think the House ought to express some definite view on that particular matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1993" /> A good deal of the statement of the Minister&rsquo;s notes was devoted to the question of tree felling and to the inroads that tree felling is making on the timber resources of the Forestry Department.  One would think that, accompanying that, there would be some substantial progress in the matter of planting.  The merits of various claims in connection with forestry, such as a suitable kind of timber and the suitability of certain lands for this purpose, have been discussed and have been the subject of very active controversy during the last two or three years between certain authorities in this country and the Minister&rsquo;s Department. I do not pretend to enter into that controversy or express any opinion about it, because I am not in a position to do so, but it would seem to be ordinary common sense that, as our tree resources are being steadily reduced by reason of certain circumstances that are inevitable at the present time, side by side with that reduction there would be something in the way of a big increase in the planting of trees.  It is significant that, in connection with the production of turf, we had already reached a point where it was perfectly clear that there would be no fire in many people&rsquo;s grates next winter before the advantage of getting our unemployed people on the bogs to cut turf was realised.</P>
    <P>I wonder what stresses or difficulties will be necessary to make the authorities realise how much more could be done in this country in the matter of planting trees.  I say that it ought to be within the competence of the Minister&rsquo;s Department to evolve a scheme whereby very much more could be done in this matter, and whereby our unemployed people in the rural areas and towns could participate in the fruits of a large national scheme of this kind.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether it is imprudent or impertinent to suggest this, but it has often occurred to me that if certain lands are not suitable for the growing of timber of a very valuable kind, they might be suitable for timber of some kind, and if the unemployed <Col N="1994" /> people were engaged in planting timber, even if it were not a very valuable kind, it would be a more reproductive asset to this State than the condition of drift that we now have and the rather wretched palliatives that we have in other respects for dealing with the present terrible condition of the unemployed in this country.  I hope the Minister will be able to give some indication that the matter of reductions in the Estimate will be reconsidered shortly and that, whether by way of Supplementary Estimates or some other way, the question of forestry in this country will receive the attention it deserves.</P>
    <P>I am old enough, as I am sure other members of the House are, to remember the attention that public representatives in this country, 25 or 30 years ago, devoted to this subject, as a subject that should get due attention when self-government was attained for this country.  Agriculture, fishery and forestry were three of the items that figured in the forefront of the national hopes that were expressed by the national representatives at that time. They would be very disappointed to find how little we have done in that direction, and while the Minister is able to point to the creation of certain forestry plantations in various parts of the country, they are few and far between, and there certainly is no great push, such as we might reasonably expect now after 20 years, in the way of availing of opportunities for doing something of this kind.  I regret that there is no sign of anything like that in the Vote this year.</P>
    <P>I consider that it is bad economy to reduce a service of this kind.  I consider that it is bad economy, apart altogether from the value to the nation of the growth and production of timber, to allow our unemployed people in the villages, towns and rural areas, who are ready to take part in work of this kind, to exist on charity of one kind or another at the present time while in every parish in the country there are opportunities for doing work both in this direction and <Col N="1995" /> other directions.  Beyond that, I have little to say.  I have had contact with the officials in the forestry branch of the Minister&rsquo;s Department and have found them helpful, useful and courteous in endeavouring to explain the various little problems and difficulties that arise in connection with this service, and where other members of the House have had contact with these officials, I am sure they would say the same.  That is the story generally. Occasionally, however, there are some little exceptions&mdash;not here, but on the outdoor staff.</P>
    <P>I think that the Minister would find, on examination, that he has been somewhat unfortunate in his selection, in the case of a very small minority, of the people who have contact with those who are at work on forestry down the country.  There have been a few experiences that were rather unhappy. I mean no reflection on the Minister or on the officials of his Department here, who are very anxious to do what they can within the limits of a policy that seems to be always confined within very narrow limits, but there have been instances down the country that have not been so happy.  I have had representations from parts of the constituency of West Cork to the effect that men employed on forestry schemes were not always recruited from the labour exchanges.  I think there ought to be a set method for recruiting people for work of this kind where employment is available, and that local labourers living in the vicinity should have first claim.  I think that that is enunciating a principle that does not bear contradiction.</P>
    <P>There ought not to be any haphazard or erratic sort of system with regard to recruiting labour, any system that might lend itself to a certain amount of suspicion.  I should like to reiterate my disappointment that the introduction of this Vote does not synchronise with a progressive drive in the acquisition of land and the planting of trees, with a better prospect of absorbing large <Col N="1996" /> numbers of our unemployed, so many of whom are with very little hope at the present time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardWalsh" hpid="Mr. R. Walsh Mr. R. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister will be good enough to indicate what is the smallest area of land that will be taken over by the Forestry Department for afforestation purposes?  In various parts of the country there are small areas of land that were formerly forest land, before certain estates were sold out by the landlords and the timber taken off them, and I should like to know if such small areas would now be useful for afforestation purposes because, in a great many instances, they are useless for agricultural purposes.  I know of two or three cases where there are 20 or 25 acres of such land, and perhaps the Minister will indicate if the Forestry Department would consider small units of that type suitable for tree planting. Is there any prospect of the saw mills at Cong, Ashford, County Mayo, being reopened?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFlynn" hpid="Mr. J. Flynn Mr. J. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to urge on the Minister the advisability of reconsidering some of the afforestation schemes which have been submitted from various parts of my constituency. Inspectors from the Department were down there and they did their utmost to have the schemes put into operation, but some little difficulties presented themselves, arising out of the rights of certain tenants, and the schemes were held up for that reason.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recently I approached the Land Commission with the object of getting them to make certain lands available for afforestation purposes.  The people down there are very disappointed that something has not been done.  We know that through no fault of the Department the schemes were held up, but it is rather disappointing that the Land Commission did not make some definite move towards providing the land necessary for tree planting.  The Forestry Department would be doing a great service to our district, and indeed to the country generally, if they reconsidered <Col N="1997" /> schemes that have already been approved for portions of County Kerry.</P>
    <P>I suggest that it is really a commercial proposition and not merely a question of planting waste land with the idea of giving a certain amount of employment. These afforestation schemes will, I suggest, ultimately pay for themselves and they will be productive of much material that will be of great value to the nation.  The people that I represent are very disappointed at the way in which these forestry schemes are being dealt with.</P>
    <P>Suggestions have been made for a big forestry drive.  I suggest that when the turf production scheme is completed there should be a big effort made, before the tree planting period in October and November next, to organise a forestry drive on the same lines as the great turf drive.  Afforestation should then take pride of place and the large numbers of men now engaged in turf production could easily be diverted to tree planting.  There should be really a nation-wide effort in the matter of afforestation and I believe that in the course of time that will become a real asset to the country.</P>
    <P>I observe from the report that has been issued that the value of timber has been enhanced because of the war. The question of the export of timber has been touched upon.  I suggest there should be no export at the present time, especially in view of the scarcity of timber for housing purposes.  In my constituency housing schemes have been held up.  Contractors and workers are unable to proceed because of a shortage of timber.  Under the circumstances there should not be any export of timber.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister should institute a re-examination in relation to schemes that have been deferred, schemes such as those I have referred to in Kerry.  I realise the difficulties because of the war situation and the trouble in finding money for various forms of development.  At the same time I believe that if the afforestation idea were properly put before the people, even if money had to be raised <Col N="1998" /> by way of loan for that special project, the people would gladly subscribe.</P>

      <P>I appreciate the difficulties under which the Forestry Department has to work at the present time.  Even if we had not the emergency to contend with, the Department would have other difficulties, particularly in connection with the acquisition of land for tree planting purposes.  I am not one of those who believe there is a large portion of plantable land in the country.  I am aware, however, that there is a fair percentage of plantable land.</P>
      <P>In some cases difficulties arise in acquisition by ordinary negotiations. I am aware of a case where nine farmers who had rights on a certain mountain met to consider selling to the Land Commission.  A representative of the Forestry Department decided that it was suitable land for planting. Eight of the people were willing to sell, but the ninth would not agree.  In a case like that I suggest that the Land Commission should have compulsory powers.  Another question that arises on this Estimate concerns supplies of timber for the manufacture of egg boxes and butter boxes.  That is a matter of importance to the poultry and dairying industries, and if suitable timber was available for the purpose it would be very useful.</P>

      <P>I direct the Minister&rsquo;s attention to sub-head C (3) under which £2,700 is provided for timber conversion. Provision is made for the runing of a saw-mill at Dundrum, County Tipperary, and a small portion for County Galway.  I consider the amount too small to provide for the conversion of timber.  While timber is being imported Ashford saw-mills are closed down.  It is three years since this estate was taken over and where previously there were 25 to 40 persons employed in the conversion of timber only about four persons are employed there by the Forestry Department, so that the place is practically closed <Col N="1999" /> down.  As there are large quantities of timber available on the estate I suggest that the Ashford saw-mills should be reopened.  The Minister should also take active steps to stop the exportation of timber in view of the scarcity that prevails.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that the total acreage under forestry is 146,000 acres.  Can the Minister say what acreage is available for planting?  There has been a good deal of discussion about this matter for some years, and I should like to know if the importance of forestry has been exaggerated.  Much would depend on the acreage available. As timber is scarce now, possibly steps could be taken to preserve supplies suitable for building purposes.  I am afraid the supply is limited but such quantities of sound timber as are here should be reserved for the building of houses.  We were dependent in the past on imports of foreign timber for house construction.  I am sure the Minister would not approve of the indiscriminate felling of trees, especially in view of the fuel shortage, but it might be wise, in order to safeguard against such practice, that the Department should communicate with the various councils giving permission for the cutting of trees that are to all intents and purposes useless.  If that were done useful trees would not suffer the same fate.  It would be a mistake if these were cut down.  It might be a good move if parish councils were given permission to cut down useless timber. As the growing of timber does not give a quick return for the money expended, forestry is a difficult proposition.  I see the point in reducing the Estimate, having regard to the shortage of essential supplies.  Could the Minister say whether forestry can be made what some people think a source of great wealth to the country, and can he give the number of acres available for planting?  I notice that provision is made for the acquisition of a few thousand acres here and there.  The total is not very large, even when added to the acreage in the hands of the Department at present.  Apart from the advantages of tree-planting it must <Col N="2000" /> be remembered that the more land devoted to that purpose the less will be available for tillage.  As far as I am concerned it might be better to have less land devoted to forestry if it could be put to better use in tillage.  Perhaps the Minister could give an idea of the value of forestry to the country generally, having regard to the amount of money expended on it each year.</P>
      <P>One has also to take into consideration the fact that a quick return will not accrue from this expenditure.  It is a waste of time and of money to be planting trees if they are going to be cut down before they mature properly. There is that danger at all times, but particularly during an emergency such as the present.  The Minister and his officials will have to take strong measures to prevent anything occurring that would militate against the work they have been doing over a number of years.</P>

      <P>I agree with Deputy Meaney that immediate steps should be taken to make timber available for the making of egg and poultry boxes. Now is the time to make preparations so that boxes will be available for the Christmas trade.  I believe that great difficulty is being experienced in getting timber for this purpose.  I am told that beech and other varieties of timber grown in the country would be suitable, and hence I suggest to the Minister that he should see that it is made available for box making.</P>

      <P>Has the Minister any information to give the House regarding the forest fires that were reported to have taken place last year in the County Tipperary?  Can he tell us the number of trees that have been planted on the 6,000 acres of land that <Col N="2001" /> he referred to in his speech, and has he any information to give regarding the Department&rsquo;s activities in the way of offering advice to persons who have plantations to the effect that it would be much better to cut down mature trees rather than allow them to remain and become decayed, when they may fall and cause damage?  Would the Minister indicate the provisions in the 1928 Forestry Act with regard to replanting, and tell us to what extent inroads have been made on the cutting of immature timber?  He rather indicated that he has fears about that, but did not tell us in the statement he was good enough to favour us with&mdash;the statement is fairly long, but not very detailed&mdash;what the actual position is. Has the Department any definite policy with regard to forestry operations as a whole, or is it merely taking land wherever it can get it?  I suggest there are certain counties which might benefit considerably from the extensive planting of trees, especially land subject to flooding.  The planting might have the effect of correcting the flooding to some extent.  Perhaps some other Department of State might help in that direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the price paid for land, as far as one can judge from the figures which have been made available, the normal price paid would appear to be about £3 10s. 0d. an acre. Sometimes it is even less than that. Would the Minister tell the House whether any resinous trees are being planted?  Trees of that variety are planted in very inhospitable regions on the Continent, in the north of France, and in the north of Spain across the Pyrenees.  One notices them there, with the little tins used for collecting the resin.  I would like to know if the Department is engaging in any sphere of activity of that kind.  Finally, would the Minister say if any suggestions have been made by the Department to the people who are felling trees to the effect that, in the long run, it might be better to uproot them completely than to leave stumps two or three feet high in the earth?  I do not know of anything more unsightly <Col N="2002" /> than these tree stumps.  It might cost a little more, when felling trees, to uproot them altogether, but for my part I would prefer to see that done than to have these tree stumps left in the ground.</P>

      <P>I desire to draw the Minister&rsquo;s attention to the mountain fires, some of them very extensive, that occurred last year in the County Dublin.  I should like to know if proper precautions are being taken, by means of extra supervision, to see that outbreaks of that sort will be avoided in the future.  These outbreaks do enormous damage, especially in areas where planting is being done. Some people, unfortunately, seem to take a pleasure in setting fire to furze. I know, of course, it is very difficult to cope with people who do that, but a warning should be issued, and if people are found offending in that respect in future they should be severely punished.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I had better open my reply by explaining that under the provisions of the Forestry Act of 1928 the Minister may, when granting a licence for the felling of a tree, impose the condition that one or more trees must be planted to replace the tree to be felled, and must allow a period of not less than 12 months within which to carry out such replanting.  The number of trees required to be planted under such conditions is usually the number required for the planting of the area on proper sylvicultural lines. The number sometimes seems excessive &mdash;perhaps six times, or an even greater proportion of the number actually felled has to be replanted&mdash;but, allowing for failures and for thinnings, the final stocking with mature trees should be normal.  There is no condition in the Act which requires that any tree to be felled must be cut down within a definite period.  As replanting <Col N="2003" /> usually has to be done on the ground from which the mature trees are being felled, replanting cannot in most cases be carried out until the felling has been completed, and it is, therefore, necessary to allow in the licence a period considerably in excess of the <Col N="2004" /> minimum provided in the Act.  I move to report progress.</P>
