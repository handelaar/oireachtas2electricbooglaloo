    <Speaker pid="AlfredPByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne (Junior) Mr. Byrne (Junior)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne (Junior)</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether under Section 64 of the Air Raid Precautions Act, 1939, he has made any arrangements for the payment of compensation in the event of injury to persons engaged in air-raid precautions activities, and, if so, if he will make the details known to the personnel of the various air-raid services; further, if no such arrangements have been made, if he will expedite a scheme for that purpose.</P>

      <P>A compensation scheme under the section mentioned was duly made. A copy of the scheme was sent by the Department of Defence to each local authority responsible for the organisation of air-raid precautions services. A copy was also sent to the secretary to the Building Trades Group, Dublin Trades Union Council, from whose members the rescue and demolition service is recruited.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health whether he will initiate the necessary steps to establish a voluntary co-ordinating committee for free meal schemes administrated for Dublin City in order to avoid overlapping and consequent waste of effort and resources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Dr. Ward) Francis Constantine (Dr.) Ward">
      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Dr. Ward)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not satisfied <Col N="1290" /> that a voluntary co-ordinating committee such as the Deputy suggests is necessary, but even if it were necessary, I think it should be brought about by means other than official intervention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Parliamentary Secretary aware that a number of public-spirited persons have initiated different schemes, the common purpose of all of which is to provide food for poor people at prices that those people can afford to pay, ranging from the Penny Dinners to the Guild of Goodwill, and that unless something is done to co-ordinate the excellent public-spirited work that is being undertaken by all these people, there is real danger of overlapping and of serious waste, and that that will not manifest itself fully until next winter, when it will be too late to take the necessary action?  I point out that, in the absence of the Minister&rsquo;s taking the initiative in this matter, it is a question of its being nobody&rsquo;s business to suggest the co-ordination of all these excellent activities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>The position may be as stated by the Deputy, but I am not aware that these voluntary organisations of individuals, who are operating such schemes, would welcome Government intervention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I suggest the possibility of something short of Government intervention?  Would it not be possible for the Parliamentary Secretary to take the initiative to bring these people together and suggest to them a practical scheme for voluntary co-ordination which would make the work of each of them more effective and the work of the whole more efficient?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>I see no reason why they cannot come together themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>But suppose they will not agree to consider the desirability of taking the initiative in the matter, would it not be possible for the Parliamentary Secretary to take the initiative, even if he made up his mind that, <Col N="1291" /> unless all parties were ready and willing to accept his good offices, he would withdraw?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>Would such intervention be welcomed in advance?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Parliamentary Secretary aware that some of these bodies are finding the demands on them greater than their resources, and does he contemplate in any way coming to their assistance?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>To those bodies which, as the Parliamentary Secretary knows, are engaging in this excellent work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>What is to prevent these bodies from communicating with the Minister to the effect that they desire intervention?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Because everybody&rsquo;s business is nobody&rsquo;s business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not desirable to avoid waste in connection with this excellent work?  The Minister represents <Col N="1292" /> the community and the State, and surely it is obviously his function to take the initiative, even if he makes up his mind that he will not pursue the matter unless his intervention is warmly welcomed?  Otherwise, there is nobody to take the first step.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture if he will state what regulations, if any, are in operation to prevent the wholesale slaughter of milch goats, and if he will take steps to safeguard from speculating purchasers the small owners and their families who are dependent on goats&rsquo; milk during a period when no other supply is available.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne (Junior)</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Co-ordination of Defensive Measures if he will state in respect of Dublin City and Dun Laoghaire Borough the number of auxiliary fire-stations ready for use in the event of emergency and the number of fire-engines available to each auxiliary station.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Defence (Mr. Moylan)</NameTxt>
      <P>In addition to the four existing fire-stations in Dublin it is proposed to have 15 auxiliary fire-stations and one auxiliary fire-station in Dun Laoghaire in addition to the existing station.  Four of the Dublin auxiliary stations are being opened and manned almost immediately and in an emergency the remainder can be made ready for use in about 72 hours.  The auxiliary station in Dun Laoghaire is being made ready for immediate use.  Three to four pumping units are being made available in each of the auxiliary fire-stations.  In addition, three of the existing stations are being augmented.  The existing station <Col N="1293" /> in Dun Laoghaire is also being augmented.  In addition to the 15 auxiliary stations, four heavy duty units for use on two barges are available and can be made ready for use in a couple of days.  A total of seven heavy duty units, nine large trailer unit and 43 light trailer units are available for Dublin.  One large trailer unit and eight light trailer units are available for Dun Laoghaire.</P>
      <P>Efforts are being made to obtain two further heavy duty units and two large trailer units for Dublin.</P>
      <P>A reserve of six heavy duty self-propelled units and six large trailer units is being established at a convenient distance from Dublin.  This reserve is to supplement the equipment in any district which may be seriously affected.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for the Co-ordination of Defensive Measures if he will state in respect of Dublin City and Dun Laoghaire Borough (1) the numbers of trained persons authoritatively appointed to and engaged in each of the various branches of air-raid precautions activities; (2) whether any limit has been set to the number of volunteers to be accepted into any or all of the various branches, and, if so, on what basis and for what reasons; and (3) what will be the duties and the status of the &ldquo;auxiliary wardens&rdquo; who are now being enrolled.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>1.&mdash;The following are the establishments for the various services for the air-raid precautions scheme in Dublin City:&mdash;4,500 wardens, 1,500 for first aid, 760 for fire-fighting, 600 for rescue, 130 for decontamination, 1,700 for emergency communications.</P>
      <P>The numbers trained and appointed to the services are as follows:&mdash;Wardens, 3,760; first aid, 1,500; fire-fighting, 300; rescue, 350; decontamination, 130; emergency communications, 1,470.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The establishments for Dun Laoghaire Borough are:&mdash;325 wardens, 120 for first aid, 150 for fire-fighting, 40 <Col N="1294" /> for rescue, 36 for decontamination, 200 for emergency communications.  The requirements have been trained and appointed except in the case of emergency communications, for which only 60 have so far been appointed.</P>
    <P>2.&mdash;The limit to the numbers to be appointed has been fixed at the establishments. These establishments provide for ample reserves.  There are very few sectors in which the establishment for any service has been exceeded. In these cases the volunteers received training and provide for extra reserves.  It is not proposed to appoint volunteers in excess of requirements. In any case the equipment for them would be expensive and difficult to obtain.</P>
    <P>3.&mdash;There are no such things as auxiliary wardens.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Parliamentary Secretary aware that, at the moment, wardens are being instructed to enrol persons anxious to act as auxiliary wardens, and that there is a great deal of ambiguity as to what their status will be?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have pointed out to the Deputy that there are no such things as auxiliary wardens.  In very few places has the established figure been exceeded.  Where it is exceeded in any particular place, the extra members are fully trained as a reserve of wardens, but we cannot equip them fully.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Estimate be referred back for re-consideration. This motion has been put down because the members of the Labour Party are not satisfied that the money asked for in this Vote will be spent for the purpose for which it is intended by the House at any rate.  If this House is to be asked, as it has been from time to time, to agree to the establishment of commissions of inquiry, it certainly should not do so except on the very distinct and definite understanding that the reports of such commissions, for which the taxpayers have to pay, will be furnished to the Deputies and to the public for their information. I realise probably as well as anybody sitting on these benches that the present Government is a Party-minded Government.  I was listening to the head of the Government when he said here some time ago that he welcomed constructive and helpful criticism from the Opposition.  I say that it is impossible for the members of the Opposition to give useful advice or advance constructive criticism unless they are furnished with the information which <Col N="1307" /> they are entitled to receive as members of the House.</P>
      <P>In that respect I consider that it is very unfair on the part of the Government to hold up the publication for a long period of reports of a number of these commissions.  It is nearly two years ago since the House agreed, on a motion moved by the then Minister for Industry and Commerce, to set up the Transport Tribunal.  I am not going to repeat what I said in this House before concerning the case made for the establishment of that tribunal by the then Minister for Industry and Commerce.  He indicated to the House that the question to be considered by the tribunal was of such urgency and importance that he expected the report of the tribunal would be furnished to the House at the beginning of 1939, two months after it was established.  That very valuable report is still locked up in some secret pigeon-hole in the Department of Industry and Commerce or some other Government Department. I contend that it is very unfair to expect this House in future to agree to the establishment of tribunals of that kind and to spend the taxpayers&rsquo; money in conducting the inquiries when the Government refuses to give the information contained in the report of that tribunal to Deputies and to the public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Finance was responsible a number of years ago for setting up a Drainage Commission. According to a reply given to a Parliamentary question by the Minister for Finance, that Commission submitted its report in October last.  Although we are asked by the Head of the Government to submit constructive proposals for the solution of the difficult pressing problems that require to be dealt with by the Government and by the representatives of the people, we have been so far denied the information which would enable us to submit those constructive proposals and suggestions.  I ask the Minister for Finance, who was responsible for the establishment of the Drainage Commission, to tell the House why he has held up the publication of that report since last October; or to give any good reason why <Col N="1308" /> Deputies should not have access to the report of a public commission of this kind, or why the public at large, who are more deeply interested probably than any Deputy in the report of that Commission, should not have the information at their disposal.  I assume that many civil servants have access to the reports of these tribunals and commissions.  I personally deny the right of any civil servant to have access to these reports while Deputies, who are the representatives of the people, and who, in the name of the people, have agreed to the establishment of these commissions and tribunals, are refused access to them.</P>
    <P>There is another and much more serious case in which the Government have up to the present withheld the publication of the report of a certain body which was set up under the Industrial Courts Act.  It is a long time ago since the Dublin Bakery Trade Inquiry was set up as a result of a motion submitted by the Minister concerned.  I understand that the report of that body was submitted to the responsible Minister in February last.  I also understand that there is an obligation on the Minister concerned, or, at any rate, on the Government, under the Industrial Courts Act to publish the report of that inquiry.</P>

      <P>There is nothing in this Vote to cover the sins of the past, but certainly there is an opportunity now to make a protest against the failure or refusal of the Government to publish the reports of the tribunals and commissions which have been set up and for which the taxpayers have already paid.  On this Vote, and before any further moneys are voted for this purpose, we are entitled to get the reasons why the representatives of the people cannot have access to the information contained in these reports.  I personally, and the members of my Party, will not agree in future to spend the taxpayers&rsquo; money on setting up <Col N="1309" /> commissions of inquiry or tribunals on motions moved by the Ministers concerned until we get an assurance here and now that these reports will be available to Deputies and will be published and circulated, so that the information contained in them will be supplied to the people who are expected to pay the cost of those inquiries. I should like to hear from the Minister for Finance or the Parliamentary Secretary the reasons for the refusal to publish those reports, particularly the refusal of the Minister concerned, to publish, as required by law, the report of the Dublin Bakery Trade Inquiry.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support Deputy Davin&rsquo;s motion on the general principle that he asserts. There are two other points which I should like to raise generally.  We voted a certain amount of money for the Commission on Vocational Organisation. That commission has now been sitting for a very long time and not a scrap of the very voluminous evidence given before that commission has been made available in any way for Deputies. Some day, I suppose, we will get a report as big as the Banking Commission&rsquo;s report, accompanied by a couple of volumes of evidence more voluminous still.  If the Government attach to the work of that commission the importance that they seem to attach to it, and if they want to be supported in whatever they may do as a result of that commission, they are not doing their duty in regard to helping those who are interested in the evidence given before the commission and the lines on which thought is travelling so far as the witnesses and the commission itself are concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the same time, while the commission has been sitting a long time and taking a lot of evidence which must bear on the question of trade union organisation, we have had presented to the House an important Bill, and I understand we are to be presented with others, dealing with trade union organisation. I think it is most unfair to very important interests that the matter of vocational organisation of any kind <Col N="1310" /> should be treated in this particular way.  Personally, I think that we should not be asked at this particular time to consider a measure dealing with trade union organisation without being told whether the Commission on Vocational Organisation has been dealing with that matter and proposes to report on it.</P>
    <P>I raise the question, principally, to say that it is high time the evidence that has been given before the Vocational Organisation Commission, if it has ceased taking evidence, should be published so that we may have a chance of reading it before the commission&rsquo;s report reaches us.  If the usual practice that Deputy Davin has spoken about is going to be followed, it is likely to be a couple of years before we see the report from the Government&rsquo;s hands.</P>
    <P>We set up an Agricultural Commission a few years ago.  The Estimate before us shows that the cost of it last year was £1,020.  The members of the commission have not yet been chloroformed, but the whole commission idea seems to have been chloroformed, without being put out of existence.  As far as we can judge from the Estimate before us, it is not the Government&rsquo;s intention to reassemble this commission during the present year.  I think it is of much greater importance that the Agricultural Commission should sit this year than any of the other commissions mentioned.  I pointed out the other day that the annual gross production per person engaged in agricultural occupations in this country is £77 a year.  In Great Britain and Northern Ireland the figure is £194.  We have heard enough from the Government Benches recently to understand that they realise how important the agricultural industry is to the general economy of the country and of how much more important it is likely to be in the future; how necessary it is not only to work hard at the present moment, but to keep a look out for developments in the world of the future in which our agricultural products will have to fight for a market. There is no more important commission that we could have sitting at the <Col N="1311" /> present than the Agricultural Commission, and I want to know why it has been chloroformed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to support the protest that has been made by Deputy Davin against the delay of the Government in publishing the reports of the tribunals and inquiries to which he made reference.  In the old days in this country, the setting up of tribunals and royal commissions provided abundant material for comedians.  Their setting up was regarded as an easy method of shelving awkward questions by those who then ruled this country. If one drops the prefix &ldquo;royal,&rdquo; one can say that the setting up of tribunals and inquiries here has now become part of the stock-in-trade of political comedians.  The purpose seems to be to humbug the people, and to sidetrack important issues.  A very serious position has been reached here, due to the attitude adopted by responsible Ministers with regard to the publication of the reports of commissions. The members of the House or the people generally have not been treated properly. Deputy Davin referred to the reports of some important commissions, and to the failure of responsible Ministers to give any satisfactory reply with regard to them.  I understood the Parliamentary Secretary to say that the report of the bakery inquiry does not come within the scope of this Estimate, and that, consequently, he is not in a position to answer any questions concerning it.  The question this inquiry dealt with is a very important one.  We ought to have some information with regard to this body&rsquo;s report since we are being asked to vote money for it in this Estimate.  Why is the report being held up?</P>

      <P>The Transport Tribunal, which has really become historic, was, as Deputy Davin has pointed out, set up following an urgent appeal made to the House by the then Minister for Industry and Commerce.  Its report has been the subject of many questions in the House.  The Government and the Ministers have not been allowed to fall asleep on this report.  Questions, dealing with it, have been tabled time after time.  The report has long since been presented to the Minister, but so far it has not been made available to the public.  As a matter of fact, the then Minister for Industry and Commerce, when moving for the setting up of the Tribunal in the month of December, said that he expected to have its report in the following February.  I appealed to him not to proceed with undue speed since the question to be examined was such a serious one.  I said that while we did not want urgency we did not want chaos either.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish the Minister would use another adjective.  I do not propose to make any further remarks on the question of the transport report, because I have expressed myself fairly freely on it, and so have Deputy Davin and others.  Matters of that kind cannot, however, be over-stressed if we take the Minister&rsquo;s own setting out of the case.  The problem has not improved with the hatching.  I hope that that &ldquo;no far distant date&rdquo; will come immediately.  The Dublin Housing Commission was set up early in 1939, and there are some other commissions which may not come within the category of &ldquo;old crocks.&rdquo;  We have the Vocational Organisation Commission, the Agricultural Commission, the summer Time Commission, and the Soldiers&rsquo; and Sailors&rsquo; Land Trust Commission, which are comparatively modern.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the really serious points in connection with these commissions was the attitude taken up by a Minister as to whether or not he had responsibility to this House to make a report back to it concerning them.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce, in dealing with the question of releasing the Transport Tribunal Report, said he doubted that he had any responsibility to furnish that report to the House.  I am sure the Minister for Finance would not take that line of action.  If he does not agree with it, I hope he will communicate his view to his colleague, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, and make clear that he does not agree with the contention that, when this House gives authority for setting up public inquiries, the reports of these bodies are intended only for use in the Minister&rsquo;s Department. These inquiries are set up for the guidance of the people of the <Col N="1315" /> country and for their education.  They are intended to enable them to come to a sound opinion on matters of public interest.  The obvious channel for conveying that information to the public is the Parliament elected by the people.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce felt that he had no responsibility to the House in this connection. That raises a really serious question which must be considered by Deputies if we are to be asked to set up inquiries, tribunals and commissions. Ministers must be told in advance, and educated if they are in ignorance of this point, that they are not the masters but the servants of the House, as we are the servants of the people. If there is any misconception on that, we should not add to the dangers of Government dictatorship by giving them additional commissions, the results of which they will refuse to furnish to Deputies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Commissions are optimistic bodies in their origin, in their intention and in their procedure.  They lay themselves out to get a great deal of very valuable information, as they hope, in a great hurry.  As a rule, these anticipations are not realised.  Difficulties of one kind or another present themselves, other aspects of the question appear in evidence, and the result is that the report is delayed.  You had in the case of the Transport Tribunal a very excellent example of that.  It was believed that it was possible to regard that as rather a simple question which could be dealt with upon simple and rapid lines.  That proved not to be possible.  The same thing has happened in relation to the Vocational Organisation Commission.  Some people thought that inquiry would be a very simple process in that case, but, when they came to the facts, the number of institutions with a vocational character of one kind or another and their permutations, combinations, inter-relations and reactions seemed to stretch out into a vista which almost reached eternity.  You can make commissions very short by deliberately cutting out a great many of the subsidiary issues, but, if you take these subsidiary issues, they stretch out into longer periods than those who initiated them expected. That is the explanation why commissions last a long time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As to why reports of commissions are not published immediately, the same amount of attention and examination given to coming to a decision on the evidence is required on the part of those whose business it is to use public funds for the purpose of carrying the reports into effect.  It would be quite simple for the Government <Col N="1317" /> simply to take a very rough look through the report of a commission and say: &ldquo;We, generally, agree with that.&rdquo;  That would be a very brief way of doing it but, very often, when such a report comes to be examined, it is found that its interaction on other activities of the State requires very definite consideration.</P>

      <P>That would be to form half an opinion on half the evidence, then change that and try to co-relate it with the remainder of the evidence. I should prefer to get the whole of it. That is one of the difficulties.  The second difficulty is that the authority in relation to the procedure of these commissions, unless otherwise decided in advance by the Dáil, rests with themselves.  It is up to them to decide whether the evidence shall be put forward in public or in private and at what rate they shall furnish it to the Government.  Take the case of the Vocational Commission, a very interesting commission, with extremely detailed information, a great deal of which would be profoundly uninteresting in itself, but, co-related, might be of extraordinary interest. No portion of that evidence has been submitted to the Government, no interim report has been submitted, and they are not in possession of one word or one portion of it.  Until the Commission exercises its own jurisdiction nothing can be done.</P>
      <P>Arising out of this discussion, the House may say in future, in relation to commissions, that they will lay down precise standards which will remove that discretion from commissions.  In relation to a particular commission, the House may say that they must publish evidence and that they must make an interim report, but until that is done the discretion must be left in their hands.  To take the Commission on Vocational Organisation as an example&mdash;in respect of which there is a complaint that there has been no publication of their report or of evidence submitted to them&mdash;the House is in possession of all the information which the Government has in relation to that matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr. Hugo Flinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash; It has been the practice to take the discussion on Votes 9, 10 and 11 together. Vote 9 bears the salaries, wages and incidental expenses of the Administrative staff of the Office of Public Works, including the Special Works Division which deals with works financed by the Vote for Employment <Col N="1321" /> Schemes&mdash;No. 67.  The cost of the Special Works staff is ultimately recovered from the latter Vote.  There are no unusual features in the Vote for the Office of Public Works.  The estimate is less than that for last year by £1,066&mdash;a casual variation in a Vote of £145,000.  I told you twelve months ago of the decision to close down the issue of loans formerly made under the Land Improvement and Land Law Acts.  As a consequence, the administrative provision for this service, which for a number of years has been decreasing in importance, has disappeared.  The Agricultural Credit Corporation now deals with applications for loans of this type.</P>
      <P>Vote 10 (Public Works) at £1,141,615 is about £100,000 less than last year. In normal times some of the sub-heads of this Vote are difficult to forecast with any accuracy, as progress&mdash;and consequently expenditure &mdash; depends upon factors not wholly within our control. This is in particular the case with the largest item, that for new works which represents about two-thirds of the total expenditure.  Last year I referred to the effect which a curtailment in the supply of building materials was likely to have on this service.  We were fortunate enough, however, to be able to carry on without much interference save that costs were, of course, increased and there were some inevitable delays.  The prospects for 1941-42 are not so hopeful.  Stocks of certain classes of material are running very low, and although we have made and are making every effort to substitute native products, the substitution involves planning problems of a somewhat experimental character and can only meet in part the difficulties. However, as the figures show, we have made provision for expenditure on the necessary services on the basis that we shall be able to give employment in the building line almost to the same extent as in the preceding year.  The number of token Votes of £10 appearing in the details of the New Works Sub-head represents the extent to which desirable works have had to be postponed in favour of more urgent requirements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are providing £250,000 for grants <Col N="1322" /> for National School buildings and improvements. Last year our estimate was £175,000 which, as I said then, was based on a pessimistic view of the difficulties with which school managers and building contractors might be confronted. In fact, we succeeded in spending £220,000, and as we have large commitments on our books, in respect of old and obsolete school-buildings, as well as in respect of very large schools in re-housing areas, we have&mdash;notwithstanding growing difficulties in the matter of materials&mdash;hopes of exceeding this expenditure in the current year.</P>
    <P>Expenditure on Defence Requirements is naturally heavy, over £200,000 being provided for essential military works.  The anticipated expenditure on airports is down by about £200,000 due to the fact that work on the Dublin Airport is drawing to a close and that the programme of sea-plane anchorage at the Shannon has, in consequence of war conditions, been modified. The new headquarters for the Department of Industry and Commerce is going ahead reasonably well.  Work on the reconstruction and extension of the Veterinary College at Ballsbridge is in hand.  The scheme will cost about £45,000 and will supply a much needed improvement in the accommodation of this important institution.  Two other large projects connected with agricultural education appear this year for the first time&mdash;new buildings estimated to cost in the neighbourhood of £50,000 each for the agricultural stations at Clonakilty and Athenry.  They are however, only in the preliminary stage at the moment and it will be some time before the detailed schemes are ready.</P>
    <P>In the other subheads of this Vote Deputies will observe increases in the items for maintenance and fuel and light.  By sundry savings we sought to keep the maintenance expenditure down to £175,000 last year.  We were not wholly successful, and as the work which was held over last year is in some cases now necessary, the figure for 1941-42 has been increased to £200,000. Rises in the price of coal, turf, fuel, oil, etc., account for the increase under subhead F.</P>
    <P>No new drainage works are in contemplation. <Col N="1323" /> Our commitments in the present year are confined to completion of the Kilmastulla district, and clean-up works on the five or six remaining cases awaiting final award.</P>
    <P>The Vote for Haulbowline Dockyard is in the usual form.  It shows a decrease of £970 in comparison with 1940-41, which is in great part due to the fact that no provision is required in the current year for submarine water-main, the renewal of which has been completed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Estimate be referred back for reconsideration.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I am surprised that the Parliamentary Secretary, in his rather brief review of the activities of his Department, has not furnished any information concerning the assistance which has been given&mdash;I know some has been given&mdash;in connection with the production of turf or fuel for the coming winter.  The Parliamentary head of this Department has been taking a very active part in connection with the turf development scheme since it was initiated some months ago, and has made many statements throughout the country as to the possibility of doubling and, if possible, trebling the production of turf in order to meet the fuel requirements of the community during the coming winter.</P>

      <P>Before we come to deal with the coming year, I shall review briefly the work of the past year.  The amount provided by the Oireachtas for the relief of distress in the year just closed was £1,400,000, of which £1,212,593 was expended within the financial year.  To this expenditure should be added the contributions by local authorities amounting to £334,877, <Col N="1328" /> making a gross expenditure of £1,547,470.  Details of the estimated expenditure to 31st March, 1941, under the different sub-heads of the Vote are as follows: Public Health Works, £259,515; Housing Site Development Works, £47,590; Urban Employment Schemes, £316,728; Rural Employment Schemes, £534,435; Minor Employment Schemes, £219,623; Marine Works, £3,764; Small Land Reclamation Schemes and Farm Improvements Schemes, £54,463; Seed Oats, etc., Lime Subsidies, £53,501; Peat Development Schemes, £2,587; Miscellaneous Works, including administrative expenses, £55,264.

The Deputy may take it that there has been a great deal of peat development in the sense of making roads into turbary, etc., included in the minor employment schemes on which £219,000 odd was spent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Up to 1940-41, the major portion of the expenditure on employment schemes carried out by local authorities was devoted to improvement works on roads and footpaths and, in the process, the supply of proposals having a reasonably high labour content was becoming exhausted, particularly in a number of the urban areas.  For some time past, therefore, the possibility of finding alternative schemes of the amenity type has been under examination and in 1940-41 an effort was made to substitute for road and footpath works, schemes for the development of playgrounds and parks and other works of local amenity.  In response to an invitation to put forward schemes of this kind, proposals were received from 21 urban district councils and three county councils and 32 schemes in all <Col N="1329" /> were actually undertaken at an estimated total cost of £58,000.  These included seven park development works, eight playgrounds, three fairgreen improvement works, four river bank improvement works and a swimming pool scheme.  Amenity works of this kind have considerable merit for inclusion in the relief programme, but it is not at all clear that there is any significant supply of such schemes which can conveniently be carried out.  I was much more hopeful of the size of the pool we were opening out than actual experience has justified.  All I can say is that I am very anxious to encourage schemes of that kind which have a high labour content and a certain social advantage.</P>
    <P>The maximum number of workmen employed at any one time during the year was 38,982.  The average number employed during the period up to October was 8,267, and from November to March, 24,212.  Of these, approximately 77 per cent. were workmen who would otherwise have been entitled to unemployment assistance.  The average period of employment given to individual workmen varies with the class of work and the different areas, but it is estimated that from 60,000 to 70,000 individual workmen received part-time employment of three to four days per week for an average period of 15 weeks in the year.  The total number of applications received for minor employment schemes during the year was 2,500 and about 8,500 proposals were investigated and reported on, including proposals already partially carried out.  During the spring and summer approximately 450 small drainage schemes were carried out at a cost of £25,000.</P>
    <P>The provision for 1941-42 is £1,000,000. To the amount of this Vote must be added contributions expected from local authorities, estimated at £236,500. This gives a total sum of £1,236,500 available for expenditure within the financial year 1941-42.</P>

      <P>Yes.  This gives a total sum of £1,236,500 available for expenditure in the financial year 1941-42, and to enable this expenditure to be achieved within the time limit it is proposed to authorise the initiation of schemes involving a State grant of £358,000 in excess of the amount of the Vote.  As the House is aware, you have to initiate a considerably larger volume of schemes in the particular year than it is possible to carry out in the year.  This sum, together with a proportionate amount for local contributions, will be carried forward at the 31st March, 1942, to form part of the ensuing year&rsquo;s programme.  In this regard it is necessary again to remind the Dáil that a large portion of each year&rsquo;s Vote is allocated to local authorities, and the fulfilment of the estimate of expenditure depends largely on the acceptance of the grants on the terms offered, and on the prompt submission of schemes by the local authorities. Subject to the foregoing remarks, the following table sets forth for each class of work the proposed expenditure in the year 1941-42:&mdash;</P>

    <P>In the administration of the Employment Schemes Vote, the aim has always been to provide temporary employment for the maximum number of persons entitled to unemployment assistance, and in proportion to their numbers in each area.  As the Dáil is aware, however, year after year the allocation of the Vote on this basis has in some cases been modified in view of the need of paying attention to works of special utility, or to preliminary works which offer a prospect of leading to employment in the future for comparatively lengthy periods. Examples of this kind are public health, turbary development and farm improvement schemes.  It is anticipated that during this year, and so long as the emergency lasts, it will be found necessary to carry out at short notice miscellaneous works of an emergency nature, as, for example, the making of roads and drains in connection with the intensive drive to produce additional turf in the country.  Such works will generally provide employment in one degree or another&mdash;or will be closely related to the provision of employment&mdash;though not always in the areas or for the classes of persons most in need of it; so that here again the usual tests for a satisfactory employment scheme cannot be applied; and, to the extent to which funds for such emergency purposes are not otherwise provided for, it is proposed to find them from this Vote as and when required.</P>
    <P>Apart from such exceptional works the normal regulations affecting the distribution of moneys and the recruitment and employment of labour will continue to apply to expenditure from this Vote, but it will be clear from <Col N="1332" /> what has just been said that during the emergency, at any rate, it is neither desirable nor possible to administer the Vote on lines strictly related to the extent and intensity of unemployment. As the House is aware, we have always tried to keep almost to a mathematical standard, if it was possible, in the distribution of this money, so that it would go to the places and the people who required it, in proportion to their individual needs.  We have regarded that as a trust to be carried out in that spirit, and I think we have very determinedly and very deliberately attempted to do it in that spirit, but it is necessary in relation to certain moneys which may be included in this Vote this year to work upon another basis.  It is in the discharge of my duty to the Dáil, whose business it is to see that this Vote is carried out in the spirit in which it understands it, that I say that in relation to certain moneys in this Vote this year it may not be possible to carry it out on that strict basis.  To the extent to which it is possible to do so, that will continue to be done.</P>
    <P>In connection with a scheme proposed by the Department of Industry and Commerce for the opening up by the Turf Development Board, Limited, of 14 extensive turbary areas for the production of peat fuel on a commercial basis, provision is being made in the Vote for grants towards the cost of the necessary drainage and levelling operations. The cost of this preparatory work has been estimated at £228,900, and the intention is that of this amount £171,600 shall be made available from the Employment Schemes Vote over a period of three years, leaving a balance of £57,300 to be borne on the Vote for Industry and Commerce.  In determining the amount to be allocated from the Employment Schemes Vote, regard has been had to the likely effect of the development work in the matter of the relief of unemployment in the areas concerned.  The cost of acquisition of the 14 bogs will fall to be borne entirely on the Vote for Industry and Commerce. The Vote has been reduced in this year by a sum of £400,000 as compared with last year.  This is due to a number of considerations.  One of <Col N="1333" /> the principal of these is that for some time past there has been a growing difficulty in finding, in those areas in which there is most unemployment, schemes of work which are suitable in the sense that they have a reasonable unskilled labour content, and are at the same time such as the local or other authority would not normally carry out from their own funds either then or in the immediate future.  This position may be aggravated during the emergency by shortage of materials, machinery, and tools and plant.</P>
    <P>In addition to this, it will be understood that up to the present the general position with regard to the possible increase of unemployment owing to the emergency is obscure. Whatever increase may take place in future months, the fact is that at the moment the actual number of men on the live register of unemployment is less by about 17,000 than it was at this time last year; or, if the combined figures of the live register and workers engaged on employment schemes be taken, the reduction is somewhere about 23,000.  It should, moreover, be borne in mind that any extension of unemployment due to shortage of raw materials for factory production would affect classes of workers of whom very few would be considered suitable for employment as labourers on employment schemes.</P>
    <P>The increased tillage that is going on in the country and the employment which is likely to be afforded in the intensive drive which is now being made for the production of increased supplies of turf should have a marked effect in reducing unemployment and distress in rural areas in this year.  In this respect it should be stated that hitherto a large proportion of the Vote has been expended during the spring and summer months, and it is feared that if this practice were to be continued in rural areas, it would seriously interfere with tillage and the production of turf.  It will, therefore, be arranged in future to bring employment schemes in rural areas to a close at a much earlier date than has hitherto been the case, and this should result in a considerable reduction in expenditure.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1334" /> As the Minister has already pointed out in the Dáil, new and additional proposals for employment schemes over and above the normal programme are now under examination, and in the event of the need for additional employment arising, and if satisfactory schemes can be found, additional provision will be made.</P>

      <P>That the Estimate be referred back for reconsideration.</P>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary has given a fairly full statement of the position and has put many figures before us, but while we got the figures and the full statement, I cannot see that there was anything in the statement which would tend to relieve our fears and doubts as to the position regarding unemployment. The first thing that strikes one about this Vote is that, in a year like this, the Vote has been reduced by £400,000.  In effect, of course, it has been reduced by £500,000, because, consequent on the reduction made in the Vote by the Government, there is a reduction of almost £100,000 in the contributions by local authorities.</P>
      <P>There is, as I say, to be available in this year, £500,000 less than was voted&mdash;and I say &ldquo;voted&rdquo; advisedly&mdash; last year.  I hope I understood the Parliamentary Secretary correctly when I understood him to say that the possibilities of increased unemployment in the State this year were obscure owing to the circumstances.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">

    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. D. Morrissey Mr. D. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there any member of the Government who believes that there is not going to be a very substantial increase in the number of unemployed before the end of this financial year?  Is it a fact that, long before this, the Parliamentary Secretary conveyed to certain authorities <Col N="1335" /> that he himself, from his knowledge and information, expects that there will be a very substantial increase? But apart from what the Parliamentary Secretary or the Government may say, do we not all know that there must be a big increase in the numbers of unemployed?  The Parliamentary Secretary said that great numbers have found employment as a result of the turf cutting campaign in progress at the moment.  That is so, but do not let us forget that, so far as a very considerable proportion of the men engaged on turf cutting to-day are concerned, they are doing alternative work.  In many counties the whole county council road staff have been taken completely from the roads and put into the bogs.</P>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary did not give one reason why, in this year of all years, instead of an increase, and a substantial increase, in the amount to be made available for employment, we should have this reduction of one-third. He has not even attempted to justify it, and I think he was wise, because it would be a task beyond the Parliamentary Secretary, or any other member of the Government for that matter, for the one thing we get from the picture put before the House is that, so far as unemployment and employment schemes are concerned, there is no co-ordination whatever. There is the most absolute and complete chaos.  We have a Vote of £500,000 less, and even with that reduced Vote the Parliamentary Secretary seems to sound a doubtful note as to whether the amount we are now asked to vote can be spent within the financial year.  That, of course, does not mean that we have not got many thousands more unemployed than the £1,000,000&mdash;or even £2,000,000&mdash;would provide for.  It simply points to the absolute chaos, want of planning and want of co-ordination in Government Departments in this matter.  Then, of course, we have, although not as badly as we got it in other years, the implication or suggestion that there is no trouble about getting money, but that the real trouble is inability to find suitable schemes of work on which to spend the money.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a joke.  It is a joke, even to the Parliamentary Secretary. He shakes his head, but, if he believes that, he has not anything like the knowledge of this country which he pretends to have, or which I thought he had.  I doubt if there is a member of the House who will not agree with me when I say that you cannot travel two miles of the roads of this country without seeing useful work which could be done, work which would give a good deal of employment and which would be useful from the point of view of the country.</P>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary made the point that the trouble was that where you had large numbers of unemployed, you had not suitable schemes, and that brings me to the point at which I consider the Department, with all possible respect to the Parliamentary Secretary, has completely fallen down.  They are approaching this matter this year as they have approached it every year for the last ten years, without a change, except that they may be voting a little more money for development of roads consequent on the extensive drive for turf production.  We have the Government, in this year, 1941, so completely bereft of any idea of planning as to tell us that we have unemployed in particular areas and no work for them to do.  That comes from the Parliamentary Secretary, who told us some time ago that it was impossible to get sufficient men to go into the bogs to cut turf, that they were not to be had. It is the most hopeless confession of despair, of bankruptcy of ideas, to use a phrase very often used by the Parliamentary Secretary himself, I have ever heard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Might I put this to the Minister?  We have been talking for the last 12 months or more on the necessity for a national register in this country, but there is one very complete register that we have in this country, and that is a complete register of the unemployed: not only a complete register but a fully-classified register.  The card of every unemployed man in this country, whether he is drawing unemployment <Col N="1337" /> benefit, drawing unemployment assistance, or merely registering for employment, is there.  His occupation is stated on that card, whether he is married or single and, if he is married, the number of his dependants.  The Parliamentary Secretary is in a position to get, within 12 hours, the number of men, of any particular occupation, unemployed in any particular townland in this country.  Yet, in this year of crisis, and when we are told that unless certain steps are taken people may go hungry, and that unless very special efforts are made there will not be enough fuel for the people of this country, we get, on the one hand, the confession that in certain areas we have work but no men to do the work, and that in other areas we have plenty of idle men but no work for them to do. I put it to any member of this House: Is that a state of affairs that shows any responsibility on the part of those who are responsible for it?</P>
    <P>Just imagine making every effort that we can, appealing to every section of the community, spending big sums of money on advertising, day in and day out, that every possible effort should be made to get turf cut here, spending hundreds of thousands of pounds on making roads and on drainage, and yet, having done all that, being told that where the turf is the men are not and that where the men are there is no work for them.  Is that a problem that is insuperable?  Is it beyond the wit of the Government to bring the men to where the work is? Is it a position that the Government or any member of this House wants to continue&mdash;in which there is work to be done and, at the same time, we go on paying men unemployment assistance?</P>
    <P>I want to make my position very clear in this matter.  Both inside and outside this House I have made the claim, as often as anybody here, that if this State did not provide work for those who were willing and able to work, then it was the duty of the State to provide them with maintenance.  I stand over that, but I say this further, and I want to state it here publicly, that if there is work available in this country for working men&mdash;and particularly in a time of national crisis like this&mdash;and if those men are not prepared <Col N="1338" /> to do that work, provided they are able to work, then the State is under no obligation to maintain them.</P>
    <P>What is the use of the Parliamentary Secretary coming before this House and telling us, with the huge number of unemployed that we had and still have in this country, that the Government or his Department is doing its job when, at the end of the last financial year, £500,000 had to be turned back into the Exchequer?  Is not that, in itself, full evidence of the fact that they are only dealing with this matter on a day-to-day basis, and that £500,000&mdash;one-third of the total amount available for employment schemes last year&mdash;was turned back into the Exchequer on the 31st March last, notwithstanding the fact that the best that could be done by the Department was to give an average of 15 weeks in the year, under the rotation scheme, to between 68,000 and 70,000 men in this country?  I would ask Deputies to try to picture to themselves what that means&mdash;an average of 15 weeks&rsquo; work in a year for between 68,000 and 70,000 men.  Is it not something that we should be ashamed of?  The money is there.  I maintain that the schemes of work are there to be done.  The men are there, unfortunately.  Yet, at the end of the Department&rsquo;s work, or mismanagement as it appears to be on the surface, one-third of the total money allocated by this House to provide work for those men is turned back into the Exchequer unspent.</P>
    <P>There are unquestionably schemes of work to be done.  I should like to say that, in my opinion, one of the most useful schemes that was introduced for some time was the farm improvements scheme.  I do not want to criticise the scheme very much.  As a matter of fact, I do not want to criticise it at all, because I fully realise that it was only in its infancy in the year under review.  That, in my opinion, is a very useful scheme.  It does great work and it gives a good deal of employment. Not only that, but to my own personal knowledge there are many fields of wheat, oats and barley in this country this year that were only rocks and furze last year, and they would be rocks and furze this year also if it were not for <Col N="1339" /> that farm improvements scheme.  Now, I regret to learn from the Parliamentary Secretary&rsquo;s statement that the amount to be allocated&mdash;not necessarily to be spent, but to be allocated &mdash;for that very useful work is only £50,000 for the coming year.  I am confident, and not only confident but almost certain, that within the present financial year three times that amount could be usefully spent on farm improvements under that scheme in this country.  I am perfectly satisfied of that.</P>
    <P>Again, however, that very useful scheme is hampered by restrictions that it is difficult for one to understand. I have been given certain information and I am now giving it as it was given to me.  I know, of course, that under this scheme a farmer can get a grant to make a good yard in front of his house.  Perhaps that is going somewhat further than I would be prepared to go.  On the other hand, however, I am informed that a farmer, who may have to go across two or three fields for water, will not get any grant, no matter how small, if he wants to sink a pump in his yard.  I would suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary and other members of this House that there are very few works that would be more useful or beneficial to a farmer than the provision of a good water supply convenient and available to his house.  If I may say so, it is particularly necessary now, at a time when another Department of State is doing its best to see that the milk and butter produced in this country is produced under the best possible conditions. Now, if you want to have milk and butter produced under the best possible conditions, you must have a convenient and plentiful supply of good water.</P>
    <P>It is no pleasure to me, as I have said on other occasions, to be raising these matters here year after year, but one begins to have a feeling of despair when, after all the years and all the talk and everything else, we find that even in this year of crisis we have the same attitude towards the unemployed. If we had any doubt as to the&mdash;I do not <Col N="1340" /> want to use the word &ldquo;negligence&rdquo;, but certainly if we had any doubt of the fact that the matter is not being faced up to in the way and in the spirit and in the manner in which it should be faced, we have only to refer to the facts which I mentioned briefly on a previous occasion, in connection with a previous Estimate, when we had a long debate here, in December last, on the whole question of unemployment.</P>
    <P>There was a motion put down calling for a commission of inquiry into the whole incidence of unemployment. The Government apparently considered the motion an important one; so much so, that they went to the trouble of putting on the Order Paper an alternative motion and that motion was carried here after full debate.  The wording of the Government&rsquo;s motion&mdash; I shall read only part of it from the Parliamentary Debates, column 1241, 12th December, 1940&mdash;was like this:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Dáil Eireann requests the Government to appoint such a commission....&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I do not want to weary the House reading the whole motion, which dealt with one of the gravest problems we could deal with.  Perhaps if one were to look into the future, indeed, the immediate future, it is the gravest of all our problems.  I said just a moment ago that this was a very grave problem.  I said that it was, in the present circumstances, and having regard to the immediate future, probably the gravest of all our problems. I refuse to proceed any further for the reason that there is not even one Minister in the House.  That simply epitomises the whole Government attitude towards this problem.  Even the Parliamentary Secretary has left the House.</P>

What I cannot understand is that not one member of the Government, <Col N="1341" /> not even the Minister for Industry and Commerce, thinks this of sufficient importance to be in attendance here.  We should realise that this Vote deals with over 100,000 people. Not one Minister is in the House and, in the circumstances, I definitely refuse to go any further.  If any other Deputy desires to speak, he may do so.</P>

      <P>This Vote is one in which a very considerable interest is taken by Deputies from the country districts.  One can understand Deputy Morrissey&rsquo;s attitude when he discovered that the Government was not represented here.  At the same time, I do not think the action he has taken is quite fair.</P>
      <P>I have been listening to his speech and so far as he went, there was no real criticism offered&mdash;and that was while the Parliamentary Secretary was present, and the Parliamentary Secretary is mainly responsible for the carrying out of these works.  The Deputy did represent, of course, that in some cases there was not a sufficient effort made to bring to the location where the work was available an adequate number of workers, and there were other objections of that sort.  From the tone of the Deputy&rsquo;s speech, I saw no justification for his sudden attitude and his resentment of the Parliamentary Secretary&rsquo;s absence for a few moments.</P>

      <P>It is rather unfortunate that the Deputy&rsquo;s point was not raised in the earlier portion of his speech, when there was a Minister here.  The incident occurred only when the Parliamentary Secretary left.  As Deputy Smith has explained, he left only for a few moments, and that statement is now borne out by the fact that the Parliamentary Secretary has just returned.  If Deputy Morrissey does not wish to resume now, I will proceed, but if the Deputy wishes to continue his speech, now that the Parliamentary Secretary has returned, I will give way.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BenMaguire" hpid="Mr. Maguire Mr. Maguire">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Maguire</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have indicated, quite a lot of interest is taken in this Vote by country Deputies.  I may say that, in a general way, the administration <Col N="1343" /> of this Department in recent years has been satisfactory, and I think it is accepted in all parts of the House that at least an honest effort was made to administer the money that is available in the very best way; that is to say, in the best way that those responsible for administering it felt it could be administered. I am not at all sure, at the same time, that they succeeded in getting the best work done, or that they got the best return for the money expended.</P>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary dealt with what I consider is a rather serious problem&mdash;that in certain areas, where a good deal of this money was spent, a difficulty arose of finding sufficient work to continue employment.  If that be so, then I trust the Parliamentary Secretary has seriously taken into account some alternative schemes for those districts. These are the poorest districts in the country, and, if the available work in these districts is exhausted, are we going to have the position that there will be continual unemployment there, and that many people will be thrown perpetually on the dole?  Surely, there should be some indication to satisfy us that this problem is being seriously faced.</P>
      <P>I am not at all convinced that there is not plenty of work still available in every such district, and I believe that in most of these places money can still be usefully spent and useful results secured.  I suggest that the Parliamentary Secretary should have a closer survey made of those districts, in conjunction with other Departments, including, especially, the Land Commission and the Department of Agriculture. I am quite satisfied he will find from the information at his disposal, that he could with very great success, continue doing very useful work in these districts for many years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Morrissey that the most useful scheme in operation was the farm improvements scheme. I am sorry that the expenditure in that direction is not much greater, because very useful work could be done.  The extent to which it could be done is practically unlimited.  Such work would be of great value to the whole community. <Col N="1344" /> I suggest that more attention should be given to a survey of our requirements in that direction, and that information might be got from parish committees and others.  As a result I believe that that scheme could be further augmented and that useful results would accrue.</P>
    <P>I am afraid that the Parliamentary Secretary is leaving the drainage problem, which is a national one, very much on the long finger.  Drainage underlies every scheme that could be undertaken to improve agricultural conditions, including forestry, reclamation of land, the improvement of tillage, and bogs.  All these problems depend really on a national scheme of drainage. Drainage has occupied the attention of different Governments, not only since the Irish Government was established, but English Governments. It still remains unsolved after 20 years of native Government, and it is very difficult to explain to those who are seriously affected the reason why nothing has been done to remedy their position.  A Commission on Drainage was set up a few years ago.  We expected that we would have got a verdict by this, and that the Government would, to some extent, have implemented it.  I am quite sure that the findings of that commission are available for a considerable time.  We should now be told what these findings were and what the Government proposes to do.  Until the drainage problem is dealt with we are only on the fringe of many schemes that could be successfully undertaken, and that would employ a great number of men. Until the Government comes to a decision on that, and puts it into effect, only small initial efforts can be made to improve land.</P>
    <P>I hope that the present interest in peat development will convince the whole community that peat is a wonderful asset to this country, and that, with the lead given by the Government, we should be in a position to supply our own needs in fuel.  I hope that state of affairs will continue when the present emergency has passed.  As regards some of the schemes with which we are familiar, minor relief schemes, to provide accommodation roads to <Col N="1345" /> farmhouses and bogs, I wish I could convince the Parliamentary Secretary of the value of these schemes to those living in rural districts.  It is only those who have experience of having to travel to their homes, away from the county roads, and through pathways leading to bogs in wintry weather can realise the hardship involved, and the value of alternative routes.  I say that it is a moral duty on those responsible for spending money to ensure that accommodation roads to houses and bogs should have preference over the spending of money on county roads. Until we provide such accommodation, so that people will be spared hardship when going to their homes, to shops, churches and schools, we will not have discharged our moral obligations.  I advise the Parliamentary Secretary when considering such applications not to apply the rules too rigidly, but to consider the value of these schemes to farmers and others, who are the backbone of the country.  These people are entitled to demand suitable accommodation to give them easy access to their homes and for the carrying on of their industry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>The principal reason that induced me to move that the Estimate be referred back was the reduction of this Estimate by about one-third.  The Parliamentary Secretary gave as a reason for the reduction the absence of suitable schemes during the past year.  I cannot understand the reason he put forward.  I know areas in my constituency where numerous schemes were put forward, and where the local authorities were prepared to pay their quota in order to secure money to carry out work that they wished to undertake.  The reason given by the Parliamentary Secretary might apply in certain areas, but I do not think it could be said to apply in areas that I represent.  The Parliamentary Secretary also stated that the numbers on the live register this year were 17,000 less than last year.  He said that if, they took into consideration the number of men at present engaged on relief works, that number would be swelled to 22,000.  The Parliamentary Secretary probably overlooked the fact that there is an operation at present <Col N="1346" /> what is known as the Employment Period Order.  That was not in operation this time last year.  If that order were not in operation now, the Parliamentary Secretary should admit that the figures on the live register would be considerably increased.  He may retort that in various counties men who were in receipt of unemployment assistance last year would be employed this year saving turf.  The saving of turf does not provide work in every county.  There is very little turf in Wexford, and in some of the villages there are large numbers unable to find work.</P>
      <P>I have two or three places in mind where large numbers of men had to apply for home assistance since the Employment Period Order was brought into operation.  The Parliamentary Secretary should take that into consideration. In certain counties there may be plenty of turf to be cut, and it may not be possible to get the requisite number of men to save it, but in the constituency I represent, owing to the fact that it is a tillage area, the extra employment given on tillage was very small.  The percentage of land tilled in Wexford is very high, and everybody agrees with that, while the farmers there keep a number of men employed, it was not necessary to take on extra men for tillage operations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary, I think, said&mdash;I do not know whether I misunderstood him or not&mdash;that the average number of weeks given per man was 15.  I cannot understand how that figure is arrived at.  If the Parliamentary Secretary takes any large urban or city area where a rotational scheme is in operation, he will find that each man only gets one turn during the operation of the scheme.  That being the case, the number of days that a man would get would be 12.  He would be taken in for a month, working three days per week during the month. I think that would be nearer the mark than the figure given by the Parliamentary Secretary.  I am not saying that for the purpose of questioning what the Parliamentary Secretary said, but my experience is that a man would get an average of 12 days&rsquo; work over the period of one year on a rotational <Col N="1347" /> scheme in certain city or urban areas. I know that in rural areas a man might get the number of days suggested by the Parliamentary Secretary, but if he segregates them and takes the urban areas and rural areas separately, I think he will find that the figure I have given will be nearer the mark than the one he has put forward.</P>
    <P>I want to complain about the late period at which the unemployment relief schemes were brought into operation last year.  Up to last year, the schemes were brought into operation, I think, about the month of October. Last year I know that in the town of Wexford the scheme was not brought into operation until December. The result was that there was absolute chaos about Christmas time. We had a situation in which men were brought in for a month about the first week in December, and their period expired on the Saturday before Christmas. That meant that for the next week and the following week, owing to the fact that Catholic holidays are observed in Wexford, the second gang that came in were knocked about completely and there was a state of absolute chaos.  I think the surveyor approached the Department with a view to permitting the men who were on for the first month to be kept on so that the sequence of unemployment assistance for the other men who would come in would not be interfered with, and I think the Department agreed to that.  I am not complaining about that.</P>
    <P>I would, however, ask the Parliamentary Secretary to see that these rotational schemes are started earlier than the first week in December, because that certainly did bring about a state of confusion last year.  I do not know whether it is the Office of Public Works or the Local Government Department is responsible, but this year the local authorities were not notified as early as usual that the grant would be available.  Some of them took a chance and put in the amount they put in last year, but the rate for the year was fixed before any information was received by the local authorities concerned as to whether they were to get any grant or not.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1348" /> I was glad to hear that the Parliamentary Secretary favours the laying out of parks in certain urban areas. These are amenities that are very badly needed in some urban areas and cities.  As he points out, the unskilled labour content in the laying out of these parks will be very high, as very little material will be needed.  The cement and other materials required for the road works carried out in urban areas have risen enormously in price and the result of that has been that the labour content has decreased considerably during the last two or three years. Therefore, I think the Parliamentary Secretary is well advised to keep away from that kind of work, so far as possible, because he certainly will not attain the object he has in view, namely, to give work to unskilled labour.</P>
    <P>I believe that before this winter is out there will be considerably more men placed on the unemployment list. We all hope that that will not be so, but, if that position arises, I hope that the Government will be prepared to meet it.  Certainly the amount of money to be voted this year would not lead people to believe that the Government were in earnest in trying to solve the unemployment problem. The amount of work given to each man in urban and city areas under this rotational scheme is certainly very small.  Although we have from time to time criticised this scheme, because of the fact that only three days&rsquo; work per week is given instead of a week&rsquo;s work, at the same time the men welcome it.  So far as I know, they will welcome it from the point of view that they would prefer to work rather than have to go to the labour exchange to draw unemployment assistance week after week.  It is only right that it should be said on behalf of the men that they do not want to draw money for nothing, that they would prefer to work, and would rather that the work was given to them more often.  At present, they only get work for 12 or 15 days in city and urban areas.</P>
    <P>I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to pay particular attention to the few matters I have mentioned, especially the question of starting the work earlier in the winter, so that <Col N="1349" /> there will not be a state of chaos such as there was last year; also that next year the local authorities will be notified beforehand as to what the intention of the Government is, as local authorities are inconvenienced in endeavouring to fix their rates at a certain time.</P>

      <P>I was under the impression that, even before we were in a position to intimate the amounts, notification was sent to the local authorities&mdash;I do know it was sent round; it is a question of the date, but my impression is that it was as early as we could do it&mdash;that they could budget on the same basis.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I think this unemployment problem is a matter for grave consideration and concern on the part of every Deputy.  The problem, to my mind, is like a cancer eating at the heart of the social and economic structure of the State.  Notwithstanding the promises that were held out to the people some few years ago by the Government and the Fianna Fáil Party that they had a plan to deal with this problem and to solve it for all time so far as this country is concerned, the problem has persisted and increased, in fact, in recent years.  While I personally believe that the best solution for unemployment is the encouragement of private enterprise, I think that if ever this House was justified in voting substantial sums of money to provide employment, this is a time during which it would be justified.  It strikes me as an amazing thing that, in a period of danger, crisis, and of difficulty for industry and agriculture, the Government should be reducing the vote for employment schemes by £450,000, with a footnote to say that there will be a reduction of £250,000 in the amount contributed by local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1350" /> That is to say, that the amount of money provided for this purpose is one-third less than it was last year.  That is an extraordinary situation, when we think what the position is throughout the country and of the methods that should be applied to remedy it.  This is the time when the Government should be considering putting into force large scale employment schemes to meet the wants of necessitous people who, owing to the increased cost of living, are finding it exceedingly difficult to carry on.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary said the reason why all the money voted last year was not spent was because it was difficult to find suitable constructive schemes of work with the required unskilled labour content.  I am glad that he stressed the necessity of finding such schemes, because what alarms me is the fact that the Government are spending so much money on schemes that, instead of being constructive, will put a substantial strain on the resources of the people.  The result of that will be to make the people poorer than they are.  The aim should be to get works of improvement from which a productive return could be obtained.  The Parliamentary Secretary has been looking for schemes of work in those areas where the incidence of unemployment is greatest. He finds it convenient to have work within a reasonable distance of where the unemployed live.  I think he will have seriously to consider bringing them to areas where constructive schemes of work can be found for them.  The country as a whole finances those schemes.  Therefore, I do not see why, year after year, this huge sum of money should be spent in the areas where unemployment is greatest, and where the work is running out.  I am certain that while the Leinster counties provide a substantial part of this money, the amount of it that is spent in those counties is not in proportion to the sums subscribed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>There is an aspect of the question that the Parliamentary Secretary should not lose sight of, and it is this: that where he finds schemes of work are running out in the areas where unemployment is greatest, he will have to go elsewhere, and that means the provision of labour camps. I think that is the only way out of it. Some Deputies may object.  Others may think that the time has arrived when that must be considered as a solution of the problem, and yet may not think it wise to put such a proposal forward.  I have no doubt myself that it would be better to do that than let things slide as at present.  If the present situation is allowed to develop it is, I believe, going to be a menace to the security of the State, with numbers of young men, many of them married, having no means of supporting themselves or their families.</P>
      <P>We have been told by the Government that the provision of adequate supplies of fuel for the coming winter is going to be a very big problem.  I believe that, so far, the Government have tackled it in a very slipshod way. There is nothing constructive about their approach to the problem.  There has been no properly conceived plan for the production of turf.  I believe myself that the plans made for its production on the great bog of Allen in the County Kildare, will fall far short of our requirements of turf in that area, not to speak at all of meeting the demands of the City of Dublin and of some large towns in the vicinity of the bog.  The Government, instead of doing something themselves, have thrown back their responsibilities on the local authorities and on the parish councils.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I said that in normal times I believed in private enterprise, but we are not living in normal times to-day.  There is no use in the Government throwing their responsibility back on the local authorities or the parish councils for the production of the turf that will be required to meet the country&rsquo;s requirements next winter. From what is going on at present it is quite obvious that when the time comes the turf will not be there to meet our requirements.  If what I have suggested to the Parliamentary Secretary is done, then when the time comes you will have turf to meet some of your requirements for the city.  I do not know whether the Parliamentary Secretary contemplates bringing turf from those areas to the city when the demands of the local farmers and other people living in the turf areas have been satisfied.  We have not been told anything about the scheme, what the proposals are under the scheme, how far they are intended to go, and what requirements they are intended to meet.  If you intend to produce turf in those areas for non-turf districts and the larger towns and cities, then, to my mind, no proper constructive attempt has been made to meet the situation.  That is the reason I suggest that the Office of Public Works should have undertaken this matter on their own and organised a large-scale scheme for production of turf in that area more than in any other area&mdash;an area which lends itself to development, and is within reasonable distance of the city.  I read in the paper within the last couple of days a report of a meeting of Kildare County Council at which it was stated that the county surveyor informed the council that a number of banks of turf were not being used at all.  That position is, I think, general all over the country, because what is everybody&rsquo;s business is nobody&rsquo;s business.  The parish councils are supposed to do this and that, but a great many of them lack finance and the organising ability <Col N="1353" /> to carry out a job of this sort.  They know nothing about it, and they have got no help from the people who ought to know something about it&mdash;those who have been dealing with bogs.</P>
      <P>On the question of lack of suitable schemes, I am very disappointed to hear that the amount provided under the farm-improvement scheme is only £50,000.  That was a pet scheme of mine, as I think the Parliamentary Secretary knows.  Tremendous improvement could be effected under a scheme of that sort.  A tremendous amount of good work has been done under the operation of schemes of that type in England and Northern Ireland. There are greater opportunities in this country for the operation of a scheme of that class than there are in any other country.  Large areas are water-logged and the land is in very bad condition.  Land which was suitable for grazing 30 or 40 years ago is now turned into &ldquo;rough&rdquo;&mdash;so rough that it is unsuitable for grazing and is even dangerous to animals.  They might be swamped in it.  I do not suggest that money for this purpose should be spent on areas where the fertility of land is so low that, even by draining it, you would not improve its grazing quality.  The spending of public funds on land of that sort would be a waste, so that a certain amount of care should be exercised as to the type of land on which the money is spent.  As a pre-requisite, the land should be of such quality that, when drained, it would be improved to such an extent that it could be cultivated or, at least, that it would produce good grass&mdash;even good coarse grass for the carrying of stock.  Then, there are all sorts of bushes and furze in certain areas that ought to be rooted out. Quite a lot of improvement could be effected in that way.  Valuable work of that sort is available all over the country.  Yet, the Government provide only £50,000 under the farm improvement scheme, when that figure could be multiplied by ten.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Corish referred to the fact that employment schemes were cut short last spring because the Parliamentary Secretary thought it might interfere with the provision of labour <Col N="1354" /> in the tillage areas under the Compulsory Tillage Order.  He was anxious to see that labour would be available for the farmers.  I am glad he was worrying about their position, but I agree with Deputy Corish&mdash;and I come from an intensive tillage district&mdash;that the increase in the amount of land under tillage in those areas this year did not affect the number of men employed to any great extent.  I was rather surprised to find that the few schemes we had in operation in Carlow were cut off quite suddenly in the middle of the war and men thrown out of employment.  They could obtain no work because there was no work for them.  The increase in acreage under cultivation in these intensive tillage counties, such as Carlow, Wexford and South Kildare, was not considerable because these counties had tilled up to the maximum, practically, before the Tillage Order came into operation. Every member of a board of health knows that, in recent weeks, able-bodied men have been coming before these boards begging for assistance. That is a shocking state of affairs.  Yet, we come into this House and find that a large amount of the money provided under this Vote last year was not expended.</P>
    <P>The responsibility is on the Minister and Parliamentary Secretary to see that these schemes are properly organised. The work is there.  The Parliamentary Secretary may be right in saying that the proper sort of work in the areas where the incidence of unemployment is greatest is running out.  He will have to travel farther afield and, where work of a proper nature requires to be done, he must tackle it even if he has to bring the men long distances. That is a matter which ought to be examined immediately.  It is immoral and unjust to find these men becoming a burden on the local authorities.  Many of the ratepayers find it difficult to make ends meet.  Most of them are struggling with big bank overdrafts. Yet, a further burden is thrown on them this year in having to provide for able-bodied men who cannot find work. I take a very serious view of the whole position.  The farmer is finding it extremely difficult to make ends meet, <Col N="1355" /> notwithstanding that we are passing through a war situation, and that the average farmer might be looking forward to a better time.  The better time has not come.  The unfortunate fact that we have foot-and-mouth disease persisting for the past three months or more is not helping matters from his point of view.  On top of that, there is a further burden which he has to carry in paying this amount to relieve able-bodied men.  That should be the responsibility of the Government, and not of the local authority.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to express my agreement with Deputy Maguire, who has stated that an honest effort is being made by the Parliamentary Secretary to cope with the problem of providing employment for the unemployed. There is no Deputy in this house who will agree, however, that an honest effort is enough at the present time.  We must have more than an honest effort.  We must have a successful effort, and, up to the present, I am afraid that we have not seen a successful attempt to cope with this problem.  We should be in the position now here that any man who cannot find work through the ordinary channels of employment should be able to apply to the Parliamentary Secretary&rsquo;s Department and obtain work immediately. We should not have the circumstances in which any able-bodied man would be forced to make application to private individuals or charitable organisations, or to the local authorities, for charity on the plea that he cannot obtain work. The local authorities or other organisations should be in a position to say that work is available, and they should be in a position to prove that it is. However, that is not the position at the present time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In many areas, as the Parliamentary Secretary has pointed out, the number of unemployed on the register is not sufficient to justify employment schemes.  There may be in any electoral division nine, ten or 12 able-bodied men, perhaps, with families, unemployed; but because there is not the requisite number they must be allowed to remain unemployed.  That is the position now.  In other areas there is a <Col N="1356" /> surplus of unemployed.  In the City of Dublin, I suppose, or in any large towns, or in the congested districts of the West of Ireland, there is a tremendous surplus of unemployed for whom it is difficult to obtain suitable work.  The Parliamentary Secretary suggests that intensive efforts are being made in those areas where there is a big surplus of unemployed to find suitable work for them.  I do not think that is a proper approach to this problem.</P>
    <P>The first task of this Department should be to find out the most useful works in the State, wherever they may be located.  By useful works I mean those which are reproductive and which have the highest possible labour content.  First of all, those works should be selected and when that has been done, no matter where they may be found or how far they may be from the areas where unemployment is rife, these are the works which should be taken, in the interests of the unemployed and in the ultimate interest of the nation.  It is better for the unemployed, in the long run, that they should be at work on reproductive schemes than on non-reproductive ones.  Whatever money is used to provide this employment must inevitably come out of the reproductive work.</P>
    <P>If the Parliamentary Secretary is prepared to agree that these are the works which should be undertaken first, the next question is to provide the necessary accommodation for the unemployed in these areas.  The first consideration should be to find out if there is actually housing accommodation in the area where the useful work is to be had.  In many cases it will be found that there is not.  The next task of the Department would be to provide houses of a temporary nature&mdash; such as hutments&mdash;while this work is being carried out.  The provision of such hutments or camps would also mean employment for a certain useful type of unemployed man, that is, skilled or semi-skilled workers.  We have the example in Clonsast, where hutments have been provided by the Turf Development Board and where men are provided with board and lodging at a very reasonable rate. <Col N="1357" /> There is no reason why a similar effort to cope with this problem should not be adopted in other areas.</P>
    <P>I do not pretend to be able to tell the Parliamentary Secretary exactly the most useful type of work which should be undertaken by his Department. His Department is designed to cater for unemployed of a temporary nature&mdash;that is to say, his Department is designed to cater for men who are unemployed at the moment and who, if they found suitable employment, should be prepared to leave the schemes provided and go to that permanent employment.  Therefore, works such as the production of turf or coal, except in a period of emergency, do not fall within the scope of the Parliamentary Secretary&rsquo;s Department.  In a time of emergency such as the present it is right and proper that the Office of Public Works should undertake production of fuel, but at all other times the work should be mainly of such a nature as has been undertaken up to now&mdash;the making and improvement of roads, reclamation and improvement of land, and drainage works.  I do not see any reason why useful works of this nature should be held up simply because there is not to be found in the electoral division a sufficient number of unemployed.</P>
    <P>Anyone who has visited some of the schemes undertaken by the Turf Development Board, such as that at Clonsast, will be impressed by the amount of useful work which has been done there.  There is drainage work which the Parliamentary Secretary&rsquo;s Department could undertake in many bogs.  The production of turf is absolutely impossible unless, first of all, a carefully planned and designed drainage scheme has been carried into effect.  If the Board of Works is equipped with the proper engineers and supervisors, with experience of the proper drainage and lay-out of bogs, they can set to work upon these areas and prepare them for the Turf Development Board or the county councils, or any other body which wishes to undertake the production of turf.  In the same way, the Board of Works can do a great deal in large-scale reclamation of land.  Apart from <Col N="1358" /> drainage, a tremendous field of work is available in the improvement of land, that is, in the removal of rocks, stone, furze bushes and other obstructions which are reducing land to an unproductive condition.</P>
    <P>I do not know how such work could be best undertaken.  I am not satisfied that the farm improvement schemes, under which the farmer provides 50 per cent. of the cost of the work is in itself sufficient to cope with this problem. It must be remembered that farmers who have the largest percentage of inferior land are mainly farmers with very little capital.  For that reason, the farmer who has the most useful work waiting to be carried out on his farm is not the man who can avail to a very large extent of the farm improvement grant.  Therefore, it would seem that there are certain areas in which the Parliamentary Secretary should be prepared to carry out the work of reclamation entirely.  Having carried it out, he might afterwards expect some contribution from the holder of the land but, in view of the nature of the land, I think he could hardly expect a 50 per cent. contribution.</P>
    <P>While I agree with other Deputies that the farm improvement scheme is useful, it is to a great extent held up, in the first place, because the amount of money provided is not sufficient and, in the second place, because the type of farmer whose land requires it most is, through lack of capital, not in a position to avail of it.  I think there are big areas which the Parliamentary Secretary could survey with a view to undertaking extensive reclamation.  I believe that the first approach to the entire problem, as I have said already, is to segregate the work which is most urgently needed.  No matter from what source the men may be drawn to be employed on that work, I think they should be employed.  If the Parliamentary Secretary will consider the problem from that angle, he will, I think, be successful in solving it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Brodrick Mr. Brodrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brodrick</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not very often I give the Parliamentary Secretary credit for the work he is doing in his Department <Col N="1359" /> but I find that in the last few years in connection with the relief schemes, to a certain extent, there is good improvement.  This year I certainly know that he is taking his job seriously because he has been going through the West of Ireland inspecting the work.  That is a sign that a man is doing his work in a proper way.</P>
      <P>In regard to employment, we hear from Deputies here time and again that huts should be erected for labourers and that the labourers should be taken from the places that are receiving the most unemployment assistance. Most of the Leinster Deputies are very fond of expressing that view. The principle is to let everyone do the work for them, but they will not do it themselves.  I do not care from what part of the House the Deputies speak, I think it is most unfair.  We have sent men up from the West of Ireland as farmers to the Meath lands, and we hear the &ldquo;grouse&rdquo; every other day in this House that they are a bit of a nuisance.  We hear that they are being sent from Donegal, Mayo, Galway and Kerry, and that they are a nuisance.  At the same time, we are told that labour is needed to develop the Kildare bogs.  We hear at the same time, from the same Deputies, the number in those districts who are in receipt of unemployment assistance. If there are numbers in those areas on unemployment assistance, why should they not be put into work?  We have a fair amount of work to do in the West of Ireland, and I would say we are delivering a supply of turf to Dublin at present equal to that from any other province.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one point to which I wish to refer.  Work on bogs, such as drainage and the making of roads into bogs, has been transferred, within the last fortnight, to the Department of Local Government.  I do not think we are going to get a lot out of that, because I think it is a bit too late.  To transfer the work of the principal Department, you might say, in the middle of the turf cutting season, to another Department upsets the whole thing. I am sorry that has been done, because I know the Board of Works had their <Col N="1360" /> engineers or their inspectors on these schemes and that they knew a fair amount about them.  I think it is not fair to transfer such work to the Department of Local Government.</P>

      <P>May I interrupt the Deputy for one moment?  He recognises that we are interested in getting these works done rapidly.  He recognises that the Board of Works is competent to do it.  The fact is that the Board of Works are responsible for having that machinery transferred for the purpose of getting it done quicker.  I think the arrangement at the present moment is the quickest that it is possible to conceive for the purpose of getting that particular kind of work done.</P>

      <P>I had occasion yesterday to get in touch with the Department of Local Government in connection with the making of a road into a bog.  It is a particularly big bog in my own district.  I had been in communication with the Board of Works for years about it.  There are about 200 families getting turf out of this bog. The answer I got was that if this road were constructed it would be no use this year.  I could not convince or persuade the Department of Local Government that the turf is being cut at the present time, that it would not be taken out of the bog until next August or September, and that in the meantime the road should be made so as to have more turf cut.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should go direct to the county surveyor in this particular matter.  He will form his own judgment and he is in a position to get the work started inside 24 hours if it is a job which should be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Brodrick Mr. Brodrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brodrick</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to know that.  That was my trouble yesterday. <Col N="1361" /> Seeing the shortage of fuel and the great danger that that shortage may become more acute, I think as many men as possible should be engaged on turf-cutting schemes.  I know that in the West of Ireland the county surveyors and the assistant surveyors are doing their utmost, but I should like if the Local Government Department would authorise the release of more men from road work for turf cutting. We have pretty good roads throughout the country.  The motor traffic at present is not very heavy and the probability is that it will be no heavier for the rest of the year.  It should be quite possible, therefore, to release more men from road work, to take them off work such as the cutting-off of corners and to employ them on turf-production schemes.</P>
      <P>Time and again I have made representations to the Parliamentary Secretary in connection with the refusal to carry out minor relief schemes in districts where the number of registered unemployed does not reach a certain figure.  A number of very necessary works have been turned down because of that condition in the past. If these works had been carried out, we would have avoided much of the rush that is now connected with turf-cutting schemes.  Frequently, you find that it is not possible to get Government approval for more than one work out of five that have been put up, because there is not the requisite number of registered unemployed in the areas where the work has to be carried out.  Any Deputy who knows conditions in the country will agree with me that after a farmer&rsquo;s son has worked for, say, six months on a trunk road, he prefers to go back to work on his father&rsquo;s holding rather than be put to the necessity of travelling six or eight miles to the nearest exchange or barrack to register as unemployed.  He feels that he will be better employed working on his father&rsquo;s land.  You have a large class of that kind who are entitled to consideration.  They are not really employed, but they prefer to work on their father&rsquo;s holdings for nothing rather than be forced to travel six or eight miles to register as unemployed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Brodrick Mr. Brodrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brodrick</NameTxt>
      <P>In these districts the farmers&rsquo; sons are just as poor as unemployed people of the towns.  Much of the work which I suggest should be carried out in these areas would be very useful work.  If it had been carried out for the last few years we would not now be in the position of having turf-cutting schemes and road-making schemes going on simultaneously. I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will consider that matter.</P>
      <P>I should next like to refer to the position of county surveyors and assistant surveyors.  In County Galway, in addition to the county surveyor, we have six assistant surveyors. Probably two or three of these are engaged on turf schemes.  They have to cover the usual 500 miles of road and to look after as many as 300 men as well. I should like that their difficulties, particularly in the matter of petrol, should be considered.  In that regard I have had much difficulty with the Department of Supplies.  I find that engineers who have no duties in connection with turf production or the supervision of men are getting the same quantity of petrol as engineers, who do a lot of work in connection with turf schemes.  I think that that is unfair.  Engineers who have so much work to supervise in connection with turf schemes, in addition to their ordinary work, should be facilitated at least in the matter of petrol supplies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should also like the Parliamentary Secretary to give more attention to <Col N="1363" /> the reclamation of land.  Land reclamation has been of great benefit to the country.  Land which was reclaimed, at a very small cost two, three or four years ago, is producing splendid crops this year.  I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will give his support to further schemes of that nature in order that more land may be made available for the production of crops.  I hope that he will also recommend to the Local Government Department that all men who can possibly be spared from road work should be released for employment in the bogs. Another suggestion I would make to the Parliamentary Secretary is that the services of the military in posts in various parts of the country might be availed of in connection with turf production schemes.  There are four or five posts in my own county and I am sure that amongst the men in these posts it would be possible to find some very useful workers.  We must remember the great shortage of fuel with which we are threatened.  Last year, which was a wonderful season for turf production, we had three cuttings and 100 per cent. of our normal supplies of coal was also available.  Notwithstanding that, there is very little of last year&rsquo;s turf now left.  This year the supply of coal has been cut down to 25 per cent. and, indeed, may be less. I do not know when I saw coal down the country.  We shall, therefore, require every ounce of turf that can possibly be produced.  Therefore, I suggest that the assistance of military from these outlying stations might be obtained to help the people in the very difficult fuel situation which we are facing at present.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I should be glad to hear from the Parliamentary Secretary if any special effort has been made to deal with the growing seriousness of the unemployment problem in the City of Dublin.  Personally, I am not satisfied that there is sufficient driving force behind the desire of the Parliamentary Secretary to secure employment for those now very sadly in need.  The number of unemployed people in the dockland area and in the industrial areas of Dublin is growing daily.  A <Col N="1364" /> very large number of people are living under the threat of losing their homes owing to their inability to pay the high rents that are charged in the city. Still more who obtained their furniture on the hire purchase system and who are now unable to continue the payments, are living under the threat of losing their furniture as well.  These are the type of people that I hope will receive consideration from the Government and the Parliamentary Secretary in any schemes that he may have in mind for the future.</P>
      <P>I sympathise with the Parliamentary Secretary in his desire to provide employment for all who need it.  I know he has a very difficult task.  I think he ought to ask for help and advice from the parish councils.  Those councils should be asked to put up schemes with a reasonable labour content. Knowing the local circumstances, they would be the best advisers in that matter.</P>
      <P>I have made reference to the fact that the docks and shipping area is in a very bad way.  I am aware also that outside the centre of the city&mdash;take the Kimmage, Crumlin and Cabra areas&mdash; there is considerable unemployment. The high cost of food, the high cost of coal, and the fact that their unemployment benefits are so small, mean that they are being deprived of essential commodities.  We have the report of medical officers, public health authorities and maternity hospitals, that in many cases our people are in a state of semi-starvation.  There are people at the present moment who cannot get the ordinary necessaries of life.  I met people to-day with paraffin oil cans, looking for a small quantity of paraffin oil.  I have seen people going around with a few pence in their hands looking for a small quantity of tea. They are being deprived of the necessaries upon which they were accustomed to live.  I have repeatedly made reference to the fact that, for a certain type of people living in the tenement quarters of Dublin, the regular meal was bread, tea and margarine three times a day.  Now they are not in a position to secure the amount of tea required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1365" /> I earnestly hope that the Minister, in his desire to provide employment all over the country, will not overlook the City of Dublin.  As I said before, the high prices brought about by scarcity are causing very grave hardships on our people.  The scarcity of materials for industrial and building purposes is still further adding to the number of unemployed.  In many quarters of the city I find that, in the last few weeks, some of the shops are reducing the number of hands they formerly employed. That is another type of worker that must be protected by the Government and by anyone with the power to do so.  I believe that the Parliamentary Secretary might justly reply that the local authority has certain responsibilities in the city.  I should be glad to hear the Parliamentary Secretary saying that, and giving those in charge in the local authorities some encouragement to go on with their schemes in the knowledge that he is prepared to give them reasonable assistance.  It may be that, in some cases, the local authority may not put up suitable schemes to satisfy the Government that they have a reasonable labour content.  If that is so, I suggest that they should be pressed to find such schemes.  I will do whatever I can in that direction.  I am satisfied, as I have said, that the parish councils in the city could give considerable help and advice in the matter of suggesting some permanent improvements that would give employment to a number of our people, while giving satisfaction to the citizens and the ratepayers generally.  Personally, I will do everything possible to assist the Parliamentary Secretary or his Department in their efforts in that direction. The local authorities have their difficulties, too.  Like the Government, their finances are limited, and they have to live within their income, but, in the present emergency, faced as we are with circumstances that were never anticipated, I am satisfied that all parties capable of providing employment for our people should endeavour to do so.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to exaggerate the circumstances which exist in the City of Dublin to-day, but I do say that they are deplorable.  Any Deputies who <Col N="1366" /> visit the various areas cannot fail to see the increasing poverty and the increasing hardship.  What is the remedy?  I can only make my humble suggestion that the parish councils and others who can put forward any proposals which would give reasonable employment at reasonable rates of wages should be asked to help.  There is another splendid organisation in this city which might give valuable assistance. I refer to the St. Vincent de Paul Society.  If the Minister would consult the heads of that organisation, they would be in a position to tell him that things are far worse than any of us know.  They have been in the habit of dealing with a certain number of our people, but only to-day I heard from them that that number is increasing. Persons who never had to appeal to any of those organisations before are now appealing for help.  If that society could get sums of money, whether it be from the Government or through any effort of the Government or from the charitable public, they could, and would, do splendid work for the country.  The splendid men who are engaged in that work, visiting our poor and distressed people, are doing a glorious national service, and are helping the Government enormously. I think it would be wise for the Parliamentary Secretary to call in some of the heads of that organisation and ask them for suggestions and recommendations. Again, I say that I deeply sympathise with the Parliamentary Secretary and the Ministry in their desire to find employment for all those who are in need of it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no doubt that the members of the St. Vincent de Paul Society and other charitable organisations are doing very fine work, but I am inclined to think that we have wasted a good deal of their energy through not having any investigation made as to why all this charity is necessary.  I want to say that charity is no substitute for justice to those poor people.  Deputy Byrne referred to the parish councils, and suggested that certain things could be done by them.  I am conscious, too, that some of the parish councils are doing useful work, but the fault I find <Col N="1367" /> is that there is no directive hand from the Government to those councils.  I am inclined to think that the Government are expecting too much from them.  Those parish councils can be successful only if they have money at their disposal to do the things which they think it is necessary to do.  I am quite satisfied that most of those councils have not got that money at their command.</P>
      <P>I admit that the Parliamentary Secretary displays a great amount of energy in looking after his Department, but I am not at all satisfied that the Government has a sufficiently well-defined directive policy, particularly in regard to the production of fuel for the coming winter.  I know that much of the work has been transferred to the county surveyors and that some of the public bodies are doing work.  I am a member of one body which has put about 53 men to work for the last three weeks.  These men, however, are merely producing fuel for the institution&mdash;I refer to the South Cork Board of Assistance&mdash;and I have in mind the 82,000 or 85,000 in Cork who will require fuel for the coming winter. Deputy Brodrick has said that he does not know when he saw coal and there is every possibility that we will have no coal for the winter.  I know that it is a big problem.  It is easy to say: &ldquo;Send men out to the bog,&rdquo; but if you send 1,000 men to a bog, questions of sanitation, transport and water arise. I am quite conscious of all these difficulties, but they must be faced.</P>

Company: &ldquo;We want so much transport and we demand that that transport be put at the disposal of men who are prepared to travel 20 miles from the city to cut turf.&rdquo;  I have a case in mind where the G.S.R. Company were asked to supply transport to take 200 or 300 men a distance of 20 miles from Cork City to a certain bog and <Col N="1368" /> for which the company demanded 12/6 per week per man, which meant that the thing collapsed.  They have other systems of transport which are anything but satisfactory.  The method of transporting the men is dangerous and unsatisfactory on wet days.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">

    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but what is being done about it?  I suggest that the Parliamentary Secretary will have to be a little more vigorous in respect of arranging for the production of fuel for the coming winter.  I think he understands well what I have in mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was rather surprised to hear him say that £400,000 less was to be expended this year, and that that was mainly due to his inability to find satisfactory schemes of high labour content.  Is that not almost dealing with the matter in a very trifling fashion?  We know that there is work to be done on the land as well as elsewhere, and we know of schemes, such as that in connection with the Rhynana airport, where men cycled 18 and 20 miles to work every morning.  I am satisfied that a lot of work could be done in these places.  I agree with Deputy Brodrick and Deputy Maguire that the work being done in the making of roads is most useful, but I do not agree with Deputy Hughes, who said that the only solution that he could see for unemployment was private enterprise.  I do not propose to give my views on that subject, other than to say that men will not be employed by private enterprise except for profit.  The Parliamentary Secretary made great play with the point that 60,000 or 70,000 men got 15 weeks&rsquo; work of three or four days per week during the year.  That would mean that 60,000 or 70,000 men got from 45 to 60 days&rsquo; work per person for the year, but they did not really get that because, very often, if a man who gets a three or four-day week is unable to work on any of these days because of bad weather, he has to go into the second week and does not get his full benefit for the week from the labour exchange.  This rotational system is <Col N="1369" /> not producing, and cannot produce, the results we should expect to get from labour if it were employed for a full week.  We had a very definite illustration of that in Cork City where we had a £23,000 contract, for which there were eight tenders.  The lowest tender was £3,500 less, on the basis of the contractor being allowed to employ labour himself rather than to employ rotational workers.</P>

      <P>The next tender was £8,000.  The corporation, in its wisdom, decided by majority vote to accept the lowest tender, but the Department sanctioned the highest tender.  The corporation of Cork contributed £7,000 towards the grant and the acceptance of the highest tender means that we are getting only a £3,500 grant instead of a £7,000 grant.  I do not believe in standing for this red tape and these regulations which must be rigidly adhered to.  Where a local authority can submit schemes of very high labour content&mdash;we have schemes in Cork involving anything up to £250,000, like the sewerage scheme&mdash;we feel that the money for the relief of unemployment should be spent on them.  We have a very big scheme in hands in connection with the preparation of ground for housing schemes, and is there any reason why this unemployment relief money should not be put to work in order to make the rents of the houses which will ultimately be built there cheaper?  I think there should be more discretion left to the local authorities and a little more consideration given by the Department to giving grants for such schemes of high labour content.  I think the Parliamentary Secretary would agree with our point of view, if he had his own way, but we have this red tape and these regulations which prescribe that you cannot give money to certain schemes because they are matters for a local authority to carry out.</P>

      <P>I am prepared to admit that, but we do not get that decision from the Department at all times.  We are told that we must do roads, footpaths, playgrounds or parks.

      <P>It is not too much to ask that when an unemployed man is employed he should be employed for the full week.  That is not a matter of saying that there should be no rotation; but why should we penalise a man because he is unemployed, and this is penalising him, because he is unemployed so long that he can get only four days a week spread over 15 weeks.  Furthermore, it draws a distinction between him and other employed men.  I have talked this matter over with the Parliamentary Secretary before, and I think it would be merely wasting the time of the House to elaborate on it.  I say to the Parliamentary Secretary, however, that, so far as turf production is concerned, we feel that there is not that directive assistance from the Government which will enable us to get things done and to set about the production of turf in a more vigorous manner.  We believe that transport is a very important factor in putting these men to work. I got a reply yesterday from the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry and Commerce showing that there are 2,652 single men signing on at the Cork Labour Exchange.  That is an appalling state of affairs, and I know that within the last four days up to 1,400 of these men signed up to go out to work on Donaghamore bog, cutting turf at 35/- a week.  These men should be given facilities to do work, whether on the land or on the bogs, and I believe they are fully prepared to do it if they get the opportunity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGovern</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Hickey in what he said with regard to some direction being given to parish councils.  The parish councils, in many <Col N="1371" /> cases, are quite competent to do a good deal of excellent work, but a number of these parish councils have no idea how to start, and if only they were told something, or given some direction, that would afford them matter for discussion, and out of that discussion they might be able to devise something better.  I do not say that whatever direction is given should be made hard and fast.  I hold that it should be left elastic enough to admit of being amended or changed by the parish councils, or other local bodies concerned.  In that connection the Departments often go wrong, when they do make a direction, by making it too hard and fast.  The trouble with parish councils and other such bodies that are only semi-responsible is that they do not give sufficient thought to such matters, and each individual parish council could not be expected to give the thought to these matters that a Department of the Government, which has a much greater responsibility in devising schemes, in the expenditure of large sums of money, and in the provision of employment for the people, can give.  These parish councils have not that responsibility, and therefore could not be expected to give the same amount of thought to it that a Department of the Government can give.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At a time like this, when there is the threatened scarcity of fuel and when we have plenty of bogs, we should have no such thing as an unemployment problem in this country for nine months of the year.  So long as we have these two items, the need for fuel and so much bog at our disposal, there should not be this unemployment.  At the same time, the railways are practically idle.  The railways could be used to run fuel into the City of Dublin, or anywhere else it is wanted, because they run straight through the best bogs that we have in this country.  We have the men, we have the bogs, and we have the railways, and all that is wanted is an honest effort and organising ability to put some schemes into operation that would find employment for all the people who are unemployed. With the £1,000,000 of the taxpayers&rsquo; money it should not be beyond the <Col N="1372" /> ingenuity of any Department to work out some effective scheme to provide employment.  According to the Minister&rsquo;s estimate, there is another £250,000 added by the local bodies. That is £1,250,000, and having so much raw material to provide work in the bogs, and with so much drainage to be done, there should be no unemployment problem for at least nine months of the year; and for the other three months there should be no unemployment problem in the rural districts when we have regard to the condition of the land and the need for improvement. At a time like this, when £1,250,000 is being spent, I think more money should be devoted to the improvement of farms.  The sum of £50,000 would amount to less than £2,000 for each county.  What could that do?  It is a ridiculous sum to offer with a view to bringing about any improvement of land or any improvement in the employment position.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding the small amount that is proposed to be spent we find, with regard to the Department that is to administer it&mdash;I think it is the Department of Agriculture&mdash;that more than half of it is being spent upon inspectors.  The figure is £26,670, spent upon 150 temporary farm improvement supervisors or inspectors of all classes. That is to be spent on salaries and travelling expenses&mdash;and that on an expenditure of £50,000! The Parliamentary Secretary should give this matter careful thought.  I always heard him say in this House that he wanted to get the greatest possible labour content out of any money expended, and I am sure he certainly will not approve of spending practically £27,000 on the administration of £50,000 for this particular scheme.</P>
    <P>If that is a sample of the way the money that is voted for employment is being spent generally, then I think the whole matter requires to be looked into, and it is very little wonder that these employment schemes have not had the desired effect.  I think there should be more consideration given to the way in which this money is being expended.  It is clear that there is something wrong in the administration when we are not able to devise suitable <Col N="1373" /> schemes to put all our men to work for at least nine months of the year&mdash;work that would be remunerative, that would pay its own way and give a return.  All that is wanted is the organising ability.</P>
    <P>There are two ways in which this might be done: first, by encouraging private enterprise, and, secondly, by some scheme of moving workers from one place to another, moving the workers from the places where they are to the place where work is to be had, and putting them to that class of work where we have an abundance of raw material, such as we have on the bogs, particularly when there is a need for fuel.  If suitable schemes were devised, and proper men put in charge of these schemes, who would see that the most value was got out of the money expended, we should have no employment problem, no fuel problem, and no railways remaining idle and unable to pay anything in the way of dividends on the money invested in them.  There is something wrong in the whole system, and I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will give very careful consideration to this matter, and seek whatever assistance he may need that might enable him to devise some better scheme than has been devised up to the present.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>Listening to the answers given here by Ministers during the past few weeks, one thing is quite clear, to me at any rate, and that is, that there is no real co-operation or consultation between the Ministerial heads of the Departments responsible for solving the problem of unemployment, or any of the other problems associated with it.  I discovered here yesterday, from replies given by two Ministers, that one Minister did not know what the other was doing.  If that is the way the situation is to be approached during the coming months, then it is truly a deplorable state of affairs and it is a clear indication that the Government have no plan for the solution of the unemployment problem or any other problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I admit, from a limited contact with the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance, that he gives attention and consideration, as head of <Col N="1374" /> the Office of Public Works, to the matters that are brought to his notice.  I believe he thinks and acts within the narrow limits of Government policy when dealing with the administration of his Department.  But nobody in the country will believe the Parliamentary Secretary when he tells them that £500,000 collected from the taxpayers last year had to be returned to the Exchequer because suitable schemes could not be found for the purpose of absorbing that money.  I believe that money has been returned to the Exchequer mainly in order to reduce the Budget deficit.  I believe that the sum asked for the present year, a sum which is £400,000 less than the sum asked last year, has been reduced for the very same reason.</P>
    <P>Will the Parliamentary Secretary tell the House the number of proposals for minor relief schemes, and particularly the number of schemes for the repair of bog roads, together with bog drainage schemes, which have been inspected by officers of his Department and which have not yet been undertaken? I am prepared to send to the Department, if it is necessary, a large number of cases where it was admitted in correspondence with the Board of Works that the schemes would be useful and necessary but they could not be carried out and that money would not be allocated for them because there was not in the area concerned the requisite number of unemployed.</P>

      <P>At the moment we are confronted with the problem of producing turf in order to meet the needs of the community during the coming winter.  We will be producing turf from some bogs, the roads leading into which are not in a sufficiently passable condition to enable the turf to be brought out of them.  We have the men in the country&mdash;whether they are in the immediate vicinity where the work is available I am not quite sure, but I know that these men are capable of doing this work which is so very essential if the community are to get our native fuel during the winter months.</P>

      <Col N="1375" /> Last year, in the carrying out of minor relief works, a sum of £219,623 was expended, whereas this year, when these works are much more urgent and necessary, only £155,000 has been set aside.</P>

      <P>I admit that bog drainage is being carried out to a considerable extent as a necessary preliminary to turf-cutting operations, but if turf is to be got out of a number of the bogs in my constituency before the winter period, there will have to be a good deal of attention paid from now onwards to the repair of bog roads.  The Parliamentary Secretary is concentrating at the moment on the production of turf.  If it is possible, I suggest that it would be very desirable to have carried out simultaneously with the turf-cutting operations the work of repairing bog roads, particularly in areas where unemployed people are still available.</P>

    <P>I notice in the figures supplied by the Parliamentary Secretary that there is a reduction of £109,000 in the amount to be provided for the carrying out of public health works.  Is that a reflection <Col N="1376" /> of an improvement in public health, or are we having the reduction of £109,000 simply because the Parliamentary Secretary wants to help the Minister to balance his Budget?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I can produce communications from the Parliamentary Secretary&rsquo;s Department showing that in previous years&mdash;and I am sure this year is in no way different&mdash;the amount allocated for every county was limited, not by the amount of work to be done, but because there was a limited amount available in the pool, as the Parliamentary Secretary has reminded us on several occasions. Why did the Department not carry out bog road repair schemes before the emergency arose?  The Parliamentary Secretary told us that you cannot take more out of the pool than has been put into it.  Therefore, the works carried out during the past three or four years in areas where we now have to find fuel was limited because of the restricted amount in the pool.  Only a very limited amount was available for each county for the purpose of carrying out minor relief schemes.</P>
      <P>Has the Parliamentary Secretary proposals before him for public health works which would justify an allocation of the same sum as was granted for a similar purpose last year?  I know urbanised and non-urbanised areas in my constituency where public health works are urgently required, and where they will be undertaken if there is a reasonable grant from the Central Fund&mdash;the same as was given in previous years.  The amount provided this year for urban and rural relief schemes is also reduced, presumably because of the reduced amount in the pool.  I suppose the figure in the pool is decided by moneylenders and bankers, who dictate the financial policy of the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The burning question at present is, <Col N="1377" /> what is the Government policy in connection with the provision of fuel for the coming winter?  Who is the head bottle-washer acting on behalf of the Government in the matter?  Are we to understand that the Parliamentary Secretary is the head of the Department responsible for supplies of fuel, or is it the Department of Industry and Commerce, or the Department of Local Government, or are the three Departments acting without consulting one another as often as they should, so as to be able to talk in the same terms to the people?  I find it difficult, if not impossible, in some cases to get reliable information as to how fuel is to be provided for people in the cities and towns.  Are we to understand that the Turf Development Board is to act as a marketing organisation for the provision of fuel for the cities and towns, or is it to be understood that turf produced in bogs under the control of the Turf Development Board is to be diverted to the Coal Importers&rsquo; Association, which will act as the distributing body?

      <P>The trouble of many people is to find out if the Parliamentary Secretary is the head of the Department responsible for the provision of fuel during the coming winter.  There is an item in this Estimate dealing with the development of bogs, and as the Parliamentary Secretary has been touring the country, including the bog areas, the people were under the impression that he is the man in the saddle and is responsible for looking after fuel requirements.  The Estimate also includes an item of £155,000 which the Parliamentary Secretary admits is connected with the production of native fuel.  Is it the position that his powers are limited, and that he can only deal with money for draining bogs or repairing bog roads, and that there his responsibility ends?  If his responsibility ends there, who is responsible for looking after fuel requirements?  I do not want to impose that heavy responsibility on the Parliamentary Secretary.  It is evident that he has some responsibility.  I do not want to increase it.  I think the question can be answered by the Parliamentary Secretary, and, if so, I hope he will not simply raise a point of order for <Col N="1379" /> the purpose of refusing to reply to what I consider to be a sensible question.</P>

At that meeting the representative of the local authority stated that he understood that the Turf Development Board would act as the marketing authority.  I ask the Parliamentary Secretary whether that statement is correct or not.  I have correspondence in my possession to prove that up to the 19th April all turf produced by bogs owned by the Turf Development Board was being sent to the Coal Importers&rsquo; Association in Dublin for distribution to those who required it.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1380" /> From correspondence I have addressed to the Parliamentary Secretary he is aware that all the available unemployed who are registered in bog areas have not up to recently been employed on turf-cutting operations.  I addressed a question to the Minister for Local Government last week, and the reply clearly indicated that only half of the registered unemployed in the local exchange in Birr were cutting turf.  There are 3,500 acres of bog, the property of one landlord, in the vicinity of Birr undeveloped, and not being worked to any extent.  A bog that has been taken over by Birr Urban Council is between four and five miles from the town, while a much larger bog is within two or three miles of the town.  I do not understand why that bog or portion of it was not acquired, and why every unemployed person was not offered work cutting turf.  In the same reply it was stated that the men employed on the bog were not engaged through the local labour exchange. Will the Parliamentary Secretary say why the men required for turf cutting are not recruited, in the first instance at any rate, from the labour exchanges, and why all suitable men registered for work are not employed at once on this very urgent and very necessary national work?  I am quoting what I believe to be a glaring case to disprove a statement made by the Parliamentary Secretary in a speech delivered, I believe, in Ennis recently, namely, that they could not find enough men to do the turf-cutting work available.</P>

      <P>I am quoting a case where, in an area surrounding a bog of 3,500 acres, only half of the unemployed registered at the labour exchange <Col N="1381" /> have been put on this job.  The question of providing transport for workers from towns to bogs a long distance away, where they are offered work, should also receive the careful attention of the Parliamentary Secretary, if it has not already done so.  I think local authorities who employ large numbers of men far away from their homes should make some reasonable provision for carrying them to and from their work.  By doing so they will get better results than by compelling men to travel four and five and, in some cases, up to nine miles to and from their work.  I heard of one case recently where men had to travel 14 miles to and from their work, but that may be an exceptional case.  I think where local authorities employ men on turf cutting operations they should provide transport for them to and from their work.

      <P>I am glad to hear that. I hope that will be extended to other areas where it does not operate at present.  I am not sure whether the Parliamentary Secretary has any responsibility for the policy of the Government in connection with this matter, but I raised the question of the fixing of a uniform rate of wages for people engaged in turf cutting with the Minister for Local Government yesterday, and also with the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  The Minister for Local Government informed me that he had not taken any steps to arrange for the payment of a uniform rate of wages in any area. The Minister for Industry and Commerce also stated that he has not prescribed any uniform rate of wages, <Col N="1382" /> or any rate of wages, for people engaged in turf cutting.</P>
      <P>I am sure the Minister for Local Government will be amazed to read a letter from himself to the Kerry County Council, dated the 24th May, which was published in the <i>Kerryman</i>, insisting upon the adoption of a certain rate of wages for turf cutters employed by the council.  This long letter, which he addressed to a special meeting of the council, clearly shows that the strong hand of the Minister has come down on the council in connection with their dealings with the turf cutters in that county.</P>
      <P>After considering this lengthy communication from the Minister for Local Government, the Kerry County Council were so impressed by the statements of a deputation of turf cutters which waited upon them that they sent a telegram to the Minister for Local Government asking him if he would review the conditions laid down in the letter which he had addressed to them, and in reply a telegram was received from the Minister stating that under no circumstances would he alter his previous attitude in the matter. The communication which he addressed to the Kerry County Council shows that, apparently, he was successful in attempting to fix a rate of wages for turf cutters.  It is a very novel scheme. In any case, the scheme which he insisted upon pressing on the Kerry County Council was one which he had apparently copied from the Donegal County Council.  Apparently, he fell in love with a scheme put into operation by the Donegal County Council, and he insisted upon a similar scheme being put into operation by the Kerry County Council.  That does not fit in with the reply which he gave to me yesterday on this matter.  I am not sure whether there has been any consultation between the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Minister for Local Government on that matter. The Parliamentary Secretary informed me, in reply to a question within the last couple of days, that serious consideration was being given to the question of fixing a price for turf, presumably at the nearest central dump to the bog.</P>

      <P>I hope I am in order in suggesting to the Parliamentary Secretary, or whichever of his colleagues may be responsible for dealing with the matter, that it is a very desirable thing that the price of turf should be fixed as soon as possible.  In making that suggestion, I mean that the price of turf at a point as near as possible to the bog where it is produced should be fixed for the guidance of the community. I do not think it is possible to fix a price for turf to be sold in Dublin, because turf will come from different places to Dublin by road, by canal, and by rail, and the fixing of a price for turf in Dublin is not a very easy matter.  But it should be an easy matter to fix the price of turf at the nearest central dump to the place where it is produced.  If the Turf Development Board can fix a price for turf on the bogs where it is produced under their supervision, it should also be possible for the Parliamentary Secretary, or whatever Minister is responsible for Government policy in this matter, to fix a price for turf produced by private producers wherever the turf is being produced.  Unless a price is fixed for turf, in my opinion there will be a good deal of trouble during the coming winter.  It is quite <Col N="1384" /> evident from what is going on in Dublin at the present time that excessive prices are being charged for the turf which is being produced, as well as for the turf that was produced last year.  I got a quotation from the Turraun Peat Works to supply turf to canal boats at 19/2 per ton.</P>

I prepared the question myself and addressed it to the Minister for Supplies. That was changed to the &ldquo;Minister for Finance.&rdquo;  The question was:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;whether (1) he has fixed the price of turf on or adjacent to the bog (or at any other central place) and, if so, whether he will state the price or prices so fixed; (2) he has fixed or contemplates fixing within specified zones a uniform charge for the transport of turf by the several systems of transportation.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>We can now pass from that.  I desire to refer to the miserable sum that is being allocated this year for the relief of unemployment.  It is quite evident from the statement made by the Parliamentary Secretary, together with the miserable sum that is being provided this year compared to last, that there is no plan for the relief of unemployment other than the sort of half-baked plan to put a large number of our unemployed people on turf-cutting operations, without any central direction from Governmental sources, during the next few months, and to hope that, with the help of God and the output of the few thousand men engaged on turf cutting, sufficient fuel will be provided for the community during the coming winter. There was no evidence in the statement of the Parliamentary Secretary of any plan for the provision of work during the coming winter, which I think will be worse than the last one, especially for those who lose their employment at the end of the turf-cutting season. Many suggestions could be put forward by Deputies for the relief of unemployment, but the figures they require for the purpose of submitting proposals are denied to members of the Opposition Parties, and, presumably, to members of the Government Party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was glad to learn from the Parliamentary Secretary this evening that it is now intended to publish the reports of the Transport Tribunal and of the Drainage Commission in the very near future.  It is possible that when Deputies of all Parties get the opportunity of reading these very interesting reports they will be enabled to put forward very valuable suggestions for the provision of more work for those who are looking for it. There was nothing illuminating in the very brief statement we had from the Parliamentary Secretary.  I want to encourage him, or whatever colleague of his has responsibility for giving <Col N="1388" /> direction and assistance to the people in the turf-cutting areas, to come to the House and make a statement at the earliest possible date for the guidance of all concerned.  I hope that, in his reply, he will give the House a rough idea of the acreage of bogs already acquired by the local authorities and the number of persons presently employed by them on turf production this year.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary has been around the country a good deal. Can he hold out any hope that the production of turf during the current year will be doubled or trebled, and, from the information at his disposal, whether it is possible to increase the number of persons that could be employed by local authorities on turf cutting?  I know myself that a good many more families are cutting turf this year than there were last year. The people who cut turf with the aid of family labour have also, of course, to look after their farming operations. They are tilling more of their land this year, and are expected at the same time to cut more turf.  If we are to have the amount of turf which will be required to provide the people in our cities and towns with fuel during the coming year, then I say the increased output will have to come from the men who are employed by the local authorities. I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will do everything he possibly can to urge on them to acquire a greater acreage of bog and to employ a far greater number of men than are presently employed on that necessary national work.</P>

      <P>May I intervene for a moment to remove a little difficulty referred to by Deputy Davin?  He suggested that the whole of those who are anxious to work in the bogs are not being used.  That is the only specific case of that kind brought to my notice. The difficulty in that case is that the work is being done by the urban district council.  It has nothing whatever to do with this Vote or, at the present moment, with me.  I have, however, been sufficiently interested in the circumstances to set inquiries on foot to see what exactly is happening. When I learn that, I shall let the Deputy know.</P>

      <P>It is very hard to understand why this Vote should be reduced this year.  The reduction amounts almost to £500,000&mdash;£400,000 on the Vote itself and £100,000, I suppose, from public bodies.  Two years ago, I pointed out to the Parliamentary Secretary that a large number of reasonably good schemes were available.  The only reason why he would not carry out those schemes was that, in a certain small district, there was not a sufficient number of unemployed men on the register.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>That is agreed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JeremiahRyan" hpid="Colonel Ryan Colonel Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Colonel Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary would not agree to send unemployed men four or five miles to the next district.  Although there might be no unemployed men in a particular district, there might be 100 unemployed men within two or three miles of that district.  Yet, they would not be brought in to do the work which was waiting for them.  There is no excuse for cutting down this Vote this year. Even if the money were not well spent this year, as often it was not well spent, it would be safer to provide a fair amount of money this year to stave off any emergency.  In the summer months you may have work in the bogs, but when the winter comes, in six months&rsquo; time, there will be practically no money to be spent on public health schemes or housing, even in rural districts.  Next year, with prices soaring and poor people perhaps hungry, there will be fewer employment schemes than ever.  It is very hard to understand the mentality of the Department of Finance or of the Government in taking that course. This year was a year when more money should have been provided for unemployment than ever, because of the special circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I find it very hard to discuss this motion.  I have been listening to Deputy Davin and to the Parliamentary Secretary, and it is difficult to ascertain who deals with unemployment. It is doubtful if anybody knows who is responsible for dealing with unemployment.  We have the Land Commission, the Department of Agriculture, the Turf Board, the Local Government Department and the <Col N="1390" /> Department of Industry and Commerce &mdash;all dealing with unemployment.  The Parliamentary Secretary knows that, for years, he and the Land Commission have been peddling at the bogs.  Yet, when I want to find out who is responsible for that work, I have to go to all the trouble in the world.  On one occasion it is the Turf Board, on another occasion it is the Land Commission and, on still another occasion it is the Board of Works.  So far as the unemployed are concerned, it does not matter which Department is responsible. The unemployed man must go to the employment exchange.  If he fails to do so, he will not get work.</P>
    <P>None of these schemes has been dealt with as it ought to have been. Hundreds of thousands of pounds have been spent in the midlands, and in my county by the Board of Works, the Turf Board and the Land Commission. Yet, in the best bogs there is neither a road nor a drain.  Where there are roads, they are made to bogs in which there is practically no turf.  That was brought to the notice of this House often enough.  The Parliamentary Secretary says that he will make a statement on this subject soon, and that roads and drains will be made in these bogs.  Let him get the roads and drains made now, and give employment. There is no use in saying you have not got the men to work in the bogs.  Work in the bogs caters for five or six different types.  Some of the men may, after practice, become very good sleansmen, others will take out the turf and others will deal with the turf when taken out.</P>
    <P>There are plenty of people to do useful work on roads to the bogs in the midlands.  Let the Parliamentary Secretary bring them there now to do the work to which I have referred and not be doing it in September next, when it is too late.  I want to impress particularly on the Parliamentary Secretary the confusion that exists between the Board of Works, the Land Commission, the Local Government Department and the Department of Industry and Commerce so far as employment is concerned.  Each of these Departments does a bit in its own way.  We have engineers from one Department driving <Col N="1391" /> past in their motor cars engineers from another Department, one engineer doing one job and another doing another job and taking no advice from anybody.</P>
    <P>There is another matter in connection with relief schemes to which I desire to refer.  The Board of Works do very few relief schemes directly.  They get the work done through the county councils.  What is the result?  It is left to the local engineers and it happens sometimes that a county councillor has a few schemes which he wants to get done.  There may be a few people in the area whom he does not like.  The engineers do not want to argue with these county councillors and their schemes are carried out. Sometimes, they are the schemes of least benefit and they are done at the instance of the assistant county surveyor. I know what I am talking about.  I know cases where roads that should have been made were not made because of that position.  What happens is that an engineer is sent from the Board of Works who looks at the road, makes his report and the work is handed over to the county council, while the most useful works are, in many cases, not done at all. That is nothing unusual.  If we are spending money we should get work for it and get the best value.  One of the reasons why there is a reduced Estimate may be that for a number of years these relief works and minor relief schemes were looked upon as an easy way of giving charity.  The men were not expected to work.  From talking to some of the people in charge of works now and again, I understand that the men were simply expected to kill time and that it was better for them to be doing that than drawing the dole.  Even if that position did exist and even if it were necessary&mdash; which I do not believe&mdash;now the time has come to change it during this year when there is plenty of work to be done suitable for each and every man, except the real corner-boy who does not want any.</P>
    <P>There should be no relief schemes of the type that gave charity to the corner-boy.  The Parliamentary Secretary <Col N="1392" /> should try to deal with unemployment in the broadest manner possible. At the moment, the Government must find money to provide fuel.  They should find it to deal with the unemployment question and not leave us facing next winter with soaring prices, which would make a difficult situation. Deputy Davin spoke about turf.  I do not wish to wander far from the subject, but this matter has been very broadly discussed.  I am satisfied there is a good deal in what Deputy Davin has said, and I am glad that the Parliamentary Secretary has promised to make a statement in the near future in connection with the whole matter. We would all like to have our minds clear as to who is responsible.  That is a thing which is disturbing the minds of everybody.</P>
    <P>I know bogs where turf is being produced, and it is doubtful if it can be brought out of the bogs unless we get a good summer.  No delay should take place in making roads and drains&mdash; especially the drains, which are most important.  In some cases, where the turf has been spread it will never be brought out if the summer is bad. After this month it will be fairly late for saving turf.  After the 31st July the time will be over unless there is a &ldquo;Michaelmas summer&rdquo; or a wonderful autumn.  It should be saved by the middle of August and be drying.  We are now at the 1st of June.  If the Parliamentary Secretary does not begin by the 1st July, it will be like some of the work of the Department of Agriculture.  He will be coming in here to find a remedy when it is three months too late.  I want to stress that. I have been in bogs during the week and have seen a disgraceful state of affairs.  I have seen bogs where roads should have been made into them. Through envy, jealousy and petty politics they were not made.</P>
    <P>In the matter of the price of turf, I do not altogether agree with Deputy Davin.  It is nearly impossible to fix the price.  It could be fixed, however, in regard to the maximum price per ton at the nearest dump or railway station to the bog.  I am saying that against myself, as I come from an area where people are making their livelihood by cutting turf.  By fixing the <Col N="1393" /> price at the bog, it would not matter whether the turf is bad or good.  A certain type of bad turf will weigh very light and it would not pay to put it on rails or cart it.  If that is so, you have three times the quantity.  Then there is a medium turf and also the heavy turf.  By fixing the maximum price at the bog, the nearest thing to justice for the whole community would be done. As I have said, I am making that point against most of the people who live near me, as they are expecting extraordinary prices and are getting them already.  In the towns, even near the bogs, the poor are being robbed.  There is nobody who will sell an ass-load of turf&mdash;they are selling by the dozen and half-dozen sods.  That is hitting the poor people very hard, and the Parliamentary Secretary should take steps immediately to set the matter right.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no complaint to make as to the numbers employed on the bogs.  I was listening to some speakers say that there are too many and that men are being taken away from other and more useful work. Others said that there are too few.  I was mystified on hearing one speaker make both statements in the same speech.  The turf scheme is proceeding very well, and great credit is due, in the main, to the initial drive which the Parliamentary Secretary gave to it.  I am quite satisfied now that it is gathering momentum, and that we will be able to produce our requirements for the coming winter.  That will certainly be so if we get a year nearly as good as last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one matter which I would like to bring to the attention of the Parliamentary Secretary.  It is the difficulty of getting suitable marine works.  I have referred to this on one or two occasions.  The condition which the Office of Public Works applies to the schemes&mdash;whereby the county council is required to contribute a certain proportion of the cost, and also give a guarantee that they will maintain the work afterwards&mdash;is a big drawback. Most of the marine works in which I am interested, at all events, would be located on islands, and the rate collection on these islands is very <Col N="1394" /> poor, so naturally there is a disinclination on the part of the county councillors who represent better ratepaying districts, to finance schemes for those who do not pay quite so much.  I do not think there would be any possibility of getting the Galway County Council, at any rate, to put up the amount for which the Parliamentary Secretary asks.  I believe I put this on paper before when writing to his Department.</P>
    <P>The Office of Public Works naturally is prepared to spend money in these places on road repair works and so on. If those schemes are not in operation a considerable amount of unemployment assistance is paid.  I would suggest to him that where there is useful work to be done he should allocate the money which would otherwise be given to road works to schemes of this sort, and not insist on the county council contribution.  I believe that some of the works put up would be regarded as useful, and that they themselves would be prepared to contribute towards them.  In these islands I know very well that the people regard marine works as far more important than road works, and would be prepared to forego employment on roads if the money were saved over a year or two and given for marine work.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be easier to give way on a matter of contribution than on one of maintenance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>On the question of maintenance, I put it to the Parliamentary Secretary that, as long as these schemes are in operation, maintenance could be dealt with by taking the view that the grant would be given in the ordinary course to a road work. I do not see any objection to adding the maintenance into the scheme.  In my opinion, it is quite possible that one would have to accept&mdash;because of the high unemployment in these places &mdash;a road which one would not accept in other places.  It is quite possible for the Parliamentary Secretary to maintain a marine work which would be of great importance.  The places I have in mind are like Inisboffin, where a sea wall is badly required.  There are slips needed in some of the Aran Islands <Col N="1395" /> and also turf quays; and in one or two places the blasting of rocks and the provision of small harbours should be undertaken.  I think particulars of these are in the Board of Works, and I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to examine the suggestions I have made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMorrissey" hpid="Mr. M. Morrissey Mr. M. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a few points I would like to raise on this Vote in connection with the turf scheme.  In some counties where heretofore very little, if any, turf was produced until the present year, the onus for the production of turf has been thrown upon the county surveyors.  I think that is very right and proper. Those people have the organisation, and it was wise on the part of the Parliamentary Secretary to select those people to carry out turf production. But I fear that county surveyors in the counties I have referred to are under the impression that they are only required to produce turf for their own institutions, such as mental hospitals, county homes and district hospitals, and they are not employing the maximum amount of labour obtainable on the bogs in those counties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wonder if the Parliamentary Secretary has issued any instructions to county surveyors that they should put as many men as possible into the production of turf?  He should dispel the idea that they are only required to produce turf for their own institutions, and that if there is a small amount left over they might be prepared to sell it.  If that idea is allowed to prevail it will have a very bad effect on turf production.  The county surveyors have the machinery.  They have the organisation and they are the only people who can produce turf in large quantities.  That applies particularly in areas where you have parish councils.  These councils have not finances enough or they may be too great a distance from the bogs and not in a position to run a turf scheme or a turf drive.  Consequently, people in these counties more or less rely for turf production on the county surveyor. I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to keep that in mind.  I do not know if it is happening, but I can <Col N="1396" /> see the danger should it happen.  Some of these county surveyors will just provide turf for their own institutions and will not think of producing turf for general consumption.</P>
    <P>I would like to impress on the Parliamentary Secretary the necessity for employment schemes for urban areas, particularly during the summer months. In rural areas at the present time there is not the great unemployment that exists in urban areas.  The extra tillage drive and the extra fuel drive naturally give employment in the rural areas, but in urban areas and county boroughs a number of men who are normally employed on housing are now unemployed.  Housing was the great employer of labour in urban areas.  In practically all urban areas and county boroughs housing is almost at a standstill, and numbers of men who have been engaged in small industries are unemployed through lack of raw material.  I fear the unemployment problem for urban areas is going to be much worse and I think special consideration should be given to urban areas in regard to employment schemes. If local authorities are slow in putting forward schemes, the Department or the Board of Works should step in and appoint an engineer to put up schemes of employment for those areas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>In this Vote there are certain moneys for turf development. There are certain moneys for the purpose of making roads into bogs.  I mean in the ordinary way of turf roads and things of that kind.  In addition to that, there has been made, about a month ago, a fairly complete statement of the position by the Government in relation to the present existing scheme of turf development.  What I am anxious to do is to guard myself and this Vote against a discussion of that portion of turf development and that portion of the turf scheme which does not come within it, but I am anxious, at the same time, to use the Vote for the purpose of giving to the House any such information of the kind which would come within the compass of the Vote which they want. The custom of this Vote has been to regard it as one in which we did try <Col N="1397" /> to help those who wanted information and we did try to regard any contribution that was made to the discussion, in whatever tone and spirit it was made, as being intended in fact for the purpose of improving matters.  For that reason, I propose to give you such information as I can reasonably, within the ambit of the Vote.  I am going to take now simply general matters. I do not think it will take us very long.</P>
      <P>Land improvement schemes are put down here for £50,000, and some complaint has been made as to the inadequacy of that amount, having regard to the fact that a good many members in the House do believe that these schemes themselves are of real value.  I happen to be one of those who do believe that these schemes are of real value and who believe that a considerable amount of expenditure along these lines may be desirable. The difficulty has been in practice to reconcile a large expenditure from this Vote on that particular purpose.  We were in considerable doubts from the very beginning as to the degree in which expenditure on farm improvements could in fact be brought within our customary definition of its purpose, that was, to get the money into the hands of those people who had a formal declaration from the State, in the form of unemployment assistance registration, that they were entitled to receive support.  Most of the schemes fell in areas which did not possess those people and, in practice, were very largely carried out by people who were not on the register and, in a great many cases, not necessitous people in any sense of the word.  That is why we have had to watch this particular contribution with a considerable amount of caution, and our point of view was that while it was a perfectly legitimate and proper subsidy to agriculture, perhaps one of the best of all ways of subsidising and developing agriculture, it was not a Vote which fitted conveniently or efficiently into the framework of our responsibility in this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For that reason, in this year the amount which is being withdrawn from the limited sum which is made available for the specific purpose of relieving <Col N="1398" /> distress due to unemployment is low, but the question as to the extent it will be extended is being given very careful consideration. In my opinion, this money should always have appeared in the Vote for the Department of Agriculture.  In all probability, in its development in the future&mdash;and I think its development in the future may be very considerable&mdash;it will be probably outside the ambit of this particular Vote.  Therefore, the question of £50,000, or any other amount, must not confuse the mind of any Deputy.</P>
    <P>We are all politicians, and we all know that the gospel of politicians is: &ldquo;When in doubt, believe the worst.&rdquo; The suggestion that the reduction of £400,000 was made to meet the Budgetary requirements of the Minister for Finance is just as natural as it is untrue.  How untrue it is, is clear from the fact that the Minister, before the Vote was ever discussed, had given an assurance to the House that any further moneys that would be required would be available.  In the brief I have given to you to-day, I actually stated in the most specific form that if, in the developed condition we may have, and the better knowledge we may have of the necessities of the problem, the necessity does, in fact, arise for an increase under any head of this Vote, we have the assurance of the Minister and the Government that this necessity will be met.  Therefore, £400,000 at the moment, whether you think it should or should not be there, is merely a book-keeping matter.  It is a question as to when the money will be available.</P>
    <P>I have been told, not for the first time&mdash;and if it be my sad responsibility to stand over this Vote for any further period, then certainly not for the last time&mdash;that there is any amount of work to be done.  There is no man living who is more anxious to find works within the definition of the purposes of this Vote than I am.  I do not think there is any member of the House, of any politics or any prejudices, who has any doubt about that.  Remember what we have to do is to convert a sum of money voted by this House, into food, clothing, shelter and maintenance for <Col N="1399" /> men who are in distress due to unemployment. From the very beginning, day by day and every day, our task and our responsibility have been to try to find methods by which the largest portion of this money provided by the State would, in fact, be directed to that purpose.  I do not think there is any man of any politics in the House who doubts that, successfully or otherwise, that is what we have tried to do. In practice that meant, unless you were prepared to go in for large schemes of temporary transport or unless you were prepared to provide housing accommodation, temporary or otherwise&mdash; tentage, huttage and schemes of that kind&mdash;and to transfer people to them, that the works had to be done within either walking or cycling distance of the people who were unemployed.</P>
    <P>In the early stages when we started this particular scheme, the number of people in western districts in the &ldquo;black&rdquo; areas, who had cycles was relatively small and the result was that the distance over which we could expect men to travel was less than it is now.  A large amount of small unemployment assistance payments&mdash; 2/-, 3/- and 4/- per man&mdash;has been used in western Ireland to pay instalments on bicycles and the result is that that problem has been practically revolutionised in the western area.  The distance which men can be expected, and are willing, to travel to works is now considerably greater.  At all times there have been men in the West of Ireland who have been prepared to walk amazing distances and to go through very great hardships for the purpose of earning even the small amount of money which was being paid on relief works rather than draw the dole but the position now is, with the extension of the use of bicycles in these districts, even out on the small islands, that you find that the men can travel greater distances.  The effect of that has been that we have been able in western districts to start works which previously we could not but, even with that improved condition, the availability of works in those &ldquo;black&rdquo; areas is now beginning to be exhausted.  We <Col N="1400" /> have the problem now of taking these men considerable distances&mdash;I mean 20, 30, 40 or even 50 miles.  I wish some member of the House who thinks this is an easy problem, one that can be solved immediately, would just go and examine the map of unemployment which is outside the Library at the present moment.  He would then recognise that these &ldquo;black&rdquo; areas are a congestion of unemployment.</P>
    <P>The proportion of men who are unemployed outside these areas is relatively small.  There are 3,000 electoral areas in the Twenty Six Counties.  I think there are 280 electoral areas in which there is not a single man on the unemployment register.  There are 850 in each of which there are less than five on the unemployment register.  You can see, therefore, that you have a very big area in which there is practically none of these unemployed people.  When you realise the nature of your transport problem you will realise that unless we are prepared actually physically to move for a considerable period people from those areas into other areas and keep them there, the problem of temporary migration is very difficult.  In addition to that, we have got to face the fact that our people do not want to migrate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. D. Morrissey Mr. D. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Thousands of them have migrated before now to England and Scotland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that.  I do not regard anything the Deputy has said or is saying as controversial.  I believe that he is making his contribution, exactly as I am making my contribution, to an examination of this question. The reason that people have been prepared to migrate from Western districts to Scotland was they wanted to earn a lot of money in a short time.  They went there to earn intensified piece-rates, and such a system was not available for migrants within the country.  They will not migrate from their own district to another district for ordinary rates of wages for a short period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That has been proved in every test that we have made up to the present. It is one of the problems with which, in relation to turf, we are quite definitely <Col N="1401" /> faced.  We have now a position in which we would be prepared to offer piece rates under which they could earn very high wages, wages as high and higher than they could earn in Scotland.  I went through the piece-rate earnings of men who went to those counties the other day, and the answer was &ldquo;It knocked Scotland to bits.&rdquo;  Any man who is prepared to go and work there can, if he chooses, do all the things that he previously was doing in Scotland.  Deputy Hickey again takes the suggestion that we are going to take men from Cork, and we are taking men from Cork, out 20 miles.  It is going to cost 12/-.  In the ordinary way, where you are dealing with a limited sum of money, that would simply mean that much less money available to give to the men.  That is the way I look at it.  If, in addition to that or alternative to that, I take a particular &ldquo;yellow&rdquo; area which has no employment works done in it, and I say I am going to bring the men from the black areas there, then I have to face the capital cost of temporarily putting up buildings and things of that kind.  That again is going to come out of the total sum which is available. The House may say: &ldquo;We are prepared to provide unlimited money,&rdquo; but we know that, in practice, when all those unlimited sums are added together they eventually reach a stage where, on Budget day here, every one of them has to be accounted for by income-tax, by taxes on tea, taxes on tobacco, taxes on petrol and all the rest of it.  It is at that point that the House breaks down in facing the responsibility to meet a problem of that kind.  If I had unlimited money, if I were in a position in which it did not matter to me what it cost to build temporary houses, with sanitation or otherwise, or what it cost me to transfer the men in buses, then there would be no difficulty.  At any rate, I would be in a position to make the offer; whether or not it would be accepted is another question.  But, in the matter of turf, I am prepared to go a good distance along the road of seeing whether it can be done.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. D. Morrissey Mr. D. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>If it is necessary <Col N="1402" /> in respect of turf, will we not have to go all the distance?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have said before to the House, I will do all things that are possible and necessary.  But suppose I have to face the fact, as mentally I am facing the fact, that I may have to put an extra 10,000 men&mdash;it may be 50,000 men&mdash;in temporary hutments on bogs in places where there is no accommodation now; there is not the material available to make those temporary hutments without cutting into things which would be of relatively the same importance.  It is a question of: &ldquo;No straw shall be given unto you, yet shall ye deliver the tale of brick.&rdquo; I have to build houses without wood, and, according to Deputy Hickey, I have to transport men without paying anything for the transport of them. I am giving an illustration of the spirit in which this is being worked.  To the extent to which it is necessary and possible, the method of transfer of labour will be used, but the actual distribution of labour, of unemployed distressed labour, and, above all, labour competent for the particular jobs, is relatively so bad&mdash; everyone of you is in a position to check it up by examination of the maps which are available&mdash;that I do not know how far it can be done.  But I am going to try.  I have been making an intensive examination of the boroughs.  Those who are in authority, and those whose business it is to know the whole of the possibilities of those districts for the purpose of finding artificial works for employment under the present conditions and the amount of materials which will be available, have been told: &ldquo;Give us the maximum amount of works; give us the outlines of the plans for the maximum amount of work which you can undertake, and which is available.&rdquo;  Deputy Morrissey mentioned that at some time I had a very pessimistic outlook on artificial employment, especially in the industrial areas, due to the present crisis.  I had, and it was at that time and on that basis that those unlimited demands were made upon the experience and the intimate knowledge of those who ought to know.  I am satisfied <Col N="1403" /> that they were competent; I am satisfied that they were knowledgeable, and I am satisfied that they used their competence and their knowledge to dig out for me what was available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The total that was dug out would be a negligible contribution to the size of the problem as it was then envisaged, so negligible relatively, and so costly relative to another method of dealing with it, that it is questionable whether it would be more than a mere gesture, whether it would not be better honestly to face the fact that the money which was being spent artificially in that way on the relief of a few people on employment works was absorbing two or three times as much of the resources as was required to make a contribution to the same standard of comfort of other people maintained in other and less desirable ways.  I have one collection of figures from one particular place, where the amount runs into, say, £400,000. Ninety per cent. of it was work which no one of us would, in an emergency, pass for the purpose of employment works on the standard which you and I are now prepared to accept&mdash;that in an emergency the test of the works is that the value shall go to the people who are in distress.  I know that, in practice, people tell me: &ldquo;At every two miles of the road you can find them.&rdquo;  In a good many cases, perfectly honest men who have believed that have come into my office, and I have said: &ldquo;Now, there is your own district; there is the amount of money which belongs to it; there is the number of unemployed.  Find me the scheme, and I will give you every help.&rdquo;  But it has not happened. When we had an employment committee, we went out into the highways and the by-ways, and we asked everybody for any scheme, sane or insane, good or bad.  We wanted the whole lot on the table; we wanted in our possession the absolute and complete pool of schemes that could be justified on the basis that the money was going where it ought to go.  We did not receive from the general public, or from any portion of the general public, a single scheme outside the ambit <Col N="1404" /> of the schemes with which we were ourselves already acquainted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. D. Morrissey Mr. D. Morrissey">

      <P>No.  I am prepared, as I tell you, to do whatever can be done, but I am not prepared to fool myself or the House.  I am not prepared to spend £100,000 if only £20,000 of it goes to the place to which it ought to go. The question has been put: why have we reduced the amount of public health works?  I will tell the House our difficulty in that matter.  It is quite easy if you say that you do not care where the works go, or who gets the money, but if you deal with it on the basis that you have to distribute the money in some measure of fairness, and that it is to go to those who are in necessity, then from that standard public health works have come out, in practice, deplorably.  They are generally in altogether too big units to meet the specific necessities of the case, and they nearly always fall in areas where, from that point of view, they are not required.  Looking back on all the public works which have passed through this fund, I think I can say that not a single one came up to any reasonable standard of bringing the remedy to the disease.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I mean that the proportion is low, that a few men get all the money.  I will give the House a couple of cases.  Sometimes the House asks me to give statistics of the number of works done and the amount involved in every district, in every town and in every county, and, as the House knows, I do not do so.  What I do is to give the House a record of every single scheme done, giving exactly what it costs and where it was done.  In addition to that, we give a distributed view of all the schemes, but we do not aggregate it to particular areas, because our experience is that it would give an entirely wrong view. There were two neighbouring counties, and their proper allocation from the Unemployment Vote was roughly <Col N="1405" /> £12,000.  One got £24,000 and the other £12,000, the reason being that there was a £12,000 public health work done in that district and distribution relative to the unemployment was so bad&mdash; it was certified to us to be necessary for public health purposes&mdash;that we could not credit any reasonable portion of it against the county or district as a whole.  Public health works have always been included in this Vote. They have remained there, but I have never pretended to the House that I regarded them as coming anywhere within the line of distribution efficiency that we have claimed for such things as minor relief works, road works or works of that kind.</P>
      <P>I have dealt with migration of labour.  If I can, and to the extent to which I can, I will attend to it. The total number of men at present employed directly under the county surveyors in the production of turf is somewhere about 16,000.  There are a very considerable number of men outside that ambit being employed, and, in certain counties, the number of men who are being employed directly by the county surveyors is a very small proportion of the total who have been artificially stimulated into activity on private bogs.  We are definitely short of men on the bogs, but there is the difficulty both of transport and of temporary accommodation.  There is also the puzzle, which those members of the House who would like to investigate the reality of the justification of Employment Period Orders would find very interesting, in the relation between the maximum number we can get out on the bogs for well-paid labour and the number who, in the winter, are on unemployment assistance. That is a problem which it is very difficult to solve.  In districts in which there were 8,000 or 9,000 men on the unemployment register, under conditions in which men can earn as good wages, if not better wages, as they ever earned in their lives&mdash;in some cases, in which they can earn far better wages&mdash;we are not getting out the proportion of men which the House and I thought would be available.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I have heard that stated outside as well as here, and I <Col N="1406" /> should like to ask the Parliamentary Secretary whether any steps are being, or will be, taken to check up on such areas to see what those men are doing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Deputy asked that question.  As a matter of fact, some of my expert staff have been put on to investigate that problem, because I envisage that as an objective problem which will have to be solved for next year.  It is not the problem of the amount of turf required this year that matters; it is not the problem of the number whom you can get this year that matters.  It is the problem of how much more we can get for next year.  At the present moment, every county surveyor in the country is calling out for men.  The point is: is it our business to bring the bogs to the men, or is it the business of the men to go to the bogs?  There is an opportunity, through the labour exchanges, to any man to get transport if he wants to look for a job in these areas.  The plain English of it is that there must be a lot of people here who could look for that work&mdash;I am going to facilitate them in every way&mdash;but, on the face of it, here is the biggest demand for rural labour that has ever arisen in this country, and that demand is not being satisfied, while there is visibly a pool of unemployed men.</P>
      <P>We have all got to face up to that and to its responsibilities, and, as Deputy Morrissey has said, the responsibility is upon us to investigate why, and where they are and why they should not be there, and to face whatever unpleasant responsibilities may remain in dealing with the knowledge when we get it.</P>

      <P>At any rate, what is common ground is that there is a responsibility upon us to investigate that problem, to see what it means, to see who is responsible, and to see that the maximum amount of remedy is brought to anything that is now slack, progressively in this year or completely in next year.  It has been suggested that the military should turn out on the bogs.  There are 960 men in the No. 1 Construction Corps.  The Minister for Defence has put them at the disposal of the scheme.  One section of them is working in Cork, another is working in Galway, a third is building a railway on the Clonsast bog, and the fourth, I think, has now been moved into position.  But in addition to that, the Minister for Defence has put at the disposal of this national necessity, to the degree that is possible, the Regular Army, and they are turning out in all sorts of places and doing excellent work cutting turf for the requirements of the Army.  The thing is being done in a manner which is of the highest possible credit to the Army&mdash;an Army which will not merely defend the assets of this State but which is prepared to help to produce them&mdash;a two-fisted Army in which both fists are working for the State.  I think a little moment of enthusiasm might be permitted to all of us in expressing thanks and appreciation for that work.</P>

      <P>At a very early stage, when this thing was faced, we recognised that that was the bottle-neck, and everyone who had to do with the production of these has been stimulated to do it.  In some cases they have dropped making anything else. The amount of sleans actually now in stock, in the possession of the manufacturers, is low, but there are sleans enough for the men we have on the bog, and I am satisfied that there will be sleans for all the men whom the co-operation of all of us will put upon the bog.  I think it was Deputy Michael Morrissey who suggested that some of the county surveyors might be under the mistaken impression that they were only required to cut turf sufficient for their own necessities, or a little more.  A public statement was issued by the Government at an early stage, in which it was suggested that the county surveyors and their organisation were invited, first, to produce the turf they required for themselves, and thereafter to an unlimited maximum, and I think that any of them who do not understand that now will understand it after this statement.  As far as I know, every one of them is working on that particular principle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Davin, I think, was rather disturbed at the fact that there seemed to be a reduction in the minor relief provision which included the provision of turf roads.  I can deal with that pretty fully, because the money for further development of turf roads is going to come out of this Vote.  This Vote, during this year, as I told you, I think, in the first statement, is going to be used as an emergency pool.  A good many things which we cannot now envisage clearly may arise as necessities to be dealt with.  Money will be taken out of this fund, and money will be put back into this fund in a fluid and flexible way so as to enable those works to be done, and the intention is to carry them out as fluidly and as flexibly as we can.  The ordinary way of asking for a drain or a turf road was that somebody sent up an application to the Board of Works.  Assuming that it was a district in which work of that kind was required to that amount, that application was examined <Col N="1409" /> by one of our surveyors, some plan was made of it, it was then fitted into the scheme, and eventually sent down in one or other of the periodical sets of grants for the purpose of being done.  What is happening now is this: The county surveyors have been made responsible for the carrying out of the turf scheme as a whole, and not merely for that portion of the scheme which is carried out by themselves.  They have been given power to take over any bog at a price which is based upon the reasonable value of it, which can be ascertained by machinery which is provided, and they can find turf banks in that way, not merely for themselves, but for all other subsidiary local authorities and for practically any other bodies who are prepared to show that they will work them.</P>
    <P>Now, most of the bogs which the county surveyors are working are virgin bogs.  I have seen&mdash;well, I should say, literally hundreds of miles of new bog faces developed under this scheme.  I have seen thousands of acres covered with works of this kind at the moment, but in many cases, if good work is to be got out of them this year and next year, those have involved road work and drainage. When the county surveyor himself, who is responsible for developing that work, is satisfied that the work is one which ought to be done, which will produce an adequate return in turf this year or next year, then it is done automatically. What he does is this.  He sends up a requisition for that road, gives its description, the amount which is required for it, and his certificate that that is work which ought to be done for that purpose, and, practically speaking, the authority issues at once.</P>

      <P>I wish you would extend that excellent scheme a little further.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>That scheme will be extended to whatever degree is safe, but it is not going to be extended outside its proper ambit.  I am concerned so that the House will understand that in relation to the powers given to work bogs, in the money which has been provided for working them, and in the celerity and flexibility of the controlling <Col N="1410" /> administration, everything that is possible is being and will be done.  That money comes through this Vote, the facilities for doing that&mdash;the machinery which enables it to be done&mdash;come through this Vote, and it is for that reason I am able to discuss things of that kind with the Deputy.</P>
      <P>I could go back over all the details which have been mentioned in Deputies&rsquo; speeches, but I think that in the summary which I have made I have taken up what would be the broad substance of the matters with which Deputies who are interested in the administration and the improvement of the administration of the Vote are concerned. There may be such detailed matters as that particular U.D. scheme in Birr, which Deputy Davin had in mind, and others that have arisen and, if there are questions of that kind, I shall try to deal with them directly with the Deputies concerned.</P>
      <P>Deputy Bartley was interested in relation to a matter which, I think, I might allude to for a moment.  That is, those marine works out on the islands. As the Deputy knows, they are quite as close to my heart as they are to his.  I know those islands very well and those are the people that probably I know best of all.  Our line of country has been this, that for the State to give money to produce a structural work which those who are getting the benefit do not even think worth maintaining, was a serious responsibility. You and I know how eager people are in matters of this sort.  This is a story which is not intended to apply to Deputy Bartley, but on one occasion I was foolish enough to let it be known that I was going to inspect the particular place in which it was suggested there should be a pier, and I think every curragh for 70 miles around was gathered there to prove the necessity for that particular pier.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>At any rate, they thought I would be impressed by things of that kind.  However, my knowledge of the country did not allow me to be deceived in that matter.  Where a county council or any other body in a <Col N="1411" /> district is prepared to say: &ldquo;If you build it we will keep it in order,&rdquo; that is some guarantee.  That is my point all the time and I have had a lot of trouble from time to time because I have tried to make local authorities contribute.  People have a very low standard in relation to relief works. It is a tradition stretching back over the years.  The money is regarded as &ldquo;buckshee&rdquo; money.  Why I want local authorities and other people to contribute is because I want them to be critical.  If the work is not a right work, if the work is not being carried out properly, if men are lounging about and not doing their work, I want the local authority to know they are paying for some of it and I want them to react by seeing that that sort of thing will not occur.</P>
      <P>I was under the impression, as far as Galway is concerned, that at the moment they are prepared to pay maintenance upon schemes of that kind. Some counties have been very good in the matter, but a couple have taken a rather obstinate attitude, and they will not contribute at all.  We are trying to do our best.  So far as the islands and the black areas and the poor people knocking about the rocky shores living very hard lives are concerned, we are not refusing them anything that we can within reason do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have said here that we are administering this Vote as a trust, that we have a moral obligation to perform and that we have always tried rigorously in the past to carry out that obligation.  In this year there are going to be moneys expended through this Vote which will not come up to that high standard.  I am giving fair warning that to that extent this Vote cannot be regarded in that particular way.  For instance, in relation to turf development we are not limited to the labour exchange.  Our business is to <Col N="1412" /> get efficient men as quickly as possible. That departs from the standard in which men of necessity were used first, even though they were less efficient. The principal purpose of the Vote in other years was not to get the work done, but to benefit those who might be inefficient through necessity.</P>
    <P>So long as the House understands that in carrying out the Vote this year that atmosphere will have to be faced to some extent, I am content.  To the extent to which it is possible still to use this Vote rigorously for the purpose of benefiting those who need it most, we will continue to use it, and to the extent to which this Vote proves insufficient for the necessities which experience may throw up, then we shall go back to the Minister for Finance for more money, and we have his assurance that that money will be at our disposal.</P>

      <P>I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to tell us what is the position with regard to drainage schemes that were under drainage boards that have lapsed for a number of years.  I found that the Board of Works objected to these schemes because at one time they had been under drainage boards, even though these have ceased to function.</P>
