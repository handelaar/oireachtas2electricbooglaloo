      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Supplies whether a standard price has been fixed for white flour, and, if not, whether he proposes to fix a price so as to prevent profiteering in the sale of such flour.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Supplies (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>The manufacture of white flour, as ordinarily understood, is prohibited except under permits which are confined to altar bread, baby foods, semolina and baking powder.  The quantity produced under the authority of such permits is very small.</P>
      <P>A standard price has been fixed by order for all flour produced in the country.  The price is 52/6 per sack of 280 lbs. free on rail at the port centres of Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Waterford, with an addition of the cheapest transport costs in the case of other areas.</P>
      <P>My Department will investigate any complaints of alleged profiteering in the sale of flour.  Two complaints have been received which, on investigation, disclosed no undue profit for the retailer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister not aware that a price as high as 6/6 a stone has been charged for white flour brought in from the Six-County area? Is it possible that the Minister&rsquo;s inspectors are unaware of that fact? Are any steps going to be taken to protect consumers against the flour being sold at that exorbitant price?</P>

      <P>Excess prices are not being charged by the millers for flour. I have, in reply to a question by the Deputy on the 19th February last, explained that the fund to which he refers is being created out of the prices being charged to the millers by Grain Importers (Éire) Ltd., for imported wheat.  The sum at present in the fund is approximately £100,000 and it is estimated that this figure will be increased to £120,000 at the end of the present cereal year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Supplies whether he is aware that the work of protection of our inland fisheries within the Limerick fishery district has been very greatly hampered by the fact that no supply or no sufficient supply of petrol is being allowed to the inspectors or bailiffs of the conservators of that district, and whether he will favourably consider granting supplementary allowances for this work of national importance, when so requested by the Board of Conservators.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that the shortage of petrol supplies has created difficulties in the carrying on of most activities throughout the country and it may be that the protection of inland fisheries within the Limerick fishery district has been hampered also.  I have been able to allocate a limited quantity of petrol for taxed motor cars for the current month, but I regret that I am unable to increase these allowances by the issue of supplementary licences.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I gather from the Minister&rsquo;s answer that he recognises both the importance of the industry and the fact that considerable damage can be done to it if poaching cannot be kept down.  I take it that the Minister will do all that possibly can be done to give an increased supply of petrol to the inspectors, if circumstances permit, so as to enable those watching the poachers to deal with what may turn into a very serious situation for the industry?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Supplies whether he is aware that tea constitutes an important food to persons who are engaged in the cutting of turf, and whether he will make arrangements with county surveyors to make supplies of tea available for consumption by workers on bogs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of an extra allowance of tea for workers engaged in the cutting of turf has already been considered.  I have found it possible to arrange that a limited quantity can be made available to permit the grant of a small additional allowance in cases where workers are employed on turf cutting in organised groups of substantial size at considerable distances from their homes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the Minister&rsquo;s reply, will he indicate briefly what is the method of distribution?  Is it through the county surveyor or the individual worker?</P>

    <Col N="355" />
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no standard method of distribution.  In the case of such organised groups, as I have mentioned, of substantial size, where there is some responsible person in charge, who can ensure that the extra allowance is properly utilised, the distribution is made through that person.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The quantity of tea that is available is, naturally, very small, and if the provision of this extra allowance were to be extended to groups of workers in a wide variety of categories, it would be used up very quickly.  It is possible to deal with only a limited number of workers, and then only in very special circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCurran" hpid="Mr. Curran Mr. Curran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Curran</NameTxt>
      <P>The number of road workers would not be very large, and if the Minister could extend this increased allowance to these workers, it would be of very great benefit to them. I have just had a letter from a road worker in that connection.</P>

      <P>The number of complaints received by my Department during the four months ended 30th April, 1941, concerning alleged excessive prices charged to the public was 426.</P>
      <P>My Department investigates all alleged excessive prices reported to it, but the Deputy should understand that an offence is committed only when a Price Control Order is contravened. During the period mentioned in the question no proceedings were instituted for the contravention of Price Control Orders.</P>
      <P>The investigation of the 426 complaints to which I have referred is proceeding. This investigation has shown that in 47 per cent. of the cases examined the prices charged were not excessive; in 17 per cent. of the cases the prices were found to be excessive and were adjusted at the instance of my Department; and in the remaining 36 per cent. of the cases the information furnished to my Department was insufficient to enable the investigation to be completed.</P>

There are many cases of excessive prices charged for commodities in respect of which a Price Control Order has neither been made nor been found practicable.  In such cases the action taken by my Department is with a view to securing an adjustment of the price, a refund of the overcharge, and the adoption of such measures as will ensure that the overcharge will not be repeated.</P>

In a letter of invitation these bodies were informed that I had had under consideration for some time what steps could best be taken to deal with unemployment following on shortage of supplies; the desirability, in particular, of prolonging employment for as many workers as possible for as long a period as possible; the desirability of requesting firms to avoid overtime and the possibility in certain cases of short-time working or working on a rotational basis subject to the exigencies of each industry.

    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>This Budget, coupled with the issue of the revolutionary Emergency Powers Order No. 83 and coupled also with the failure of the Government to control prices or to eliminate profiteering up to the present, proves that the present Government is a very reactionary type of capitalist Government, probably the most reactionary of the democratic Governments existing to-day.  This Budget, in my opinion, looks like the last prop that is about to be put under a collapsing, unchristian, capitalist social system, and I doubt if it will be the privilege of any Minister now sitting on the Government Benches to find any prop that will carry on the policy which this Government appears to have made up its mind to carry on. We all know that millions could be got during the past year or two, and probably so long as money is required, from the banks and the moneylenders for the purchase of implements of destruction, or the setting up of a defence system which will meet the requirements <Col N="364" /> of to-day, while, on the other hand, the same bankers and moneylenders, through the agency of the Government, will not give us hundreds, in some cases, and thousands, in others, to carry out works of a constructive nature.</P>
      <P>I am sure that every Deputy, who lives in a bog area particularly, during the past 12 months or two years, has made repeated applications through the proper channel for small grants for the carrying out of bog road repair works, for bog drainage and for other works necessary in rural areas, and that he has received the same kind of unsympathetic answer that we have all received: the money was not available for the carrying out of this work, or there was not a sufficient number of registered unemployed in the area to justify the allocation of a grant of something like £100.  We have been told, on the other hand, by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance&mdash;and I challenge the accuracy of the statement&mdash;that £500,000 of the people&rsquo;s money raised by taxation last year had to be returned to the Exchequer because, in the opinion of the Parliamentary Secretary and his advisers, there were no suitable schemes for the absorption of the money.  I am not accepting that statement because I can produce evidence to prove that it is incorrect, so far as it applies to my own constituency.  The £500,000, or whatever sum was returned to the Exchequer at the end of the financial year, was returned, in my opinion, in order to reduce the Budget deficit, and not because sufficient schemes of an acceptable nature for the employment of men were not available.  I can quote many cases of applications for grants for the repair of bog roads being made and turned down during the past couple of years, and now we have plenty of excitement in the Department of Finance in respect of the securing of men to carry out these works as quickly as they can be carried out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know why the Minister, in introducing his Budget, thought fit to slip in this Emergency Powers Order and to relate it in any way to the <Col N="365" /> Budget Resolution which we are now discussing.  In that particular portion of his speech, the Minister said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We are to-day promulgating two orders of first-class importance which are, to some extent&mdash;</P>
    <P>I underline the words &ldquo;to some extent&rdquo;</P>
    <P>&mdash;complementary to the proposals in regard to income-tax and corporation profits tax with which I have been dealing.  These orders place restrictions on increase of rates of remuneration of practically all classes of workers and employees in the service of public utility and statutory undertakings in certain essential industries and sheltered or protected industries and, at the same time, limit the amount that can be paid by companies either by way of dividends or remuneration of directors.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Here is another part of that reference which I should like the Minister to explain:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Where companies have paid no dividend they will be allowed, under the order, to distribute up to 6 per cent. per annum on all their paid-up ordinary share capital.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I should not like to suggest to the Minister, or any of his colleagues, that this Emergency Powers Order has been introduced for the deliberate purpose of provoking trouble in this country. So far as I know, there has been very little trouble during the past six or 12 months or loss of time through strikes arising out of demands made, and rightly made, by workers for increased remuneration to meet the huge increase in the cost of living.  Is the Minister justifying the introduction of this order by the number of strikes that have taken place, and the loss of working days involved in them?  The Minister and his Government have received every co-operation and toleration from organised workers since the emergency arose in the middle of last year.</P>
    <P>We have the cases of some of our big trade unions who sent pretty large sums to the Government to help them over the troubled period without <Col N="366" /> asking for any interest on the sums so advanced.  I wonder will the Minister tell us&mdash;I am sure he has the information&mdash;what response he has received in that respect from the bacon curers, the flour millers, and the profiteers who are getting away by being allowed to charge the excessive prices which have been charged since the emergency arose and since the outbreak of the war.  Has he received any money free of interest from the bacon curers, the bankers, the flour millers, or the other people who are to be dealt with under this section of the Emergency Powers Order so far as it applies to the collection of taxation under the heading of excess profits? I daresay the Emergency Powers Order and the Bill introduced shortly before that are the interest which the Government proposes to pay to trade unions who gave the money to the Government during this critical period free of interest.</P>
    <P>I warn the Government, if they are not looking for trouble, that they should reconsider without delay their decision to put this Emergency Powers Order into operation.  If they do not do so, there will be a day of reckoning and there will be an answer given by the people who will be so seriously affected, especially as the Government have done nothing, on the admission of the Minister for Supplies to-day, to deal with the profiteering and racketeering which is going on.</P>
    <P>One could, I suppose, relate this kind of Emergency Powers Order to a standstill order dealing with prices, but certainly not to income-tax or excess profits tax.  When I was speaking the other night and criticising, as I am entitled to do, the inaction or failure of the Government to deal with the profiteers and racketeers, the Minister interrupted me, apparently without any knowledge of what was going on in another Department of the Government, and said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We have not threatened the profiteers; we have acted.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>When he intervened again he said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I said we did not issue threats to these people, but we were acting.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="367" /> What is the history of the action taken by the Government to deal with the profiteers?  In the 12 months ending 31st December, 1940, the Minister for Supplies admitted that he had received 585 complaints from citizens of the State alleging that excessive profits were charged for different commodities. After investigating the 585 complaints, he decided in his wisdom to prosecute in four cases and three convictions were secured in the courts.</P>

It is a matter for your ruling, Sir, but I submit that he is entitled to back up that and make the best case he can for it.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I was allowed to make a statement on Thursday night which I have repeated, that while the Government have, through this emergency order, taken power from Wednesday last to stabilise the wages of the workers, they have refused so far to use the machinery which they have at their disposal to stabilise or control prices or to eliminate the profiteer. On that occasion the Minister for Finance, whose policy and speech are involved in the Resolution now before the House, challenged the accuracy of my statement.  I propose, and I hope you, Sir, will allow me, to proceed to give particulars of cases which will justify the statement I was allowed to make on last Thursday evening.  That is being done, I assure you, Sir, without any reference to anything which can be stated by me or any other Deputy on the Estimates for the Department of Supplies when they come up for consideration.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I can give you, Sir, an assurance that I will not repeat this. I am endeavouring to prove to the satisfaction of the Minister for Finance that what he stated in the House the other evening is not correct.  Out of the 426 additional complaints made by the citizens of the State to the same Department of excessive prices having been charged during the last four months, action has been taken in only 17 per cent. of the cases. The profiteers and the racketeers have not been brought before the courts and punished, as they should have been, for fleecing the poor and the community in general in this period of crisis.  On Saturday week, I listened to the Taoiseach addressing the representatives of parish councils in Tullamore, where he repeated, with greater emphasis, statements which he had made elsewhere to the effect that the Government would deal in a ruthless way with any farmer who did not till his land, or the percentage of it which he was required to till under the terms of the Compulsory Tillage Order. The Taoiseach declared:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I want to warn the farmers now that if they do not grow enough food for all&mdash;the human population and the animal population&mdash;and if, in consequence, there is a shortage, the animals will have to go.  It has had to be done in other countries, but we will be quite ruthless about it here.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The farmers, and those who are not doing their duty, are liable to be dealt with in that way.  The farmers who are not tilling the amount of land they are required to till in order to meet the requirements of the order made by the Minister for Agriculture are being brought before the courts, and fairly heavy fines are being imposed on them for non-compliance.  The Taoiseach, however, in the course of his speech criticised the very low fines which, he said, are being imposed, and called for the imposition of heavier penalties. If the Taoiseach is correctly reported in the local paper from which I have already quoted, he went on to say the farmers&rsquo; lands would be taken from them if they did not do their duty in accordance with the requirements of <Col N="371" /> the Government.  The farmers, as I have said, are being brought into court. Fairly heavy fines are being imposed on them, and I think that, in certain circumstances, it has been suggested that their lands should be confiscated; but, according to what we have heard here this evening from the Minister for Supplies, one dare not bring under public notice the name of any person who has been proved to be charging excessive prices.</P>
    <P>What is the explanation of the different treatment that is being meted out to the farmer as against the profiteer? Some of the profiteers are selling the farmers&rsquo; produce at 100 per cent. more than they paid for it.  The Minister for Finance knows that perfectly well.  He must know, too, that at the end of last harvest surplus oats in this country was bought at 12/- and 14/- a barrel.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is now discussing the Department of Agriculture in relation to a matter that was very fully dealt with in a debate that has not yet been brought to a conclusion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I could quote many other cases to justify my statement that there is wholesale profiteering and racketeering going on through the country.  I brought cases of the kind to the notice of the responsible Ministers on several occasions in this House.  The Taoiseach tells the Farmers of the country that they must plough their land and get it ready for the sowing of mangold seeds, but he farmers, having ploughed their land, cannot get the mangold seeds.  Some of them have come to Dublin on excursions to try and find the places where mangold seed is said to be on sale.  Some have succeeded in getting it, and have been charged exorbitant and excessive prices for it.  On the 30th April last, in this House, I drew the attention of the Minister for Agriculture to an advertisement which appeared in a newspaper stating that there was a large quantity of mangold seed for sale at 5/- per lb.  (The reference is <Col N="372" /> cols. 1936-7, Dáil Debates.) The Minister for Agriculture admitted that he had not even reported this case, which I brought to his notice, to the Prices Commission, or to whatever body is responsible for dealing with proiteering. I have another case which I know has been brought to the notice of the Minister for Supplies.  The particulars of this case are given over the name of a well-known baker in the City of Dublin.  They appeared in a newspaper issued on the 3rd May last. In that paper it is stated:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;White flour will soon be as valuable (commercially) as gold dust or bullion if the present prices for it in Eire are allowed to soar further. We know of white flour sold last week in Dublin to householders at 4/6 per stone.  That works out at&rsquo; 90/- per 20 stone sack&mdash;the unit bakers usually work on.  This white flour came from the Six Countries, where the prices of white flour per 20 stone sack in 26/6.  We have since heard of a case of this Northern Ireland flour being sold in Dublin at 8d. per lb.  That makes 180/8 per 20 stone sack, or about seven times the original purchase price of the flour.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That appeared over the name of a well-known baker who lives in the City of Dublin, and I am pretty certain that the paper containing that allegation has found its way into the Department of Supplies.  No action has been taken on that according to the information given by the Minister for Supplies to Deputy Norton in the Dáil this evening. Flour can be bought at 26/6 per 20 stone sack, be smuggled over the Border and sold again on the streets of Dublin at 7d. and 8d. per lb. without the knowledge, officially at any rate, of the Minister for Supplies, and apparently without the knowledge, and without any action being taken, of the officials of that Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Glaring examples have been given of the excessive prices charged for tea. Some of these cases have been brought to the notice of the Minister for Supplies by way of question in the Dáil. I drew the attention of the Minister to an advertisement about tea which <Col N="373" /> appeared in a paper some time ago. Tea was being publicly advertised for sale at 6/- per lb.  The Minister&rsquo;s attention was drawn to that case by way of parliamentary question on 23rd April last.  The reference will be found in column 1609 of the Dáil Debates.  No action was taken by the Minister.  I could go on to give a number of similar cases of glaring profiteering and racketeering. While the workers of Dublin and of the country have to pay these excessive prices, and, according to what we heard from the Minister to-day, will have to continue to pay them, their wages are to be kept at the figure in operation on the 7th instant.  I could understand, if I could not explain it, if the Minister for Finance had related the Emergency Powers Order he has made to an Emergency Powers Order stabilising prices at a reasonable figure, so as to bring prices back to the pre-emergency figure.  The farmers are being brought before the courts of the country, where their cases get full publicity in the local newspapers, for failing to till a certain amount of their land.  They are being fined for not doing so, and are threatened with the confiscation of their lands while the people who are charging those excessive prices are able to get away with them.  I am sure it will be great satisfaction to them to know, from what we heard here this evening, that they can still carry on the same old game.</P>
    <P>This Emergency Powers Order came into operation on Wednesday last. What I cannot understand about it is why it should have been embodied in the Minister&rsquo;s Budget speech.  Deputies did not get copies of the order in the same way as they got orders of the kind on previous occasions.  I received my copy of it on Saturday morning.  I understand it was slipped into the Library by somebody on Wednesday evening.  As a matter of fact, I did not know the contents of the order until about 7.30 on Thursday evening.  I and my colleagues were amazed when we read the contents of the order, and so, I am sure, was every decent Deputy who does not believe in this kind of policy, or in the operations of the profiteers.</P>
    <P>There is the case of wages board <Col N="374" /> that is operating with the sanction of the Minister for Industry and Commerce. It is hearing an application for increased rates of wages from a considerable number of railwaymen. The board sat on Tuesday and Wednesday last considering the application. Up to the present no decision has been given.  That is the usual procedure. If and when a decision is given in this particular case, and there are good grounds for believing that a favourable decision will be given and that the award would operate as from 26th November of last year, may I ask the Minister whether the workers concerned will be deprived of the benefits of the award as a result of the coming into operation of this Emergency Powers Order?  This is one of the many cases which I think are bound to arise, and which apparently were not foreseen by the Minister or by the Government or by the advisers of the Government who were responsible for the drafting of this revolutionary order.</P>
    <P>Another body of railwaymen whose case should have been heard before the Railway Wages Board two months ago had their case postponed, awaiting the result of an award in a case that was heard previously.  The railwaymen concerned, or some of them, live in the Minister&rsquo;s constituency, and at the present time are paid a rate of wages as low as £2s. 9d. per week.  Will the Minister get up here in this House, as a representative of an area in the City of Dublin where railway workers are paid at the rate of £2s. 9d. per week, and justify the application of the Emergency Powers Order to those railwaymen in his own constituency?  I could understand, even if I could not explain, the application of an order of this kind to workers or wage-earners with a salary or wage above a certain fixed figure, which should be a fairly reasonable figure, but is there any Deputy in this House who will stand up and say that the wages of workers in the City of Dublin, with the cost of living as we know it in the City of Dublin, should be stabilised at £2 2s. 9d. per week?  Is there any Deputy on the Fianna Fáil Benches who will stand up and say he is defending <Col N="375" /> that?  If not, they should go and have a serious talk with the Minister for Finance and the other members of the Government, and ask them what in the name of God they mean by applying an order of this kind to workers of this type.  In the town of Dun Laoghaire, where I live, the wages of the railway workers are to be stabilised at the figure of £2 0s. 9d. per week, and that is a place where the cost of living is even higher than it is in the City of Dublin.  Does anybody think that the organised workers of this country are going to stand for that?  Does anybody think they are going to stand for it because it is put up by the members of the Fianna Fáil Government, and related, and wrongly related, to the collection of an excess profits tax?</P>
    <P>I could go on and refer to many other cases of lowly-paid workers in this city and throughout the country to whom this revolutionary Emergency Powers Order will be applied.  We are asked here to give helpful and constructive criticism of the Government, and advice and assistance where they can be given.  The Minister for Finance will not deny, nor will the Head of the Government deny, that they have got every assistance and advice so far as we were capable of giving them good advice since the emergency arose in this country.  Does anybody think, for instance, that the Defence Forces of this country would be as good as they are to-day, or that you would have the numbers you have to-day in the Local Defence Force and the Defence Forces generally, were it not for the willing co-operation and assistance given to the Government by all Parties in this House since the emergency arose?  I suspect, and my suspicions are based upon information which I have received during the past few days, that there will be trouble brewing for the Government if they pursue the policy contained in this Emergency Powers Order.  That is not being delivered to the Government as a threat.  If they cannot see the sense of that, or if their advisers are not prepared to tell them that, there will be a day of <Col N="376" /> reckoning, and they will admit it later on.</P>
    <P>I read the speeches of a number of members of the Government delivered in the country quite recently, amongst them being the latest speech delivered by the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs during the week-end.  The Minister for Supplies, at a hand-picked meeting in the Catholic Commercial Club quite recently, talked about the codology of the Labour Party.  I presume he is referring to the comments and the criticism by many of our supporters during the recent annual conference of the Party which was held in the Mansion House.  The Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, who very seldom gives us the pleasure of listening to him in this House, criticised us at a meeting of his Party&rsquo;s supporters in Waterford during the week-end.  I do not think I am doing him any injustice by quoting the report of the speech, or portion of it, given in the daily papers.  He says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;People who, like the Labour Party, criticised the Wages Standstill Order, misrepresented the whole Budget and the whole Government policy.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I hope I am not misrepresenting the meaning of the Emergency Powers Order.  The only conclusion I can come to is that the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs does not himself understand the implications of it.  Then he goes on to make a remarkable statement, which, personally, I am very glad to hear from him if he will get a free hand in the matter.  Dealing with wages, he said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;While having an open mind on the matter, I have always regarded attacks on salaries and allowances as due either to real misunderstanding or a thoroughly dishonest attack upon Parliamentary institutions and the dignity of public representation.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is very hard to follow the meaning of that, but if it means anything I take it that his views do not entirely fit in with the powers contained in the Emergency Powers Order.  The Minister <Col N="377" /> for Supplies thinks we talk codology. The Minister for Supplies can go to the Head of the Government and find out the extent to which that &ldquo;codology&rdquo; has been pursued in other directions&mdash;other directions where helpful assistance has been recognised, and recognised as being given without any grudge.  On the last occasion when I was speaking here I was endeavouring to persuade the Minister for Supplies that something should be done to organise the workers of the country who will have to produce turf for the community during the present critical period, and particularly during the next three or four months.  I suggested that the failure of the Government to set up a central directing department to supervise the activities of those who were employed on turf production&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The figures given to me by the Minister for Local Government here in the House this evening prove that that is correct, so far as certain areas in my own constituency are concerned.  I have been given figures by the Minister for Industry and Commerce here this evening which show that only 71 out of 143 persons who were registered at a certain labour exchange in my constituency are engaged in turf-producing operations, while at the same time the Taoiseach and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance have been making speeches throughout the country stating that they cannot get enough men to carry on turf-producing operations.

I am pointing out to the Minister for Finance, who is responsible for finding the money for this necessary national work, that all the available unemployed are not being employed on this work in areas within my constituency, and that is a big turf-cutting area.

      <P>The Minister for Finance has paid the expenses connected with the work of the Transport Tribunal, and the cost of a service of that kind is included in the figures upon which we are asked to vote.  I presume that all the expenses of the Transport Tribunal have been paid.  I submit that the Head of the Government cannot expect helpful criticism from the Opposition unless Deputies are given the material which is contained in the reports of tribunals of the kind to which I have referred.  The Minister <Col N="381" /> for Finance, or his Parliamentary Secretary, was responsible for the setting up of the Drainage Commission, which sent in its report as far back as October last.  Will the Minister justify the refusal of his Department to furnish Deputies with the information contained in the report of that commission, if it is his wish that helpful criticism should be put forward?</P>
      <P>There were several instances in recent times where Opposition Deputies asked for information concerning exports and imports and the Minister for Industry and Commerce repeatedly stated that it would not be in the public interest to give the information sought.  I wonder does he know that some of the figures asked for are contained in printed documents issued by local authorities, such as harbour commissioners and port and docks boards? I heard the Minister for Industry and Commerce stating it would not be in the public interest to give certain figures to Deputy Mulcahy, and I am aware that those figures are contained in the audited accounts of the Dublin Port and Docks Board.  Still the Minister tells us it is not in the public interest to disclose the figures.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister for Finance practically asked for our sympathy in the heavy task that confronts any Minister for Finance at the present moment, and I shall be as restrained as possible in dealing with his Budget statement.  I fully understand the difficulties in which Ministers for Finance finds themselves at the present moment.  Deputy Davin spoke of a day of reckoning for the Tánaiste.  I gather that Tánaistí or Deputy Leaders find the present time a rather difficult and puzzling one for them, whether in Moscow, Berlin or Dublin.  I wonder, if Deputy Davin&rsquo;s prophecy comes true, will the Tánaiste use his position to charter or seize an aeroplane and fly to the Fiji Islands or some other place in order to get out of the difficulties?  However, the precedent is there: two men in a similar position have already gone.  I wonder is the Tánaiste to be the proverbial third?  He, like men of a more exalted profession, finds that when budgetary calculating is to be done, the Minister&rsquo;s life is not a happy one, and he asks us <Col N="383" /> for our sympathy and points out, quite reasonably, that there is an enormous sum of money involved in this Budget.</P>
      <P>Now, I shall refrain from anything in the nature of harsh criticism of the Government, but I would put it to the Minister and his colleagues as a question to be answered-at least answered to themselves and seriously considered-does the Minister, and those of his colleagues who take a really serious interest in the task of Government, feel satisfied that value is being got for this immense sum of money he is now demanding from the country?  The strange thing is that we hear a great deal about the increase of expenditure and the increase of taxation, but I put it to the House and the Government that the other question which I am now raising is not asked often enough and, if asked, is rarely attended to: what is the value we are getting for the money that is now asked for by the Minister for Finance?  Is the Minister satisfied?  I take it, from his Budget speech, that he does realise the serious financial situation in which the country finds itself and that he does foresee the possibility or shall I say, the likelihood, even if we stay out of the war, of much more strenuous times in the future and much more difficult problems to be faced?  Let him look over his Government Departments, let him look over the various headings under which this immense sum of money is being spent, and ask himself if even at the present moment value is being given.  I cannot understand how any Minister, putting himself that question, and being honest with himself, can say that value is being given.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all share the Minister&rsquo;s hope that we may escape from being involved in this war, but even if we are not involved, the problems that will have to be faced by him and by any Government that is entrusted with the destinies of this country, both during the remaining years of the war and after the cessation of the war, are bound to be extremely difficult, and the fact that they will be difficult ought to be sufficiently clear to the Ministers to make them realise that however <Col N="384" /> much we may share all the pious opinions&mdash;and we share them to the full-expressed by the Minister in his Budget statement, in addition to faith of that kind a few good works might be useful also.</P>
    <P>Before I develop that matter further, perhaps I might be allowed to ask one or two questions of the Minister, with a view to his elucidating them or making the position clear. I do not know if he is aware of the fact that since his Budget statement, not merely a great deal of anxiety, but a great deal of confusion has prevailed in certain circles in the country&mdash;those who are interested in manufacture on the one hand and merchants on the other hand.  I refer to the lack of clarity about the Minister&rsquo;s statement on the excess profits tax and the corporation profits tax.  I do not think the public knows where it stands in that particular matter, and I trust that the Minister will take the opportunity in his closing speech to make the position clear.  I know a number of people engaged in manufacture who have been struggling hard for the last couple of years and who are very uneasy.  I do not suggest that this was deliberately done, but at least the wording of that able document which we had read to us by the Minister, does create, on page 24 of the typed copy that was supplied to us, the suggestion-it is nothing more than a suggestion, but the suggestion is enough-that the main portion of the revenue would come from excess profits that were gained during the war.  Now, I admit that if you parse the words carefully, that is not said, but that was the way the matter was first received by the House, I think, and certainly by many people outside the House, until it was seen that there was a snag.  For there are to be modifications in the general corporation tax, and many manufacturers and merchants are very uneasy as to how that will hit their business.  Take the case of people who have just been able to carry on.  How is the modification of the corporation tax as distinct from the excess profits tax going to hit them?  The House will have noticed that in connection with an estimate of the total yield in reference <Col N="385" /> to-I think I am correct in saying&mdash; these two sources of revenue, no segregation was made as to the sums that were expected from each branch, from the modification of the existing corporation tax on the one hand and from the profits that were got as a result of the war on the other hand.</P>
    <P>In fairness to those engaged in industry the thing ought to be made clear as soon as possible.  Even accountants in the City of Dublin do not know exactly where their clients stand at the present moment.  Let us take it that as a result of the war and as a result of the advice given by the Minister&rsquo;s colleagues, a merchant got in and stored an amount of tea, or some other commodity, and that as a result of various alarmist rumours there was a run on that particular merchant. That has happened, as the Minister knows, in the case of various articles. That would mean, of course, an abnormal profit shown over a short period which will be more than counterbalanced, or at least counterbalanced, by a lean period to come.  What are the Minister&rsquo;s intentions so far as profits of that kind are concerned?  I mention the corporation tax and the excess profits tax because a number of people have spoken to me on the matter and have complained of the ambiguity, the confused way in which the matter has been left by the Minister, and the confusion of mind that has eventually followed.  The main question, however, which I would put to the Minister is: granting that we are faced with a crisis, is there any evidence, or, shall I put it a little more mildly, is there evidence enough, to satisfy the Minister that everything is being done that ought to be done, both by the people and by the Government? If there is a crisis, a crisis which can daily become more difficult, have we any indication, apart from speeches, that the Government, by its action, shows itself sufficiently alive to the seriousness of that crisis, or that the country shows itself alive to the seriousness of the present situation, to say nothing of the more serious situation which may come upon us?</P>
    <P>I do not want to say anything that could damage the prestige of any <Col N="386" /> Government responsible for the carrying on of the affairs of this country, but I would urge upon the Government with any seriousness I can command that they themselves, by their policy or by their actions, should do nothing to undermine their own prestige or the prestige of any Government responsible for carrying on this country&rsquo;s affairs, because, in the long run, it is the country that will suffer from loss of prestige by the rulers. Nobody can say that what is happening at present is a test of Parliamentary institutions.  It is not, because at no time in the history of this State has the Government been more in control than this Government has been since the start of the war.  It has escaped, as a result of the crisis, a great deal of the ordinary criticism which would come from different parts of this House.  In fact, the Government has practically complete control unhampered by criticism.  If anything will have been tested and found wanting, it will not be Parliamentary institutions but something approaching the opposite, that is, too much uncontrolled power in the hands of the Government and possibly not enough criticism to urge them on to a performance of the tasks before them as leaders of the nation.</P>
    <P>Would it be too much, would it be an exaggeration, if I said that most problems are not seriously faced and that, in the general uncertainty that prevails&mdash;and I have a certain amount of personal sympathy in this regard&mdash; the Government thinks it has done sufficiently well if, in the different spheres of Governmental activity, it gets over the difficulty of the day? Have we any evidence of a longer view?  I think there was a hint in the financial statement itself practically deprecating anything like a possibility of a longer view.  I am not indulging in any harsh or unfair criticism, but I put it to the Minister, as one who is interested in the future of the country, that something longer than a mere day-to-day view is necessary. Getting over the immediate difficulty and carrying on is not enough.  It is not enough at any period, but the Minister must realise, <Col N="387" /> and I am sure he does, that it is certainly not enough at present.  In other words, is the Minister convinced that the Government has a real grip of the situation in the various Departments where the Government is active or should be active?</P>
    <P>There is a demand for increased tillage. That demand is voiced again and again by the Head of the Government and by different Ministers.  But surely speeches, however well meant, are in this respect merely propaganda.  It is useful propaganda, but propaganda by itself will not make the crops grow, and when the Minister in his Budget statement says there is a shortage of manures and various other facilities which the farmers need to carry on the campaign of tillage, would he not ask himself how that came about?  Does he realise that, however useful such slogans as &ldquo;Grow More Wheat&rdquo; and &ldquo;Plough More Land&rdquo; may be, they are not enough, and if the Government asks, as it quite rightly asks, the co-operation of the farmers and everybody else, I put it that the Government itself should spare no effort to give as much co-operation as possible, on the one hand, and, on the other, to convince the public that they are doing so.  I think he would be an optimistic supporter of the Government who could honestly say at present that the people believe that the Government is doing all it can.  While it is their duty to put the national house in order, to get it as economically and productively managed as possible, a heavier duty lies on the members of the Government to do their share.  The Government has its Departments, and nobody can pretend, judging by the increased expenditure in those Departments of recent years, that they are undermanned. Are they led by their Ministers?</P>
    <P>The Minister said that, as a result of the war, the supplies we had laid in at the beginning of the war have become exhausted.  Is he serious in suggesting that, in the 12 months prior to the war, or during the months which followed its outbreak, when stringency was not so obvious, supplies had been laid in to anything like the extent <Col N="388" /> desirable and necessary?  I am speaking from memory when I say that, in an early debate here after the outbreak of war, I gathered from the Minister for Supplies that, though a separate department of the Department of Industry and Commerce had been set up 12 months prior to the war, and a new Department was set up immediately the war started, and there was a clear vision as to the possibility of a shortage of wheat here, the total extra supply he had got in &mdash; the reserve, he called it &mdash; was about 60,000 tons, that is, one-tenth of our ordinary consumption.  Our supplies, or reserves, were quickly exhausted because they were not there, or were there in very small quantities, in quantities that would be laughable in a less serious situation.  I do not stress that-that is of the past.  What I am much more concerned about is that the same drift, the same lack of grip, the same failure to grasp the problem in all its seriousness is still operating; that notwithstanding a certain amount of criticism&mdash;restrained undoubtedly&mdash; which has been offered since the war started, we are unfortunately able to see very little improvement in this respect.</P>
    <P>There was a question raised by Deputy Davin.  I do not intend to go into the detail with which Deputy Davin treated it.  I gathered from a previous Budget statement and from this that the Government had taken up a certain policy; that they had set their face against allowing an increase in wages for this particular reason, that an increase in wages meant an increase in prices, which would demand a further increase in wages, and that in turn would mean a further increase in prices.  Thus you got a completely vicious circle.  I think that is more or less the Government&rsquo;s conception. I put it to the Minister for Finance that that has two sides.  The whole argument, so far as it is sound, stands on two legs, so to speak, and, so far as we can judge, the Government at the present moment are standing on only one of them.  In other words, the circle can be travelled in either direction; the two things must hang together.  If the Government are <Col N="389" /> serious and fair, if there is to be no increase in wages, there must really be an effort made to prevent an increase in prices.  You cannot take up the line that you shall not allow an increase in wages because that means an increase in prices unless you are prepared to face the other side of the picture and say: &ldquo;We cannot allow an increase in prices because that will inevitably bring with it an increase in wages.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I wonder whether there is anyone in the country, be he a supporter of the Government or not, who is convinced that a really serious effort is being made to deal with the rise in prices. As a place to live in, the country is becoming more expensive every day. Without at all wishing for the day of reckoning that is soon to come, that Deputy Davin referred to, I think a one-sided policy of that kind is an invitation to trouble.  I put it to the Minister that at the present moment he and his colleagues should take every step to see that that is prevented. The Minister admits that this is a tremendous Budget.  I doubt if the increasing Budgets we have had here for the last eight or nine years were a proper or useful preparation for our being in a position to meet the policy of stringency that is now coming for the Ministry and for the country.  I do not wish to dwell unduly on this.  The Government may say, quite rightly, that in 1935 they could not have foreseen war.  In 1937 it was somewhat more likely.  Still there was no hint of any effort being made to face that particular situation.</P>
    <P>We see the public services increasing and expenditure on those services growing more and more swollen every day.  With the best will in the world, I certainly am not able to convince myself that we are getting value for the money spent.  I attach a great deal more importance to our getting value for the money spent than I do to the amount of the money spent. That is an aspect of the whole business which I should like to impress on the Ministry&mdash;get value; get all the Ministers to put themselves really at the head of their Departments and to cooperate with the people.  When, in <Col N="390" /> practice, the people are under the impression that the Government are doing very little to help, it is difficult to expect as generous a response as we should like from the people.  Co-operation means, not one section working, but two sections working&mdash;both the Government and the people.</P>
    <P>Great as are the sacrifices involved in this Budget, and great as may be the sacrifices that we may yet have to face, I am quite sure that the people would respond more readily and in a better spirit if they were really convinced that the Government were giving a lead in the situation and doing their share of the work.  I shall not ask the Minister to bear in mind that he will have to look beyond this year even in framing this year&rsquo;s Budget.  I am convinced that the Government adopt a policy of a kind of economic <i>carpe diem</i>&mdash;live for the day; let us be satisfied if we can stave off trouble for the day; let the morrow bring its own problems and we will face them in the same spirit.</P>
    <P>There may be something to be said about the impossibility of trying to forecast the future, and I have a certain amount of sympathy with the Government in that respect.  But one thing that will certainly land us in a difficulty is lack of policy, lack of grip on the situation.  It is that drift that fills me with considerable apprehension-apprehension of what the future may have in store for any Government and for this country.  I cannot see on the part of the Government any evidence, and I think the Minister for Finance dropped a hint or two in his statement that he cannot see any evidence in the lives of the people at the present moment, that there is any real understanding of the present situation that faces the country and the much more serious one that must face it, even if we escape the war.  On the contrary, I find everybody in this respect following the example of the Government, refusing to think of the morrow, refusing to face even the probable developments.</P>
    <P>I find on the part of a great many people&mdash;I find it on the part of the Government&mdash;a considerable amount of self-satisfaction, an incapacity on our <Col N="391" /> part to be aware of our own shortcomings, and even of our own difficulties. That is really what fills me with, as I say, a considerable amount of apprehension, and even of alarm, when I think of what this country may have to face.  The Minister used the phrase &ldquo;Ponder longer and seriously.&rdquo; I wish that the amount of earnest thought that he and some of his colleagues have apparently given to all these matters could show itself a little more obviously in their policy and in their action.  I shall, therefore, end as I began by almost beseeching the Government&mdash;because remember it is not the fate of the Government, it is not the fate of the Opposition, it is not even the fate of Parliamentary institutions here that are at stake but it is the fate of the country&mdash;really to do their part in the job that is before this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a war Budget. The Minister, when introducing it, told the House that it was mainly because of the situation in which we find ourselves that he had to ask the House to vote such a huge sum of money.  In other words, the Minister put it, it is in order to preserve our neutrality that we have to spend this large sum of money.  We have this war Budget without the accompanying advantages which other countries have of an increased national income.  We are in an altogether different position from that of the neighbouring country which is raising not millions, but billions of money at the present moment.  In doing so, it is inflicting very heavy taxation on its people.  We here are inflicting a tremendous amount of taxation on our people without any accompanying increase in our national income.  It may be said that, possibly, the incomes of the people generally&mdash; certainly of those engaged in agriculture, and no doubt the same applies to industry&mdash;have declined.  Deputies will readily exempt the Minister for Finance from criticism for any part of his Budget expenditure which is for defence purposes.  But if we eliminate every single penny that is to be raised for our Defence Forces and for <Col N="392" /> defence equipment, there still remains a sum of money that is altogether too high for a small country like this.</P>
      <P>We have been presented with a Budget for £41,000,000 or £42,000,000. Judging by the experience of past years, we are almost certain to have presented to us during the coming year, two or three, or even more, Supplementary Estimates which will still further increase this very big demand. A Budget of £41,000,000 or £42,000,000 for a country of our size is really more than our people are able to bear.  It represents a tax of over £52 a year on the average family consisting of three or four people.  Some time ago a very eminent financial and agricultural expert, a professor in Cork, in the course of a paper which he prepared on the profits and losses of agriculture, estimated that the average national income of our agriculturists is something below £50 a year, so that, in effect, we are taxing the average family a sum per year which is more than the average agriculturist makes out of his farm.  In the last ten years we have had two Ministers for Finance.  When the present Minister&rsquo;s predecessor relinquished the office, we all had expected that there might be a change in policy, and something tantamount to a reduction in expenditure in the succeeding years.</P>
      <P>The older members of the House will remember the famous occasion when the father of the present English Prime Minister resigned his office as Chancellor of the Exchequer.  His resignation was, I think, due to pique.  I do not say that our former Minister for Finance resigned in pique, but following Lord Randolph Churchill&rsquo;s resignation there was a famous cartoon in one of the national newspapers published in this country at the time.  It depicted the incoming Chancellor, Mr. Goschen, in the coat of his predecessor.  The coat was a bit too big for him.  I think our own Minister for Finance is a little less corpulent than his predecessor.  At any rate, the underline in this cartoon was:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It is a little loose on him, but it will fit beautifully when we take it in a bit.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="393" /> When we had a change of Ministers for Finance some of us had expected that something similar would have happened here: that it would have had the happy results for our people that the substitution of Mr. Goschen for Lord Randolph Churchill had for the people of England.  Mr. Goschen turned out to be a very famous Chancellor and produced effects that most of the people of this country would have desired.  Unfortunately, the substitution of one Minister for Finance by another did not produce the same happy results here.</P>
    <P>Our present Minister for Finance is a very genial man, but since he took office there has been no sign of a reduction in our ever increasing bill of taxation.  Taxation has been mounting during the last ten years.  Even, as I have said, if we were to eliminate expenditure for defence purposes, the bill is still far too big.  We are presented year after year with a mounting bill of expenditure while there is no increase in the general prosperity of the country.  If our unfortunate unemployed were being assimilated in schemes of useful work there might be something to be said for this high expenditure. Even in the case of our main industry, and we have only the one, there is not the prosperity in it that Ministers or the Government would desire.</P>
    <P>There certainly has not been that absorption of the unemployed in useful work which we were promised years ago, and repeatedly promised since.  If one forgets a few sheltered industries, or the proprietors of a few sheltered industries, I cannot see anywhere evidence of increased incomes in any other industry.  One of the most striking features in this Budget as it appears to me, with the figure increasing from £22,000,000, which it was at one period, to about double that figure now, is the paucity of the amount which is directly spent on agriculture.  In this agricultural country, where we have had to raise additional taxation year after year, one would have expected that much of it would have been shown in the Estimates as being devoted to the advantage of agriculture, to <Col N="394" /> increasing the production of agriculture, and relieving the lot of the people engaged on agriculture, and that eventually the results of that expenditure would be plainly seen.  But we have no such evidence. Over a period of eight or ten years, everything points to the contrary. We might have been in a better position to bear this burden if the policy of the Government had been different during the last ten years, but for some of the time at least what happened was that the savings of agriculture, if there were any such thing, or certainly the reserves of agriculture, were depleted, with the result that we meet a crisis, such as the present one, with the people engaged in the main industry of the country impoverished, and in no manner capable of bearing their share of the burden, which, as I said, amounts to practically £50 a year for every family in this country.</P>
    <P>There are one or two principal points in this Budget with which I should like to deal.  The one which I should like to mention particularly is the tax on tobacco.  In view of the present position in the country, with a not too prosperous agriculture, with a great deal of unemployment, and a good deal of discomfort generally, I do not think that a tax of 4d. on 11d. worth of tobacco should have been imposed.  I might say that tobacco is the last luxury left to many poor persons in this country.  While those who smoke the more expensive type of tobacco might possibly be able to bear such a burden, it is especially hard on the people who smoke the commoner brands.  I think the money might have been found by substituting some other tax.  For instance, I do not know why the Minister did not think of taxing bicycles.  There might possibly be criticism of such a tax, but it would have affected a different set of people. It would not have affected the old age pensioner, or the very hard-working man who has very little time to spend on bicycle riding, and it would have produced a good amount of money. There is a very large number of bicycles in this country, and a fair tax on any bicycle would not have pressed very hardly on anybody.</P>

      <P>Somebody said that the Government themselves ought to set a headline, and that Deputies ought to set a headline to the country by reducing their own stipend.  It was suggested here by two or three speakers that the salaries of Deputies should be reduced.  I deprecate the use of the word &ldquo;salaries&rdquo;.  If the people of this country thought fit to elect Deputies to carry out certain work for them, and if the House thought fit that allowances should be made to those Deputies to fit them to undertake that work, and to pay their ordinary expenses in doing that work, I say that that is right and proper.  I say that that allowance can be justified, and should not be treated as a salary, because it is not a salary for most of us, and I do not believe it is a salary for anybody.  When the allowance was increased, I was one of the Deputies who voted against it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>I voted against it, because at the time when it was introduced we were in a bad financial condition. We are in a worse position now.  Mind you, I do not believe it would be a bad idea to make such a gesture to the people generally.  I do not say it would amount to anything. It would be such a small thing in our financial expenditure that it really is not worth talking about, but we might make a gesture and reduce the allowance. I am not saying whether it is proper or not, and I would not have alluded to it at all were it not for the fact that I deprecate the use of the word &ldquo;salaries&rdquo; in regard to Deputies&rsquo; allowances.  If the gesture is worth making, then I believe most of the Deputies are prepared to make it.  A reduction might be made in the allowances, as a gesture to the people generally, if they want such a gesture, but I do believe that the people of the <Col N="397" /> country are intelligent enough to realise that if such a reduction were made it would not make one whit of difference to the financial position of the country.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is not such a fool as he pretends to be, or as a celebrated leader in a certain country pretends that an under-strapper of his who flew away from that country is.  One could talk on this Budget for 20 hours, going through item after item, and yet find little satisfaction.  I do not propose to do that.  It would have no effect. Probably I would be ruled out of order, and rightly so, if I directed my speech to the policy of each Department.  We will have lots of opportunities for doing that.  I will probably take advantage of some of them later on.  I wish to emphasise that £42,000,000&mdash;and it will not stop at that&mdash;represents too great a burden for this country.  An annual charge of £1 a week, or £52 a year, on every family in this country, is a charge that cannot be borne, and there must be an attempt made to reduce expenditure or else increase the national income by the expenditure of money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Sullivan asked the Minister if he had given any thought to the future.  I daresay the Minister has. Many Deputies have done so.  I am rather terrified when I think of what the future of this country is likely to be, following the termination of this war.  It does not require much intelligence to foresee what the purchasing power of a neighbouring country will be, following upon its enormous expenditure in this war.  What are the prospects in relation to the prices of agricultural products, and what will be <Col N="398" /> the general economic condition of this country after this almost universal war has terminated?  They will not be good and we shall have to make preparations for that period.  One would have thought that those preparations would have been begun by now.</P>
    <P>I do not consider that any useful purpose will be served by a systematic criticism of the Budget.  Even if we reduce the amount that necessarily had to be spent on the defence of this country in order to preserve its neutrality, there still remains to be imposed upon the people an amount of taxation altogether beyond their resources.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>With the exception of the amount required for the upkeep of the Army this year, I think we could say that this is a comparatively normal Budget.  That is as far as expenditure is concerned.  No cognisance seems to have been taken by the Minister for Finance of the economic position in the country.  Up to a couple of years ago the Government always gave expression to their deep concern for the unemployed.  I think it will be admitted that within the last two or three years, certainly since the war started, the position of the unemployed has worsened.  Notwithstanding that, there is no apparent notice being taken of the position of the unemployed.  We cannot find anything in the Budget proposing to deal with the economic situation.  No regard at all is paid to the problems which confront the country from the economic point of view. Day after day and week after week more people are becoming unemployed in consequence of the shortage of supplies. In years gone by the Government appeared to place the unemployment problem in the forefront of their programme, but this year, above all years, when it is absolutely necessary that something definite should be done for the unemployed, no attempt has been made, at least through the medium of the Budget, to deal with our economic problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The wages policy of the Government, enunciated by the Minister in his Supplementary Budget speech in, I think, September, 1939, is now emphasised. <Col N="399" /> Strong action is to be taken by the Government in the case of the workers who have taken any action which would enable them to keep pace, at least to some little extent, with the increased cost of living.  Wage-earners are tied hand and foot.  All the rights won through years of agitation and sacrifice under an alien Government are now being taken away by members of an Irish Government who have, from time to time, classed themselves as the workingman&rsquo;s Government.  I cannot understand why the Government have taken this action.  Since the beginning of the war they have been asked to do something to control the cost of living, but nothing has been done to prevent food prices from soaring to such an extent that it is absolutely impossible for a workingman to live to-day.  The only thing that has been controlled in this country is the pay of the worker.  The only thing that is going to be controlled is any action that workers may take in an effort to ensure that they will get wages commensurate with the cost of living.</P>
    <P>It is all very well for Ministers to say that action is being taken and that certain regulations have been made to control the cost of certain foods.  We know that it is absolutely necessary for an individual, if he or she thinks there is overcharging, to make a complaint to the Government in order to have something done, but we also know there are unfortunate people who have to procure goods on credit from the shopkeepers and they will hesitate before they complain, although they know they are being overcharged. Ministers have been asked from time to time to permit local food control committees to be appointed under the auspices of different local authorities, and although the Minister for Supplies told us he was giving serious consideration to that matter, nothing has been done.  It is almost 12 months since he promised me that he was favourably considering the suggestion about having local committees formed. If something like that were done, it would enable local representatives to prevent profiteers from fattening on the profits that they have been making <Col N="400" /> since the war started.  Anybody who goes into a provincial town or city cannot but observe the variations in the prices of different commodities, and it is apparent to everybody that there is profiteering.  Everybody, except the Minister concerned, seems to be aware of this.  Up to this the only thing they have controlled is the price of men&rsquo;s labour.</P>
    <P>In many towns in Ireland movements were in operation recently in order to secure that a standard wage would be established in various industries. We have the position in some counties in Ireland where in one town a tradesman is paid one rate of wages while in a neighbouring town for the same class of work a different rate of wages is being paid.  That ensures that certain profits will be taken by the employers in the town in which the lower rate is paid, and it is now a crime in this country for the workers in the particular town I mention to secure a higher rate of wages.</P>
    <P>This is no time for using loose language or loose words, but I am greatly afraid that this is going to lead to a serious eruption in this country. I have heard murmurings over the week-end amongst the workers, and action of some kind will be taken. The workers will not take this action of the Government lying down.  We would not get any more dictatorship from Germany or Italy than in included in this order promulgated by the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  As I said before, one would never have expected this from a Government, which has always held itself up as being a workingman&rsquo;s Government, and I am certainly surprised that some of the members of the Fianna Fáil Party, whom I have known to be in the trade union movement for a number of years and who have been agitators in this country for a number of years on behalf of the various professions which they follow, should stand idly by and permit their Government to issue an order of this kind.</P>
    <P>Now, to come back to the Budget problem, there is one particular tax that the Minister has increased, and that is the tobacco tax.  The Minister <Col N="401" /> has had to resort to borrowing in order to find some of the money which was necessary to be found, and it is a pity that he did not go a little further and borrow an amount of money equivalent to the amount which will be raised by the tobacco tax.  Let us take the position of a farm labourer or road worker in this country to-day.  His gross wages would be 30/&mdash;that is, including food, and I suppose the majority of farm labourers would only draw about 14/- a week.  His insurance would be about 1/6, and that leaves him 28/6 a week.  The average number of ounces smoked by a workingman in the country would be four ounces, and that means something equivalent to a reduction of 1/4 per week in his wages, because many a worker in this country would prefer tobacco to his breakfast in the morning.  That man is prevented by the order made by the Minister from seeking any increase in wages notwithstanding the fact that the Minister himself is imposing a reduction through the medium of this taxation of at least 1/4 a week.  As I said, it is a pity that he did not borrow an amount equivalent to that.</P>
    <P>Again, the Minister has agreed to make certain increases in unemploy ment insurance.  About two months ago this Party had a resolution down in the House asking that unemployment insurance should be increased. When that motion was moved we had the usual lecture from the Minister for Industry and Commerce, who told us that it was absolutely impossible to increase unemployment insurance and that the fund was not capable of bearing it.  I am perfectly satisfied that at that time the fund was capable of doing it, just as capable of doing it as it is now, and that the money is being now taken from the fund contributed to by the workers and employers of this country.  I am satisfied that the only reason the Government said it was impossible at that time was that they were not willing to permit the Labour Party to get any kudos from the passing of a resolution of that kind.</P>
    <P>The Minister is also about to issue vouchers&mdash;I am not exactly sure of the amount yet&mdash;to old age pensioners, recipients of widows&rsquo; and orphans&rsquo; pensions <Col N="402" /> and other people of that kind, but the issue of these vouchers is to be confined to cities and urban areas.  I cannot see any justification at all for the Minister confining the issue of these vouchers to cities and urban areas.  In this country to-day there are small towns which are not under either commissioners or urban authorities, and large villages where the inhabitants have been hit very badly by unemployment. I know one particular place in my constituency, the village of Castlebridge, and at the present moment, as any of my colleagues there can tell you, there are about 100 men out of work there.  In normal times these men would be still working. There are mills there that were capable of employing these men practically the whole year round, but during recent years these men have been only employed for three or four months in the year.  These people are in the same degree of need as people in cities or urban areas or areas administered by commissioners, and I cannot understand what justification the Minister has for drawing the line as between cities or urban areas and places of that kind.  I think he would be well advised to reconsider the position in relation to those people.</P>
    <P>The Minister, on, I think, page 45 of his statement, talks about county boards of health being in a position to assist recipients of home help, and he says that the State is prepared to place at the disposal of public health authorities the sum of £200.000. That sum is very little to deal with the situation with which this country is confronted at the present time.  Any of us who are on country health boards know the huge number of people who are at present in receipt of home help.  We know that in consequence of the Employment Period Order, which is being brought into operation this year earlier than in other years, the county boards of health have been very badly hit and will have very little money at their disposal to supplement the already too low and meagre allowances which home help recipients have been given.  I cannot understand how the Minister arrived at the sum of £200,000.  I hope <Col N="403" /> he does not expect local authorities to raise a larger sum during the financial year in order to supplement this, because I think it is the Government&rsquo;s duty in this abnormal period to provide all the money which is necessary in order to help the unemployed people over this emergency period.</P>
    <P>Referring again to the order issued by the Minister in connection with the question of wages, there is one particular clause in it which prevents an employer, when he is replacing an employee who has left his service, from giving to the man who replaces the man who has left any more wages than his former man had, but there is nothing at all in the order to prevent an employer from giving a lesser rate of wages than he had been giving formerly, and I am satisfied from my own experience that when any employee leaves a job some employers try to get the man replacing him to take a lesser rate of wages.  I suggest that that should have been taken into consideration.  I do not want the order in operation at all, but that just shows the mind of the Minister when he neglects to put in something to secure that when a man replaces another man he will not be given a lesser rate of wages than his predecessor had.</P>
    <P>The Budget certainly inflicts a huge load on the people of this country by way of taxation.  I must admit that the Minister was confronted with a formidable task when he had to set out to frame this Budget.  A large amount of the increase is due to the fact that at the present time we have to take certain steps to secure our defences, but apart from that the Budget is quite normal in so far as expenditure is concerned because, as I said at the beginning, no cognisance at all is being taken of the economic state of the country.  No reference is made to the unemployment question.  No reference is being made by the Government, through the medium of this Budget, to do anything at all to help the unemployed, about whom they professed to think so much when they were endeavouring to get into office in 1932 <Col N="404" /> and 1933.  The position, so far as the unemployed are concerned, is worse now than it has been for the past 20 years.  In spite of all their promises as to what they were going to do for the unemployed, practically their every action has made the condition of the unemployed worse.  Their condition to-day is one of despondency.  The condition of the working-class generally is one of despondency, and the action taken by the Government during the past week in the issuing of this order has been responsible for stirring up the working-class to such an extent that I hope nothing will happen in the near future to bring about in this country what none of us wants to see&mdash;a revolution.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestEdmondsonBenso" hpid="Mr. Benson Mr. Benson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Benson</NameTxt>
      <P>This Budget, on the whole, has received a mild reception, but, for myself, I am not sure that it is justified in receiving such a mild reception.  The most disturbing feature of the Minister&rsquo;s speech was his statement that he had been unable to reduce expenditure and that, therefore, he must bring income up to meet that expenditure.  Deputy Dillon has already referred to Mr. Micawber&rsquo;s philosophy of life, and if the Minister is not fully acquainted with Mr. Micawber&rsquo;s views on the subject, I suggest that he study, assimilate and follow them as rapidly as possible.</P>
      <P>There are two features of the Budget to which I should like to draw particular attention.  The first is the newspaper tax.  It may be that it is the Government&rsquo;s desire to reduce the circulation of newspapers, but I think that is certainly going to be the effect of this tax.  It may be that they desire to reduce the circulation of newspapers in order that the people of the country may not have so many opportunities of reading of their misdeeds, and, if that be so, there may be something to be said on their behalf. I think it is a very objectionable tax, however, and it is particularly hard in that even the ordinary little children&rsquo;s papers have to bear this impost which is now going to be increased still further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other item to which I take objection is the excess profits tax.  I think <Col N="405" /> it most undesirable that the Minister should now call for the re-opening in most cases of two years&rsquo; accounts which have been closed and the profits of which have been distributed.  In most cases, these profits have probably been distributed in the purchase of supplies&mdash;a very essential thing in these difficult times where it can be done&mdash;and now, under the terms of the Financial Resolution, the Minister asks firms which have disposed of these profits to re-open the whole matter and find a sum of money to pay over to him in discharge of this excess profits tax.  I have not the slightest doubt that, in many cases, it is going to be extremely difficult for firms to find the necessary money.</P>
    <P>I want to make it quite clear that my objection is to the corporation profits tax and not to the excess corporation profits tax.  If the Minister&rsquo;s views are correct, that persons have made an undue profit out of the present circumstances, I think he is fully justified in going back over the two years to secure the 50 per cent. he proposes to secure. I know of nobody who, in fact, has made these excess profits, but if he is correct, I think he is fully justified in his proposal.  With regard to the ordinary corporation profits tax, however, he has brought the figure down to a level of £1,000, which is going to affect very many quite small firms, and I think it an undue hardship on these firms, in these very difficult times, to expect them to go back over two years to make up the amount which the Minister proposes to take under this Financial Resolution.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AndrewFogarty" hpid="Mr. P.J. Fogarty Mr. P.J. Fogarty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Fogarty</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a few items in this Budget to which I want to draw the Minister&rsquo;s attention, the first being the imposition of this 2½ per cent. tax on race-course betting. Personally, I think there is no justification whatever for the imposition of this tax, and I strongly recommend the Minister to withdraw it.  In 1932, having heard this whole matter discussed, the then Minister for Finance decided to withdraw it, and I suggest that this Minister do the same, because it is imposing a tax on Irish racing which it can ill afford at present.  If the Minister <Col N="406" /> examines the money derived from betting at the end of the racing year in November, 1939, he will find that he received a grand total of roughly £241,000 or practically a quarter-million pounds.  If he compares that figure with his receipts in November, 1940, and up to the present, he will find a great reduction, due to the present state of racing.</P>
      <P>So far as I am aware, bookmakers are not, as a great number of people think, persons who drive around in large cars and smoke big cigars, but the Minister, in imposing this tax, perhaps had that in mind.  In face of war conditions, bookmakers have been endeavouring to carry on, to keep their offices open and their staffs employed, and to meet all their expenses with reduced racing.  Here in Ireland, the principal race meetings, Punchestown and Fairyhouse, have been abandoned, and, due to the prevalence of foot-and-mouth disease, there was no racing for several months; but during that period bookmakers endeavoured to keep their offices open and to keep their staffs employed.  I was reading recently the report of the commission of inquiry into the horse-breeding industry, which was set up in 1935.  One of the items in that report was: &ldquo;The commission is of opinion that racing is an essential to successful breeding,&rdquo; and I say that bookmaking is an essential to racing. If you have no bookmakers, you will have no attendances.  I wonder is the Minister aware of the contribution made by the bookmakers to race executives and racing generally for the improvement of the horse-breeding industry? Every bookmakers has to pay four times the entrance fee before he stands up.  That may be information to a number of people.  He has to pay a clerk, a runner, and all the other people attached to his business.  The Phoenix Park race people have stated that from 12 meetings in a year they received from bookmakers the sum of £2,000, and bookmakers contributed to race executives in one year the sum of £16,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. Everett Mr. Everett">

    <Col N="407" />
    <Speaker pid="AndrewFogarty" hpid="Mr. Fogarty Mr. Fogarty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fogarty</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that was a fair contribution to racing in Ireland, and, for the information of Deputy Everett, as a Labour man, it is estimated that, in the bookmaking business, there are at least 4,000 people employed.  It is also estimated that at least £500,000 is distributed to those employed.  I think the Minister would be well advised to consult the representatives of the bookmakers.  If he insists on extracting more money from bookmakers, he might find a more feasible way than by putting this tax on race-course betting. He will find great difficulty in collecting his estimated £30,000.  I doubt if he will collect it.  The revenue department have experience of endeavouring to collect this tax before.  They had to send out inspectors and employ other means of checking whether they were getting a true return or not.</P>
      <P>Apart from the race-courses, there are at least nine greyhound racing tracks in this country.  If the Minister met the representatives of the Bookmakers&rsquo; Association it might be possible to devise some other scheme by which the bookmakers could pay an extra sum in order to be allowed to carry on their business at the different meetings, and it would be better both for horse-racing and greyhound-racing. I seriously suggest to the Minister that he should give that matter consideration. In 1932, the Minister for Finance decided to do away with the 2½ per cent. tax on race-course betting after giving the matter full consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other matter to which I wish to draw attention is the tax on tobacco. Undoubtedly, an increase of 4d. per ounce will impose great hardship on working-class people, particularly those with small wages.  Deputy Corish said that some of them could only afford to buy four ounces.  I think they can only afford to buy a couple of ounces in the week.  I suggest to the Minister that he should reconsider this tax and find some other means of raising the necessary revenue.  A tax on cinemas, for instance, would cause less hardship. It would not be asking too much of people who want to see their favourite film star, whether it is Greta Garbo or <Col N="408" /> Gracic Fields, to pay an extra penny or twopence in taxation.</P>
    <P>There is another method of raising revenue which I am surprised the Minister has not thought about, and that is the taxation of golf clubs and other clubs.  On Christmas Day, Good Friday or St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day the ordinary workingman, who has been working hard all the week, if he has 8d. cannot get a pint.  But if he has a bag of golf sticks he could go to a golf club and drink all day.  These clubs are given facilities which publicans have not got.  The publican has got to pay a sum equal to half his valuation in licence duty.  A tax of £50 or £100 on the Kildare Street Club or some of the other clubs in the city, according to their returns, would be no hardship, and make it possible to reduce the proposed increase in the tobacco tax.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JeremiahHurley" hpid="Mr. Hurley Mr. Hurley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hurley</NameTxt>
      <P>This Budget and the Financial Resolutions on which the Minister&rsquo;s speech was based do not in any way take congnisance of or show any realisation of the position generally in the country.  I think it was Deputy Corish who said that this was a normal Budget.  But surely the times are abnormal, and in order to deal with an abnormal situation this Budget should have something abnormal in its makeup. I refer particularly to the lack of vision shown with regard to the unemployment problem.  Large numbers of people are unemployed and the total is continally growing.  That fact is very evident from the action taken by the Minister for Industry and Commerce in meeting the representatives of the employers and workers to discuss the position generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as I can see, the only remedy the Government have for the unemployment problem is the production of turf.  The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance, speaking last Thursday, as reported in column 2093 of the Official Reports, said: &ldquo;That would cover the unemployment problem better, as far as I can see, than we have had an opportunity of covering it in any recent year during the summer months.&rdquo;  The Parliamentary Secretary forgets that there are parts of the country where there is no turf <Col N="409" /> production because there are no bogs there.  For instance, the Rushbrooke area of County Cork, where the Parliamentary Secretary lives, is one of the most depressed areas in this country and probably in any country at the present time.  In places like Cobh and Passage West there is actual starvation at present and there is nothing in this Budget for dealing with that problem.</P>
    <P>There have been suggestions put up to the Minister as to how the problem could be dealt with.  In Rushbrooke there is a dockyard which is second only to Harland and Wolff&rsquo;s in Belfast for the docking of very large ships. It has been put up to the Minister by the people of Cobh that that dockyard should be utilised for the docking and repair of the ships which the Irish Shipping Company have purchased. That is a very feasible proposition and one that would give a certain amount of very necessary employment in that area.</P>
    <P>I am rather surprised that the Parliamentary Secretary did not think of the position in his own particular area, because turf production will not meet the unemployment problem in any way. As a matter of fact it is dealt with in too haphazard a fashion.  Everybody is told to go along and do the best he can.  There is no plan really with regard to the production of turf.  There is no fixed price for the output of the bogs.  The result is that you have various prices and probably a good deal of profiteering in connection with the production of turf this year. Deputy Davin has suggested that it should be possible to fix a price at the bog side or on the turf banks, and in that way you would probably be able to deal with the price of turf in the various centres.</P>
    <P>I want to say to the Minister that the Rushbrooke Docks are very suitable for large ships.  There is a good deal of machinery there and the expenditure necessary would be infinitesimal compared with the usefulness of the docks.</P>
    <P>The Budget provides a good deal of money for defence purposes, and I think no Deputy will question the provision of that money.  I say that it is <Col N="410" /> equally necessary, however, to defend the people from hunger, starvation and misery which is the lot of many thousands of them at present.  That is as necessary a side of the Minister&rsquo;s activities as providing money for the defence of the country against invasion by some outside enemy.  The enemy is amongst us already.  Thousands of people in this country are living on the verge of starvation.  Thousands of women and children are living below that line as can be shown by the returns made by the various county medical officers of health in regard to malnutrition amongst children.  The unemployment problem down in that harbour area is very acute.  The population of Cobh is about 7,000, and of Passage about 2,000.  You have, therefore, a big number of people concentrated in those two areas without any prospect of employment.  That is the position.  For a number of years, the only employment in Passage West was in the form of relief schemes. During the last war that area was a prosperous and thriving one because a good deal of work was given in Haulbowline, Rushbrooke and Passage itself. That prosperity could be restored in some measure if the suggestions which I am going to make to the Minister were taken to heart by him and acted upon.  I may say that one of the suggestions is not mine.  I have mentioned Rushbrooke docks.  There is also in that area an industry called Irish Steel which, at the moment, is in the hands of a receiver.  The place is closed down.  During the Elections of 1937 and 1938, that industry was capitalised politically very much by the Minister&rsquo;s Party.  We were told of the hundreds of men who would get employment in the Irish Steel Company. The anticipations may have been too ambitious.</P>
    <P>I am prepared to admit that the present war may have interfered with them in some way, but, at any rate, they have been upset a good deal.  In last week&rsquo;s issue of <i>The Standard</i> a special article appeared dealing with this industry.  Figures were given which the writer stated were compiled by an expert.  I do not know whether the Minister has seen the article or not, <Col N="411" /> but I suggest to him that it is worth studying.  It states that 60,000 tons of steel ingots could be produced there. There are 30,000 tons of scrap available in the country.  A good deal of scrap has been exported.  The figures in relation to these exports can be obtained from the Dublin and Cork harbour authorities.  If they are consulted, I think they will show that 30,000 tons of scrap were exported last year&mdash;scrap which could have been used in the steel mill.  It is pointed out, in the course of the article, that if we were producing in this steel mill 30,000 tons of merchant iron at £13 a ton&mdash;£390,000&mdash; and 30,000 tons of sheets and tinplate at £20 a ton&mdash;£600,000,&mdash;the total production of both would represent a sum of £990,000.</P>
    <P>It is estimated that 800 workers would be required to produce that amount of material at, say, a wage of £4 a week.  The value of the plant, already erected there, is put down at £500,000, and the cost of completing this for the output indicated is estimated at £350,000.  The working capital required would be about £150,000. It is suggested that it is quite within our capacity to build two open-hearth furnaces&mdash;to complete what was started there before the war&mdash;and that we could produce 50,000 tons of steel ingots. Of these, 30,000 tons could be transformed into merchant iron, and the remainder, 20,000 tons of ingots, could be exported and exchanged for coal.</P>
    <P>Where I suggest the Minister has failed in his Budget is that he has made no provision whatever for any big works such as I am suggesting here. I think he should take his courage in his hands and raise a loan sufficiently large to enable schemes of this kind, if found feasible and workable, to be undertaken.  It is estimated that the amount of working capital required&mdash; purchase of coal and scrap, overheads, etc.&mdash;would be about £100,000.  The actual erection of the plant and equipment would cost about £50,000.  It is estimated that there would be 350 men employed.  Supposing this scheme to be in operation in about six months&rsquo;<Col N="412" /> time, what would the value of the annual output be at present-day prices? 30,000 tons of merchant iron at £25&mdash; £750,000; 20,000 tons of ingots at £10&mdash; £200,000, or a gross total of £950,000. On this production there would be employment for 250 or 300 workers. The annual wage bill would be in or about £55,000.  On 300 unemployed men, receiving only 15/- a week, the country would spend about £11,700 a year.  Why should not the Government pay this sum as interest on a loan for the completion of the plant?</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister that he should give serious consideration to this article.  It is stated that the costings and other figures given have been compiled by an expert.  Work of the kind suggested would provide useful employment for a large number in that very distressed area&mdash;the Cork harbour area.  The statement is made in the article that what has been suggested is not new, because we already have the Electricity Supply Board, and the sugar company.  These may be said to be national institutions.  Why not have a national steel company which would be vital for the economic development of the country?</P>
    <P>It would prove useful, too, for the absorption of some of the products of the mines which the Minister for Industry and Commerce proposes to have developed under the Mines and Minerals Act passed recently.  I wanted to deal with that side of the problem because it was a side of it that was not touched upon at all by the Minister for Finance in his Budget statement, or in any of the speeches that I heard made from the Government benches.</P>
    <P>Another matter that I want to refer to is the wages order embodied in the Minister&rsquo;s Budget statement.  Deputies on these benches and on the Fine Fael benches have already made reference to it.  The only description that one can apply to this order is that it is viciously drastic.  It follows, in some way, orders made by the Totalitarian States, but it has not even the saving grace of their orders because usually their orders, pegging down or limiting wages, are accompanied by a price control order. Our Minister has definitely failed to do <Col N="413" /> that.  The wages order made by the Government not alone pegs down wages which may be considered adequate, but it also pegs down low wages.  It hits the lowly-paid man in such a fashion that, according to law, he has no redress.  When the emergency legislation was being passed through the House in September, 1939, and when doubts were expressed from these benches that orders might be made under it and used to the detriment of the workers of the country, the Taoiseach scoffed at the idea.  He did not think such a thing was possible.  Now we have a very viciously drastic order brought in under the operation of the Emergency Powers Act.  We were led to believe that those powers would be operated if and when any subversive action was taken by any citizen of the State or anybody outside the State to disturb in any way the safety of the State.  Now we have this order brought in by the Minister, to operate from 7th May, without any reference whatever to Parliament or to any constitutional body.  It has been done in the most high-handed fashion of any dictator in any part of this Continent of Europe. I cannot see what the purpose of it is. except to cause a good deal of irritation, and, as members of this Party have pointed out to the Minister, a good deal of unrest and dissatisfaction exists throughout the country owing to the operation of this order.  Of course it is only when the operation of it comes more into play, and definitely comes into conflict with the views of the workers who may be seeking increases on account of the increased cost of living, that the Minister will heed the warnings which have been issued by members of this Party.</P>
    <P>There has been no effort made to control prices in this State.  Prices are allowed to soar, and, as the Minister for Supplies has told Deputy Davin to-day, no prosecution has taken place.  Nobody has been prosecuted for profiteering.  We in this Party have put up some suggestions.  As a matter of fact the Labour Party got the Cork Corporation to pass a resolution, and send it on to the Minister for Supplies. that local committees should be formed in each city and town and area to deal <Col N="414" /> with profiteering.  To my mind it is the only way to deal with it, because I am of the opinion that any community which discovers profiteering, even amongst itself, will deal with it drastically and properly.  Profiteering at the expense of poor people is simply downright robbery, and I cannot for the life of me understand why it is that the Minister for Supplies or the Government will not deal and deal harshly with people who have been discovered in those acts of profiteering. It appears to me as if the Government were anxious to cloak the individuals who have been discovered in open and bare-faced profiteering.  The names of those people will not even be published in the Press, and I think that is a very slight punishment for such a serious offence.  I put it to the Minister again that he ought to consider the necessity for having those local committees to deal with profiteering.  It was done during the last war.  People who acted on those committees in Cork City pointed out to me the usefulness of their work during the last war.  At that time wages were pretty high, and employment was plentiful.  Now we have unemployment, and we have this wages order pegging down the wages to the figure at which they stood on 7th May.  I think that the need for those local committees was never more urgent and pressing than it is at the present time, and I am quite prepared to leave it to the judgment of those committees to find a way to deal with those profiteers.</P>
    <P>We heard some Deputies speak about the hardship imposed by the Minister owing to the excess profits tax of 50 per cent.  I do not agree with the Minister in putting a 50 per cent. tax on those excess profits; I think it should be a 100 per cent. tax, because, if I understand the thing rightly, excess profits are nothing short of legalised robbery.  It is simply taking advantage of the position one occupies as a retailer or wholesaler of goods, and charging a figure that is not just or moral.  I cannot see the Minister&rsquo;s point of view in saying to such people: &ldquo;You take half, and give me the other half of the swag.&rdquo;  I think excess profits mean just that.  I should like <Col N="415" /> the Minister, when replying, to correct me if I am wrong, but to me the making of excess profits means that the individual is getting over and above what is legal or just or moral, and I cannot describe it as anything else but robbery, robbery of the poor people who are defenceless owing to the present way of dealing with profiteers.</P>
    <P>There is also a reference in the Minister&rsquo;s speech to vouchers for certain classes of people&mdash;people who are receiving unemployment assistance, old age pensions, and widows&rsquo; and orphans&rsquo; pensions.  This applies only in urban areas, and in areas having town commissioners, and there is nothing stated with regard to the value of such vouchers in pounds, shillings and pence.  Probably the Minister will give us an idea as to what is the amount.  As far as I can read from the statement of the Minister it applies only to dependents, and there is no provision made for, we will say, the unemployed man himself.  I should also like to ask the Minister what about people like those who live outside the City of Cork, in the newly built-up areas there?  They got a concession under the Employment Period Order in that they were not brought in under it on this occasion, recognising them as being what they really are, urban workers.  I should like to know from the Minister how he is going to deal with these people.  I spoke on this matter on different occasions in this House, and I am sure the people know the people to whom I am referring. Will they be dealt with under this voucher system as if they lived in Cork City or in an urban area?  It is very important that they should be, because there is no difference&mdash;either as to the cost of living or conditions when they are employed&mdash;between the people who live immediately inside and those who live immediately outside.  I think there is a definite case to be made for the extension of the voucher system to them.  I would like the Minister to give us some idea of what he intends to do.  I should like to point out to him that these people are entitled to any little amelioration <Col N="416" /> which may be given under the voucher system to the people who live in the cities and urban areas.</P>
    <P>I have tried to point out to the Minister that the turf-cutting scheme and the food production scheme will not meet the exigencies of the unemployment problem, especially in places such as I have mentioned.  I should like the Minister seriously to consider the suggestions that I have made to deal with the unemployment problem in those areas.  The situation is very serious there and, if he wants any confirmation of that, he might ask the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance, who is just as well aware as I am of the conditions in that area, and I think that he will support the suggestions that I have put forward. There is sufficient accommodation in the Rushbrooke Docks, and they could be very usefully availed of in connection with the docking of those ships which the shipping board are to purchase, or have purchased.</P>
    <P>I would commend to the Minister an article in <i>The Standard</i> last Sunday with regard to the steel works in Haulbowline.  If the Minister takes his courage in his hands and finances those projects, he will restore in some measure the prosperity which existed in that area during the last war and for some years afterwards. That prosperity disappeared owing to the change in the circumstances of this country.  The people down there helped a lot in the national struggle at that time and I think they have a very good case for the help that I suggest the Government should provide for them.  I hope the Minister will assist us in some way in relieving the scourge of unemployment that is so prevalent in the area around Cork Harbour.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Surveying the present situation in retrospect, I think it will be agreed to be common case that, until January of this year, nobody appears to have realised fully the possible repercussions on this country, neutral as it is, of the war situation which is developing around us.  Since January, certain revelations have been made, but up to that period complacency was distinctly the mood of <Col N="417" /> the Government.  It stifled whatever possibility there was of energetic effort on their part to cope with growing difficulties and from them that complacency flowed out into the country. The people were lulled into a mood of false security.  Since January, there have been certain shattering blows struck against that complacent mood and certain Ministers have been called here to make their bow before an awakened people.  The people have thus been allowed to see what has been done by the few Ministers who have been paraded in that fashion to meet the difficulties of the situation.  Very few Ministers have either merited or gained any applause for what has been revealed as to their activities.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Finance now makes his bow.  I do not think that, viewed in retrospect, this Budget will win him much in the way of applause.  There seems to be prevailing an idea that a Minister&rsquo;s duty is discharged when he tells the people the worst, or such part of the worst as no longer can be kept from them.  It is no longer regarded as any part of ministerial responsibility to try to exercise imagination or face up to difficulties; they do not appear capable of casting aside old and out-of-date methods of approach if they do not fit the new task.  Ministers are content to say that such a situation exists, and whatever errors there may be are errors of the past, but, nevertheless, there is no amendment or promise for the future.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Finance is one man who has responsibility for a good deal of the situation with which this country was confronted prior to the war.  Due to the activities of himself and his Party before the war started in 1939, this country was in a position in which we had a very heavily increased, and still increasing, cost of living.  Rates had risen to a very high degree; taxes had been increased without appreciation of the capacity of the people to pay; markets had been destroyed or weakened and no substitutes had been found.  There was a marked increase in the dead-weight debt on the shoulders of the people and that was allowed to increase, even though repeated warnings were given about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="418" /> Offsetting that, there was some case of an immediate type in the form of increased migration.  It was in full tide, but, of those who remained behind, the number who could not get work and who had to depend on relief, unemployment assistance, or other means of preventing destitution, had been stabilised at a fairly high figure.  The indications were that there was going to be an increase, and the retort of the Government was greater expenditure out of an unexpanded national income.  The natural result was a still further increase of those who had to depend upon what were euphemistically called social services.  Relief, doles, the handing out of money&mdash;that type of thing was apparently regarded as an excellent substitute for work.  The Government appeared to have come to the conclusion that it was better to dub these as social services, and they took a pride in them instead of relying on the old idea of giving men work out of which they could earn enough to keep themselves and their families.</P>
    <P>In that weakened structure we approached the war situation.  That war was heralded months ahead.  It might have been said that the warnings were not heeded by the majority of the world, and were not even heeded here sufficiently, but, at any rate, there were indications given here, to placate the populace, that there was a realisation of the danger.  We had an announcement early of the setting up of a supplies department for the Department of Industry and Commerce.  This later became the Department of Supplies. The Minister for that Department told us he had to devote himself to making ready against a state of emergency.  That was the appearance of the Government plan many months before the war broke out.</P>
    <P>War itself, as has been said elsewhere, is a bitter medicine, but sometimes has an excellent tonic effect.  It failed to have that tonic effect here. We were told that preparations were being made, and supplies were being laid in, but when we did find ourselves in a war situation, and when, even though we were neutral, we were surrounded by these warring countries, <Col N="419" /> and found ourselves in what amounted to a beleaguered situation, we found that we had nothing in reserve.  We have, temporarily, a convention to the effect that the situation in regard to defence is not to be discussed openly, and that there is no good in entering into that matter in detail.  Now, it is common knowledge that nothing in the way of a real preparation in connection with our defence had been made against a war situation.  The population of this country&mdash;its young men&mdash; are still as willing and ready to sacrifice their liberties and their persons as they have always been, but modern war takes no account of persons unless they are properly equipped, and it is now evident that the Government had taken no steps to provide our Army with anything in the way of proper equipment for the conditions of modern war, and these unfortunate young men were evidently expected to be prepared to sacrifice their persons in such conditions as that.</P>
    <P>There is also the shortage in regard to certain essential foodstuffs.  There had been a boast about the policy of self-sufficiency, but that was swept away once the war came and we then realised, and have continued to realise with ever-increasing anxiety, that this boasted self-sufficiency was only a myth and that we are all dependent to an enormous extent on supplies that come in from outside.  The Ministry of Supplies was set up earlier and it is more particularly the duty of that Minister than of any other Ministers to look after our supplies and to announce from time to time any shortages that have occurred or may be expected to occur in respect of supplies, and the people expected him to make such announcements from time to time.  That question of supplies, to anybody with imagination, must have gone to the point of including raw materials for industrial production.  One would have thought that a Minister who was so proud of industrial production would at least have taken care that some little sufficiency of industrial raw materials would have been here so as to enable the so-called self-sufficient industries to continue for some little time.  There is <Col N="420" /> a bitter realisation here now, 20 months after the war started, of the inadequacy of the efforts of various Ministers to deal with this matter, but more particularly of the inadequacy of the efforts of the Minister for Supplies. We know now that no provision was being made.  No warning was given in time to the people as to how badly the supply situation had been tackled. Warning should have been given with a view to getting people to see what they could do in the way of producing at home substitutes for what cannot be procured from abroad.</P>
    <P>The governmental device against that is, of course, two things.  We have this loose phrase used about blockade, so as to divert the minds of the people away from the sins of the Government and make them believe that there is some sort of deliberate effort on the part of some of the belligerents that is stopping us from getting what we had a right to expect&mdash;something that no Minister for Supplies could have expected would come or should come, and, therefore, need make no preparation against.  Second, we have the device of closing down on all statistical information to the people so that boasts which are false can still be made, that in the months between, say, Munich and the outbreak of the war, or even between the outbreak of the war and the fall of France, efforts were made to get in stores of foodstuffs, raw materials, or other essentials for industry. The Government know that the statistical information that has been asked for from time to time, if given, would blast away for ever the statement that that interval was seized upon and utilised to bring in the things that were necessary for the people of the country.</P>
    <P>At the beginning of the war, in the early days of it, this House was summoned to discuss the emergency situation, and this House granted to the Government of the day certain powers.  I insist again that it was a Party Government and there was no request made that there should be a change in Party Government, nor any suggestion from the Government that any such change should be made.  To that Party Government other Parties <Col N="421" /> gave the most drastic powers that were ever given even to a national government, and I think these powers included such things as that people who made money out of the chances of a war situation would be dealt with.  I think there was unanimity in the House when it was pointed out that there was one part of the emergency powers which indicated that there was going to be some way of dealing with a man who tried to make money during a period of the exhaustion of his fellows.</P>
    <P>I heard a phrase to the effect that a profiteer was the loathsome product of most wars, and there was a certain amount of joy that something would be done to people who would set out to make profits of an extravagant type during the war situation.  Afterwards, when we asked what use was being made of these powers we were always told that there was price control.  The method of price control was derided by those who have had experience of it, and it was pointed out that most countries that had experience of price control, looking back on their attempts to enforce it, said that these attempts were fruitless.  It was said here that the only way to get at the increased profits was to take them when they were made, with a very small percentage allowed to enable people to go on and keep in production.  This Budget, in any event, is, at least impliedly, a confession that the attempts that were supposed to have been made through price control have failed.  We were told all the time that prices had been controlled and that excess profits at least had not been made.  Now the Budget has revealed to us that about half the extra money that is to be gathered in is to be taken from excess profits that were made by profiteers.  Look at the way it is being done.  We do get to a point where men must balance their minds between the present and the immediate future, and in the immediate future as it presents itself to us there are many warnings of what may come and what must be done in regard to the possibility of people continuing in production, to which more attention should be paid than to the extra amount they may make.  We have to consider the question of keeping <Col N="422" /> people in production and in employment. In this situation we are now going to view the war situation from the point of view of when it started in September, 1939, and an attempt is now being made retrospectively to get back and collect 95 per cent. of the excess profits made in that time.  Take the phrase used by the Minister in page 24 of his speech, which is as follows:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The accounts now available indicate that a considerable number of business concerns have been making substantially increased profits since the outbreak of the war and that these concerns are mainly in the hands of limited companies.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Then this was the preamble:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I therefore propose to make certain changes in the corporation profits tax and these changes include a modification designed to give the Exchequer a very substantial proportion of the increased profits which have accrued as a result of the war.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If we were starting back at the beginning, or if this were starting merely at this point, nobody could disagree with it or with the fact that the Exchequer was to get a very substantial amount, even let us say, 100 per cent., of the increased profits accrued as a result of the war, but at the end of that page we get the first device:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Corporation profits tax at present is not charged on the first £5,000 of profit.  I propose to reduce this exemption limit to £1,000.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Then the amount that was charged was either 7½ per cent. to 10 per cent. or 10 per cent. to 12½ per cent., and these are being increased.  It is, of course, clear that that is going to apply to a company which has not made increased profits and that it cannot apply to a company which may have made increased profits as a result of enhanced business but not as a result of the war.</P>
    <P>Take that last phrase.  A company that made £10,000 may have its profits dropped by half.  It is going to pay more and is going to pay that &ldquo;more&rdquo; from September, 1939, and that is put <Col N="423" /> under the heading of &ldquo;increased profits that have accrued as a result of the war.&rdquo;  If the Minister were getting at the real excess profits, at the people who have made money and have made it out of the exigencies of the war and were going to take 50 per cent.&mdash;he shows later that, by the addition of certain other matters, in the end, he is going to get 75 per cent.&mdash;again, if he were starting from this moment, his attempt to get 75 per cent. of these increased profits, where it can be shown that they are increased profits due to the war, I think his effort would be welcomed by any public-spirited citizen, and, if he increased it to 80 per cent. or 90 per cent., or anything he liked, he would be encouraged.  But he tails it back to the start of the war and that has apparently to be paid this year.  I do not see why, if he is going back, he should stop at the outbreak of the war.  The worst profiteering brought to the notice of the public was profiteering which took place prior to the war.  It was profiteering which was made easy, for people who were so minded, by Governmental activity.  We had commissions which reported on these matters.  The Ranks business and the bacon curers are two that stand out.  Attention was called to this over and over again and Ministers were asked to search the pockets of these people, and to take back even such moneys as were found in these reports to have been dishonestly taken from the people, but there was no attempt made then, nor is there any attempt made now, to get these moneys.</P>
    <P>As a matter of fact, the lucky person is the person who had successfully profiteered up to September, 1939, because he will have two good standard years, and it is only if he has made superhuman efforts and got really good fat profits since the war, that he will be penalised at all.  The man who got his chance and seized on it prior to 1939 is the lucky man.  Take the business man who got a tariff which he used moderately pre-war.  He had only just begun to get his feet under him and had what would be described in normal <Col N="424" /> times as an expanding business.  He was beset with all the difficulties which surround the start of a business and he did not make much in the way of profits in the three years preceding the war.  I take the case of a man who could say, on evidence shown by his accounts, that he was, in the normal course of events, going to do bigger business, going to have a bigger turnover and, therefore, more profits as the years rolled on, and going to give more employment because of his activities which was the aim and object of the tariff policy.  That man is now put in the same gallery with the profiteer, and the Minister&rsquo;s whip will be laid as effectively on his shoulders as upon those of the rogue who deserves no mercy.</P>
    <P>Take the other situation.  Take the man who has an expanding business and who made something in the way of profits for the three years prior to the war.  He has increased his business since; he utilised the increased profits accruing to him from that business to build up his business still further.  He is, say, a man who felt he was not fully equipped to do the business he should be doing, and who put his money into plant and machinery. Maybe the Finance Bill will reveal that some account will be taken of such a case, but, in the Minister&rsquo;s bald statement, there is no evidence that that is to be taken account of.  Suppose that man has involved every penny he made in equipment.  He is now asked to pay retrospectively over, say, two years&mdash;and he has to make it one payment&mdash;an amount of taxation calculated on the two years&rsquo; business trading.  Where is he to find it?  Does the Minister want to drive such a person into liquidation?  Does the Minister feel that if he goes to a bank and indicates what his situation is, the bank will readily accommodate him?  Does he think it right to drive people to borrow from banks in order to meet his demands?</P>
    <P>Take the case of the person who did a good trade, who was running an expanding business and who, having more forethought than the Minister for Supplies, put back every shilling he was making into goods and lined his <Col N="425" /> shelves.  That man, in fact, was obeying, except that he was anticipating in his obedience, the exhortations of the Government recently, but he will find himself in the position one of these days in which he will have a fair amount of goods which he can turn into cash some time or other, and then the Minister&rsquo;s demand note will come down upon him.  What is he to do? Suppose we take the case&mdash;I have an individual case before me&mdash;of a man who, when his accounts are paraded, will show that his net profit increased from the year before the war from about £600 to four times that figure now.  He, as I say, now stands in line with Ranks, the bacon curers and all that class of folk.  Suppose he is able to show that his turnover increased enormously in the period, that the amount he paid in wages had increased very largely and that his other overheads, excluding wages, had by him been kept low.  If he has given employment, and increased employment, and if he has packed every shilling he made in these increased profits into still further expanding his business, what is going to be done for that man?  Is it proper that that fellow should be put out of business, or should even be hampered in the running of his business because the Minister this year finds himself short of cash and must get this sum of £1,720,000, which he is to get from corporation profits tax, income-tax and sur-tax?</P>
    <P>I suggest that the Minister might at least do this: let him take the war period, whatever it may be, starting in September, 1939, and running to the end of the war, or even longer.  If there is going to be a period of business confusion, of industrial upset of a severe type, even when the war ends, let him regard that as part of the war period. We have already done it from the constitutional angle, clearly contemplating that the confusion caused by the war will not finish with the mere outbreak of peace, and we are going to allow an extension of the period of emergency so far as constitutional matters are concerned. Economically, the confusion will be still at least as great.  Let the Minister contemplate, and announce that he is contemplating, that, in the <Col N="426" /> period called the war period, not necessarily brought to an end by the termination of hostilities, he is not going to allow excess profits to be made, and that he will see, in a leisurely, unhurried way, that people will pay on the profits made over all that period, but let him also announce that, inside that period, because this is a matter to which we must pay some attention, he will test out this matter of excess profits in a variety of ways.</P>
    <P>I suppose it would be common case that if a man did make a little extra out of the people of this country, and, at the end of the war, left himself with a better business unit, a better factor of production, that man is not to be derided and looked upon as a chap who made money, but as a man who will be in a better position to serve the country economically.  There is something to be said in favour of that man and he ought to get good marks for that.  Suppose that, after all the war period, that man has increased his employment, has increased the amount of purchasing power which he scattered amongst his employees&mdash;or, as possibly may be the case, if it gets to the lower level, that he maintains his employment, because all the signs are that people are going to go out of productivity under the impact of this Budget as well as other things&mdash;suppose he is a man of whom it can be said that he made money in certain of the years of the war, but that he kept his business going, and kept people from getting on to the backs of the State, that he did not make them persons to get in line for the dole and for assistance of different types, surely, again, some sort of good marks ought to be given for that type of thing, when this whole period has been surveyed.  I suggest to the Minister that he ought to pay some attention to that.</P>
    <P>As he does this thing at the moment, it is crude.  I think it is going to be inefficient in its application.  The Minister simply says: &ldquo;I am taking the period since September, 1939, and, irrespective of the harm that may be done to future production, I am going to get 50 per cent. or 75 per cent. of all the extra moneys made, whether made <Col N="427" /> through good business or through profiteering.  I am going to get the money whether it causes businesses to crash or not.&rdquo;  Supposing it does cause a few to crash?  Will the Minister not lose a bit in the end?  Suppose there is a vast decrease in production, that in fact supplies fail along the lines which the Minister&rsquo;s forebodings ran towards the end of his speech, will not the man who keeps his business alive and people in some sort of occupation be almost a national hero?  All those people, simply because they made some more money since the war broke out, are to be dubbed the same&mdash;profiteers &mdash;and it is thought justice and equity that 75 per cent. of all they took should be taken from them.</P>
    <P>I realise the Minister&rsquo;s other difficulty, that he must get this money and get it this year.  I am taking it for the moment that that is the situation, but I doubt if it is.  He has to get certain moneys this year and he has to meet certain expenditure.  He has two ways of doing that so far as this is concerned. There is a third way which he brushed aside.  He can economise, cut down, and pare somewhere.  He can borrow, he can get the money through taxation, or by forced loans or something like that.  He said here that he will borrow.  There is a funny distinction made between what it is proper to borrow for and what it is not.  In any event, £5,000,000 has to be found this year by the Minister by way of borrowing. £1,000,000 odd of that is supposed to have assets against it. Almost £4,000,000 is going to be borrowed simply because we cannot find it in any other way.</P>
    <P>If production goes down and the Minister cannot economise, the Minister will have less revenue-bearing items in the State.  What is he going to do?  Is it a question of increasing the borrowing if the amount raised by taxation falls?  If that is the situation, would it not be better to borrow a little more now when production is still maintained at some point, rather than to have to go to people and ask them to lend money because production has broken down?  If that is the situation, should not the Minister here and now <Col N="428" /> contemplate the possible effect of this grabbing of £1,700,000 out of the future business and industrial productivity of the country?</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the Minister could not make some use of the repayment device adopted on the other side. Let it be estimated that the Minister must get £1,700,000 this year.  Is it not possible, having in mind that other plan, for some scheme to be made out, with an allowance for meritorious conduct of a financial or industrial type, by which he will get the extra profits made out of the war period?  Is it not possible for him to recognise that there will be great difficulty in taking from firms retrospectively 75 per cent. of their excess profits over nearly two years?  Could he not make some arrangement whereby there would be the possibility of repayment?  Repayment would certainly have to occur if in later years, because of his activities, losses are incurred.  Surely the Minister must contemplate the possibility that here and there a firm, because of his attack, will make a loss next year. Will he take that into contemplation? Will he balance that possibility of a loss eventually against the profits that he said have been made over 20 months?  Will he so equate the bill eventually, as was done in connection with the previous excess profits tax, that a loss will be balanced against a gain, and that in the end the industrialist will pay, not upon the ephemeral profits of one or two years, but upon the whole period of the war, on what he succeeded in extracting from the people in that time?</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister that this is the most serious part of the Budget, because we have a situation in which, owing to the break-down in other Departments, the country is not provided with supplies.  The country has not even supplies of certain foodstuffs that it needs.  There certainly is a large deficiency in the supplies required to keep whatever industrial production there is running.  Materials are running out; prices are rising and no effort is being made to control them.  I think it somewhat realistic at least that, coincident with the Budget, there has <Col N="429" /> been issued an order stabilising wages at a certain point.  However much that may be disliked, it is at least based upon the realisation that, when the Budget gets going and these moneys are extracted from the people, as much as possible will be passed on to the poorer elements of the community and that prices will rise.  The Ministry, seeing that that is the natural outcome of the Budget, have decided: &ldquo;We can stop that in a brutally inefficient way by simply saying, irrespective of what people&rsquo;s feelings may be, irrespective of the distress we will cause, irrespective of the outbreak that that may provoke and which may cause expenditure far greater than anything in the Budget, we will allow no increase no matter what case can be made.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Supposing we take this order as being founded entirely upon the exposed profiteer.  It is notorious that he is getting away with 25 per cent. of the moneys.  Is there any allowance in the wage rate to equate for that?  It is also clear, of course, that part of the increase in the cost of living was caused not since the war started, but before it; that it was caused by a lot of people who made money passing on the burden and raising the cost of living to people who could not offset that in any way.  They are now being allowed to take their excess profits of previous years as their standard, and base their future upon that.  The wages clause simply rules in a particular way.</P>
    <P>The Minister must know that there is a bad situation developing in the country.  So far as food is concerned, although the signs are the other way, there may be only inconvenience and a change over from one type of food to another.  The country is certainly not as well endowed as it is expected to be as regards provisioning.  So far as fuel is concerned, the situation is extremely bad.  I have seen calculations made that, if all the turf the city requires was now cut and saved and lying in the bogs, provision has not been made for transporting into the city more than one-third of what the city&rsquo;s requirements will be during the winter.  Of course, it is notorious that the turf is not cut and saved, and the <Col N="430" /> transport difficulty, which will only arise when that point has been reached, does not emerge as a really serious matter.  The thing that does emerge as a serious matter is the cutting and the saving of the fuel.  But no serious approach was made to this either.</P>
    <P>The Government were content to throw out a few exhortations to parish councils, and to publish advertisements to the effect that any turf cut now would be purchased from the people and would not be left on their hands. There was, however, no attempt made to give central direction or to marshal forces for a definite assault on this very serious problem.  The Government were content to sit at the top and exhort. The country requires more than that. When winter comes, if the situation develops as badly as it promises, it will be no excuse for the Government to say that they asked the parish councils and the local authorities to do certain things.  The Government must be aware, from the evidence they have, that the work is not being done, and that the amount of fuel that will be required for this city will not be there when the demand is made for it.  I speak only for the city.</P>
    <P>In regard to foodstuffs, some embarrassment is certain to be caused when people are put on a changed kind of diet which they may resent.  They may tolerate it, but that will not prevent recrimination as to whether some better attempt could not have been made earlier to get some other kind of provisioning done for them.  If, in addition to that, there is a dearth of fuel, if people have not the way of cooking food, and have not a sufficient store of fuel of some other type to take the chill out of their system, that certainly will be a bad enough situation.  Suppose, in addition, that firms go out of work, that the number of people now profitably employed decreases, and that the number who have to resort to Government aid increases, then, with prices soaring, the situation is going to be bad.  The workers who have a bit of money will find that its purchasing power has decreased.  In these circumstances, does the Minister think that this is the time to try to extract, irrespective of what harm it may cause to <Col N="431" /> business, his excess profits?  He says that he proposes to get that, no matter what occurs.  I suggest to him that, in the critical times in which we are living, production should be the key note of his Budget and not taxation.</P>
    <P>The Minister said there was one other field for economy and that was the Army.  He had there a promising field for economy.  He said that all his attacks to reduce the Army Vote were repulsed.  &ldquo;I suppose I am revealing no secrets,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;when I say that not even was succour forthcoming on my side from the Council of Defence.&rdquo;  Whatever the Minister may mean about not revealing any secrets, he is certainly not revealing the truth in this because Deputy Norton, a member of the Defence Conference, said that he did not remember the Army Vote being brought before it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>At any rate it is clear now that there is a fertile field <Col N="433" /> there for exploration.  If one looks at the war that is progressing outside and tries to make up one&rsquo;s mind as to whether, at the moment, it is the flesh-and blood side or the equipment side that counts, one will be driven to the conclusion, having regard to the possible expenditure on equipment, that the Estimate for the Army is an ill-balanced one, and that a huge amount could be taken off the more useless side of that proposed expenditure.  I certainly think that the Minister should have that examined before he sets out on what has been described as the ruthless pursuit of these so-called profiteers.  I propose to examine critically and cautiously that aspect of the Minister&rsquo;s speech at a later stage and to present arguments which, I hope, will persuade him that the ruthless application that he speaks of in his speech will work harm to every interest in the country.  If the Minister had started in September, 1939, and said that he would allow no excess profits, due to the war, to accrue to any person running industry or business, he would have had the full support of everyone.  I say, further, that if the Minister had said that, he would have had, as the war rolled on, with this country left neutral, been driven more and more to give subventions to businesses to keep them going.  I suggest that instead of adopting that device the Minister should halt in his attempt to collect that money, should recognise the exceptional cases of distress that may occur, and, out of no love for profiteers at all but simply because of an interest in keeping production going to some degree in this country, should give merit where merit is due, and allow people even to get a little bit in the way of what might be described as excess profits of the profiteering type if they kept their businesses going and kept people from becoming a burden on the State.</P>

      <P>During the time when the present Minister for Finance was Minister for Local Government I had occasion to congratulate him on the successful way in which he was running his office.  I regret to say that at present I cannot congratulate him.  We have here a Budget for £40,000,000.  It <Col N="434" /> has been suggested by members on this side of the House, especially by the Deputy who has just sat down, that there are a great many economies which could be effected in this expenditure if the Minister went about it properly.  I have a few suggestions to make with regard to economies which I recommend the Minister carefully to consider.  In 1932, the cost of the Oireachtas was £104,000, while the cost in 1941-42 is £125,000, and the membership in the Dáil has been reduced from 153 to 138.  I respectfully submit to the Minister for Finance that he could save the taxpayers at least £25,000 by making the T.D.s pay income-tax at 7/6 in the £ on their allowances, or by reducing the allowances from £480 to £360.  For the Minister&rsquo;s own Department, the Department of Finance, the cost this year is £73,000, while in 1932-3 it was £57,000, when it was run on a much more businesslike basis.  A saving of at least £20,000 could be made on the running of that Department, without in any way impairing its efficiency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave referred to the Revenue Commissioners in the Budget debate on Thursday last.  The Office of the Revenue Commissioners cost £660,000 in 1932, and according to this year&rsquo;s Estimate the cost will be £926,000.  Can the Minister justify that enormous increase of £260,000 a year for that service?  Are they more efficient now than they were in 1932? I would seriously recommend that the Minister take the necessary steps to have that Estimate reduced, in war time, by at least £250,000.  Even then they will be costing more than they were in 1932, when they were doing more work and doing it better.  The Office of Public Works cost £89,000 in 1932, while in this year&rsquo;s Estimate the figure is £145,000.  A saving of at least £55,000 could be made there.  In 1932-33, the cost of Public Works and Buildings was £537,000, and the corresponding figure for 1941-42 is £1,141,000. Without in any way impairing the service of that Department the Estimate could be reduced by £250,000. Here we have a war situation, and instead of squandering the money of the taxpayers and ratepayers we <Col N="435" /> should try to conserve it.  In 1932, the Civil Service Commission cost £11,000. It was as efficient then as now, and the Estimate for this year is £22,000.  At least £10,000 should be deducted from this year&rsquo;s Estimate, and that saving could be made without any impairing of efficiency.  I hope the Minister will very carefully look into those matters.</P>
    <P>Secret Service is costing £20,000 this year, while in 1932-33 it cost only £952.  I suggest that a saving of £15,000 could be made in that service. Expenses under the Electoral Act and the Juries Act amounted to £17,000 in 1932-33.  As there is no hope of having elections during the coming year, I think that item could be struck off and £17,000 saved.  Stationery and printing cost £101,000 in 1932, and the figure for this year is £161,000.  There is less printing done and less stationery used now than in 1932, and I suggest that a saving of £60,000 could be made in that service.  The Department of Agriculture, under a capable Minister in 1932, cost £464,000.  In 1941-42, that Department is to cost the State £932,000.  Is it worth it?  Are we getting value for the money allocated to it?  I do not think so.  I think that £500,000 could be struck off that Estimate, without impairing the work of the Department. The Office of the Minister for Justice is estimated to cost £43,000 this year as against £37,000 in 1932-33.  A sum of £5,000 could easily be saved on the running of that office without in any way impairing its efficiency.  There are increases in the Estimates for the District Court, the Supreme Court and High Court of Justice.  I think that a sum of £15,000 could be saved without any danger of impairing those services.</P>
    <P>The Department of Local Government and Public Health is estimated to cost £1,229,000 this year as against £437,000 in 1932-33, an increase of nearly £800,000.  A saving of £500,000 could be made in that Department. They had as much, if not more, work to do in 1932, and they did it more efficiently than it is being done at present. The Office of the Minister for Education was run in 1932-33 at a cost of £160,000, and it will cost the taxpayers £190,000 for 1941-42.  This <Col N="436" /> amount could quite easily be cut down by £30,000.  The cost of Secondary Education has gone up from £333,000 to £483,000, while the cost of Technical Education has gone up from £173,000 to £329,000.  The Estimate for those services should be reduced by £150,000, and they would still cost £156,000 more than they did in 1932.  Transport and Meteorological Services are to cost £88,000 in 1941-42.  In 1932-33 we had better services, and the cost was £39,000.  I would suggest that that Estimate could be cut down by £50,000. I do not think those services are functioning to any extent at present.  As far as the farmers are concerned they have not been getting any weather news since the war started.  Then we come to the Land Commission.  In 1932-33 the Department of Lands cost £479,000, and the estimated cost for 1941-42 is £1,468,000.  I do not want to make any comments on that Estimate, beyond requesting the Minister for Finance to have it reduced by at least £500,000.</P>
    <P>There is an increase of £128,000 in the Estimate for the Forestry Department. I think that could be pruned down by £50,000 without impairing the efficiency of the service.  The Estimate for the Department of Industry and Commerce this year is £262,000, while in 1932-33 it cost £99,000, when Deputy McGilligan was in charge of that Department, and I do not think anybody will say that he did not run it efficiently.  The Estimate could easily be reduced this year by £100,000.  In 1932, the Army Vote was £1,154,000, while this year the figure is £8,313,000. I believe, if the Minister were to look into this matter seriously in order to try to balance his Budget, he could cut that Vote down by at least £3,000,000, and it would still be an intolerable burden on the taxpayers. Salaries and wages have been decreasing steadily every year since Fianna Fáil got into power.  The Department of External Affairs has increased from £60,000 to £85,000.  I should like to know for what reason the Estimate has been increased by over £20,000.  Surely that increase could be taken off. Agricultural produce subsidies did not cost anything in 1932, but they are <Col N="437" /> costing £250,000 for this year.  That represents £250,000 being taken out of the pockets of the taxpayers in order to give cheap butter, bacon and eggs to Great Britain, while we are practically starving our own people.  I intend to vote against this Resolution.</P>
    <P>I must strongly protest against the tax on tobacco.  Everybody knows that the only luxury left to the farming community, indeed to the majority of the people in this country, is tobacco. No doubt the Minister remembers the time when tobacco could be purchased for 3d. an ounce.  The price to day is five times that amount.  If the Minister would seriously consider the economies which I have suggested, he could easily make a substantial reduction in his demands for this year.  Let us now take the case of petrol, upon which the tax will be 1/3 as against 10d. a gallon. There would be no necessity for that very big increase if the economies I suggested were put into practice.</P>
    <P>Another matter to which I should like to refer is the bonus which is paid to Government officials in particular. In the Land Commission alone there is a sum of £110,000 paid by way of bonus on salaries, wages and allowances.  A similar condition of things applies to every other Government Department. I do not see why we should continue to pay that bonus for all time.  After all, the bonus was only a war measure, and that war finished 22 or 23 years ago.  I cannot understand why we should be paying that bonus to-day.  It should be cut out at once.  There is no reason why the people to whom it is paid should not bear sacrifices the same as every other person in the country.</P>
    <P>The conditions in the country districts are bad.  We have brought the farmers to a terrible state of poverty and distress, and people are now allowed only half an ounce of tea each week.  There is no reason why we should be paying a bonus amounting in all to £400,000 or £500,000 a year to employees of the Government.  They are getting substantial salaries upon which they can easily exist, and the loss of the bonus would not affect them very much.  The Minister should endeavour to put at least some of the <Col N="438" /> economies that have been suggested into effect.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>The point of view of this Party has been clearly expressed already and, therefore, I do not propose to take up very much of the time of the House.  I merely wish to express my great regret that the Government have seen fit to reiterate in this Budget the policy that was enunciated by the Minister for Finance on the occasion of the introduction of his Supplementary Budget in November, 1939.  He then ventured to state his own views and the views of the Government against workers or anybody else who might seek increased wages or salaries in view of the cost of living index figure.  This Budget indicates a continuance of that policy.  It would seem that the Government learn nothing and forget nothing. Embodied in this Budget is a drastic order in pursuance of the ukase indicated by the Minister in 1939, when he set his face against the workers.</P>
      <P>At that time the only people whom this attitude could affect were those who were unfortunate enough to be under his direct control.  Conscientious and moral-minded employers willingly gave concessions and increases to their workers, when they found that the increasing cost of living justified it. Representatives of trade union organisations and representatives of employees negotiated satisfactory increases, which in no case represented anything beyond what was absolutely justified by the cost of living figures. It was generally recognised that it was a time when the difficulties caused by the war emergency should be shared by everybody, and that there should be an equal sacrifice all round.  The increases that were then conceded affected various types of industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Finance told us some time ago that they were not talking about preventing prices rising&mdash; they were acting.  I suggest that all that matters to the people is that the cost of living has increased.  I agree that in the case of some things that are absolutely essential there was an increase that could not have been prevented by any Government.  We <Col N="439" /> have heard a lot about profiteering and about certain things that might have been stopped by the Government but, willy nilly, increases have taken place in the cost of living and apparently the Government are determined that they are not going to allow any increased remuneration whatsoever.  That would immediately envisage a certain condition of things&mdash;that we enjoyed a very high standard of living here, one that would warrant us suffering a reduction of even 25 per cent.</P>
    <P>Does the Minister suggest that the social standards of our people before the war were of such a fine character that we could afford, without any serious inconvenience, to stand still with our incomes, tighten our belts and keep on living irrespective of the inability of the Government to control the cost of material things?  We are told that the Government are sticking to what they call the old system, and it was stated by their spokesmen that if they could not solve our economic and other problems from inside their system, they would be prepared to go outside.  They are not even operating the old system, the system that was inherited from our neighbour across the water.</P>
    <P>If we study the conditions across the channel to-day, we do not find them tightening their belts.  On the contrary, they are paying increased wages to their people.  If we compare the attitude of the Government towards the people there with the attitude of the Government here we find that they do not suffer by the comparison.  I suggest that this is nothing short of a huge deportation order affecting the majority of Irish workers.  The Taoiseach denied that there was any emigration&mdash;I prefer to call it deportation&mdash;of Irish workers taking place, but Deputy Norton suggested that if he went across to Amiens Street Station he would get an ocular demonstration which would surely convince him that large numbers of workers are leaving the country.</P>
    <P>In my own city, which has a comparatively small population, there is a regular exodus and the only difficulty is that experienced in procuring passports. <Col N="440" /> In one instance alone 149 people went to Gloucestershire to engage in remunerative work there.  I am aware that there were over 4,000 persons from Limerick and the surrounding counties anxious to cross to England to engage in work there. Surely that fact is within the knowledge of the Government.  In Dublin City the exodus of skilled and unskilled men has been proceeding steadily for months past.</P>
    <P>Because of the absence of any serious attempt by the Government to provide employment at home, these people are going to go over there.  This is a further effort now to drive the people across the water.  The people are not to be allowed to get any increase whatever, no matter how the cost of living may soar.  In that way I charge the Government with definite negligence in their duties, because there is a huge amount of work to be done by the people of this country in order to provide for our requirements here. The production of turf, to make up for the lack of supplies of imported fuel is a matter of outstanding importance, but the Government have not indicated that they have any real plan for the production of that fuel.  The Taoiseach has addressed several meetings.  He has addressed various parish councils in different parts of the country, but at no time has he committed himself beyond saying: &ldquo;We want the turf, and it is there in the bogs to be got, but do not ask me to do anything about it; ask somebody else to do it.&rdquo; If that is regarded as planning to produce a prime essential, in the absence of imported fuel, there is going to be a serious reaction during the coming winter.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister now to get into touch with the county and regional commissioners and the various county surveyors who have got instructions recently in connection with the bogs, with a view to getting from these people an estimate of what will be their requirements of fuel in each of their districts, and ask them to say what they think they will be able to get out of the bogs and how they propose to transport the turf from the bogs.  I think that the Minister and <Col N="441" /> the Government will be really amazed at the gap that will be revealed between the amount required and the amount that will be produced by the present haphazard method, or rather lack of method.  A Deputy here spoke of the difficulty of transporting the turf to Dublin and other cities.  Now, before you cook your hare you have to catch him, and I want to suggest that before we concern ourselves with the question of the transport of the turf from the bogs we should first devote ourselves to the question of bringing workers to the bogs.  The bogs are not all in the one place.  They are scattered over wide areas.</P>
    <P>In my own county they form a sort of whisker around the fringe of the county, and the county surveyor is not able to get the necessary labour to go on to the bogs.  He has employed all the people who are available in the vicinity of the bogs, but he has got no facility from the Government to provide even a pint of petrol for the transport of men from other areas who would be willing to go and work on the bogs if they could get there.  We have cases of men cycling 14 miles to the bog in the morning and 14 miles back in the evening.  Many men cycle ten and 12 miles to their work, but in some cases it is 14 and 15 miles that they have to cycle there and back, and a man is not able to do much after that, especially when he only has a hastily prepared meal at midday which he prepares when he is on the bog.  If we are to replace the imported fuel with turf the Government should have made provision for the transport of men to produce the turf, and they should also provide a hot meal for these men in the bog at midday.  I do not think it would be anything patriotic or extra generous on the part of the Government to provide these things; it would be just good business, and in that way it would be possible to plan the development and production of the fuel that will be necessary this year.</P>
    <P>If some definite central scheme of that type is not evolved we are not going to get the turf that is required. If the Government have no hope of securing coal from outside&mdash;and all the Indications are that coal will not be <Col N="442" /> available&mdash;then in all sincerity I say that they ought now, before it is too late, to devise ways and means of providing transport.  They have plenty of lorries, and whatever petrol they have, on the basis of that bed-rock ration, should be applied to the purpose of bringing men to the bogs so as to enable sufficient native fuel to be produced for the coming winter.  The petrol could not be used to better purpose.</P>
    <P>Our supplies, generally, have been neglected.  We have made complaints and heard complaints from time to time of the lack of tea.  That has been explained away by saying that we cannot have it because we did not get it from Britain.  I suggest to the Minister that if we are going to be short of tea and certain types of coal for which turf will not be a substitute&mdash;I refer particularly to gas coal because the situation in the cities is getting very serious; speaking for my own city and for the City of Cork where supplies are very low, if the supplies of gas coal should fail down there it will be a really serious disaster &mdash; some effort should be made to come to an arrangement with Britain.</P>
    <P>As we are continuing to export our butter, eggs, bacon, poultry, stout, biscuits and all the other things for the people over there, would it be too much of a lowering of the Government&rsquo;s dignity to send a deputation over there, with the Minister himself a member of it, and ask them to give us a <i>quid pro quo</i> in the shape of coal or other necessities in exchange for the things we send them?  A deputation could go over to Colwyn Bay to see the people over there in regard to coal. There does not seem to be any lowering of dignity in the case of other Governments when they send deputations to other countries to discuss things of that character.  I should like to know whether anything of that kind has been done.  If so, we have not heard of it, and I am of opinion that if a deputation were sent over, with the Minister himself upon it, we should be able to arrange for supplies.  There is no reason why we should not be able to get a release of the coal, tea and other commodities that we know are <Col N="443" /> lying over there in abundance in Britain, but it seems to be a question of somebody&rsquo;s prestige being offended or his dignity lowered.  In addition to trying to solve our own fuel problem, our outside supplies ought to be attended to also, and a responsible deputation should be sent to deal with the British Government in order to get a <i>quid pro quo</i> for the goods we send over there.</P>
    <P>A regrettable feature of this Budget was the tobacco tax.  Something, of course, has to be hit, but the tobacco tax bears too harshly on the poor man. Other alternatives have been suggested. Someone suggested a tax on lipstick or some other cosmetics.  Bad as all that is from the point of view of the workers, however, I feel that the most regrettable feature of the Budget and the greatest affront that it carries is the definite challenge conveyed in that Order No. 83, which is nothing more than a hurling of defiance at the workers of the country, who are doing their best to carry on during this time of crisis to help the State out of its difficulties.  The emergency powers that were given by this House to the Government, were to be used for definite and specific purposes: to prevent subversive action, to prevent anybody from trying to usurp the functions of the Government of this State, and so on, but they were never intended to be utilised, as this is being utilised, against the workers of the country legitimately carrying on their business and, at one stroke, to take away from them their hard-won rights which they had gained through trade union legislation going back to 1871. This order can only be taken in the one way&mdash;as a deliberate defiance of the organised workers, and saying to the workers: &ldquo;We found that the powers we took in 1939 to go against you were not sufficient, and we shall go the whole hog now.&rdquo;  We, the Labour Deputies on these benches, would be very sorry to see any dislocation or disturbances in this country, but, if such disturbance or dislocation should come about, it can be laid definitely at the doors of the Government who have been guilty of this misguided <Col N="444" /> action of introducing this drastic order which is only worthy of the worst type of military dictatorship.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has referred to one very regrettable feature of this Budget and has indicated that he deplores it.  So do we all.  We all deplore the regrettable circumstances of the time which have made it necessary to introduce a Budget of this description in this House, but what other remedy was there?  What other remedy has the Government in the situation which now confronts it? Deputy McGilligan suggests that the key-note of this Budget should have been production and not taxation, but you cannot produce without the materials, and the materials for most of our industries are not available and could not be available unless this country were completely and wholly self-sufficient.  Whether we could ever attain what some people regard as the ideal state in that matter or not, I am not prepared to argue at this point, but the fact is that we are not, to our cost, as self-sufficient as perhaps we might have been.  I do not think that in that regard any undue criticism can be levelled at the Government.  Perhaps those who have been criticising us because the keynote of this Budget is taxation and not production might search their own consciences in that matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was saying that we cannot hope to continue our present rate of production so far as industrial output is concerned, in view of the present, and perhaps increasing, shortage of overseas supplies.  The position, therefore, with which we are faced is that we are going to have a dwindling pool of essential commodities available for the support of all our people.  Naturally, in those circumstances, the prices of such commodities are bound to rise and, equally naturally, all those who can protect themselves against such an increase in prices and ensure the maintenance of their own standards of living are going to endeavour to do so. Workers who happen to be in sheltered occupations, workers who are employed in monopolies, workers who are <Col N="445" /> in a position perhaps to bring the productive processes of the community to a standstill, naturally feel that they are in a strong position and will try to ensure that they, at any rate, will escape the calamity which is impending on the community in general.  That is how the position tended to develop even before the problem in regard to supplies became as grave as it is. When prices began to rise because the costs of imported raw materials for our industries had gone up, workers who were in a position to do so naturally asked, and, in many cases, obtained, substantial increases in their remuneration. In some industries, the increases amounted to as much as 9/-, 12/- and 13/- a week, and those who secured these increases, I think, would admit that they themselves were and are in a better position than the vast bulk of the community, most of whom were not in a position to protect themselves against these increases in industrial costs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I can.  In one or two companies which are either highly sheltered or enjoy a monopoly position, increases amounting to 12/- or 13/- a week were given.  The cement industry, for instance, is an industry in which very substantial increases in remuneration were given&mdash;an increase which, of course, was immediately reflected in the cost of cement, in turn reflected in the cost of housing, in turn, to be reflected in the rents paid by working-class people for such houses, and, to a greater extent perhaps, to be reflected in the rates to be paid in those urban communities which, in the face of rising costs, were endeavouring to complete their housing programmes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The shareholder in some industries may have secured increased profits.  In this particular industry, he did not, because the dividend paid by the cement company was reduced by 20 per cent. for the last financial year as compared with the previous financial year.  Again, there are other industries.  We have monopolies like the gas company, where very substantial increases in wages have already been secured, these, in turn, were reflected in an increase in the price of gas, resulting in an increase in the household expenses of the greater part of the working-class people of this city.  I could go through a whole gamut of industries, largely industries falling within the categories of public utilities, monopoly undertakings and sheltered occupations, in which increases have been secured.</P>
      <P>Increases have been secured by the workers who were able, by reason of the fact that they occupy key positions, to secure them, but these increases have been secured mainly at the expense of other workers, and of the other elements in this community who are not in that position, who are not in a position to bring economic pressure to bear on the community as a whole.  While we have had, at the one end of the scale, the increases to which I have referred, at the other end, we have industries in which the workers have secured nothing.  In addition, you have a very large element of this population dependent upon public money for the relief of their poverty to whom we were unable to give anything until this Budget, and in regard to whom, in so far as we have been able to provide relief at all, we have not been able to provide it out of normal taxation, but have had to borrow the money for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have not been able to provide it out of normal taxation because we felt that any further increases in what might be described as normal taxation, apart altogether from the taxation of what might be described as excess profits, that is, income-tax, or the usual fiscs, would have resulted in increased unemployment, and would only have added to the number who have to rely on the State, as I have <Col N="447" /> said, for the greater part of their maintenance.</P>
    <P>Deputy Norton, in the course of his remarks on this Budget last week, stated that, in his view, there were at least 111,000 persons unemployed in this country.  That was, like many of Deputy Norton&rsquo;s statements in regard to these matters, an overstatement. The number on the unemployment register at the moment, in fact, amounts, I think, to about 69,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>We have been hearing speeches about the difficulty of getting labour to work on the bogs.  The Employment Period Order affects, as the Deputy well knows, only the country areas, and we know that the one great difficulty we are facing in regard to the production of food and fuel is the shortage of labour in the country districts.  Accordingly, the Employment Period Order has been fully justified because these people would always have been working, irrespective of the Employment Period Order, but at least we have this advantage, that while they are at work and maintaining themselves, the State is not paying them on the assumption that they were not able to find employment and not able to maintain themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Norton referred to this matter, and I have been pointing out that his estimate fixing the number of unemployed persons at 111,000, was in fact an over-estimate. There are, however, 69,000 persons at present on the unemployment register. I am not admitting that all these 69,000 persons are employable; I am not admitting that all these 69,000 persons <Col N="448" /> are in actual need of employment; and I am not admitting that all these 69,000 persons actually want employment. There is a very large number of them in need of employment and who, perhaps for the first time in their lives, are at the moment out of jobs. But, at any rate, whether they are employable, whether they are unemployable, whether they are looking for work or shirking work, there are 69,000 persons unable at the moment normally to provide for themselves.  These 69,000 persons are only part of a much larger number, varying according to the time of the year from about 320,000 to about 360,000, who are dependent to some extent, and in many cases to a very great extent, upon public moneys for their maintenance.  They get those moneys in the form of widows&rsquo; and orphans&rsquo; pensions, old age pensions, home assistance, unemployment assistance, and unemployment benefit, and the total amount which they receive in any one year is about £7,000,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now those people, if the cost of living goes up, are unable, through exerting economic pressure of one sort or another on private employers, to ensure that their standard of living will rise with prices.  If prices are driven up by the action of a small section in the community, those prices are driven up at the expense of the very poorest elements of the community.  While we have increases of 9/-, 10/-, 12/- or 13/- a week given in some industries, in industries which are an important factor in influencing the trend of the cost of living, those increases are given, not at the expense in many cases of the employers, not at the expense of the shareholders, but at the expense of the consumer and, mainly, at the expense of the very poorest elements in the population.  It stands to reason that if, because of an increase in wages, the price of cloth goes up, the workman who has to pay more for his suit on the plea that the cost of living has gone up for the weaver, if he happens to be either a gas-worker or engaged, say, in the manufacture of boots and shoes, is going himself to look for an increase of wages so that he may indemnify himself against the increase in the cost of living which has been caused <Col N="449" /> by the fact that the price of cloth has gone up for him.  If, instead of dealing with clothing, boots and shoes, we try to deal with processed foodstuffs, then the position becomes very much more grave, because the reactions of an increase in the cost of such foodstuffs are much more drastic, much greater, and have a correspondingly more depressing effect upon the standard of living of the person who cannot protect himself against an increase in costs.</P>
    <P>When we examine what are the principal factors which go to make up the cost of living, we realise that food and clothing are the main elements in it.  An increase in the price of bread, an increase in the price of butter, an increase in the price of clothes, an increase in the price of boots&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>And flour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;an increase in the price of flour, an increase in any article of common consumption, has comparatively less reaction in the households of the well-to-do.  Their money is not mainly spent upon food and upon essential clothes; it is not mainly spent upon bread, upon sugar, upon tea, upon flour, or upon boots and clothes; it is spent on other things. It may be spent on education, on servants, on gardens; it may be spent in a dozen ways which give employment. In any event, the reaction of an increase in the costs of commodities in common consumption in the households of the well-to-do is very much less than it is in the households of the poorer people.  Therefore, when you have a sort of vicious circle in which wages go up in one industry, resulting in an increase in price which workers in other industries try to recompense themselves for, it is within that circle merely a case of the workers beggaring each other and getting nowhere. To the extent to which those who are in a better position to protect themselves against an increase in the cost of living do so at the expense of those who are not in as good a position, they do so mainly at the expense of those who, because they are in poor employment or not at work or are <Col N="450" /> otherwise dependent upon public funds, are not in a position to do anything to protect themselves.</P>
      <P>How are we to deal with this situation? We are faced, as I have said, with a future in which, for one reason or another, prices are going to rise; in which, for reasons completely outside the control of the Government, unemployment is going to increase.  Are we going to let the people who are fortunate enough to be in employment have the sole benefit of whatever pool of essential and irreplaceable materials the country still possesses?  Are we going to allow this struggle between workers to maintain their standard of living, ultimately at the expense of every other worker, to go on unchecked and uncontrolled? Or, are we going to say to the workers in a definite form: &ldquo;You will have to stand still for a moment until we get a grip of this situation, and until we see a way, as it develops, to do the best we possibly can for everybody&rdquo;?</P>

      <P>The Deputy can answer it by asking himself: What would happen to the worker if the employer were to be put in a position in which he could not employ his worker without losing money?  What would happen to the worker if the employer could not buy the raw materials to keep his workers in employment without losing money?  Is it not obvious that if you do not permit a man who is prepared to risk his capital, as he must do, in buying raw materials to charge a price which will not involve him in actual loss even on the cost of the raw materials&mdash;because that was the case which the Deputy put to me&mdash; then he will not buy them at all?  He will decide, if he has any capital which he can realise, to take it out of his business and try to put it somewhere else, he will close the doors of his factory and turn his workers out on the street.  I know, of course, that Deputy Davin and Deputy Norton want all this changed.  They want an end to this capitalist system.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I am like a lot of other people&mdash;that I learn as I grow older.  After all, you cannot make this world out of dreams.  In trying to solve our social problems, you have got to deal with human nature, and to realise that one of the incentives to effort in this world is that a man must get some reward for any enterprise which he may display.</P>
      <P>I was trying to deal with the question which the Deputy put to me: how is it that we will allow a manufacturer to compensate himself for the cost of his raw materials?  I was pointing out that, after all, we have got to do that because the manufacturer has to take a risk when he purchases his raw materials.  The thing does not begin or end with his taking that risk.  He has to get not only the materials, but he has to employ himself in seeing how they can be most effectively and efficiently used, and he has to get a certain reward for that service.  The worker, on the other hand, if he is in employment, does not take any risk.  I am talking now as a person who, as Deputy Norton knows, appreciates the worker&rsquo;s point of view as well as any other person. I am talking of the worker who has a safe job where the physical risks are not abnormal.  He is certain of getting his weekly money provided his employer does not go bankrupt.  Provided the employer does not make some business miscalculation, the worker is at any rate certain, perhaps unfortunately only for a limited period in present circumstances, of his employment from week to week.  I do not want to put it any further than that: that the worker is certain of getting some remuneration&mdash;the employer may not.  The question that we are now examining for ourselves is whether in a world in which for everybody, and most of all for the very poorest, conditions are worsening, the worker who is in secure employment should not be content to undergo some self-denial for the common good?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have in this stand-still order, because we found that there were some elements, not everybody <Col N="453" /> by any means, tending to break away from that, and were perhaps with some recollection of the history of prices and wages in the last war tending to be restive.  There were likewise some employers thinking that they could see a way of making additional profits out of increasing wages which in turn would be reflected in increased prices and profits.  We feel it essential, in view of the situation which the country is facing, to get a grip on that situation, and endeavour, without doing an injustice to anybody, to do all that we can do to keep down prices.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Sullivan when speaking to-day had a very pertinent argument. He said if you are going to control wages you must control prices also.  Now, there are some elements in the present cost of production that we cannot control.  For example, we cannot control fuel costs because we have to pay practically whatever is asked for whatever coal we can get.  In the case of the textile industry, we cannot control the price of imported cotton yarns.  If one goes through the industries of the country generally, he will find that there are different elements of cost which we cannot control. There is this one element of cost which we have tried to control, because it is within our control, and to the extent to which we allow it to get out of control we are creating a social evil&mdash; I want to emphasise this&mdash;which is going to be visited most heavily on our poor people.</P>
    <P>I would like to say in connection with this order, and to say it in all sincerity, that I think the great mass of the workers of this country have realised for themselves what I have said: they realise that in present circumstances it would be folly for them to try to make wages chase prices in the circumstances in which we find ourselves. It is quite true to say what was said by, I think, Deputy Keyes, Deputy Davin and others, that the workers are looking at the situation in a realistic way.  The making of this standstill order is no refusal on our part to recognise that fact.  But we are facing, at the moment a situation <Col N="454" /> the development of which we cannot foresee.  If we cannot get control of it now, it may be disastrous later. It may be in four or five months&rsquo; time that we shall reach the crisis of it. We do know that the pressure upon our people is becoming more intense. We know that the urge for workers to seek compensation for their present difficulties in higher wages is becoming stronger.  We know it, too, that there is a disposition and, mind you, it is a normal and a natural one, on the part of a good many employers to have regard only to the circumstances of their workers and say: &ldquo;Well, damn it all prices have gone up so high and wages have been stable so long that we have to give them something&rdquo;, but these employers are overlooking the reaction upon the whole cost of living of an accumulation of comparatively small increases.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>There are many employers who are quite prepared to deal with their workers on that basis. I am not saying they all are, but I think it is quite true to say, as has already been said here, that the country as a whole is visualising the situation in an understanding way. They have realised that we are all in a common difficulty, and there has been a desire to appreciate the other person&rsquo;s point of view.  I think that is true of some employers.  I am not giving a certificate to every employer, any more than I am giving a certificate to every worker.  I am not saying that every worker has looked at this situation in a public spirited way, nor am I saying that every employer has done so, but I am saying that there has been a disposition to approach the problem in that fashion.  There have been employers who, as I have said, have linked their wages to the cost-of-living scale, and have given increases to their workers more or less automatically, without having regard to the general situation which they were building up, the dangerous, inflationary situation, in which &mdash; again I must say it, because it cannot be repeated too often&mdash;the very poorest <Col N="455" /> elements in our population would suffer most.</P>
      <P>We may say what we like about the conditions of the workers in the towns, the conditions of those who are employed in industry, but we have throughout the country a very large section of our people who do not secure anything like the remuneration which is secured in industry, and those workers are at the moment a highly essential element in our whole economy.  If those agricultural workers, and those whom we are wanting to produce fuel&mdash;and we have heard a great deal about the price of fuel and the price of foodstuffs recently&mdash;see that workers in industrial employment are securing full compensation for all the increase in the cost of living, while their own remuneration remains comparatively stable, naturally they may either refuse to produce, or, if they are going to produce at all, will command the top of the market for their labour.  They will say that they should be compensated equally with everybody else for the increased cost of living.</P>

In other industries the workers were not able to get increases at all, because the circumstances would not permit of increases being given.  But, for those workers who got no increases, the cost of living had been driven up by the workers who had got the increases.</P>

      <P>Remember, we are not taking anything off the workers. We are simply saying that there is at the moment a standstill.  Under the Excess Profits Tax, as Deputy McGilligan told the House a short time ago, we are going back and collecting a very large proportion of the profits over and above a certain standard which have been made since September, 1939.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think that is letting anybody get away with anything.  Because I am talking about what we are going to do in relation to excess profits, or profits over a certain standard, I do not want anybody to assume for a moment that there is not a great deal to be said pro and con that proposal, because remember that, so long as our social organisation here is based on the principle of private enterprise, it is very difficult to say to what extent, first of all, when you are taking profits in excess of a certain standard, you are <Col N="457" /> penalising legitimate enterprise, and to what extent you may be in fact imposing a capital levy on business.  Those profits represent a difference in many cases between the purchase price of certain materials at one general price level and the selling price of them at another&mdash;they always do; that is the basis of the calculation&mdash;but when the reverse cycle sets in, and prices begin to fall, and raw materials bought at one level of prices have to be sold at a lower level of prices, you may find that this element which has been described as an excess profits tax has, in fact, been a capital levy.  That is what happened after the last war, and that was one of the great causes of the difficulties with which British enterprises were faced after the last war.</P>
    <P>Let us leave that for the moment, and let us see how we are treating profits which are made in excess of a certain standard.  I suppose we have to concede that the profit element is vital to business; it is vital to enterprise, and it is vital to our whole productive economy as we know it now.  The farmer will not produce food unless he is certain he is going to make a profit. A man will not cut turf unless he is certain there will be a profit on his labour.  A man will not weave cloth unless there is to be a profit on it. No man will put a penny into any business, or engage in any business, unless he is certain of being recouped first of all for the expense in which he is involved when he goes into the business, and for the labour he will have to put into the business.  Unless a man can see that, at the end of a series of transactions, he is going to be fully indemnified for all those things&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I was dealing with this element of profit, and was trying to point out that, after all, the profit factor is an essential element in our whole productive economy as at present constituted.  In regard to it we are, first of all, saying this&mdash; and we are dealing mainly with limited liability companies&mdash;that no limited liability company, which has made profits prior to the date of the making of this order, will be allowed to distribute its profits at a greater rate than it has hitherto done subject to satisfying the Prices Commission.  It can make all the profits it is able to but, so far as the actual disbursement of these profits is concerned, disbursements to its shareholders or directors or any other persons in the concern, whether manager, director, secretary, clerical worker, foreman or operator in the concern, no person is going to get out of that concern, no matter in what capacity he may be associated with it, anything more than he was getting at the date on which this order was made. It may be that many concerns will make profits which would permit them to pay increased dividends to the shareholders, bonuses to the directors or increased remuneration to the directors and increased bonuses to their higher staffs.  If they do make those profits, they will not be allowed to increase dividends or increase the remuneration paid to any employees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The excess over and above what they were giving out at the date of the order will be dealt with by the Minister for Finance.  He proceeds to deal with it in this way, by taking for the purposes of the State and the people 75 per cent. of any profit in excess of the profit made prior to 1st September, 1939.  In the case of <Col N="459" /> companies which have not made profits up to this, now enterprises which have been started, we realise that we&mdash;and when I say &ldquo;we&rdquo; I mean this House and the community&mdash;encouraged men to invest their capital in these new enterprises and that accordingly they are entitled to get what would be regarded as the standard remuneration upon such investments in the case of well-established companies in which the speculative element was not large. We have said, therefore, that, so far as the new industries are concerned, they will be allowed to pay a dividend at a standard rate of 6 per cent. and they will be allowed to average that back over the years during which they were established.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is aware that the ordinary shareholders of railway companies have not been paid a dividend for 12 years.  Will they be allowed to go back 12 years, while the wages of the workers will stand still?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I would say &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;, but I would also say that it would be a happy day for the railway workers&mdash; the day upon which the Irish railways began to resume the payment of dividends. Their jobs would be much more secure.  The railways would be able to get more capital and reorganise their concerns, and the workers would be looking to a happy future.  While I do not think the happy position the Deputy has suggested will come about, nevertheless, it is well for us to know that if it did it would not be detrimental to the workers&rsquo; interests.  In the case of the newer concerns, which hitherto have not paid a dividend, we are permitting them to average out on the basis of the dividends which would be earned by an undertaking which was well established and which was not too speculative.  If there is any criticism of that position, it is this, that it has not sufficiently taken into account the position of the new concerns, the risks they undertook, and the encouragement and incitements used to get them to embark on the enterprises. If we were to treat them worse than is proposed we should be treating them shabbily.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="460" /> As regards the profits in excess of the standard profits, the Minister proposes to take 75 per cent., and again there is a great deal to be said for and against that attitude.  I do not want to put the case any further than I think desirable.  What is going to happen to the other 25 per cent.?  It will be put to reserve; it will have to be utilised to build up a reserve which we hope will enable these companies to tide over the very difficult period of reconstruction which is going to follow this war.  The main thing is this, that whether the Minister for Finance takes 75 per cent. of the profits in excess of the standard profits, or whether the 25 per cent. is being put to reserve, the proprietors of these concerns, their shareholders and their managements, do not participate even to the extent of one penny piece in any profits in excess of the pre-1939 profits which the company may have earned.</P>
    <P>Therefore, in regard to this very important element in the community, an element upon which, as our industry is at present organised, all the wage-earners in Irish industry depend, they are in exactly the same position as their employees&mdash;they are being made stand still.  Take the persons dependent upon dividends for a living. There are very many highly respectable and highly reputable persons who have no other way of living except on dividends. They are not, perhaps, in a position to earn for themselves.  All those people in whose incomes dividends are an important part, are in exactly the same position as all the workers; they are being made stand still, and their total incomes in many cases may not be as great as the incomes of many workers employed in the concerns in which their money is involved.</P>
    <P>There is another point upon which I should like to say a few words.  It is the aspect of the Budget which was referred to by Deputy Dillon and also, though not in exactly the same measured and sympathetic terms, by Deputy Hickey and Deputy Hurley; that is, the provision which we are making to supplement the allowances given under the Unemployment Assistance <Col N="461" /> Act, the Widows&rsquo; and Orphans&rsquo; Pensions Act, and the Old Age Pension Acts.  The form in which that supplement is being given is a novel one. Instead of giving people what Deputy Hickey has often described as money tickets, we are giving them vouchers, tickets, notes, which will be payable in food.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, that is not a question we have come to, but I do not think it is of sufficient importance to worry about.  Now, I do not want this position to be misrepresented.  Remember what I am saying: that this is a supplement to the existing cash allowances. Remember, again, that the system is experimental, that its extension depends upon our ability to devise machinery, but that we are taking a long view of the situation and looking ahead to the time when it may be very difficult for people with very little money to secure a share of essential foodstuffs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="462" /> We are introducing this as an experimental measure.  Now, the advantages are these.  First of all, it means that it does not matter what happens to our currency; whether it depreciates, as some people think it may, or not, the persons who get these food vouchers will be assured of getting at least that supplementary supply of essential foodstuffs, and furthermore, they will be assured that so far as milk, at any rate, is concerned, it will be good quality milk.  So far as butter is concerned, I think the same will apply and that it will be prime creamery butter, and we may be able to make the same arrangements with regard to bread.  It does mean, however, that people will be in the position of having an assured food ration in the poorest homes in this country.  We are dealing with one section, the poorest section, of the people first.  This is experimental.  We hope it will work; we think it will work and we see no reason why it should not work.  It does not interfere with the right of the individuals who get this supplementary allowance, if they wish, to utilise their cash to get more butter, milk or bread.  The only thing is that until some other system is devised they would have to take their chance on the market with everybody else when getting these things for cash, but so far as the voucher is concerned they will have a definite amount assured to them on this food ration.</P>

      <P>I think the Deputy heard me saying very emphatically that one of the things we hoped to do was to get a machine which would enable us to provide for that.  Deputy Dillon suggested that there were one or two considerations which ought to be examined in regard to the introduction of this system.  He said that, first of all, it was perhaps not a good thing that when a man was suffering under the adversity of unemployment we should require him to go down to a grocer and identify himself as a recipient of charity.  Well, of course, that would be very regrettable if, in fact, as a rule, the person in receipt of unemployment assistance were not known already to the grocer and to his neighbours to be a person out of work. In the case of a city like Dublin, where you have many people living in one neighbourhood who all deal in the one class of shop, their position is fairly well known to the person who has to give them credit occasionally.  We may try, however, to ensure that so far as milk, perhaps, is concerned, there will be no question of a man presenting himself to a shop.  I am not sure if we can do that in regard to bread, but we are bearing in mind what Deputy Dillon suggested and trying to get a machine which at least will not expose any person in receipt of this to any indignity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, we have a fairly well-established milk distribution scheme all over the country and we are trying to arrange for the distribution of the milk through that medium.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>How will you arrange for the voucher?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that is just a mechanical thing that we can easily tackle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We know, of course, also, that a system of this sort is open to fraud, that a man may get the voucher and then sell it, but then, again, he may <Col N="464" /> get the cash and not use it for the purpose for which it was given to him. We think that on the whole, in view of the fact that these vouchers are for essential foodstuffs, there will not be so much tendency to frand.  One of the difficulties in regard to the meat scheme, I think, was that a very large ration was given, much more than most poor people were accustomed to, and it had to be cooked.  These foods, however, are easy to deal with and they do not have to be prepared for consumption except in a most rudimentary way.  If a man should sell his vouchers or deal with them wrongly, if he is inconsiderate enough to deal in that way with his family, there is nothing we can do to prevent it, but in general we feel that whatever he may do in the case of cash he will bring these vouchers home to his wife and let her dispose of them.  We feel that that would be the position even in the case of the most degraded man, and in that regard the great majority of the married people who draw unemployment assistance are decent men and women who will try to do the best they can, within their means, for their families.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon raised the point that the foods which we are giving by way of supplement to the unemployment assistance would simply be taken to replace corresponding quantities of such food stuffs which are already being paid for out of unemployment assistance money.  That may happen, but there is no way out of it, and if the unemployment assistance cash is used to buy other things of which a mother thinks her household is in greater need, I do not think there is any way by which we could control it, and provided that the money is not spent foolishly, I do not think that any great harm would be done.</P>
    <P>There is a final matter to which I should like to draw attention. It is the case made by Deputy Dillon to the effect that in this country we should deliberately subsidise potatoes, milk, coal and sugar in the urban centres and make no bones about it.  In Great Britain they have subsidised bread and flour, milk, cheese, meat and <Col N="465" /> bacon.  If it were possible to introduce a system of foodstuff subsidies in this country, first of all I do not think we would be able to deal with potatoes, oatmeal or coal.  What we should probably have to concentrate on would be bread and flour, butter, milk, fresh meat and bacon, and in regard to some of these I can say at once that, judging by our previous experience of it, the difficulties of administration and so on, we can rule out fresh meat as one of the articles or commodities the consumption of which could be subsidised in this country.</P>
    <P>These are merely preliminaries because I want to get at the practical fact of this proposal.  In Britain, it is true that they are subsidising foodstuffs, and that the food subsidies have cost them perhaps about £100,000,000 a year, but, as against that, since the war started, the increased taxes on sugar and tea have very largely offset the food subsidies given. The position is that, notwithstanding the fact that Great Britain has heavily subsidised certain foodstuffs, the cost of living in Great Britain has risen by almost exactly the same as it has risen here.  There is not a point of difference in the increase in the two countries.  Notwithstanding the fact that Great Britain has subsidised her food consumption to the extent of about £100,000,000 a year, the costs of foodstuffs in both countries have moved up almost step by step.  That is, I think, proof of the contention made that the subsidies in Great Britain have, in fact, only compensated for the increased prices due to certain food taxes.</P>
    <P>We have considered this question very carefully, and we find that a subsidy of 1d. per 2-lb. loaf, with a concomitant subsidy of 9d. per stone of flour, 2d. per lb. of fresh meat, 2d. per lb. of bacon, 2d. per lb. of butter and 2d. per quart of milk would cost the State about £5,500,000, and would result in a fall in the cost-of-living index number of only 13 points, or about 6 per cent.  It is clear from the cost of the subsidy and the comparatively trivial effect it would have on the cost of living that <Col N="466" /> in this country it is something very difficult to undertake and something the results of which, I think, would scarcely be commensurate with the expenditure involved.  The figures I have given for the cost of the subsidy go to substantiate the point I made at the beginning of my speech in relation to the standstill order, that an increase in industrial costs in this country has much more serious reactions on the cost-of-living figure than an increase in the price of foodstuffs.</P>
    <P>I think I have kept the House too long and I should like just to repeat that we regard the standstill order as very regrettable.  It is only part of a general policy to try to keep a grip of a situation which may develop with extreme rapidity until it becomes extremely dangerous.  As I have pointed out, it is not confined to any particular class of the community. Everybody who draws remuneration in any form in certain industries, whether he is a bank director or an operative, is put on exactly the same plane.</P>

      <P>They are told that they will not be allowed to get any increased remuneration.  The shareholders in any such companies are put in the same position and a great many people in this country who are engaged in industry are put in rather a worse position, because they are being asked to surrender some part of the remuneration which they think they have justly earned.  We take the view that, in the present emergency, in view of the needs of the State and the community, those people who have made these profits, who would say, if you challenged them, that these profits are due to their foresight, their enterprise and their concern&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>And to the workers who helped to create them, but mainly to the fact that these men put themselves into a situation in which they could earn these profits.  That is what they would say.  We say that, in view of the national need, they must surrender a very large part of them, and that so far as the remainder of their share of these profits is concerned, it must be put aside for a rainy day, with the view that, when the post-war reconstruction period comes, these profits will not have been spent, will not have been squandered, but will be there to help these manufacturers and employers to reorganise their businesses and maintain their workers in employment, and to avoid the disastrous catastrophies which characterised the post-war slump of 1920.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Hannigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it is possible at this stage of the debate to say anything that has not been said, and very well said, but, in my opinion, severe though this Budget is, it is very much less severe than was generally anticipated and, in my considered opinion, it is being well received in the City of Dublin and throughout the country generally.  I do not propose to go into many aspects of the Budget, but there is one point to which I should like to refer.  If there is one depressing fact which clearly emerges from the Budget, it is that poverty and distress are prevalent throughout the country and the Minister has expressed his appreciation of the fact that poverty and distress are most keenly felt in populous areas in places like the City of Dublin by introducing the voucher system, whereby certain classes of people will be provided with the basic necessaries, such as milk, bread and butter.  I am not enamoured of the voucher system because I know that it is a system which can be very much abused and that the recipients of these vouchers, whom the Government are most anxious to help, can be made the <Col N="468" /> victims of exploitation of a very mean type.  I say, therefore, that it would have been a much better thing if monetary allowances had been granted, allowances which would provide these people with an opportunity of getting these necessaries by paying their cash over the counter of whatever shop they chose to go into.</P>
      <P>The real point I want to come to is that I think this would have been the most opportune time for the Minister to introduce a system of family allowances, for which there is a crying need. I know that Deputy Dillon has championed this system for a considerable time.  The Minister should bear in mind that this system is no longer in the experimental stage, that it has been tried out in other countries where it has had remarkable success and that there is a particular need for it here at present.  It would undoubtedly involve considerable expense, but it would, at the same time, I think, eliminate a good deal of expenditure under the heading of home assistance and the various other types of assistance given by local authorities and by the central authority.  It is a system for which, as I say, there is a crying need and a system which, sooner or later, will have to be introduced here.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Finance and the Government are well aware of the difficulties with regard to the present Budget.  The Minister himself indicated that he has not been able to balance the Budget in an orthodox fashion.  But that is not only the experience of the Government; it is the experience of a good many families throughout the country in connection with their budget; one thing is in some way related to the other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In his Budget statement the Minister, when signifying his intention with regard to the corporation profits tax, in a rather sudden way tried to show that there was no profiteering in the country.  That was the impression that his remarks were calculated to give. It would have been very much better for the Minister to have spoken outright and to have said, what he knows to be true, that profiteering is being carried on; that no opportunity is <Col N="469" /> being missed, in connection with commodities of which there is an acute shortage, of profiteering and exploiting the situation to the utmost extent. When I say that, I do not mean that the business community as a whole are profiteers.  Even a few people can do a lot of damage and reap big profits. I hope the Minister when replying will refer to that aspect of the situation.</P>
    <P>I gather from the members of the Labour Party that the new order in relation to the stabilisation of the wages of the workers generally is causing very great concern.  I would appeal to the members of the Labour Party to bear in mind the fact that we are living in times of great difficulty.</P>

What you do not know and ought to know is that for some time to come the business of the Government will be to try to protect the worst off section of the community &mdash;the unemployed and the people in receipt of pensions, such as blind pensions and various other types of pensions.</P>
      <P>No indication has so far been given as to how the £200,000 mentioned in the Budget statement to help local authorities in the distribution of home assistance is to be distributed.  I should like to know how this sum will be allocated, and I sincerely hope that the City of Dublin will come in for its just share.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TimothyJMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>The speech of the Minister for Industry and Commerce was very sad in many ways, because it is very pathetic to see an ex-revolutionary turn completely Tory.  That certainly is the interpretation that most people will put on the speech we heard this evening from the Minister.  In spite of the Minister&rsquo;s rather skilful method of debating this question, it is clear that the policy of the Government is that wages must stand still, but that prices may go marching on.  That is the position to-day.  The Minister would remove a good deal of the feeling which this wages order has aroused if he even now gave any indication of the fact that <Col N="470" /> there is a firm conviction held by the Government in favour of prices control. There is no evidence of that so far.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce talked about the rights of certain interests.  Members of local authorities know that, time and again, during the last 12 months, contractors who entered into a definite contract for the supply of certain commodities had invoked the aid of certain Government Departments, with the result that local authorities were advised in many cases to pay a price over and above what had been contracted for to manufacturers and merchants for goods supplied, because of increased costs and charges arising out of the war situation. But, no matter who may get an increase, or who may get something additional because of the difficulties of the present situation, the Minister&rsquo;s face is as sternly set against any increase for the working people as was the face of his colleague when he made his Budget statement 12 months ago.</P>
      <P>In my opinion, the use of the Emergency Powers Act for the purpose of enforcing this order is a flagrant breach of trust with the members of the House.  At the outbreak of war Ministers came here and asked for certain measures to be used during the emergency for the defence and protection of the people.  The powers then given to the Government are now being used to keep down the wages of our working people, to prevent them using the right that workers have won, not only in this country but in many other countries, after years of agitation, suffering and imprisonment&mdash;the right to withdraw their labour and to utilise the power of their organisations to protect themselves.  All those rights have been withdrawn from them, not by an Act of Parliament passed by the representatives of the people, but by an order made under this Emergency Powers Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest that, in these circumstances, that Act was obtained from the House under false pretences.  It is, as I have said, a breach of trust with the people&rsquo;s representatives as well as with large sections of the community. <Col N="471" /> It is certainly a very poor return to the workers&rsquo; organisations which recently made what the Minister described as an extremely generous gesture when they offered considerable sums of money, free of interest, to the State for the purpose of assisting in this emergency.  It is not, of course, the first time in the history of this country in which the workers have been treated in this way.  When I contrast the speeches made by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, when he sat on the Opposition Benches, with the speech that he made here this evening, I can see how far he has removed himself from all contact with the workers, and how he has imbibed the philosophy and the doctrines of the more favoured interests.</P>
    <P>With regard to the scheme for giving additional allowances to that large and deserving section of our people, the aged, the widows and orphans and those in receipt of unemployment assistance, I must say that the method that is being employed is entirely degrading.  It reflects on those people in this way, that they would not be competent to handle a cash allowance. It is also a reflection on their method of housekeeping.  Surely, they know far better how to do their housekeeping than any State Department. Not alone ought these allowances be given in cash, but they ought to be made effective throughout the country, and not be confined to any particular area.</P>
    <P>As I said at the beginning, the Government are not showing any disposition to control prices or any desire to give the working people and their families some opportunity of existing on their present wages.  That fact emerged quite clearly to-day when it was ascertained, by means of a Parliamentary Question put down by Deputy Norton, that while there had been a considerable number of cases of overcharging, only four prosecutions have been instituted.  The Government are utilising their powers under the Emergency Powers Act to penalise, victimise and harass the working people who are suffering so much at <Col N="472" /> the present time because of the in crease in prices.  Deputy Hannigan asked the working people to remember that they are facing a crisis.  They know it quite well, because they have everyday experience of it.  They have evidence of it in their own homes, and they feel there how the crisis is affecting them.  The Government, by making this wages standstill order are, as I have said, depriving the workers of their hardly-won rights and their trade unions of the right to protect them.  I am not one who ever advocated extreme trade union action.  I have no particular affection for the strike weapon.  But I want to suggest to the Government that they are acting unfairly in depriving workers of the rights that they have secured through their trade unions.  They are penalising them.  I suggest that the powers under which this standstill order is going to be enforced were obtained by a trick.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. Everett Mr. Everett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>On previous occasions the Minister referred to what he called the moderate men of the Labour Party. I want to warn him of the road he is travelling to-day.  We assert that the Minister is abusing the powers which he received under the Emergency Powers Act.  When that measure was going through some of us were brought to book by the Taoiseach.  I remember I said that, as far as I was concerned, I would be slow to give a Labour Party the powers the Government were then seeking.  I see now that I was not far wrong in that view, seeing the way the Government propose to use the powers then obtained.  This standstill order is to be enforced not only against the men in the cities, but against the men in the rural areas who have very small wages.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce, in a reference to the Trade Union Bill, said that the men in the cities were all right with their high wages, but that he was concerned principally with the poor, and especially with that large section of the community living in the rural areas.  In the Budget, however, we find no consideration for the men in the rural areas.  They are to be penalised under this order.  I am surprised that the <Col N="473" /> Minister for Finance should do that because he knows the country well.  In the old days he used to travel through the country on his bicycle.  He must realise that there is a great amount of poverty in the rural areas at the present time, just as much, unfortunately, as there is in the cities and towns.</P>
      <P>I can give one instance in my own constituency.  In the famous Avoca there are over 100 men unemployed. There is no county council work there. There are 70 of those men, I believe, in the Local Security Force, and they came on a deputation to see if they could get work on turf-cutting 14 miles from their area.  There is no possible chance of getting them work.  Notwithstanding that, the Minister has, by an Employment Period Order, cut those men off from receiving any assistance other than home assistance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there no work to be got at turf-cutting?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. Everett Mr. Everett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>Not in Avoca.  There is no turf bank available there; the nearest one is in Glenmalure.  Those men are asked to pay 4d. extra per ounce on their twist tobacco.  They are asked to pay extra for their matches. While they are being asked to pay extra taxation out of their miserable home assistance, those men in the rural areas are refused any consideration other than the privilege of paying for other people&rsquo;s luxuries.  I think the Minister has got the wrong impression from the Minister for Industry and Commerce or from the officials in his Department as to the condition of affairs which exists at the present time in the rural areas.  Speaking for County Wicklow, I am satisfied that in a large number of the rural areas very few men have been employed owing to the distance from the turf-cutting centres.  Very few men are employed by the small farmers.  Owing to the foot-and-mouth disease those farmers are unable to sell their own produce, and are unable to employ any labour. There is very little work on the roads. Men are being brought from the urban areas a distance of 14 or 15 <Col N="474" /> miles to work on the turf banks, while large numbers of men in close proximity to the turf banks are unemployed and looking for home assistance. I would make a special appeal to the Minister to reconsider his decision in connection with the treatment of unemployed persons in the rural areas.  I could send him shoals of letters from the poor people who are in receipt of home assistance in the rural areas, telling of the plight they are in, unable to get the bare necessaries of life out of the miserable pittance they receive in the form of home assistance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are told that there is a greater amount of food in the rural areas. That may be true to a certain extent, but if we take the price of foodstuffs in the shops we will find that the figure charged in the small villages is much higher than that charged for the same article in the towns, on account of the cost of carriage and so on.  The cost of living in the rural areas is, in some cases, higher than it is in the urban areas.  If a man in the urban areas is entitled to those concessions, surely a man in the rural areas is also entitled to some consideration.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce has told us that they are the backbone of the country, but all the consideration he gives them is to allow them to depend on the charity of the public boards.  I do agree with what other Deputies have said with regard to the vouchers.  I have been connected with an organisation which has handed out thousands of vouchers, and I know the feelings of the decent poor people who come in at night and make an appeal to be given cash, so that they would not have to go into a shop with the vouchers and admit that they were receiving charity.  Will the Minister give the vouchers through the post offices, or through the labour exchanges or the relieving officers?  He does not state who will deliver the vouchers.  I do not see what difference it would make to the Department to give the extra relief in the form of cash, and it would certainly give the people a little more independence.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce said that it is impossible to have a watertight <Col N="475" /> scheme.  Certain things may happen in connection with the voucher system; I know it is impossible to have it perfect, but I do suggest to the Minister that if he gets in touch with people in various charitable organisations who have had experience of this matter he will find that they are not in favour of vouchers being given.  Why should a poor woman who has lost her breadwinner have to go to a certain shop which may have butter and bread but no milk?  Why not give her the money and let her get the milk from her ordinary supplier?</P>
    <P>On the question of the Trade Union Bill and the standstill order, I believe the trade union movement are to take that matter in hands, and I suppose their decision will affect the country generally.  Pending their decision, it is not for me to make statements as to what may happen.  I was chastised by the Minister here on a previous occasion for pointing out to him the non-recognition of the workers in the rural areas.  I am prepared to be chastised by the Minister again when I point out that his Government has not done justice to the men in the country areas.  In the areas which I have mentioned there is a huge number of unemployed, and there is no work available through public bodies or otherwise. If it could be shown that in any particular area there is plenty of work available, then I would certainly agree that no assistance should be given. But the Employment Period Order applies generally, whether work is available or not.  We could give returns to the Minister for Industry and Commerce of the large numbers of men in certain parts of the County Wicklow who are available for work, and there is no work for them, other than the few men who are employed by the public boards.  The Minister must realise that there are very few extra men employed on the land.  Owing to tractors and other things, only about 100 extra men would be employed on the increased tillage in the whole county.</P>
    <P>On the question of profiteering, I made an appeal to the Minister on a previous occasion; surely the local committees <Col N="476" /> and parish councils could deal with that question without any extra cost.  I will quote for him one case I know where the timber merchants are purchasing timber from the Government at 12/6 per ton and charging the poor people 1/11 per cwt.  The Government is giving them cheap timber at 12/6 per ton, and that is the price at which they are selling it.  If you had your local committee there, they would draw public attention to that fact, without the assistance of any inspectors or anyone else.  They would regulate the cost of transport and so on, and allow the merchant a reasonable profit, instead of the profit which he is getting at the present time.  That is happening wholesale all over the country, and the people cannot come out and complain to the Guards or anyone else or they will find difficulty in getting their supplies of materials.  There was one case which was reported to the Minister for Supplies where a large wholesaler refused to give a certain small shopkeeper supplies of tea and sugar. The Department took the matter up with the wholesaler, who attempted to deny that the person ever received the amount of tea and sugar which was alleged, and she had to produce her receipts.  If a person who is entitled to them finds such difficulty in getting supplies from a shopkeeper, what is the position of the average poor person? I think that in order to avoid trouble the Government should authorised parish committees or some local authority to appoint a price control committee which will have full control over all these matters.  If that is done the Minister will have less trouble and the Government will have the cooperation of all parties in their efforts to prevent profiteering.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the Minister should give serious consideration to the various matters to which I have drawn his attention.  There are few of us who do not realise the serious position in which the country is placed.  So far as the people are concerned, no matter on what side they have been in the past, we may be sure that if there is any crisis to be faced we will have the <Col N="477" /> people ready and determined.  We are not one bit afraid of meeting whatever situation may arise.  At the same time we are not going to be prevented from criticising the Government in relation to matters of policy, and we consider it our duty to point out to them whatever defects come under our observation.</P>
    <P>It is all very well for the Government to argue that a state of emergency exists, but that does not justify them in filching from the people the rights that they possess.  I submit that the Government should not allow the road workers to receive such a low rate of wages as 30/- a week at a time when the cost of life&rsquo;s necessaries is increasing so rapidly.  Just consider the position of the man who labours in the bog.  Although you charge £2 or £2 5s. a ton for turf, it costs only 12/6 to raise it to the bank.  Where does the profit go?  It does not go to the poor man who works so hard in the bog.</P>
    <P>The Minister should make some concession in the areas where these men are engaged on turf production.  They have not been granted any concession. I can cite the case of a man with a wife and eight children.  He has to travel by lorry a distance of 12 miles from an urban area to cut the turf.  He has to have his breakfast along with his family at 6.30 in the morning and he has to take with him to the turf bank the food that could well be used by the wife and children at home.  His income is hardly sufficient to maintain himself and his family.  These are hard facts, and the Minister might well consider them.</P>
    <P>Why not put a tax on whiskey or wine or cigarettes and take it off the poor man&rsquo;s tobacco?  Tobacco is the luxury of the poor man.  A tax on tobacco hits the worker much more than it will hit a wealthy man or a T.D.  Twist tobacco is what is chiefly used by the poor man.  He cannot go to pictures or take part in other amusements, and tobacco is the only pleasure he indulges in.  If the Minister wants to raise the money let him put a tax on whiskey or wine and, if necessary, pictures and dances and <Col N="478" /> similar forms of amusement.  He should not put any tax on bicycles, as was suggested by Deputy Bennett, because the bicycle is the poor man&rsquo;s motor car.  Instead of raising money on tobacco the Minister should try to get it from other sources.</P>
    <P>He should try to put a stop to the profiteering that is rampant, and in this connection he would be well advised to give some authority to local public representatives.  That will have a steadying effect.  We do not wish to say anything that might cause unpleasantness, but we cannot overlook the men who have to exist on meagre allowances, who have not constant employment and upon whom wives and families depend.  Where you have a large section of men in that position they have little hope in Parliamentary institutions.  It is immaterial to them what Government or what Party is in power, because they realise that they will be the last to be considered.  I should like the Minister more especially to consider sympathetically those who are trying to exist in the rural areas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The longer I sit here, the more it occurs to me that we must consider, in relation to the operation of government in the future, some sort of plan with which to face an entirely different life that is almost inevitable for the remainder of this war, and also for the period after the war.  It is a remarkable fact that, even in Great Britain, while she is fighting for her very life-blood, and facing daily greater and greater destruction of her assets, there are a great number of civil servants, a great number of experts, and at least two Ministers who, assuming that victory will come to them, are planning for the future, are planning for a better world, and are planning to obviate some of the defects which affected English democracy before the war started, and which led them into some of the difficulties which they are now encountering.  I have no doubt there are also Governments in other countries that are planning likewise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not in any sense criticising this Government for not having yet considered doing so, because, God knows. <Col N="479" /> we have had to face so many new positions, so much new adversity, since the war began, that we hardly have had time to think of the future.  I submit that the Minister and all Parties in the House should consider that, in a state of peace, without being actually at war, we have the time and the men and the opportunity to form some kind of a planning committee, and to examine the future of this country from two aspects.  We could assume, for instance, that we have to face two situations, a situation in which international trade very largely breaks down for a considerable period, and a situation in which, no matter who is the victor, the reign of economic nationalism is more or less at an end, and the victor, whether by dictation or free agreement, decides that the world has to start trading on a far more extensive basis, and, therefore, nations which do not wish to be completely stagnant will have to consider how far they will fit themselves into that international system.</P>
    <P>This planning committee might be divided into two sections, those who consider a position amounting almost to disaster and chaos, and those who consider the possibility of an entirely new world.  I am absolutely convinced that if, at the end of this crisis, we live in the same groove as we have lived in for the last 20 years, not only will we suffer more severely than we need do, but we shall be unable to grapple with the problems of the future.</P>
    <P>I think that in considering this Budget and in considering the way in which we spend our money we ought to reflect on what has taken place in the past.  I would describe this country as a country that has succeeded very well, allowing for all the difficulties which faced us since we became independent, but on the other hand we must recognise that in comparison with some of the small democracies which have had greater liberties and a longer period of self-government than we have had, there are very unsatisfactory features in our method of facing production problems in this country, and now that we are faced <Col N="480" /> with a really serious period of crisis it is just as well that the people of this country should be confronted with some of the failings and deficiencies of both Administrations in this country since we regained our independence.</P>
    <P>The first and most obvious thing&mdash; I have said it often before and I am going to continue repeating it, Sir, until as many people as possible come to appreciate it&mdash;is that since we have had our independence there has been very little total change in either the total national income of the people of this country or in our national production, and that we started this war with our principal capital assets, namely, our cattle population and our agricultural industry, in a not very much better position&mdash;there was improvement to a certain degree, but not very much&mdash;than they were in at the end of the last war.  We carried out some very valuable industrial development and some very valuable modifications in our agricultural development, so far as their utility in this war is concerned, but unfortunately the national struggle which we have had did not result in that industrial development adding to the total national income of the country because what we gained through industrial development was lost, so far as our agricultural industry was concerned, as a result of the economic war.  There were many difficulties, but we have to face the fact that there has been a considerable stagnancy in our whole productive life.</P>
    <P>Again, just as in other countries, we have had controversies on free trade and protection, and controversies on the productive value of private initiative or private enterprise as against social services developed by the State, and all these controversies eventually proved to be as futile in this country as they have proved to be in other countries, as evidently there was immense value in both conceptions just as there were immense reactions to be encountered from both conceptions.  I think it is as well, however, for the people of this country to realise that <Col N="481" /> we have been especially blessed during the past years with easy but artificial conditions which may have disappeared at the end of this war and which have already gone to some extent.</P>
    <P>The fact is that we were existing in a false economic paradise.  For example, there was no competition, or practically none, in respect of 40 per cent. of our exports.  Our neighbour required store cattle for her own agriculture, and she took them.  That was one advantage we had.  We also had the advantage of absolutely free emigration to either one Continent or another, thus enabling us to get rid of labour which was surplus or which was badly paid in a number of fields, without making any effort ourselves to deal with the situation.  We had the advantage of what is, I suppose, one of the largest volumes of savings of external dividends, coming in year after year, of any civilised country in the world, thus enabling us to rapidly increase, for example, our State expenditure and enabling us to finance a great period of housing development, to buy freely in every country on earth, which placed us in a far more advantageous position than that in which most countries are placed because, in order to buy something from another country they have, first of all, to have something to sell.</P>
    <P>At the same time, we had a comparatively slow growth, so far as production was concerned in the competition which we face outside this country as compared with many other countries. That competition has become fierce in the case of many of our products because there has been too much production on far too low a basis, but we are better off than in England, where they are faced with an overwhelming change in fashions and so on.  At the same time we had the additional advantage, except during the four years of the economic war, of that preferential principle involved in the general Ottawa principle, which enabled us to export to our nearest neighbour commodities with either no tariffs or very low tariffs on them, and also to impose tariffs, of a very considerable order, on <Col N="482" /> goods coming in here, for the benefit of our own industries.</P>
    <P>In spite of all that I have mentioned, we may as well face the fact that we have not saved very much during the 20 years of home Administration so far as the future is concerned.  We have not placed ourselves in the position of being able to compete at the end of this war on a 100 per cent. basis with other countries so far as our agricultural exports to Great Britain are concerned. We have not conserved the fertility of our soil which, probably, has been declining ever since the end of the last war, and neither this Administration nor the former one took adequate steps, or asked people to make even temporary sacrifices, to restore the fertility of our soil.  We have not developed our exports to any other country than Britain&mdash;countries from which we buy vast amounts of feeding-stuffs, which are paid for by our external investments.  If after the war, for instance, there should be a collapse of these investments, we have not the means to buy, say, 1,000,000 tons of maize from the Argentine in order to recommence pig exporting on a large scale.  The only way would be to export something to the Argentine, and that would be a difficult matter.</P>
    <P>We could have made more efforts, undoubtedly, and we did not make them.  In fact, during the last 20 years we inherited in this country what I might describe as the full panoply of the more unsatisfactory type of democracy. We have attempted to live off the fat of the land rather than to sacrifice the enjoyment of many things for the sake of reconstruction.  We have, in common with many other democratic countries, been preaching the rights of the people to a far greater extent than their duties.  That was quite natural, owing to the conflict between the two Parties on the national issue, and as long as that conflict lasted it was not easy to appeal to people to make sacrifices and do certain hard things in order to build up an economic weapon that would serve us in times of need or greater competition.  The fact that we did live in that atmosphere and the fact that <Col N="483" /> we were not inclined to make sacrifices because we were finding things easy meant that there was not engendered an atmosphere of enthusiasm sufficient to make available capital for the reconstruction that would be necessary if we were to be in a position to face the issues we may have to face after this war.</P>
    <P>Let us be honest about that.  We have succeeded far better than many other States during the last few years and, on the other hand, we have not succeeded so well as others.  At the present time there is a great national effort being made in this country, both for the purpose of defence and for the development of tillage, the cutting of turf and the development of voluntary social services by parish councils and so on.  Let us be perfectly frank about that national effort.  It is a magnificent effort and there is no need to decry it, but I think we shall have to admit that a great part of that effort and, indeed, enthusiasm, is really induced by fear of the consequences of not making an effort&mdash;fear of the possibility of severe shortage of supplies&mdash;and is not due to what might be called a desire for a fundamental reconstruction of the nation&rsquo;s life.  We are glad that it has happened; it is a good thing that it has happened, and I only hope that after the war it will become something of a permanent nature and that the parish councils, operating now, partly at least because of the fear of shortage of supplies, may be encouraged to organise for the future on a cooperative basis, and that people will be brought to understand for the first time that it is better to combine voluntarily in order to get the things done than to live in isolation; that you can produce more, give more employment, and sell more productively by combining voluntarily than by remaining in isolation, each man fighting for himself and, very often, fighting for himself in such a way as, ultimately, to increase his own production costs.</P>
    <P>The fact remains that the people of this country have become disillusioned <Col N="484" /> to a considerable degree by the activities of the Dáil, and no person could possibly come into the Dáil and speak on this Budget without saying at least a word on that subject.  No one could say, as a member of the Dáil, that the Dáil enjoys the same reputation that it enjoyed, for example, seven, eight, nine or ten years ago, or even that it enjoyed before the war started, and it is well that Deputies, all of us, working collectively, should face the fact that we are, in some ways, like other democracies which began to collapse before this war.  The people are definitely disillusioned.  It is very easy to be disillusioned.  It is far more easy to be disillusioned than to make constructive suggestions as to how the democratic world can succeed better than it has, but I think it well that we should face that, and that we should face certain issues with regard to public opinion about the Dáil. Public opinion has a great admiration for the unity in this Dáil regarding defence matters, regarding our general belief in neutrality and regarding standing together and facing common peril; but I think we should say straight out, at the same time, that public opinion is very disillusioned so far as our economic policy is concerned. The people know that the atmosphere of this House has been largely dictated by the atmosphere of the economic war, and that that atmosphere still continues here, despite the fact that the economic war ended in April, 1938. They know very well that there is still a tendency on both sides to say: &ldquo;I told you so,&rdquo; about this or that item of economic policy, although the difference so far as economic policy is concerned between the two Parties has become very considerably modified. No one knows that better than the average Deputy in this country.</P>

      <P>There are many Deputies who already in their speeches have made it perfectly clear that they understand the value of developing industries that have never been developed here before and understand <Col N="485" /> perfectly the very gross dependence of this country on foreign trade.  I do hope the people will appreciate that, because the people I go amongst have their Party loyalties and their Party affiliations; they have their alternative choices of those whom they would like to have as their leader, and everything I am speaking about now refers not to leaders or to confidence in the Government but solely to the isolated issue of economic policy in this country.  The vast majority of the people quite obviously prefer one leader at present. I am speaking purely of their views on economic policy, taken apart from the general matter of who should lead this country during this present crisis.  On the question of economic policy, they know very well that there has been a very definite change of opinion on both sides, and I think it is time that we should make it clearer to them.  They know very well, for example, that industries must be made to dovetail with agriculture in one way or another. They know that industry must be preserved and extended, and that, instead of condemning industry, it must be made to fit into the general economic situation.  They know very well also that the agricultural machine is considerably out of date.  People realise only too well when they have to plough one-fifth of their land that, in some way or other, during past years, a great deal of their land has got into a very poor condition and they are asking all the time for measures to improve the quality of the land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People also know that there is a very great dilemma facing the Government in connection with this war as between the value of voluntary action and State control.  They know that the world demands greater Government control of almost all productive resources and almost all distributive resources.  They know that the further we get into the war and still more so at the end of the war, the Government must control, to a far greater degree than ever before, production of every kind.  They also know that that has frequently resulted in other countries in very inefficient production, because the State machine is generally not an <Col N="486" /> efficient machine, particularly in a country where the people are individualists, and they are asking themselves what can be done to reconcile the inefficiency of the State machine with the urgent necessity for improving State production and enabling production to continue after the war in a world in which there will be a great deal of State control.  They also know perfectly well that our economy is closely linked with the continued existence of emigration to other countries, and that naturally disturbs them.</P>
    <P>Arising out of this doubt in people&rsquo;s minds, it is quite obvious that a number throughout the country, in a very sincere way, are trying to devise special expedients by which we could overcome our difficulties. One of the expedients devised is the general conception that, by issuing credit on a large scale, we shall somehow get around our difficulties and employ all the people who have been employed up to now but who are now disemployed as a result of the war, solve the unemployment problem and in some way raise the average income of the poorer section of the people.  It is very necessary for those people in this country who appreciate the real economy of the country, and who know our difficulties, on both sides of the House, to prevent a growth in the numbers of those who advocate crank special expedients at a time when the whole course of this war is proving beyond all doubt that the mere issue of money brings nothing.</P>
    <P>I want to speak of this because there are certain newspapers and certain magazines, with quite large circulations, who advocate these special schemes, and I think it just as well to refer briefly to where the defects in the policy lie.  This war has shattered the illusions of most economists who believe in social credit, because they have watched two very great Powers conducting the war on what would appear to be entirely orthodox principles, supplemented only by a very great control of the lives of the inhabitants of these countries. They have seen the countries who had almost infinite power, instead of issuing <Col N="487" /> credit notes on a wide scale, without a corresponding control of production, taking every step to see that for every pound spent in an abnormal direction, a pound shall not be spent in another direction, and for every mark spent in one direction, a mark shall not be spent in another direction. In other words, both belligerents have realised the futility of inflationist credit schemes.</P>
    <P>It is well that these people here who advocate these schemes should study the methods of economic administration of both the principal belligerents, because they will learn a very valuable lesson.  Both of them have discovered, and agreed, that if, by taxing the people you increase production, it is no harm so far as the prosperity of the country is concerned; that if you tax people on a rising national income, there is no harm so far as the country is concerned; that if you tax people on a stable income and transfer money from one group to another, you do not increase the prosperity of the country as a whole; but if you tax people on a declining income, or in a way which reduces production, the only thing you can do to make up for it, unless you want to have economic chaos, is deliberately to reduce consumption and reduce employment in one direction in order to give it in another.  In other words, if you want to build all the houses required in Dublin City in ten years, instead of building them in 30 years, some people have to do without and you have to disemploy people in other directions, or lower the standard of living in other directions, to achieve that end.  The belligerents have discovered what most of them knew was the truth before; they have discovered how to control consumption, how to control production, how to control almost all the economic elements of their lives, and it is a very grave warning to people in this country who advocate special schemes of an inflationary character.</P>
    <P>Equally, we hear the suggestion that we might mobilise all our external assets, all our external investments, for schemes of development at home.  Now, <Col N="488" /> unfortunately, here again we have to face the fact that we are a dependent economy, that our external assets and securities create the purchasing power for imports which we do not produce in this country to the value of something like over £17,000,000 a year. There is no objection whatever to transferring our securities and developing them at home provided we can make certain that the total turnover of money, the total production, and the total trade of this country are not diminished through that transfer not producing the same rate of interest as it produced before in the form of external dividends.  In other words, there is no use blindly bringing back millions of externally invested money if the result is to be that we cannot buy maize from the Argentine to carry out increased pig production; or iron and steel from other countries to carry out our housing policy and to make use of for producing agricultural implements.</P>
    <P>It is quite possible for us to borrow money on a very large scale.  But let us make quite certain in borrowing money that it will result in greater production and more useful trade. There is no point, for example, in spending millions on drainage on a very lavish scale or on land improvement on a very lavish scale, on a scale which would re-employ all the idle people in the country and eliminate poverty, as has been suggested by certain people, unless we have an organised market, a market with capital behind it, with knowledge behind it, with organisation behind it, to sell agricultural produce at a rate which would pay off the interest on the money.</P>
    <P>As I have said, these other countries have discovered those truths.  If they appear to be using credit on a very large scale, they control their people in other ways.  It is well for this country to recognise that if we were to adopt any of the schemes of inflation proposed recently in certain instances by certain people, we would have automatically and permanently, both in war and in peace, to control all wages and profits, to control <Col N="489" /> exports and imports, to control private capital, to a very large degree to control emigration, and to control the consumption of a very large number of products.  At the same time, we would have to make quite certain that there would be sufficient technical knowledge available to take advantage of the results of the expenditure.</P>
    <P>That is a very large order.  Whether the people of the country are prepared to face what would amount to a complete and absolute dictation of their private lives and circumstances is very doubtful.  If we were to plan an economy such as is advised by inflationists it would require very many months&rsquo; investigation and a great deal of knowledge on the part of officials and members of the Government before we could attempt it.  In my opinion, there lies definitely a half-way line between the extreme proposals made by certain persons and the very orthodox attitude towards agricultural development in this country.</P>
    <P>As I have said, there has been criticism of democratic government. One feels it in this country.  One felt it if one lived in France before the war.  Part of it is of an artificial character.  Part of it is due to the fact that people naturally resent facing adversity; they like to blame the first person they can for it, and they blame their Government and their Parliament. Part of it is due to the fact that it is rather fashionable at the moment to criticise democracy, although actually before the war three or four of the finest civilisations in the world were democracies.  Partly it is due to the feeling that there was a lack of preparedness for the war and that there had been previously considerable economic stagnancy.  It seems to me that it is going to be rather serious for democracy in the future.  Democracy can be very easily destroyed, very quickly modified, but it can only be reborn very slowly, and it is essential for us to face that fact and to plan to a greater degree for the future.  Above all, it is essential for us in this House &mdash;and I speak as a very young member, but as one who has done a great deal to learn things&mdash;to do a great deal <Col N="490" /> more leading rather than indulging in wishful thinking to satisfy this or that section of the population.  It is absolutely essential to plan for the future to a far greater degree.</P>
    <P>We shall have to face, first of all, the immediate effects of this war.  This Budget has revealed an effort on the part of the Government to control profits, salaries, wages and prices.  I should like to make a few suggestions to the Minister with regard to the general criticism all over the country in connection with profiteering.  It is very hard for the average layman to tell whether there is profiteering or not because the prices of raw materials are rising so quickly.  It is quite impossible to expect the average consumer to make a complaint about prices or to write to the Prices Commission; it is not in our nature.  I am certain the Government are sincere in checking prices in so far as they can. Up to now, perhaps, the machinery which has existed has been sufficient; but I ask the Minister to consider the possibility, even as an experiment, of creating under an emergency order a consumers&rsquo; council in one or two towns, and paying, on a part-time basis, a secretary to act for that council.  It might be either the parish council or some other body, but let it be known that there is a body with semi-statutory powers in that town composed of citizens whose sole purpose is to put a check on prices and to make sure that an absolutely anonymous and effective report is given indicating where excessive prices have been charged.</P>
    <P>The experiment might not work, it may not be effective; but I think at least it is worth trying.  I very much admire the efforts of those Ministers concerned to avoid inflation.  They are trying to close up the circle on every side, and are carrying out measures which are not at all popular with the electorate.  The electorate as usual, perhaps, have not been asked to face the future with sufficient clarity.  Still, the fact remains that there is that one gap.  If the Government could try some method of having a voluntary organisation <Col N="491" /> to check prices in towns they would be able to say at least that they made an effort to close the gap at the last point so far as inflation is concerned.  I recommend that to them very sincerely.</P>
    <P>I also suggest that it should be quite possible to plan to a greater degree for the production of cereals, turf and substitute materials; to plan in advance and to give people rather earlier than usual some idea of what is going to happen; to make clear what the position is; to prepare the land for example, for the winter sowing of wheat long before the sowing period and, if possible, to make provision in this Budget for so doing; to give people plenty of time to consider the rotation of crops which has become very difficult for them on account of the large amount of land to be tilled.</P>
    <P>I ask the Government to make perfectly clear, not only to the institutions concerned but to the public, what they are going to do about prolonging employment in industries which are about to suffer serious shortages of raw material for the remainder of the war; to make it clear to the public that every effort will be made to continue employment, even if it means going on short time or having rotational employment, and not to allow an industry to continue blindly to the end of the raw material available on full time, with the result that suddenly large numbers of people are rendered idle.  I think that is very important. I should like the Government to conduct a general examination of the work of parish councils.</P>
    <P>When I think of my own constituency, I think naturally of the good parish councils.  I am aware, however, that from the standpoint of a sudden emergency, a really serious emergency&mdash;anything in the nature of an invasion or an economic collapse or, say, a very serious failure of the harvest&mdash;it would be found, I am afraid, that there would be a large number of parish councils which are not yet fully effective.  I think the Government would do well by making a report to the Dáil as to the number <Col N="492" /> of parish councils that they think are fully prepared to face any situation. That report might be obtained from the emergency committees.  The information, so obtained, would give some idea as to how far we have to go in completing the development work of the parish councils.  I am aware of the position with regard to the parish councils in my constituency.  In some places you have excellent parish councils, while in others they do not appear to be quite so efficient.</P>
    <P>I also think that the cost of living may rise so much in the next six months as to make it necessary for the Government, in addition to providing food vouchers, to prepare some sort of scheme of cheap food canteens, or to encourage private enterprise in that direction.  Thousands of people may be out of employment by the end of next winter, people who are utterly unaccustomed to live on very short commons.  In Germany, for five years before the war ever started, in order to carry out their armament effort, and in certain States of America in the great crisis of 1932, they went in for schemes involving very considerable sacrifices, on the part of those with money, in the form of a direct transfer of gifts of food from the section of the population more fortunately placed to those less fortunately placed.  There may come a time when the money machine may break down in this country, and when it may not be possible to give practical succour to thousands of people merely by giving them money.  It may be necessary, in the circumstances of the time, to have a transfer of food, not by voucher but physically.  I think that is a matter that the Government should seriously consider&mdash;the possibility of some scheme based on the German or American model in which parish councils would have to arrange for days when certain sections of the community would go without different items of food, and when that food should be collected and brought to a centre.  I can say that, so far as my constituency is concerned, the situation for people who are living to-day on 23/- or 30/- a week, people with, say, <Col N="493" /> a family of five children, will by next winter be a very serious one.  The situation may affect not only those who are unemployed, but even those with small average incomes, so that something definite will have to be done about them.  I know that the Government are making plans, but I suggest to them that they should assume, from the standpoint of the State, that if the money machine breaks down, or if there is an economic collapse, they will have to adopt something on the lines of the American or German plan if they are to achieve their end.</P>
    <P>In conclusion I want to appeal for that replanning of this country when the war is over.  We may then have a period of artificial prosperity since countries that have been without food for a long time will be prepared to pay a high price for what we have to offer.  There may afterwards come a period in which we shall have to fit into some sort of international economy.  We can be absolutely certain, no matter who wins the war, that the two factors that will count most in that period will be economic efficiency and low production costs.  We cannot claim to be experts or first-class in regard to either.  We should prepare now for that period by organisation.  A great deal of planning will be required. When speaking last week on the Estimate for the Department of Agriculture I said that I believed we could not afford to be blind to the reality of the condition of the land of this country.  I would ask the Minister for Finance to consider, during the current period, whether it would not be advisable to have a survey made of our land so that anyone going into a parish could see on a map the fields of old pasture land matted with roots and in a condition gravely requiring capital expenditure, as well as every piece of undrained land and of badly hedged land.  With such a map one should be able to get a picture of aggriculture in an entire district. I think there is nothing which could shock the people of the country into a reality of their position more quickly than the preparation of a land <Col N="494" /> survey.  It would reveal to them the extent to which the land of this country has gone back during the last 20 years, as well as the extent to which we are unprepared to face low production costs and efficiency after this war is over.</P>
    <P>It seems to me also that we should require to adopt a better marketing organisation for agriculture if we are to succeed in our foreign trade.  As regards agriculture, we cannot continue in the old-fashioned way in which the greatest possible cost enters into the production of an article up to the time it leaves the country.  We shall have to face the fact that there are only two successful types of agricultural economy for this country&mdash;the large-farm economy, and the small-farm economy in which there is a very high degree of co-operation.  One of the ways in which this House has, perhaps, instead of leading, followed too much the dictates of ordinary opinion without trying to give any encouragement, has been the fact that we have done nothing to encourage co-operation in the last 20 years so as to make it an essential factor in small-farm economy. Is there something strange and peculiar about this country, or why is it that almost all the prosperous countries which compete with us are either large-farm countries or co-operative countries?  Are we going to admit that we cannot do as they are doing? Are we to say that the Irish people are too individualistic and cannot be made to face the issue of co-operation, or that we cannot get efficient managers?  Are we to go on saying that, or are we prepared to take the bit in our teeth and say that it would appear from all the evidence around us that we must do one of these two things if we are to be efficient?  Let us do it, and let us begin planning here and now.</P>
    <P>Similarly, we will have to face some decline in our external trade.  I believe that it would be a very good speculation for this planning committee to assume that for five or six years after the war, no matter who wins it, <Col N="495" /> there will be a very large market for pedigree stock, plants, seed potatoes, and pedigree produce of any kind. The whole of that trade has been virtually interrupted by the present conflict. Countries that are actually competing with us in the outside market are looking for pedigree stock.  For example, countries such as South America are in urgent need of an almost unlimited quantity of seed potatoes and of pedigree stock of every kind for which there is neither the shipping nor the organisation at present.  The manager of a famous exporting organisation in this country, on his return from a tour of the world informed a group of buyers that there was an almost unlimited market throughout the world for seed potatoes. We have not done very much in that direction so far.  There is, I think, a small grant given for their production. At the end of this year we may not be able to buy maize or iron unless we can sell seed potatoes or some other class of agricultural produce.  What preparations are we making to develop that export trade?  We all know that the production of pedigree stock requires years of experience and a great deal of technical organisation.  If we are to meet the changes that are bound to come about after the war, we cannot go on relying on our old forms of exports. The only exports that are likely to be of much use to us after the war are those which we can send out at a very low cost of production, with a high rate of efficiency or specialist products &mdash;things that we can produce better than other countries, that no other country can produce as well as ourselves, or commodities of very high quality for which the total supply is not sufficient through the world.  Should we not begin now to prepare for the development of that production?  If time permitted I could suggest a number of other plans for the future, plans for the development of industrial exports and of commodities which cannot be produced in other countries because the plant for their production in those countries has been destroyed.  Plans might also be thought out for the export of the products of our woollen <Col N="496" /> industry.  In regard to these we should hold a very high place in the world&rsquo;s markets.  So far as those exports are concerned, the Government have adopted, in regard to some of them, a <i>laissez faire</i> policy.  They have said that they have not been stimulated by the people to encourage these very special exports&mdash;I believe that they could be greatly increased&mdash;and that, therefore, there is no need to prepare an organisation. But the fact remains that we are one of the very few countries in Europe who had not before the war a special export organisation, with an immense amount of information on how to find markets, how to advertise, how to pack, how to despatch, how to overcome marketing difficulties, how to overcome import difficulties and import restrictions.  We should commence an organisation of that kind if we are to continue trading, after this war, on any extensive scale.</P>
    <P>I think, finally, that we must be prepared to make the people recognise that, just as extra work and extra labour for very little profit and very little pay is the policy of the leading belligerents in this war, so when this war is ended unless we in this country work together to develop prosperity and to face the issues before us we shall not enjoy the fruits of our independence. Here again the whole question of the Civil Service arises. Does the Government believe that at the present time the Civil Service of this country, so far as our productive Departments are concerned, is organised in a way which suits the emergency?  Does the Government believe that, in the case of the Departments dealing with economic production, it is useful or desirable that sometimes 20 or 30 officials should examine a file on a given subject?  That has always been considered essential for preventing public abuse, and for ensuring fairness to all people.  After this war, and even during this war, can we continue to allow our Civil Service to be administered in quite the same way? Would it not be possible to avoid the public abuse and greatly to increase the efficiency of the Civil Service if we had the Civil Service more grouped&mdash;<Col N="497" /> a small number of officials in charge of a given area of production or in charge of a given industry, and those officials requested to interlock far more closely with the people outside the Civil Service who are in charge of the industry or of the production?  At the present time, civil servants in the Department of Supplies are working very hard consulting groups of manufacturers and importers.  They take down long reports, consider those reports, take advice from various other institutions and act on that advice.  In Great Britain and Germany the business men of the country are invited to take an actual part in the Civil Service, to interlock with the Civil Service.  There are advisory committees of two or three individuals who not only give advice to the civil servants, but sit with them and help them in their work. If the crisis becomes more grave, can we afford the old-fashioned system which was in vogue before the Great War, or are we going to interlock with the Civil Service what might be described as voluntary vocationalism on a very extended scale?  I submit those things to the Government to consider, without any suggestion of criticism, but merely with a feeling that this Dáil has been far too long a very conventional two-Party Parliament; that the people are aware of it and are asking for greater leadership on a great number of matters; that we will have to face a greater crisis after this war is over, and that we should begin now to plan for the future on a far greater scale than we have ever done since we became an independent nation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>Speaking on this Budget, I should say in the first place that the amount of money which the Minister is asking from this country at present is very large.  High taxation does not lead to increased production or an increase in industry.  I remember when taxation in this country stood at about £20,000,000 the members of the present Government waxed eloquent in this House telling us that the country could not afford that sum. To-day it is almost doubled.  I can quite appreciate the difficult position <Col N="498" /> in which the Minister for Finance finds himself at the present time.  I am quite aware that many circumstances exist at the moment over which he has no control.  I am also aware of the fact that the vast majority of the people of this country are very desirous to ensure peace here.  Of course, peace is worth a good price, but possibly the people of this country might pay too good a price for it. What I am concerned with is whether we are to get good value for those extra millions which are being raised by the Minister for Finance on this occasion.  I hope and trust that the Government and the members of the Government Party are not taking advantage of the desire for peace which exists among the people of this country, and assuming that they will put up with anything at the moment so far as taxation is concerned.  After all, £40,000,000 is a terrible sum.  If high taxation could solve our difficulties, this little country would have no difficulties at all at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Speaking on previous Budgets I ventured the opinion that the more money the Minister for Finance raised in a particular year the more money he would have to raise in the year following, and the year following again.  I pointed out on every occasion to the members of the Government here that whoever embarked on a policy of solving the unemployment question would increase the number of unemployed instead of decreasing it.  I think my opinion at that time is borne out by the facts which exist to-day.  Notwithstanding what has been said by several speakers on the Government Benches, there are possibly more people unemployed to-day than ever there were in the history of the State.  I do not want to blame the Government for that state of affairs.  What I do blame them for is persisting in making it one of the planks of their programme that they could solve the unemployment question.  I hope the present state of this country will bring it home to the Deputies on the Fianna Fáil back benches that they engaged in a lot of &ldquo;flapdoodle&rdquo; in the last ten years, when they gilded the lily, so to speak, <Col N="499" /> for the poor people at the crossroads, telling them that if they were returned to power this little country would be a paradise on earth.  It is anything but that at the present time.  I will not twit the members of the Government because of their failure to solve the unemployment question, but I hope they have learned a lesson so far as the future is concerned.  I hope they will recognise the fact which I have pointed out to them over and over again since they came into power here, that this is a little country, that it can afford certain things and do certain things but cannot afford any more; that having made our bed here in this country we should lie on it, and not try to copy great countries like Great Britain.  We should set our standard of living in accordance with the capacity of the people of the country to pay.</P>
    <P>The whole speech of the Deputy who has just spoken from the Government Benches points to the fact that the whole policy of the Government for the last ten years has been the wrong one. The intensive tariff policy which has been pursued for the last ten years, if I can correctly interpret the remarks of the Deputy who has just spoken, has been a complete failure, and in so far as the future is concerned it is imperative to change that policy, and to endeavour to fit in the policy of this country with the policy that will be pursued when this war is over.  In other words, there will be no such thing as a national policy; the policy will be more or less of an international nature. That was the gist of the speech of the Deputy who has just sat down&mdash;that the whole policy would have to be changed.  In fact, I would go as far as to say that nothing has been done right in this country for the last 20 years, according to Deputy Childers. I think any Deputy who studies the speech he has just delivered will agree with me in that.  I was beginning to wonder how we lived here at all before we ever heard of Deputy Childers or how our fathers before us lived or how the country got on.  Everything is wrong according to Deputy Childers; <Col N="500" /> we must change the whole economic fabric of this State.  Of course, there were many points in his speech which were very sound, but I would advise the back benchers of Fianna Fáil to take heed of the words of Deputy Childers and go down to their constituents and try to explain to them the reasons why this country at the present moment has to put up £40,000,000 to carry on the government of the country. It is an extraordinary thing that after 20 years of native government our Minister for Finance should find it necessary to raise a couple of million pounds in this Budget in order to keep the tens of thousands of our people who at the moment are unemployed from starvation.  I deplore that fact.</P>
    <P>There are one or two things in connection with this Budget to which I would like to draw the attention of the Minister for Finance.  One is the great increase he has placed on tobacco.  I remember when the Minister made his Budget statement last year he had a sort of tilt&mdash;perhaps he was entitled to that tilt&mdash;at many of the Deputies who made dismal prophecies that he was embarking on a policy symbolic of killing the goose that laid the golden egg.  He referred on that occasion to the increase in the excise duty on beer and spirits and to the fact that, notwithstanding the increase on beer and spirits in the previous Budget, the yield in revenue was greater than it was the previous year.  The Minister, possibly, was right on that occasion, but I would like to remind the Minister on this occasion of the truth of the other old proverb, that it is the last straw that breaks the camel&rsquo;s back, and that possibly this extra 4d. on the ounce of tobacco may be the means of destroying the tobacco industry which, as everybody knows, is one that gives a good deal of well-paid employment to hundreds of our people, apart altogether from the great hardship it is going to impose on that section of our people who, by virtue of the low wages they receive, are not in a position to pay this very large increase, amounting in some cases to over 33? per cent.  It will impose a great hardship on the agricultural worker, <Col N="501" /> the small farmer and the unemployed man in our towns and cities.  Candidly, I would not feel a bit upset if the Minister reduced the Army Vote by the amount he hopes to gain by this increase on tobacco.  I am one of those who does not fear the future in so far as the international position is concerned.  I am afraid a great many people in this country are very fearful of what will happen.  In the words of the old saying, they are bidding the devil good morrow before he meets them and they are prepared to do almost anything for peace.  Peace is all right for those who, possibly, enjoy at the moment a good standard of living, but it is not very nice for people who are practically living on an empty stomach and who have to pay extra for everything they find it necessary to purchase.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister should have seriously considered the question in so far as it affects the tobacco industry before he placed this additional burden upon it.  The Minister himself conveyed that he was somewhat anxious as regards the future of this industry, particularly as regards supplies.  There might come a time in the near future when the supplies of raw material will be so limited that the revenue derived from the customs duties will be very much reduced.  Taking everything into consideration, I think it should have been possible for the Minister to find the money, or at least portion of the money, he wanted by some other way instead of imposing this very large increase of 4d. per ounce on tobacco.</P>
    <P>There are many other things that I should like to deal with in this Budget, but I do not wish to go over the same ground as other Deputies.  In regard to the increase of 2/6 which the Minister proposes to give to the recipients of unemployment insurance benefit, I think that is long overdue.  I can appreciate the spirit that prompted the Minister to make that concession. There is no doubt about it that at the moment there are very large numbers of decent, respectable men, who have been accustomed to an average weekly wage of £3 10s. to £4, not for the last year or two, but for the last 25 or 30 years, who have never known what it <Col N="502" /> was to be a day idle, who because of the abnormal circumstances existing at the moment arising from the unfortunate struggle that is going on, have had their means of employment taken away.  That type of man finds himself suddenly reduced to living on unemployment insurance benefit.  If he is a married man with a wife and no other dependants he is entitled to a sum of £1 per week.  With all respect to what has been stated here about the Minister&rsquo;s action in regard to increases in wages, that should bring home to a lot of people in this country the sacrifices that some men have to make.  The men I am referring to have had their weekly incomes reduced overnight as it were from an average of £3 10s. and £4 to £1.  If they have dependent children, of course, they get 1/6 or 2/- for each child, but that does not at all compensate them for what they expend on the children.  Therefore, I must congratulate the Minister, in a way, on giving that 2/6 increase.  I am sure he would like to be in a position to increase it fourfold because of the type of people to whom that increase will apply.</P>
    <P>As regards the recipients of old age pensions, widows&rsquo; and orphans&rsquo; pensions and unemployment assistance, as far as I understand, the Minister proposes to assist those people in two ways, one of which possibly does not find favour with many Deputies.  In the first place, he intends to give that assistance by voucher.  There is a bit of a snag in that because of the fact that at the moment I do not personally know who is going to issue these vouchers.  I should like to impress on the Minister that if it is the board of health that will issue those vouchers, there will be a very large number of people who will not take advantage of the Minister&rsquo;s kindly gesture.  People who have been in receipt of unemployment benefit will not seek assistance from the board of health&mdash;they never did and they never will.  Similarly people who have been receiving unemployment assistance because of the fact that their unemployment insurance benefit was exhausted during a long period of unemployment, will not seek assistance from the board of health. <Col N="503" /> These people like to retain their dignity even though they have been unemployed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesCoburn" hpid="Mr. Coburn Mr. Coburn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope not, because if so, they will not avail of the Minister&rsquo;s kindly gesture.  I should like the Minister also to note that adjacent to large centres of population, such as Dundalk, Drogheda, Wexford and Sligo, there is a very considerable section of people living in what is called the rural area, immediately adjoining the urban area, who, from time immemorial, never worked anywhere except in the urban area.  I think it would be a great hardship if these large sections were debarred from participating in the scheme outlined by the Minister in his Budget statement.  I have in mind in particular two big areas around Dundalk in which the local priests took a very keen interest lately when they discovered that these people were excluded by the new Employment Period Order from receiving unemployment assistance because they lived in the rural area, whereas it had been proved that 99 per cent. of these people earned their living in Dundalk. The same remarks apply to Drogheda. I think that these people should be scheduled much on the same lines as people are scheduled for fire-fighting services.  I should impress upon the Minister the desirability of endeavouring by every means in his power to see that these people should be enabled to participate in the benefits that the Minister has provided through this Budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In conclusion, need I say that we are living in very difficult times?  No matter what may have been said during the debate on this Budget, I should like to assure the Minister and the members of the Government the people of the country generally are anxious to co-operate with them in every activity designed to promote the good of the people.  I think, notwithstanding what may have been said here <Col N="504" /> on this occasion, that the Government may take it&mdash;at least I give it as my opinion, although others may differ from me&mdash;that the people are ready and willing to co-operate with the Government in any measures necessary to safeguard the interests of the people and of the State.  I think it is well that the Government should know that, so that they in return will do all they possibly can to take the people into their confidence.  In that connection, may I say, with all due respect to the back benchers on the opposite side, that I think they ought to take a more active part than they have done in the past year to get the people to realise the seriousness of the times through which we are passing.</P>
    <P>I think it is up to all Deputies to do that and to have the moral courage to say things which, though they may not be popular at present, will have a good effect afterwards.  It is very easy for the people to be misled owing to the chaos and confusion that surrounds them.  People&rsquo;s minds are, to a certain extent, unbalanced by the sufferings which they see other nations have to endure.  It is, therefore, all the more necessary that those in responsible positions should endeavour by every means in their power to consolidate the people so that they will be enabled to face anything that may come their way in the future.  The people must get a chance.  They must be taken into the confidence of those in power.  Therefore, I would appeal to members of the House to do everything they possibly can by word and example to get the people to work together for the common good. Undoubtedly they have reacted to the appeals made to them up to the present in a most praiseworthy manner.  I have been forcibly struck by the way in which our young men have turned out to join the Local Defence Force and the Local Security Force.  They have carried out their duties in a very conscientious manner. That is as it should be.  Above all, those in responsible positions must realise the serious position which confronts the country and do their utmost to alleviate the difficulties of the people.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrancisLoughman" hpid="Mr. Loughman Mr. Loughman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Loughman</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very interested in the proposal to double the duty on cider as it affects adversely an industry which has existed for some time in County Tipperary&mdash;my constituency. The cider manufacturing industry is an industry which has been only four or five years in existence.  It had the task of popularising cider as a drink in the country in competition with drinks that were long established and that are very good in themselves.  Cider had an advantage in price over these drinks up to the time the Budget was introduced last year.  It had also the advantage of being a very excellent beverage in itself.  As I have said, up to the time the Budget was introduced last year it had made very considerable progress, but the imposition of a duty of 1/- per gallon last year was a complete setback to it.  Notwithstanding the fact that last year was what I might can a very excellent cider year, there was a reduction in consumption amounting to 30,000 gallons.  In the year 1939 the factory milled no less than 1,700 tons of apples.  In 1940 when the tax of 1/- was imposed, the amount of apples milled was reduced to 400 tons.  That affords some indication of the setback which the industry received by the imposition of even a tax of 1/-.  The industry is very important to the town of Clonmel for the reason that it gives constant employment to about 50 persons and it gives seasonal employment to a number somewhere in the neighbourhood of 70 or 80.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As well as that, it provides a good market for those people who have orchards inasmuch as they have now a competitor with the ordinary purchaser of apples and are able to get a much better price than they were getting previously.  When the factory was first instituted, with the co-operation of the Department of Agriculture, they distributed amongst the farmers of South Tipperary over 7,000 apple trees and they have offered to distribute a further 10,000 in order to produce the supplies which the factory will need if it is to continue.  As I have said, it received a setback by the imposition of the 1/- duty, and it is believed that, if a 2/- duty is imposed, <Col N="506" /> the industry will completely collapse. That is the assurance I have been given by the people in the industry, and I put it to the Minister that it would be a bad thing if, for the sake of gaining the £7,000 which he expects this extra tax to bring in, he were to kill an industry which is giving employment to so many people and providing a market for the produce of our own country.  I bring these few points to the Minister&rsquo;s notice and I ask him to reconsider the decision to impose this extra duty.  I even ask him to re-examine the imposition of the 1/- duty and give this industry a chance of getting on its feet before it has to face competition with beverages which have been popular for so long a period and beverages which are excellent in themselves.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope that the Minister, when replying, will clarify, to some extent, the position as regards food vouchers.  We have heard so much about them that a cloud of doubt has been raised concerning them. Deputy Flinn, the other day, and the Minister for Industry and Commerce to-day, gave the impression that food vouchers would get precedence over money for purchasing purposes.  I do not think that there is any sense in those contentions or that such a system could be operated.  I could not imagine anything like that happening and I do not think that the vouchers would ensure food any more than money would in the circumstances mentioned.</P>
      <P>I should like if the Minister would also explain the contribution which local authorities are supposed to make in order to become shareholders in this sum of £200,000 to which the Minister refers on page 45 of his Budget speech. In that speech, he said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I propose to provide a sum not exceeding £200,000 towards meeting the cost of the additional food which boards of assistance may grant to such of the necessitous poor as are approved of by them.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Further, he says that regard will be had in this connection to the extent of the additional allowance for food made by boards of health and boards of <Col N="507" /> public assistance over their normal yearly expenditure.  Does that mean that only boards of health which are giving assistance in kind will be eligible for this grant?  The Minister indicates that that is not so, but it is open to that impression.  Is it intended that only boards of health which have increased their estimate this year will be eligible?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that that would be quite fair.  A board of health is influenced by the conditions that prevail at the moment.  The estimates of boards of health are often wrong.  They are never just correct.  A board of health may not have estimated for a greater amount this year than they did last year, but the needs of the board may in a few months be greater.  I hope the Minister will not act literally on what he has said.</P>

      <P>The details of the administration of this food-voucher system are being worked out.  The intention was that, if there was a scarcity of food, the people holding vouchers would be certain of getting certain items of food.

      <P>The Deputy was one of the first to protest against the issue of food vouchers.  Of course, the system may not work out.  Some years ago I had experience of work in a charitable organisation.  We used to give out vouchers for food and these vouchers were addressed to certain traders, who were to honour them. Though we, as members of the St. Vincent de Paul Society, visited the people who got the vouchers every week and got to know them, we found that we were sometimes fooled.  That happened in <Col N="509" /> the case of people whom we knew and trusted.  At certain times, they practically bartered the food vouchers for money, which they spent in ways which did not make for the improvement of their health or for the benefit of their families.  As Deputies have admitted, no system is absolutely perfect, but I ask Deputies to give us credit for our <Col N="510" /> intention to secure priority for holders of these vouchers in the event of food scarcity.</P>
