      <P>I propose to take questions 1 and 2 together.  As Deputies are aware, the purpose of the Minister's visit to the United States was to examine the possibility of purchasing arms and supplies from that country. As regards arms, unfortunately, his efforts were not successful.  As regards supplies, the American Government offered to release for sale to us and transfer to the Irish flag two cargo vessels to be used for the transport of supplies from America to Ireland. This offer was accepted.  Irish crews for these two ships are already on their way to America, and the ships are expected to be ready for sea in the course of the next few weeks.  The Minister was also able to do much to make our position better known and understood generally.</P>

With regard to the second part of the question, I have no indication&mdash; apart from Press reports&mdash;that deliveries of American ammunition to this country would be in any way dependent on the condition suggested by the Deputy; and, as our determination to resist attack in all circumstances has been many times repeated and made abundantly clear, it is difficult to see what would be the object of such a condition.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>Owing to the shortage of supplies of oil fuel, it has been necessary to restrict the issue of permits to purchase kerosene for agricultural tractors in the months of June and July to those cases in which it was established that the farmers concerned could not carry out essential agricultural operations with horses.  As a result of the saving of fuel thus effected, it will be possible to arrange that each agricultural tractor owner who has completed the form issued to him by my Department in June will be authorised to purchase a reasonable supply of kerosene for harvesting and threshing.  The available stocks of kerosene are limited and, therefore, all agricultural tractor owners should be as economical as possible in the use of this fuel, as portion of our stocks must be reserved for autumn ploughing and other essential agricultural work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister knows the conditions in County Dublin.  Men with from 20 to 50 acres of early potatoes want to put them on the market. They also want to plough the ground and crop it before the end of the first week of August.  Otherwise, the crops which they intend to put in will not mature.  Have these men not a good case for a supply?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am stating the facts from my own knowledge.  I know that they are correct.  How does the Minister differentiate?  People who used 400 or 500 gallons per month for agricultural work have a good case for obtaining a supply.  Is it for joy-riding that they used that quantity in their tractors or are they going to waste the oil, now that it is double the price which it was a year ago?  The public want an answer to this question.  The farmers were appealed to to grow more food&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The prohibition of the movement of fat stock for slaughter in the Borough of Dun Laoghaire was a necessary measure for dealing with the serious outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease in the Dublin area.

Meat is slaughtered in the Dublin abattoir, where the first outbreak occurred, and which was the hub of the disease.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture if he will state why South County Dublin and the Borough of Dun Laoghaire are excluded from the cattle sale and export scheme; what provision is being made for the sale of cattle in South County Dublin and the Borough of Dun Laoghaire when the emergency purchasing committee is wound up, and why the restrictions on the sale of cattle are being tightened in these areas while in adjoining areas they are being relaxed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>My reply to the previous question has stated the reasons for continuing the restrictions on the slaughter of cattle and sheep in Dun Laoghaire Borough.  The restrictions in that area have not been tightened. It was proposed to permit victuallers in Dun Laoghaire, as well as victuallers in the County Borough of Dublin to buy their requirements of fat cattle and sheep in Dublin market as from Friday, 11th July, but a request was received from the Dublin Victuallers' Association, which includes victuallers in Dun Laoghaire, that the emergency committee should continue for the present to buy fat stock for the supply of meat for the two boroughs.  This has been agreed to and the committee will, for the time being, act as agents for the Victuallers' Association and buy cattle and sheep in districts, including South Dublin, wherever movement is permitted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As from Tuesday, 15th July, fat stock for export only will be permitted to be moved to Dublin market.  Movement to this market is limited, for the present, to animals which have been not less than eight weeks on farms in the area situated north of Dublin Borough&mdash;the Grand Canal from the city boundary to Shannon Harbour and thence to the mouth of the Shannon. This restriction was necessary in order <Col N="1090" /> to obtain the consent of the British authorities to the opening of Birkenhead and Glasgow ports for the export of cattle and sheep for immediate slaughter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>That represents an amelioration of the conditions since these questions were put down and it meets one point in this question.  I hope the Minister will not be too much influenced by the Dublin victuallers in connection with Dun Laoghaire.  I should like if he would give a reply to the representations made by the Dun Laoghaire victuallers.</P>

      <P>When the House adjourned on Friday last, I was trying to elicit from the Minister if this amendment were to be the be-all and the end-all of his intentions as far as the craft unions are concerned because the amendment to my mind gives no concession whatever in the direction that has been pleaded from these benches for the continuance and preservation of these very deserving institutions of which we have already spoken.  Their only crime is their small membership and the paucity of their funds.  I had hoped that the Minister would give some indication that he was prepared to yield in some respect to the representations made to him.  I hope he will now indicate that the appeals that have been made are going to have some response from him, so that he will not jeopardise the continuance of these unions that have rendered such heroic service to their members, that have never put themselves in a position of stirring up strife in the industrial life of the country and that are on that account entitled to get some consideration from the Minister.  I hope he will ensure that they will not be put out of action, that they will be allowed to retain their status as trade unions and that this impossible burden of £2,000 which can only be described as a hammer to put them completely out of existence, will not be inflicted in their case.  These unions cannot be suitably absorbed in the general unions and if the impossible conditions set out here are imposed upon them, it will mean their extinction or their transformation into that detestable form of union known as the house union or the company union, unions in which they will have no right to assert their claims and in which their employers will be complete masters.  The amendment is no better than the Schedule in that respect.  I should like the Minister to give us some indication as to whether it is still his intention to steamroll these small unions out of existence.</P>

      <P>I entirely support the representations of Deputy Keyes in regard to craft unions.  I am sure <Col N="1100" /> the Deputy would include in these representations all the small unions.  The amendment the Minister has before the House is simply eyewash and nothing else.  If the amendment is figured out, it makes only a kind of intermediate relief in various steps between the substantial deposits provided for but it does not change the principle behind the Schedule.  Deputy Keyes says he hopes that the Minister will do something about these small unions.  The Minister actually admitted in the ebb and flow of the discussion on Friday that he would do something about these unions, but he did not indicate what precisely he was prepared to do. He said that he would be prepared to consider the position of these old established small societies.  I submit that it is immoral to make the deposit so big that its only effect can be to wipe out a union.  The Minister gave us some idea of his philosophy&mdash; whether it is a deeply felt philosophy&mdash; or just a passing philosophy which runs to his lips in debate I do not know&mdash;when he referred on Friday to a union's ability to safeguard the interests of its members, to cater satisfactorily for its members and to help its members.  I wish he would tell the House what he means by &ldquo;serving the interests of its members&rdquo; because he enunciated the philosophy that a union's ability to cater satisfactorily for its members was proportionate to its financial resources. He repeated that several times and that led up to his making this further statement:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I think when we decide that we have to reduce the number of unions, to get rid of these unnecessary or inefficient elements in the movement, that a salutary and very convenient way, at any rate, and I think the only practical way, is to require trade unions to make a reasonably substantial deposit.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So that here we have the position that the Minister based the capacity of a trade union to serve its members on the size of its purse.  He said that there are too many of these unions and that if some of them have to be got rid of, what he called a rough-and-ready way, <Col N="1101" /> and later a salutary and very convenient way, is to insist on a deposit of such a size that that deposit will be the machinery for weeding them out.</P>
    <P>I had previously moved that the House should do away with this deposit entirely, but the House disagreed with that.  I submit that the deposit should only be a formal matter now. Generally the Minister's attitude has been to impress on the House that this is an experimental proposal, and that whatever happens the whole proceedings before the tribunal will be experimental. Assuming that the tribunal will be a group of persons capable of examining this whole question, and capable of helping to mould the trade union movement in the country into the effective and useful kind of organisation that we should all like it to be, should there be any test of a financial nature imposed on trade unions, that will wipe them out before they reach the tribunal?  Who then is going to decide that a trade union is not useful, is not efficient, or is not necessary simply because it has not a purse?  The Minister apparently has taken up that position.</P>
    <P>I submit to the Minister that the Government as a whole should reconsider its decision if it has been taken in that particular way.  I think that they should look into this matter again, and if they are going to be the only people who will have an opportunity of looking at it again, see whether it is advisable to determine the usefulness of a union by the length of its purse.  If this Schedule is passed we accept the position that the usefulness and the efficiency of a trade union are determined by its purse.  I should like to have some idea as to what the Minister meant by the expression, &ldquo;catering for the members of a trade union,&rdquo; because apparently there has been amongst some Irish workers a tradition that they have been able to cater for the members of particular crafts without piling up a big purse.  I want to know if that tradition is going to be killed, as I think it will be killed by this measure.  The Minister as well as other Ministers have preached to Irish industrialists and Irish workers that they must become more efficient.  I know of <Col N="1102" /> no better way in which industrial workers can be made more efficient than by promoting a love on their part for their craft, a desire for the development of their technique and by their own personal application to the advancement of that craft without being distracted by any desire to build up the power or the purse of their union.  I think the Minister is entirely wrong, and he was showing some signs of a glimmer of reason behind the facade of the arguments he put up when he indicated that he was prepared not only to reduce these substantial deposits, but also to consider the position of the small unions.  The whole scheme in relation to the deposits is entirely wrong.</P>

      <P>If the Minister persists in steam-rolling this Bill through the Dáil, particularly with what is under discussion included in it, he will probably create a glorious opportunity for some of his friends who are eminent lawyers to challenge the whole scheme before the courts in relation to its application to the Constitution.  I am in the habit of reading, as far as I have time to do so, the daily newspaper reports, and particularly the leading articles when they deal with political matters.  I read with interest a leading article in the <i>Irish Press</i> yesterday.  The leader writer presumably wrote on behalf of the Minister and probably at the request of the Minister when he said that, as a result of the Minister's week-end rest, he was prepared to give the trade union movement an extension of the probationary period in which unions would be able to settle between themselves the issues which he did not want, if he could avoid it, to settle, under the terms of this dragooning measure.  He is prepared to extend the period of time for doing certain things.  Time alone will tell whether that will be necessary.  If the leader writer wrote on behalf of the Minister, it represents a little bit of an advance on the attitude that the Minister adopted on last Friday and the preceding days.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister gave his benediction, both before and after he became a Minister, to many of the small unions that are to-day affiliated to the Irish <Col N="1103" /> Trade Unions Congress.  He did so by speeches, and by communications which he addressed to the officials of some of the unions that are going to be wiped out under the penalty clause contained in the Schedule.</P>

      <P>Last Friday the Minister was asked by Deputy McGilligan what was the basis on which he fixed the amount of the deposit and I was certainly surprised when I heard him stating that the figure was fixed on a rough-and-ready calculation.  I asked the Minister whether, before he fixed the figures in the Schedule, he made any examination of the annual reports submitted to the Registrar of Friendly Societies by the secretary of every trade union that is going to come under the whip.  I can hardly believe that the Minister, who gave his benediction to the establishment of certain small unions at a particular period and for political purposes, would now, when he has the power, wipe out the same unions by the penalty clause in the Schedule.  I have read the reports of some of the unions submitted to the Registrar and I know at least one union, that the Minister strongly advocated and supported when he was a Deputy for County Dublin, that could not put up the minimum amount fixed in the Schedule.  According to the last report submitted by the secretary of that union to the Registrar of Friendly Societies, not alone have they no money, but they have intimated that they are deeply in debt.</P>

I know he was irritated to a certain extent and his attitude rather indicated that last Friday but, perhaps, now that he has had a rest over the week-end, he will be in a position to give a more acceptable explanation in relation to those figures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I never subscribed to the idea that it was necessary to have a large number of unions purporting to cater for the interests of any group of workers in any industry, but the Minister's desire to bring about an amalgamation or an absorption of unions will not be achieved by the dragooning tactics set out in this portion of the Bill.  This is the portion of the Bill that contains the deadly penalty clause, deadly so far as the small unions are concerned.  Under it the majority of the small unions will disappear, and they are purely Irish unions.  The amalgamated unions have a big membership and, if they recognise this measure when it becomes law, they will easily be able to provide the sums named in the Schedule.  I think I am entitled to know from the Minister whether the sum fixed in the Schedule as a condition for making application for a negotiation licence is based upon his knowledge of the membership and <Col N="1105" /> financial standing of the Irish and the amalgamated unions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. D. Morrissey Mr. D. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister on Friday, during the discussion on this amendment to the Schedule, elaborated a point of view which he put forward for the first time on Thursday night&mdash; that unions, in order to exist in this country after the passing of this legislation, will not only be required to pay the deposit set out in the Schedule or the amendment to it, but will also have to satisfy the tribunal, or some other authority, that, after providing the deposit, whether it is £2,000 or £8,000, they are financially sound and have a good financial surplus to safeguard, as the Minister put it, the interests of their members.  I was not surprised to hear that expression from the Minister. I was less surprised when it was repeated by him on Friday.  From the beginning I stated that, in my opinion, certain interests were behind this Bill, and behind this Schedule, because so far as wiping out unions, which is the aim of the Bill, is concerned, the Schedule is the effective part &mdash;although that has been denied&mdash; for lopping the heads off unions. When one listened to the Minister talking about unions, whose effectiveness, so far as the members are concerned, has to be measured by their financial resources, one cannot help recalling the Minister's couple of hours of humbugging here on Wednesday or Thursday night, when he kept playing off, or trying to play off Irish unions as against English unions, and got so wrapped up in the whole thing that he thought it desirable, apparently, to attack certain prominent trade union officials who are English.  The position, of course, is, as Deputy Mulcahy very rightly described it, that this eye-washing amendment is not going to have the slightest effect on the amalgamated unions.  There is not one amalgamated union operating here that will not be able to meet these conditions, but many purely Irish unions will not be able to meet the amounts set out in the amendment, and because of that they are going to be wiped out. We are told that in future unions are to be judged by their financial resources. <Col N="1106" /> All that is set out in the amendment as to the deposits that will be demanded and the scrutiny that is apparently going to take place into the financial position of each union, if it is unable to put up the deposit, is being done on the plea that all the trouble with inter-union disputes was caused by small unions.  That is not so.  Any person who deliberately says that that is so is saying something that is not true.</P>
      <P>On this Schedule I say it is unfair that this House should be asked to impose conditions on small unions which they are unable to meet, and so wipe them out.  The House is being told that that is desirable&mdash;and not only desirable but essential&mdash;because these small unions, which will be unable to put up the deposit, have been responsible for the trouble and the turmoil.  I now challenge the Minister to say if the inter-union trouble which has taken place, particularly in the City of Dublin, in the last four or five years, was not caused almost exclusively by big unions that will not be affected by this amendment.  If you want to wipe out small unions, not only in the City of Dublin, but unions that have been very effective throughout the country, then do so openly and above board.  Do not try to do it under the cloak of pinning on them sins of which they have not been guilty.  It is known not only to the Minister, but to every official in his Department, and to every trade unionist and to most of the citizens of Dublin, that the major troubles in this city, industrial and inter-union troubles, were not prolonged by small unions, but were caused by some of the biggest unions. The Minister knows that.</P>

      <P>On the last day the Minister indicated to the House, when we were discussing the amendment, that the Schedule as originally prepared was a rough and ready decision. Now he has given us an amended Schedule which is less rough as it was less ready, but he indicated two things with regard to his mind when he was discussing the amendment, first, that he would be prepared to consider the position of the old-established small societies.  He also indicated that in certain circumstances he was prepared to reduce the £2,000 deposit to £1,000.  I would like to ask the Minister what is the position with regard to these matters and <Col N="1109" /> whether he proposes to introduce amendments on the Report Stage in one or other of these directions or in both?</P>

      <P>Upon that point, on Friday last the Minister intimated to Deputies, if the House expressed certain opinions which were expressed in certain sections of the House, his willingness to amend the deposit clause in the Schedule.  In the course of the debate the Minister lost his temper and then said, because certain people said something which ruffled him, his whole mind was altered and that he had, therefore, decided to withdraw the earlier offer.  I can understand the Minister getting into a temper.  As a matter of fact, apparently, that is a very normal condition with the Minister. But that is a temperamental problem and not a legislative problem. It does not seem to be a reasonable kind of procedure that a Minister should come into the House on Friday, make an offer, make it in very nice tones, and then in the course of the debate get ruffled and say the whole offer is withdrawn because he lost his temper.  That was the Minister's attitude on Friday last, but legislation should not be fashioned in that way. Deputy Meaney wrote a letter to the paper and said that he wanted this legislation shaped by an impact of reason on reason, that he wanted it shaped by thoughtful views.  There was some sound sense in Deputy Meaney's letter, even though he did not contribute very much to the shaping of the legislation when it was passing through this House.  If the Minister will not listen to reason from this side of the House, in any case, he ought to pay some regard to what Deputy Meaney wrote to the <i>Irish Press.</i>  Deputy Meaney felt that a Bill of this kind should be fashioned by an impact of reason on reason.  This Bill is being <Col N="1110" /> fashioned by the Minister's temper&mdash; by the Minister's bad temper&mdash;not even by good temper.</P>

      <P>I think Deputy Mulcahy has really shown the relevance of this because the Minister made an offer on Friday last and, in the course of the debate, got ruffled and, because he got ruffled, said, &ldquo;The offer I have made is withdrawn.&rdquo;  But the basic facts remained undisturbed between the time the Minister made the offer and the time he withdrew the offer.  Legislation surely should not be fashioned in that way because the Minister cannot keep his temper.  Will the Minister say now what set of circumstances induced him to make the offer and why he withdrew the offer?  If the Minister still says he has withdrawn the offer, then we can only conclude that the trade unions in this country are being asked to pay a minimum deposit of £2,000 because this country has a Minister for Industry and Commerce who, during the debates in this House, cannot be relied on to keep his temper for more than a few minutes.</P>

      <P>May I put the situation as it appears to me?  My temper has got nothing to do with this Bill but statements have been made on the part of the Opposition after I had indicated that I was prepared, if it would meet the wishes of the House, to consider some reduction in the minimum amount of the deposit which might meet the case of these old established trade unions.  I said I would consider that if that would meet the point of view that had been expressed. I made that offer, not because I think that the minimum amount of the deposit is too high or likely to be too onerous so far as the trade unions which I think can usefully function in this country are concerned, but simply to meet a point of view that had been expressed by the Opposition.  The response to that offer on my part, to meet what was the point of view of the Opposition, was a flat rejection.  I was <Col N="1111" /> told by one of the leading critics and opponents of the Bill that he did not want any deposit at all: that nothing would satisfy him except a nominal deposit.  He suggested a sum of £5. It was quite obvious that, in these circumstances, there was no use in giving effect to the proposal I had made to meet, not my own point of view at all because I was not convinced by a single argument, but to meet the point of view of the Opposition to this Bill. I cannot see, in these circumstances, that there is anything I can say on this stage which will cure that situation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. D. Morrissey Mr. D. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>After the admission made by the Minister, one can hardly conceive of anything, which one could even think of, that would be likely to help the situation.  He says he is prepared to meet the wishes expressed by certain members of the House although he is convinced there was nothing whatever in the point of view they put forward, that there was no justice or reason in the arguments put forward which would lead him to reduce the deposit below a minimum of £2,000.  One gathered from the Minister's statement that he had heard nothing on any stage of the Bill which would shake his determination to get it through in the form in which he had introduced it.  I want to put it to him that under paragraph (1) of the Schedule the imposition of this £2,000 deposit is going to have the effect of wiping out a very large number of small unions which are now doing, and have been doing for a considerable time, very useful work.  Members belonging to all Parties in the House are conversant with the activities of those unions in small towns.  They cater for town workers, for agricultural workers, and for road workers, and in a quiet way they have been able to do very effective work for their members. They have been able to do that without having behind them the vast financial resources which the Minister desires. In addition, they have to my own personal knowledge, been able to do very good work for the community.  On many occasions their efforts have <Col N="1112" /> helped to avert strikes.  When this measure is put into operation not one of these small unions will be left, because not one of them will be able to make a deposit of £2,000.  There is no prospect before them, therefore, except to be wiped out.</P>
      <P>I want to suggest to the Minister that the big unions, with the big financial resources, that he has in mind will not be over-anxious to cater for the type of workman whose interests were looked after by these small unions, so that what is really going to happen is that those men will become completely unorganised and disorganised.  They will have no legal right to negotiate with employers in a small town or village with a group of farmers in the country, or with the county surveyor or the assistant surveyors in the county council area.  In my opinion the Minister, under this proposal, is not only going to inflict a grave hardship on those men, but is going to do them a grave injustice.  I think he is unwise, to say the least of it, to be creating the precedent that if anything good is to be done for this county and its people it must have big financial resources behind it.  The Minister should remember that we had many organisations and societies in the country all of which proved their effectiveness at a particular time in our history.  If their effectiveness had to be determined by their capacity to put down a deposit of £2,000, they would not have remained very long in existence.  I hope that the new theory embodied in this Schedule will not be persisted in.  If the Bill goes through in its present form, then I say a large number of workers, particularly in the rural areas, are going to suffer severely.  Grave hardship and injustice are going to be inflicted on them.</P>

      <P>I am always prepared to consider an argument reasonably put, as it has been in this case to-day by Deputy Morrissey, and as it was put by certain other Deputies on Friday.  I want to say again that I do not think that the minimum sum set out in the Schedule is going to inflict any undue hardship upon responsible trade unions.  If, however, there are <Col N="1113" /> others, familiar with this problem, who take a different view, I am prepared to meet them, to some extent, and, accordingly, I will, if necessary, put down for Report Stage an amendment to reduce the minimum amount required, but that amount must still remain a fairly substantial one.  I do not expect, in the time available, that I shall be able to deal with particular cases under this amendment, so that I shall just have to fix a certain standard to which even the smallest and oldest unions will have to conform.  That is a usual condition in legislation.  We cannot legislate for particular cases.</P>

Perhaps we might have some co-operation on that little idea started by Deputy Morrissey &mdash;of having a little school of Parliamentary deportment so that those who have not Parliamentary manners might learn them, and so help to conduct business.  We hate to be putting the Minister into that frame of mind that he got into from time to time during the debates on this Bill.  We would like if he could help us to avoid doing that, and would even be prepared to sit at anybody's feet to learn.</P>

      <P>The Minister in the discussions on this Bill has been hugging a kind of delusion that it has been designed <Col N="1114" /> for the purpose of assisting Irish trade unionists.  During the discussions last week the Minister in a Napoleonic way announced that he was going to put the English trade unions in their place and make them subject to our law.  He spent quite a considerable time lacerating a well-known and highly thought-of secretary of a trade union&mdash;the National Union of Railwaymen.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to discuss the whole Bill.  In this Bill there are various stages for the trial and extinction of trade unions, but the Schedule may be described as the execution chamber.  It is the place where they are all lopped off, one by one, unless they can produce the cheques required by the Minister.  The Minister has sought to try and justify this Bill on the ground that it is one to help the Irish unions, but everybody knows perfectly well, everybody who has any experience of the trade union movement, that this Bill will do incalculable harm to Irish trade unions, that is, to organisations of Irish trade unionists with headquarters in Ireland.  In the main, with our sparse population, those are small organisations.  Their financial resources, except in a few instances, are not extensive, but, nevertheless, they have managed to do a vast amount of very useful work for their members.  They have raised the standard of living of those workers, and it seems to me that that is much more important than the kind of legislative embroidery which is turned out by this institution.  Putting more food on the tables of the workers, giving more food and clothing to the men, women and children of this country, is much more <Col N="1115" /> valuable, it seems to me in building up a small self-reliant nation, than a lot of the nonsense on which time is wasted in this House.</P>
      <P>We must look at this Bill through the Schedule, which is the most vital part of the whole Bill.  The Minister tries to pretend that this Bill will help the Irish unions.  He knows perfectly well that Irish unions, in the main, are very small organisations.  Deputy Cooney can confirm that.  He has not said one word on this Bill, although he knows perfectly well that what I am saying is true.  Deputy Cooney represents trade unionists in the City of Dublin, and he knows perfectly well that, in the main, the small unions are the Irish unions.  Those organisations will find it extremely difficult to raise the necessary deposit.  They are not well endowed with funds, and, under this Bill if passed in its present form, they will cease to exist.  I want to put one question to the Minister, and I will do my best not to annoy him in putting it.  Is it true that under this Bill a small Irish organisation with a membership of 500 or 1,000, if it cannot pay the £2,000 deposit which is provided for in this Schedule as a minimum, will be compelled to go out of existence unless it amalgamates with another organisation with which it does not want to amalgamate in the forcible way envisaged in this Bill?  If that is the effect on that organisation, would the Minister tell me what good purpose will at any time be achieved by putting that small organisation out of existence, and why it is necessary to introduce legislation of that gritty, sandy type at this time when one would think that good statesmanship and a telescopic view of our national problems would induce people to see that it is not desirable to throw spanners of that kind into the machinery, but that it is necessary to promote national unity and goodwill?  Will the Minister kindly answer those questions?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The minimum deposit here is £2,000.  The Minister's amendment does not deal with the problem under £2,000; it deals with the problem over £2,000.  I have asked a question in relation to the £2,000.  If a small Irish union cannot pay it, must it go out of existence?  When the only other union in that industry is an English organisation, that is one with headquarters across the Channel, must the Irish union go out of existence and amalgamate with the English organisation?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The point I am putting is this.  The Minister talked at length &mdash;I do not want to go over the whole ground again&mdash;about an Irish carpenter who was a member of the Irish National Union of Woodworkers, and we all know the background in which that kind of argument was set.  There are two carpenters' organisations in this country; one is the Irish National Union of Woodworkers, and the other is the Amalgamated Society of Woodworkers with its headquarters in Manchester. That is the organisation against which the Minister the other day almost invoked the Offences <Col N="1117" /> Against the State Act, and in regard to which he made a number of references which I think might, with prudence, have been avoided.  If the Irish National Union of Woodworkers cannot pay the £2,000 under this Schedule, I want to find out from the Minister whether they must go out of existence. I want to know from the Minister must they go out of existence, and must they amalgamate with the organisation which the Minister said sent an ultimatum to the Irish Government and threatened to make war on this State? That seems to me to be implied in this Schedule.  That seems to me to be the inevitable result of passing the Schedule in its present form.  The Minister pretends that he wants this Bill to help the Irish unions.  My interpretation of the Bill is that it will put that small organisation out of existence and compel it to amalgamate with the other organisation.  I want to ask the Minister this question.  Deputy Cooney ought to be asking him this instead of me.  Will that small Irish organisation be compelled to go out of existence if it cannot pay the £2,000? That is the net question, and the answer is either &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no.&rdquo; One word from the Minister will not delay the Bill much further.  The position is, of course, that the Minister does not want to answer.  He knows that the Irish organisation will be put out of existence and compelled to go into the other organisation.</P>

      <P>The general display by the Minister in so far as this Bill is concerned has been very unsatisfactory throughout.

      <NameTxt>Dr. Hannigan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that we are almost afraid to address ourselves to the problem.  So far as I can see, no adequate explanation has thus far been given as to why a minimum deposit of £2,000 should be extorted from the small unions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Hannigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know what the Minister is muttering about.  If he wants to intervene, surely he ought to adopt the regular procedure of the House and stand up.  As I said, no adequate explanation has so far been given.  It is readily recognisable that the object of extorting this £2,000, or attempting to extort it, as a deposit from a number of unions, is to wipe out those unions.  That is a matter which has been universally condemned by the Opposition in this House, and it is a matter which the Minister may feel certain will be opposed more forcibly and more determinedly by a much stronger opposition outside the House. Apart from the smaller deposit&mdash;if it may be so described&mdash;of £2,000, no explanation is given as to why sums varying from £2,000 to £10,000 are being insisted upon as deposits.  I would ask the Minister not to be so sparing in his words.  Admittedly, there have been prolonged discussions on various sections of the Bill, but that is just as it should be by reason of the fact that the Opposition is intensely interested in the measure, and that the measure has created nation-wide interest.</P>

Is the Minister in a position to give the House any information as to the number of such organisations in the country with a membership which does not exceed 2,000?</P>

Well, may I say&mdash;without wanting to be in any way offensive at all&mdash;that it seems to me that that would be one of the essential pieces of information that the Minister should have sought before he fixed on this sum of £2,000?  I am afraid&mdash;from my own, if you like, <Col N="1119" /> rather limited knowledge&mdash;that a very large number of organisations, with a membership of less than 2,000, are going to be affected by this Bill, and therefore the Minister should be in the position, in my opinion, to give the House some idea of the number of organisations in this country with a membership that does not exceed 2,000.</P>

      <P>It is just a euphemism for an entirely different operation. While this Bill purports to confer licences on certain persons to register, the real purpose of the Bill is to smash the small organisations which cannot pay a minimum of £2,000.  In the main, the small organisations which will be smashed are Irish organisations comprised solely of Irish trade unions, having headquarters in Ireland.  The bulk of them will be put out of existence by this Bill, which has such an apparently innocuous title.  I suggest the title should be:&mdash;&ldquo;A Bill to make war on small Irish trade unions and put them out of existence,&rdquo; because out of existence they will go under this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that the Minister, shortly after introducing this Bill, put down a number of amendments, and in view of the fact that, while the Bill was being discussed on Committee Stage, the Minister was still producing amendments, would he not consider leaving the next stage over until a later date than next week, so that we might have a look at the Bill in the light of the amendments made, and give the Minister an opportunity of putting in further amendments which experience of the debates may suggest as necessary or desirable?  In that way, we might have a much more cordial discussion on the next stage than the type of discussion we had during the past fortnight, because of the Minister's generally scattered thoughts on the subject.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has not had any scattered thoughts in regard to this Bill, but some sections of the House put down amendments to the Bill and then did not move them.  In the course of the debate, representations were made upon the points covered by the amendments and I indicated that I should consider them.  The Bill was very fully discussed in Committee.  Every aspect of it has been elucidated in the House and the amendments which I propose to put down&mdash;they are, as a matter of fact, in draft&mdash;will cover all the points raised.  There is no reason why the discussion should be interminably prolonged. We have already spent three weeks on the Committee Stage and, in the light of that, I think that it is reasonable to fix this day week for the Report Stage.</P>

      <P>This measure is not of urgent public importance and I do not think that the Minister has made the case that it is.  Apart from that, nearly every member of this Party, other than myself, will be engaged at the annual congress of the trade union movement next week.  That body will have a good deal to say on this measure and what it means to trade unionists.  If the Minister has any desire to accommodate the members of this small group, he might take that into consideration and agree to the postponement of the next stage until this day fortnight. That will not delay the final passage of the Bill or the trouble which may, subsequently, arise as the result of its coming into law, to any great extent.</P>

      <P>The point made by Deputy Davin is quite reasonable. The Trades Union Congress is a body which has the right to speak for trade unionists.  It might be helpful to the Minister and to the House if the Report Stage were deferred until the Trades Union Congress would have an opportunity of voicing its opinions on the Bill, particularly as the Minister has, on more than one occasion during the debate, told the House that the majority of trade unions and the majority of those who make up the Trades Union Congress were in favour of the Bill.</P>

The only figures which I gave to the House in relation to the Trades Union Congress had reference to the voting upon the resolution proposed by Mr. Marchbanks at the special session of the Trades Union Congress.  I indicated that, on his motion, 21 unions voted for the adoption of Memorandum No 2, and 18 against.</P>

      <P>I should have been very glad if the Minister, who was for a long period Minister for Industry and Commerce, had chosen to help the House during the discussion of the Bill. He might have had some contribution to give.  Here we are in the busiest portion of the year, so far as the business of the House is concerned, and so far as the work of a large number of Deputies is concerned, and we have spent seven days on this measure.  I do not know whether the Minister expects the Seanad to sit through August to deal with this Bill or whether that House will postpone consideration of the measure until autumn.  That would be the reasonable course.  With so many interests involved, with so many misunderstandings, and with so many people now awake to the implications of the Bill, we shall have a heavy discussion on Report Stage. When we consider how it has been discussed in this House, the Bill will probably be subjected to very considerable discussion in the Seanad. It is unreasonable from the point of view of Parliamentary time, on the one hand, and <Col N="1128" /> from the point of view of work in the country and the general run of seasons on the other, that a measure of this particular size and importance should be imposed on the House at this particular time of the year.  If this Bill is not to be discussed in the Seanad during the month of August, then I submit that there is no great rush about it and that the Report Stage might be postponed until after the Recess. However, that is another matter.</P>
      <P>From the point of view of discussing it next week, the Minister has pointed out that a large number of amendments were put down by one Party in the House and not moved.  So far as this Party is concerned, those amendments were on the Order Paper, and we anticipated they would be discussed.  As the amendments were not moved and no decision of the House was taken on them, after seven days' committee work here a very considerable amount of thought has to be given by this Party to the amendments to be put down for the Report Stage, if, as I understand, the Labour Party maintain their attitude with regard to amendments on the Report Stage, because of the reasons they expressed in the House, and will not move any amendments.  In the first place, there is a considerable amount of work to be done on the Report Stage.  In the second place, there is the point made with regard to the Trade Union Congress meeting next week.  In the third place, there is the point made by me, that we cannot expect a measure of this size and importance, with all the discussion which has ranged round it, to be dealt with by the Seanad before the Summer Recess. Therefore, I submit to the Minister that, if he wants to get the Bill through the Dáil before the Summer Recess, there may be a case for that, but that he could take the Report Stage the week after next.</P>

      <P>The Deputy admits that on Friday he sent his Deputies home while he held the fort himself. He challenged a division on every possible section, and he spoke on every possible section, sometimes three times. He has done that in regard to every section and every amendment to this <Col N="1129" /> Bill.  There are 28 sections in the Bill, which is a simple measure.  He has spoken on most of these on two, or sometimes three, occasions and duplicated that performance in relation to every amendment.</P>

      <P>The time of the House has been wasted by a deliberate policy of obstruction such as has not been witnessed in this House for a considerable number of years.  We have had divisions challenged on every amendment; we have had divisions challenged on every section; we have had divisions challenged on purely formal sections; and we had a division challenged to-day on the Title, and, as the House is aware, every division occupies at least 15 minutes.  To-day we are told that, because Deputies have other business to attend to, the business of the Government is to be held up.  I put it to you again, Sir, that it is fair and reasonable in all the circumstances to take the Report Stage of the Bill on this day week.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the personal point the Minister made that I stayed here on Friday holding the fort, I first spoke on Friday in a formal way at ten minutes to two. Early in the morning I made one remark, but only by way of elucidation of some point.  There were so many Deputies here on Friday to discuss matters and so much to be said, that the business was not concluded by 2 p.m. Never in the course of this <Col N="1130" /> debate during the seven days of Committee did I challenge a division on any of these things.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Hannigan</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I point out that the submission made by the Minister, that a postponement of the Report Stage was being sought because Deputies have other business to attend to, is a misrepresentation?  The main contention put forward by Deputy Davin for the postponement is that the Labour Deputies have to attend the Trade Union Congress which will be dealing with matters closely related to this Bill.  That is a reasonable request, and, if the Minister does not accede to it, his refusal can only be regarded as a continuation of his obstinacy and his unyielding attitude throughout.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister made precisely the same case in regard to the taking of the Committee Stage of the Valuation Bill.  That Bill was introduced in 1938.  The Minister said it was a very valuable Bill which would confer enormous benefits on the smaller ratepayers who would have their rates reduced because the valuations were to be lumped on to the wealthy folk and, consequently, they would ride away with small rates.  That was in 1938. The Bill has been on the Order Paper for three years, notwithstanding the enormous benefits it was to confer on these people.  This Bill confers no benefit on anybody.  Nobody has asked for it, nobody wants it, except the Minister and some of his advisers and, perhaps, the bosses.  Trade unionists have not asked for it; the workless have not asked for it; the emigrants have not asked for it; people faced with rising prices have not asked for it; folk who cannot get supplies have not asked for it.  Why, then, is the Minister pressing a Bill of this kind which nobody wants?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In any case, on its face, it cannot come into operation until six months after it is enacted and, as the Minister indicated during the Committee Stage, he is willing to arrange that it will not be brought into operation for a longer period.  What is the urgency about this Bill which nobody wants? Why can we not deal with something <Col N="1131" /> more serious?  What is the purpose of having the Report Stage next week? If the Minister imagines that he will get the Report Stage next week, I can tell him that he will not get the Report Stage for a few weeks.  What is the purpose of holding up the Dáil and the Seanad before the summer recess trying to pass a Bill which nobody wants and which, even when passed, you know perfectly well you cannot implement, because you dare not?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>

      <P>I move: That the Emergency Powers (Continuance) Bill, 1941, be now read a Second Time. The purpose of this Bill is to continue for a further year, up to 2nd September, 1942, the operation of the Emergency Powers Act.  Deputies will recall that the Emergency Powers Act was passed on the 3rd September, 1939, following the outbreak of the war.  It was limited to one year, that is, up to 2nd September, 1940.  In July, 1940, in view of the continuance of the war and the emergency conditions resulting therefrom, the Oireachtas passed a measure continuing the Emergency Powers Act up to the 2nd September next.  It is evident that the special powers conferred by the Act will still be required after that date and it is therefore proposed to extend the legislation up to 2nd September, 1942.</P>

      <P>I move the amendment standing in the names of Deputy Davin and myself.  It reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To delete all words after the word &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following words:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Dáil Eireann refuses to give this Bill a Second Reading until such time as this House obtains from the Government adequate assurances that the powers conferred on them by the Emergency Powers Act, 1939, will not be employed in future for the purpose of reducing real wages <Col N="1135" /> or of suppressing expressions of opinion concerning the social and economic consequences of Government policy.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach has said this legislation was originally enacted in September, 1939, and was re-enacted by a continuation Bill last year.  When this Act was discussed in 1939, a number of objections were raised to it, but, in the desire to give the Government all the powers that it reasonably required for the purpose of protecting the State, and in a belief that these powers would be used for that purpose and for no other purpose, the House adopted it, being apparently chloroformed into believing that the assurances which were then given by the Taoiseach and certain Ministers would be carried into effect.</P>
    <P>A perusal of the Parliamentary Debates in relation to the 1939 discussions will show at once that these assurances covered censorship, the exercise of personal liberty, industrial conscription, taxation and amendments of the existing statutes or an abrogation of existing statutes.  It might be well to deal with some of the matters which were then covered by assurances to see to what extent these assurances have been completely disregarded by the Government in the intervening period, how the Government have utilised the Emergency Powers Act for the purpose of doing things which it was never contemplated should be done under the Act as originally passed, and how, in particular, they have utilised the Act for the purpose of making it do things which were not adverted to when the Act was being discussed here in 1939 or in 1940.  When we discussed the 1939 Bill it was observed by most of the speakers that the Bill conferred on the Government very wide powers for the suppression of views as well as news. It was generally recognised, however, that the Bill was drawn practically word for word on the same lines as the British statute on the same subject and, being modelled on the British statute, there was a general understanding that its administration would not be any more rigid than the administration <Col N="1136" /> of a similar Act in Great Britain.  But, of course, facts have falsified that assumption.</P>
    <P>There was an emphatic assurance given by the Government that the power of censorship would not be used to prevent the publication of responsible criticism of Government policy or the discussion of subjects of internal administration not related to belligerency. The Minister for Supplies, who spoke on the Bill, said at the time:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is clear that in our circumstances it is necessary for us to take the powers which every neutral country takes in order to prevent use being made of its communications system, or its Press, or for the purpose of either attacking the morale or supplying material to belligerents or supplying military information to its enemies.  Generally, that censorship is necessary in order to ensure that the interests of this State will not be affected by any such uncontrolled use of our communications or Press.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>During the debate on the Bill Deputy T.J. Murphy, of this Party, envisaged a situation in which censorship of the Press might be used to prevent reports of the proceedings of Parliament being published in the Press.  Deputy Everett, also of this Party, in the course of the debate expressed the fear that even if the Executive Council, in their wisdom, condescended to recall the Dáil, the Press would not be allowed to publish any criticisms that might be directed against the Government in this House.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Supplies went to considerable pains to give assurances on these points.  He said, in column 119, volume 77, of the Parliamentary Debates:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is, I think, possible to say that only the minimum restrictions will be proposed at the outset.  Whatever tightening-up of those restrictions circumstances may necessitate will come gradually, and in the light of such circumstances.  I think I can assure Deputy Cosgrave that the censorship will not be used for the purpose of Party political advantage.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1137" /> Does anybody believe that to-day? Later in the debate the Minister for Supplies went on to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;...so far as we can secure it, it is our conscientious intention to prevent the censorship or any similar power being used for Party purposes.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>At column 168 in the same debate the Minister said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I think, in our circumstances, some control over the publication of news in the newspapers&mdash;information which might be of a military character and be of assistance to belligerents or detrimental to some other party engaged in hostilities&mdash; is necessary in our own interests.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In the course of the debate which then took place, the Taoiseach intervened to clarify what had been said in regard to censorship by the Minister for Supplies. In the course of his remarks the Taoiseach made it clear that expressions of opinion and discussions in the House would not come within the ambit of censorship.  It was then believed by everybody who listened to the Taoiseach that, so far as discussions in this House were concerned, the newspapers would not be prohibited from reporting anything which took place in this House.  In fact, the Taoiseach on that occasion crystallised his remarks in this way:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Taoiseach: If the idea is in connection with, for instance, controversies and expressions of opinion that would naturally take place here in this House about policy and so on, that sort of thing will have to be permitted, of course.</P>
    <P>Mr. Cosgrave: I would not put it further than that, taking such matters as are discussed in the House&mdash; for example, criticism of the Government in connection with the administration of the business side of those proposals, and so on&mdash;there will not be any censorship in respect of that?</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach: I think that understanding could be given all right.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Deputy Mulcahy intervened to say:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I take it that there will be no <Col N="1138" /> power in the censorship to prevent the publication in a newspaper here of anything extracted from the records of either House of the Oireachtas?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach then said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Discussions here in the House are privileged, and the publication of them, I take it, will be privileged also.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was the Taoiseach in 1939, dealing with the censorship.  He can scarcely know himself to-day as having uttered these views, in the light of what has happened in the intervening period.  It seems to me clear from these statements that the Government were willing to give assurances and, in fact, gave assurances that the censorship was intended for the purpose of preventing the publication of matters relating to the war situation and for no other purpose.  The British censorship is restricted even within these limits. As a matter of fact, if one wishes to discuss the censorship here <i>vis-a-vis</i> Britain, one can find the most candid criticism permitted even of Britain's war policy, while one cannot get into the Press here any statement unless it is well interleaved with admiration of the Government and the Government's policy.  However, towards the end of the debate, Deputy McGilligan put this question:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I ask definitely that we should get a guarantee of the continuation of Parliamentary meeting and Parliamentary privilege, that a man may speak his mind here freely and that there will be no imposition on him in any speech he makes here under any of these previous clauses with regard to censorship or anything else.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister for Supplies then intervened to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;So far as expressions of opinion are concerned there will be no such censorship.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is, of course, notorious that these undertakings have not been observed in the administration of the censorship. Regulations have been made on the authority of the censorship which are at complete variance with the undertakings given by the Taoiseach and Ministers at that time.  On January <Col N="1139" /> 28th, 1941, the powers conferred by the Emergency Powers Act were utilised for the purpose of making a special order declaring it an offence for any person to send out of this country by any means an uncensored message intended for publication and relating to any event arising out of or connected with the war, internal public order or the supply of commodities.</P>
    <P>During the discussion on the Trade Union Bill in this House about a fortnight ago speeches were made by two Deputies, Deputy Corish and myself, in connection with the Bill, in which we pointed out how unwise it was to try to force a Bill of that kind through the House.  We pointed out that it was unstatesmanlike to sunder our people on an issue of that kind at a time like this.  We pointed out that an impairment of national unity would be caused by any attempt to force through a measure of that kind in face of the widespread trade union and public opposition to it.  Because we regarded the measure as not expressing either the viewpoint of the country or of a democratic assembly, but merely the views of people who ought to know better and whose existence in this House in present circumstances constitutes a menace to national unity, we then said that we for our part&mdash;and the statement holds good to-day&mdash; would do all we could to prevent trade unions being regimented in the manner contemplated in the Bill.  I said that I would try&mdash;and I will still try&mdash;to persuade every trade union&mdash;and I think very little persuasion is necessary&mdash;not to take any notice of this Trade Union Bill.  In addition I know that the trade union congress, which will meet in Drogheda next week, will pass a resolution definitely declaring that it is not the intention to register under this Bill, or to take any notice of it.  The whole purpose of the Trade Union Bill has been to fetter and muzzle trade unions.  Why the Government insists on doing that I do not know.  Why they insist on it in the present circumstances passes my comprehension. It is the most foolish, shortsighted, and the most unstatesmanlike measure ever introduced in <Col N="1140" /> any Parliament in the world where democracy still obtains.  I feel I am entitled to say as a member of this House, fortified with some authority from the people, conscious of the responsibility which I thus derive, and of the effect of what I have said, that the trade unions will not recognise that Bill, and will not register under it.</P>
    <P>We got assurances from the Taoiseach and from the Minister that it would not mean censorship as far as publication in the Press of this country was concerned.  What happened?  The Press censor on the day following my speech, presumably acting under instructions issued by the Government, sent at least one telegram&mdash;I confine it to one, because a copy of it was handed to me by the paper in question&mdash;forbidding that newspaper to publish a speech made in this House.  I did not expect that the Government would agree with the speech I made.  That is not involved in this issue.  But we had explicit assurances from the Government that proceedings in this House would not be subject to censorship, and that being privileged here these statements were equally privileged in the public Press.  That was the assurance we got from the Government.  We have seen that that assurance was trampled upon.  We have seen that a telegram was sent in defiance of that assurance preventing proceedings in this House being reported in the Press or published, even in a paper which had a very natural interest in the fate of the Trade Union Bill and of the discussions in this House.  But that is not all.  A writer in a Catholic weekly newspaper, <i>The Standard,</i> contributed an article on the recruitment in Ireland of labour for export to Britain, now a very vital problem, and a matter of grave national concern to our people.  The article was held over for a week by the censor, and meantime the poster which contained the title of the article: &ldquo;The Man from England&rdquo;, was prohibited. A week later the article was released, presumably after the Government had considered the matter of its publication.  If the censor alone was responsible, I am inclined to imagine he would either prohibit publication of the article or permit its publication <Col N="1141" /> immediately.  If there was no necessity for a week's delay before releasing the article, that seems to me to indicate that there was some other influence at work, apart from that exercised by the censor in the course of his natural and legal functions in respect of censorship.</P>
    <P>Now we come to the question of the power which is inherent in the Emergency Powers Act to revoke and abrogate existing statutes.  On that subject the Taoiseach was equally emphatic. He said, during the same debate, at column 102: &ldquo;Our only reason for seeking these powers&rdquo;&mdash;that is the far-reaching, far flung, widespread powers of the Emergency Powers Act &mdash;&ldquo;is to have the right and the power to protect our people and their interests.&rdquo;  But the power conferred by the section is being used to abrogate the Trade Board Acts and to prohibit the making of agreements between employers and workers regarding rates of remuneration.  So, the powers which were to be used for the protection of our people and their interests have been utilised&mdash;perversely utilised&mdash;for the purpose of suppressing the Trade Board Acts and preventing even a trade union from exercising its natural, and up to recently, its legal right to negotiate on wages and conditions of employment with an employer on behalf of its members.</P>
    <P>Several other things were done under the Act which appear, in my view, to be completely outside the scope of its provisions as described by Ministers when the Bill was introduced.  A list of some of the things done would indeed be interesting.  For instance, according to the Taoiseach, the reason for seeking the powers set out in the Emergency Powers Act was to have the right and the power to protect our people and their interests.  Let us review the way in which we did that. We utilised that power for the purpose of amending the Public Holidays Act. We utilised it also for an amendment of the Summer Time Act.  We utilised it for the purpose of suspending the Civil Service (Transferred Officers) Compensation Act.  We utilised it for the purpose of amending the Coroners Act.  We utilised it for the purpose of amending the Conditions of Employment <Col N="1142" /> Act, so as to exclude turf workers from its scope.  We utilised it also for the purpose of amending the Methodist Church of Ireland Act which, by the way, was originally a private Act and not a public Act, and ought to have been amended by private Bill procedure. We utilised it also for the purpose of establishing a shipping company which ought to have been promoted in the ordinary way, by ordinary legislation.  We have utilised it, too, for the purpose of making an order authorising the postponement of the annual valuation of property carried out by the Commissioners of Valuation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact that so many things of so diversified a character have been done under this Act shows perfectly well that the Government regard the Emergency Powers Act, 1939, as continued by the Bill of last year, as something in the nature of a miniature Parliament, that they can stand on the Act and, standing there and declaring these things to be necessary, there is no fear there will be any criticism, as it is not even necessary for people to trip into the Division Lobbies to get through what is required.  All you have to do is simply to make an order under the Emergency Powers Act and you are immune from Parliamentary criticism. It is not even necessary to justify what you propose to do.  In the secrecy of a Ministerial sanctum, or in the still greater secrecy of the council chamber of the Government, you can make orders under the Emergency Powers Act and you can give these orders all the force of a legislative enactment and feel sure that that puts you above criticism for a considerable time.  Then the Parliamentary machine can be utilised in such a way as even to prevent or, at least, to restrict discussion on the wide variety of orders which may be made under the Emergency Powers Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We come now to a question of industrial conscription.  We got an assurance that there would be no industrial conscription but that, of course, has <Col N="1143" /> not been fulfilled either.  We have seen young men registering for employment at the employment exchanges, registering for employment which was not there.  They are faced with two alternatives, to go to Belfast or Britain and make munitions for Britain&mdash;and they can get there if they are willing to do that and agencies in this city will make sure they get passports&mdash; or they can join the Construction Corps for the low scale of remuneration there and subject themselves to military law.  If they refuse to go to Belfast or Britain to make munitions and run the risks of all the <i>blitzkriegs</i> there, and if they refuse to join the Construction Corps because of the low rate of wages that is offered to them, then they are deprived of unemployment assistance.  If they are deprived of unemployment assistance than they are left penniless.  So that the only alternatives are to go to Britain to make munitions or to join the Construction Corps.  If that is not industrial conscription I do not know what industrial conscription is.  The whole purpose of that procedure is to compel people either to go to Britain or to go to the Construction Corps.  But this is still a free country; we have not yet a compulsory system of labour camps which are usually associated with totalitarian States but so far as our young men who are seeking employment are concerned we have got the same type of mentality, even though we have not got the courage to declare openly that we stand for the same type of regimentation in respect of labour camps as exists in totalitarian States.</P>
    <P>It was sought, of course, to justify that procedure on the grounds that the Construction Corps is something comparable to the American civilian conservation corps.  It is no such thing.  The civil conservation corps in operation in America is something which ought not to be insulted by comparison with the thing we have established here.  The rates of wages and conditions of employment there are such that they never have the slightest difficulty in the United States of America in getting an adequate supply of labour for utilisation through the civilian conservation corps, whereas in our circumstances <Col N="1144" /> we compel young persons to join the Construction Corps and we pay them a scale of remuneration which, under present taxation limits, would not keep them in cigarettes each week, much less enable them to make any provision for those who, naturally, expect some contribution from them towards the maintenance of homesteads.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this measure, as indicated by the Taoiseach, when the Bill was introduced in 1939, was to have the right and the power to protect our people and their interests.  In the matter of the right to have the power to protect our people and their interests, the people have had very little opportunity of thinking for themselves. When it comes to protecting our people and their interests the people are not consulted.  Instead of that, the Executive Council do the thinking for them.  That is a very curious variety of democracy.  The Emergency Powers Act was given by this House to the Government in order to deal with the possibility that our liberties and our independence might be menaced and that we might find it necessary by the utilisation of exceptional measures, implemented expeditiously, to defend ourselves in such circumstances.  We have seen that Act, which was given to the Government for the purpose of enabling them to deal with the situation in which some other power desired to make war on our people, utilised by this Government for the purpose of making war on our people with a ferocity very little different from what one might expect from a foreign invader.</P>
    <P>The Emergency Powers Order No. 83 has been utilised by the Government, definitely and deliberately, to depress the standard of living of our people, to take food off the tables of our workers, to take clothes from the wives and children of our workers, to accumulate debts in the homes of our workers because of their inability to obtain sufficient wages to enable them to meet the present high cost of living.  That has been done under an Act the purpose of which, we were told in this House, was to protect our people and their interests.  That order, of course, <Col N="1145" /> was called the Stabilisation of Wages Order.  How you can justify the stabilisation of wages while you fail&mdash; and, apparently, deliberately fail&mdash;to stabilise prices passes my comprehension.</P>
    <P>We had, of course, in the early days of the emergency situation, round about the time we passed the Emergency Powers Act of 1939, a declaration by the Minister for Supplies that the Government had made a general standstill order in respect of prices, and that prices were being pegged down to the level in operation in August, 1939.  We have seen, since then, various orders made by the Minister for Supplies releasing practically every one of the pegged down commodities from the scope of the standstill prices order until the prices of many commodities have risen by 100 per cent. and by even more than 100 per cent.  In face of the Government's pitiful helplessness to control prices, I would like to know on what grounds they can justify the Emergency Powers Order No. 83, and, especially, on what grounds they can justify the making of it under an Act which they got, not to make war on the homes of the people and on their standard of living, but to protect the people of this country against the dangers of foreign aggression, and of a menace to our independence and liberty.  In any circumstances it seems to me that the stabilisation of wages would never be justified, because to do so means at once to pass judgment on the standard of wages in operation to-day.  If there should happen to be in any city ten employers, nine of whom were paying good wages, while the tenth refused to do so, thereby not acting fairly towards the other employers and most unfairly by exploiting his own workers, it seems to me that the State should never intervene to peg down wages to the low level paid by that tenth employer.  Under the Stabilisation of Wages Order, every employer in this country who does not play fairly with his own workers or with other employers in the same industry, can now rub his hands and say: &ldquo;Ah, the Government have now put their approval on the scale of wages <Col N="1146" /> which I pay because they will not permit me to increase it under Emergency Powers Order No. 83.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Was there any justification, though, for making an Emergency Powers Order in circumstances such as we have experienced in the last 18 months?  In September, 1939, when the Emergency Powers Act was passed, the cost-of-living index figure was 173, taking the base 100 at July, 1914.  By May of this year the cost-of-living index figure, taking the same base&mdash;100 at July, 1914&mdash;had risen to 220, so that in the intervening period there has been an increase in prices, even as measured within the narrow limits of the cost-of-living index figure, by over 26 per cent.  In face of the fact that prices have risen so rapidly, and that there is no apparent co-ordinating or efficacious method of controlling them, in circumstances of that kind, the Government choose to make this Emergency Powers Order No. 83, thereby forcing wages down to their present low levels and keeping them there, while permitting everybody else who produces goods for sale, wholesale or retail, to get increases in prices measured by over 26 per cent. as a minimum.  The prices of many commodities have risen by 100 per cent., and some by over 100 per cent.</P>
    <P>We can see from the scope of Emergency Powers Order No. 83 that prices have been permitted to rise with the most complete impunity, and, so far as one can understand by the indifferent attitude of the Government, with their complete approbation and unconcern.  While that is happening on the one hand, wage increase on the other hand have been refused.  The whole policy of the Government has been to keep wages down, which means that, while prices are rising, the standard of living of the workers of this country is being debased, and debased apparently as part of fixed Government policy.  I suggest to the Taoiseach that this Act, which was given to him by the Dáil with the gravest possible misgiving, was given only with the very definite assurance that it would not be utilised for the purpose of any extensive censorship on internal matters, that it would not be <Col N="1147" /> utilised for the purpose of imposing industrial conscription&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that it would not be utilised for the purpose of imposing taxation, that it would not be utilised for the purpose of any wide amendment of our basic statutes, or any wide abrogation of our basic statutes.  Nobody in this country ever dreamed at that time that the Emergency Powers Act would be utilised for the purpose of forcing down wages.  The House, however, is wiser to-day.  It has seen the provisions in the Act which the present Government utilised to do everything, from amending the Methodist Church (Ireland) Act, 1928, to suppressing the wages of workers and keeping them at a low level.  There is no indication yet as to the extent to which that Act may be utilised by the Government during the next 12 months.  I say to the Taoiseach that, having got that Act to defend the nation against aggression, to defend its liberties and preserve its institutions, it is an abuse of Parliamentary power and an abuse of governmental privilege, that it should be utilised, as it has been utilised, for the purpose of making war on the standard of living of the workers, and of debasing their standard of living to a new low level.  By some actions which the Government have taken under this Bill, they have done irreparable harm to national unity, and in circumstances in which national unity was never more necessary.  The Government, by their action in making Emergency Powers Order No. 83, have caused widespread discontent and disunity, because the people realise at once that, while they are being asked to listen to appeals from the Government to render service to the nation, the only reciprocity they get from the Government side is to see the powers under this Act utilised, not by way of indicating any appreciation of the services which the workers are rendering, but to see them used to debase their standard of living, to drive them back to the condition which it has taken years of struggle and sacrifice to free them from.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1148" /> We put down this amendment for the purpose of calling attention to what we regard as the very grave misuse of its powers by the Government under the Emergency Powers Act, an abuse of power in respect to censorship, an abuse of power in respect to debasing the standard of living of the workers, an abuse of power by utilising the Act for a purpose for which it was never intended it should be utilised.  We hope that the House will insist that, so far as the exercise of power under this Act is concerned, the Government will be required to give an assurance that the provisions of the Act will not be utilised for the purpose of reducing real wages or for suppressing opinions concerning the social and economic consequences of the Government's internal policy.  The present Act does not expire until September next.  The Government have plenty of time between now and September to think over the provisions of this Continuance Bill.  Unless they intend to utilise the Emergency Powers Act to suppress opinions which they dislike and to debase the standard of living of the workers, the Taoiseach can easily accept this amendment.  If, however, he has not had an abundance of time to think over the matter he can in any case postpone the Second Stage of this Bill until September, having introduced the necessary safeguards to ensure that the Act, when passed by the House, will not be misused like the 1939 and 1940 Acts.  The Taoiseach can then give the necessary assurances having satisfied the House that the Act will be utilised for the purpose of defending the nation against outside aggression and not for the purpose of creating economic mischief.  In such circumstances, the Government might very well get a measure on the basic principles of which all Parties in the House would agree.  I put down this amendment to indicate the dissent of this Party from the manner in which the Emergency Powers Act, as in operation now, has been abused.  I hope we will get from the Taoiseach an assurance that that abuse will be discontinued, so that all Parties may co-operate in giving the <Col N="1149" /> Government reasonable powers to deal with external aggression, the Government on its part giving an assurance that the Act will not be utilised for the purpose of depressing the standard of living of our people, and stifling criticism in a manner quite unworthy of a democratic State.</P>

      <P>In page 12, to delete Section 25, lines 40-47, and substitute a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>25.&mdash;(1) For the purposes of this section, the following shall be the statutory grounds for the removal of the holder of an office from such office, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) unfitness of such holder for such office,</P>
      <P>(b) the fact that such holder has refused to obey or carry into effect any order lawfully given to him as the holder of such office, or has otherwise misconducted himself in such office,</P>
      <P>and, in this section, the expression &ldquo;statutory grounds for removal from office&rdquo; shall be construed accordingly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(2) Where the appropriate Minister is satisfied as a result of any local inquiry that any of the statutory grounds for removal from office exists as regards the holder of an office, the appropriate Minister may <Col N="1153" /> by order remove such holder from such office.</P>
    <P>(3) Where the appropriate Minister is of opinion that any of the statutory grounds for removal from office exists as regards the holder of an office, the appropriate Minister may send by post to such holder at the principal office of the local authority under which such holder holds such office a notice in writing stating the said opinion, and if the appropriate Minister, after the expiration of seven days from the sending of such notice and after consideration of the representations (if any) made to him by such holder, remains of the said opinion, he may by order remove such holder from such office.</P>
    <P>(4) Where the holder of an office is convicted of an offence which, in the opinion of the appropriate Minister, renders him unfit for such office, the appropriate Minister may by order remove such holder from such office.</P>
    <P>This amendment is to meet objections which were raised here that officers who were being removed for misconduct would not have an opportunity of making their case.  The position now will be that an officer may be removed, first, after a local inquiry, at which he will have an opportunity of stating his case and giving any explanations he may have to offer; in the second case, he will be notified in writing of the Minister's opinion, and will have an opportunity of making representations; and the third case is that he can be removed after notification.</P>

      <P>In page 15, before Section 35, to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>35.&mdash;(1) In this section the word &ldquo;borough&rdquo; does not include a county borough or the borough of Dún Laoghaire or the borough of Galway.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(2) The Minister may by order divide any borough or urban district into two or more local electoral areas and fix the number of the members <Col N="1158" /> of the council of such borough or urban district to be elected for each such area.</P>
    <P>(3) The division of a borough or urban district into two or more local electoral areas made by an order under this section shall have effect for the purposes of the election held next after the making of such order and thereafter.</P>
    <P>(4) The number of members of the council of a borough or urban district to which an order under this section relates to be elected for each local electoral area at any election held after the making of such order shall be the number fixed in that behalf by such order.</P>
    <P>(5) In every borough in respect of which an order under this section is in force, there shall, as from the election held next after the making of such order, be two aldermen for and elected from every local electoral area in such borough.</P>
    <P>(6) The Minister may by order revoke, amend or modify an order under this section (including an order under this sub-section), and every such revocation, amendment or modification shall have effect for the purposes of the election held next after the making of such revocation, amendment, or modification and thereafter.</P>

      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  Last year employees of the Dublin Corporation, being dissatisfied with the decision of the corporation on an application for an increase of wages, withdrew their services.  Most of the employees were on the permanent staff and had pension rights.  The breach in service affected such rights.  When they resumed duty, the corporation made representations with a view to ensuring that the period of service rendered before the strike would continue to be regarded as pensionable service.  This Bill is intended to meet that request.</P>

      <P>There was a considerable amount in the speech of Deputy Norton with which I had to agree, but I find myself in this difficulty: though I am quite as conscious as he is of the manner in which the powers granted under this Bill have been abused by the Government, I still find it impossible to refuse a renewal of these powers to them.</P>
      <P>This Act was originally passed in September, 1939, immediately on the outbreak of war.  That was a time when the country and the House, as representing the country, were facing a very grave crisis.  However strongly I may feel regarding the manner in which the Government have abused the trust which the House then placed in them, I cannot see that we are not now facing a crisis at least as serious and as complex as, if not more serious and more complex than, the crisis with which we were confronted when we passed this Act in 1939.  Much as I should like to support the spirit of the amendment moved by Deputy Norton, I cannot take upon myself the responsibility of refusing the Government powers which were thought necessary to the safety, the continued government and, possibly, the existence of this country in 1939.  I am not aware that the situation has changed sufficiently in the meantime to justify a revision of the decision we then took.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is true that we have had experience, in the meantime, of the manner in which the Government has used <Col N="1167" /> these powers.  For many of us, the experience was by no means a pleasant one.  It is, perhaps, one of the drawbacks of giving practically unlimited&mdash; almost absolute&mdash;powers to a Government that there is a tendency, very rarely resisted, to overstep the limits of the understanding on which these powers are given.  I think that a certain amount of allowance could be made for reasonable overstepping of the spirit of the agreement which prevailed when these powers were first given.  But I think that the Government has far outstepped what most people on this side of the House who gave attention to the matter thought would be the use made of these powers. We find ourselves, at present, in a crisis at least as grave as that which existed when the powers were first given&mdash;a crisis which may hit us hard. Severely critical as I find myself bound to be of the conduct of the Government in its use of these powers, I still feel that whatever Government we have must have powers&mdash;even drastic powers&mdash;to deal with sudden emergencies and sudden situations which may crop up in present circumstances. For that reason and also for the reason that no indication was given in Deputy Norton's speech of the safeguards he really wants from the Government, I cannot support the amendment which he has moved.</P>
    <P>We are in the unfortunate position that, when we gave practically unlimited powers to the Government, we laid ourselves open to the charge that we were likely to be deceived in the way the powers would be used.  I do not see how we can evade that.  As regards the censorship, there might be some method of dealing with the powers the Government have but, on the whole, whether we like it or not, and whatever way we may feel regarding the manner in which the Government has honoured the promises given in 1939, I think we cannot withhold these powers from them.  The war is being brought much nearer our shores than any of us thought immediately likely in 1939 and it is not easy to see how the Government could be refused powers of this kind.  As <Col N="1168" /> regards guarantees, we thought we got guarantees from the Government in September, 1939, but the whole complaint of the Deputy who moved this amendment, and our whole complaint, is that these guarantees, however seriously meant at the time, have not materialised.  Whether we like it or not, it seems to me that we shall have to recognise the necessity for giving practically unlimited powers to the Government.</P>
    <P>Though past experience does not justify us in expecting that a wiser use will be made of those powers than has been made in the last 18 or 20 months, we can at least hope, not very strongly I will admit, that the Government will change their tactics.  We could not refuse those powers on the outbreak of the war, and I do not think there can be any serious question of refusing them now.  We may point out, as it is our duty to point out, to the Government the damage, as it seems to us, that has been done by the way in which those powers have been exercised. Therefore, as I have said, despite the disquieting experience that many of us have had, for instance, as to the use of the censorship, of the abuse&mdash;that is not too strong a word&mdash;of various powers given under this Act to the Government, I cannot find myself in a position to vote for the amendment.</P>
    <P>There is a danger always in giving absolute power to anybody.  I have often pointed out a tendency on the part of Governments, and particularly this Government, to think that, because they have legal authority to take a certain action, therefore, they are justified in taking that action.  I think they have acted in that way beyond all reason where the censorship was concerned. Though we had recent instances of it, unfortunately, I do not intend to repeat what was said here on the motion that was put down in connection with the censorship.  It is an amazing position&mdash;candidly, I do not think it is a healthy one, and I put this to the Government in all seriousness&mdash;that in one of the most vital matters, in practically most of the vital matters, affecting the future material and spiritual fate of this country, no public discussion is allowed.  I can well <Col N="1169" /> understand, and I do not underestimate at a time like the present, the danger of unrestricted discussion.  It may endanger our position; it may endanger our neutrality.  But I think that the Government have carried the matter altogether too far in that respect. They have become so timorous that they almost invite slaps in the face from outside Powers.  By their conduct, it seems to me they call almost for treatment of that kind at the hands of unscrupulous people.  As I say, in a matter affecting the whole spiritual and material well-being of this country, I wonder whether it is wise that we should drift&mdash;and by we I mean, of course, all of us who are interested in public matters and the public&mdash;into the unhealthy position of having no opinions whatsoever.  I am quite aware that a man can hold whatever opinions he likes.  But, it is not easy to get a healthy public opinion unless there is some kind of discussion.  I put it seriously to the Government that they ought to consider that side of the matter and considerably relax the hold they have on the expression of public opinion in this country.</P>
    <P>I do not want to exaggerate, because I feel that nothing is to be got by exaggeration in a matter of this kind. I will admit that it is a balancing of evils.  I do not think that can be avoided.  But I fear that permanent damage, as well as some immediate damage, is being done to the mind of the people by the manner in which that power of censorship has been exercised. I would further say that damage is being done, not merely to parliamentary institutions&mdash;perhaps for the moment that is not the most important thing&mdash;but to governmental institutions by the excessive use of the censorship.  It is quite true that criticisms of Ministers have been suppressed. Possibly, Deputy Norton was not far wrong when he stated that no big question of public policy may be discussed unless there is laudation of the Government.  That may be good in the sense at least of being triumphant for a short time, but the people get very suspicious.  If there was a little more exercise of common sense in the manner in which the censorship <Col N="1170" /> is applied, I think you would have a healthier tone in the country, and I feel that the Government themselves would be in a stronger position than they are to-day.  As I have said in many debates here, I consider the break-down of governmental machinery, the break-down even of respect for the Government that I think I see around me, at any time is bad, but in the present crisis it may well be catastrophic.</P>
    <P>The powers were granted to enable the Government to deal with a variety of matters indicated roughly by the various Ministers when the original Bill was passing through this House, but certainly they were all expected to be grave and urgent matters.  It was not, I think, contemplated at the time, that these powers should be used as a kind of substitute for Parliament, and I do not think the Government should use them now in that way&mdash;as they are using them.  Let me take one instance &mdash;from many&mdash;where I think there was an abuse of those powers quite recently and an abuse that was not advantageous either to government&mdash;I am not now referring to the Fianna Fáil Government; I mean government&mdash;or to Parliament.  That was the celebrated Order No. 83.  There was a problem&mdash;I would be the last to deny that there was a problem&mdash;a very serious problem requiring the very best consideration that the different Parties in this House could give it.  Undoubtedly, there is danger of a vicious spiral of prices and rises.  But, surely, having waited for some 18 months before we thought it necessary to introduce an order under this Act, was there not plenty of time to deal with that matter&mdash;I admit it is important, that it is of grave importance, if you like&mdash;by means of ordinary legislation, so that the House and the country could have had an opportunity of hearing the case put up for the particular measure that was proposed, and the remedies could be discussed and the implications of the measure discussed?</P>
    <P>Instead of that, what happened? Utilising the power given to them under this Act, the Government introduced this standstill order.  There could not be, and there was not, adequate discussion or consideration <Col N="1171" /> of that order in this House.  Now, why was that done?  What was the urgency? That is a matter that everybody must have foreseen.  Even some of the Taoiseach's Ministers must have foreseen&mdash;and the Lord knows their foresight is sorry enough&mdash;that that was a problem that was bound to arise.  They saw a neighbouring country engaged in the war dealing with that problem&mdash; one of the first things it attacked. Why, then, was time not taken by the forelock?  Why was a measure not introduced so as to give full time for discussion, amendment and improvement, and for suggesting the various other things that ought to accompany that particular measure?</P>
    <P>The difficulty is, as I say, whatever may have been the good intentions of Ministers when they gave their various pledges in September, 1939, there is an almost irresistible temptation&mdash;and the Government certainly have not shown any desire to resist it&mdash;to use this Act for all sorts of purposes for which it was certainly not intended at the start. Some of them were quite trivial but, even so, the measure should not have been used for purposes of that kind. Deputy Norton gave some instances, I need not go into others, but certainly the measure has been used for a series of matters such as the standstill order, for which, when the powers were given, it never dawned upon the people or this House that it would have been used.  May I say in fairness to the Government that, in September, 1939, it did not seem to dawn upon them that it would be used for these purposes? But none the less what we are having now is the supplanting of Parliament in the consideration of measures by Departments.</P>
    <P>If anybody has watched the political tendency here and elsewhere&mdash;it is this country I am interested in now&mdash;for some years past, he will have noticed a growing disposition amongst Departments to think that they are all-wise. They are now, I will admit, almost legislatively omnipotent as a result of the powers given here, but unfortunately they always think they are all-wise, whereas the country is getting into a position in which people are <Col N="1172" /> beginning to think that Departments know precious little about the practical problems of the country.  Yet this Act has been used to prevent various measures getting the impact of the views of Deputies in this House who have touch with the country.</P>
    <P>I would impress upon the Government to consider their position in that matter.  I do so, not because I am particularly interested in this Party or that Party, but because I do not like, in fact I am very anxious about and very much afraid of, a certain development that it seems to me is taking place in this country.  I am not referring now to the efforts made in various quarters to undermine Parliamentary institutions.  That is serious and I wonder whether the number of people who indulge in it consider what would be the fate of the privileges that they now enjoy if their campaign came to a successful issue.  However, much more serious than that undermining of Parliamentary institutions, it seems to me, is the growing disrespect for Government institutions.  Now we can do, any country can do, without a Parliament.  I do not think if we were to do without one for long that this country would be well-off.  On the contrary, I think that it would become more and more helpless as regards government.  But certainly what no country can do without is a Government and a Government that enjoys the respect of the people.  What is on trial at the present moment is, as I said before, not Parliamentary institutions, because most of the power has already passed from the hands of the Dáil into the hands of the Government.  What is on trial at the moment, strange to say, is bureaucratic government.  I think it should be the effort of the Government to resist as far as it can that almost irresistible temptation: Having got powers legally, practically without limit, having the full support of their Party&mdash;though I recognise how hard it is to overcome that temptation of using them to the full&mdash;I pray them, in the interests of the smooth and efficient working of governmental institutions in this country, to reconsider their whole attitude in this matter.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1173" /> Immense powers were given to the Government not merely to ensure the safety of this country against external attack&mdash;we are all willing to give all the support we can to the Government in its general policy of keeping out of this trouble&mdash;but to preserve internal order.  In addition, power was given to enable them to see that the needs of the country were properly provided, that the people of the country were properly fed and properly clothed. Power was further given to them to deal with the expression of opinion.  I put it to the Government that they have been much more efficient in the suppression of opinion than they have been in the exercise of some of the other powers, at least with those powers that deal with providing supplies for the people of the country. There is no comparison between the efficiency with which they have exercised their power of censorship on the one hand and their immense power to provide supplies, control prices, etc., on the other hand.  I do not think that is healthy and it is a matter that I would ask the Government seriously to consider because I do believe that their whole attitude, both as regards censorship on the one hand and the supplying of the very obvious needs of the people on the other hand, does require serious reconsideration.  It is lamentable, considering the immense powers of this kind that were given to the Government, that there is a feeling in the country as far as I know it&mdash;again it is something I regret&mdash;by no means bounded by any particular Party lines, that Departments have fallen down on their job.</P>
    <P>The censorship was, as I thought, to be used&mdash;and I am not denying that sometimes it has been so used&mdash;to prevent us getting into loggerheads with any of the belligerent countries.  But equally well, I fear that censorship has been used merely to cover the general policy of the Government, where that policy should have been open to full criticism.  The fact that we feel it necessary to present a united front to any outside Powers does not mean that there ought not to be the fullest discussion&mdash;that the Government, <Col N="1174" /> even in a crisis like this, ought not welcome discussion&mdash;on the very grave internal problems that are confronting us.  I wish we could get rid of the idea that Departments know everything; that the man down the country, the man in the city, the labourer, the businessman and the farmer, do not know what they are talking about, whereas men here in Dublin, be they Ministers or otherwise, who are removed from all practical touch with the daily problems that confront the people in the town and country, are omnipotent, that they know everything, and there is no necessity to pay attention to the so-called grumblers in the country.</P>
    <P>I think we can, at least, congratulate ourselves on one thing, namely, that the grumbling&mdash;though it is there and there is at the back of it something I regret, and that I would pay still more attention to, a sense of disillusionment &mdash;has certainly, up to the present, not taken a form to which anybody could have the slightest objection.  But that is no reason why it should not be attended to; that is no reason why it should not be voiced.  I know perfectly well&mdash;I suppose it is inherent in human nature&mdash;that if you give a man power to suppress criticism of himself, even the suppression of the opinions of others, he will suppress them.  Therefore, it should have been the business of the Government to see that that natural tendency was resisted, that only on the rarest occasions should there have been interference with the expression of opinion; that, instead of the censors looking here and looking there for something to suppress, for something in reference to which they could hit a man on the head, they should try to find reasons why even what looked doubtful expressions of opinion could be allowed.</P>
    <P>The easier thing is to do the other; the easier thing is, when you see an opinion, suppress it, and human nature is so constituted that that temptation will not often be resisted.  But though that is the easier method, though at the moment it promises a certain amount of success, and it does deal with the immediate problem&mdash;&ldquo;This troublesome fellow may say a certain thing, but nobody will read it because <Col N="1175" /> we will not allow it to be read&rdquo;&mdash;in the long run I do not think it is wise, even in a time of crisis.  You will get a healthier spirit if there is a relaxation of the censorship.  We have already expressed our views on that matter in the rather short debate that took place here some months ago.  I am not aware that there has been any improvement; I am not aware that there will be any improvement after this.</P>
    <P>I have looked in vain since this debate started&mdash;and remember, there is an amendment down by Deputy Norton and Deputy Davin&mdash;for the appearance of the Minister responsible for censorship in this House.  As I am particularly anxious, not exactly to express an opinion of what I think of the Government by way of a vote, which anybody who has not been in the debate can do, but to persuade the censor&mdash;that is the Minister responsible for censorship&mdash;to grant some relaxation, and seeing that censorship was one of the principal things to which attention was directed in the amendment, is it not peculiar that the Minister responsible for censorship thinks it well to absent himself from the House during the whole of this debate, up to the present at least?</P>
    <P>I do not think it is a good augury. He must know, even though he has only recently returned from abroad, how the censorship is regarded by many people.  The dissatisfaction with the censorship antedates his foreign expedition. He must know the grave dissatisfaction that is felt.  We, of the Opposition, are in this unfortunate position, that we do not know, except by hearing it casually in the House from Deputy Norton, that one of the Labour papers got a note from the censor.  We do not know what instructions have been given to the Press; we do not know what is censored and what is not censored.  If we could rely on the good sense&mdash;and it is a question of good sense&mdash;of the Minister, who will, now that he has returned, be still, I presume, responsible for this particular office&mdash;if we could rely on his good sense or on any improvement in the administration of these powers, we might feel easier in our minds.  But <Col N="1176" /> we have to rely-and again I do not think it is fair to responsible Deputies &mdash;on gossip, which we cannot always test.  Sometimes we can test it, but certainly we are not in a position to test a great deal of it because we know perfectly well that if a newspaper gets instructions from the censor and they are revealed to us, so much the worse for that paper in the future.</P>
    <P>That does not create what, above all other things, we ought to strive to create at present, a healthy public mind.  I think it does the opposite, especially when there is a question on which Ministers and their measures are attacked and criticised.  A statement would have to go far in the way of endangering, or appearing to endanger certain values, before suppression should take place.  I fear that it is impossible for the public, and for reasonably-minded people, sometimes to avoid the conviction, that what might seem an indiscretion of expression of opinion here in this House is used to cloak a criticism of the Ministers. Anyhow, as long as censorship is applied as it is at present, I cannot see how that suspicion can be avoided.  You may get over your temporary inconvenience of having measures with a lack of foresight criticised but, in the long run, you are only piling up the waters of discontent and possibly creating more difficult problems for the future.</P>
    <P>I have tried to avoid as far as I could any exaggerated statements, any employment of condemnatory adjectives or anything of that kind, because I would like to impress on the Government, even at this hour, the wisdom of going much slower in the way in which they apply this Act.  They are the Government of this country.  We are facing a crisis and far from being out of it I am afraid it is, at least, as imminent to-day and more so, I believe, than when we first gave these powers. Therefore, speaking for myself, I do not see how I could vote against these powers being granted, but in the interests, not of any particular Party but of sound administration and respect for Government institutions, and on account of the confidence that the country ought to have in whatever <Col N="1177" /> Government is responsible for its destinies, I think there should be some indication from the Taoiseach as to the manner in which he intends to apply this Act in future.  I am not asking him now to do penance, for I know that it is a waste of breath to suggest that there was the slightest mistake made by himself or his Ministers.  I am not interested in that.  I am interested in the future.  The suggestion that there has been any abuse of these powers carries no weight with the Taoiseach.  I feel that that is one of the alarming symptoms of the situation, but at least let him put the past aside if he likes and indicate quite clearly that these legislative powers are not to be used except in times of grave and sudden emergency, but certainly not used to take the place of ordinary legislative procedure when there is plenty of time for that legislative procedure to be adopted.</P>
    <P>These are some of the matters that I should like to put before the Government. It would be easy to say a number of cutting things about the character of the Government and the way they have abused their powers. I candidly confess that I would be much easier in my mind if I could see any indication on the part of any Minister or the Government that they are really willing and anxious to face seriously the many problems that confront us.  One of the most disquieting things is that there is no evidence of that, that I at least can gather, on the part of the Front Bench, no foresight, no real tackling of problems, no effort to take any advantage of any criticism offered here, no effort to get rid of thinking that a few glib remarks made here in the course of debate will solve the serious problems of the nation as a whole, of the different classes in the nation and especially of the poor.  Glib remarks of that kind are all very well in their own way.  Unfortunately they do not solve anything, and equally unfortunately they do not convince anybody that the Government is ready seriously to face the problems that confront the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JeremiahHurley" hpid="Mr. Hurley Mr. Hurley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hurley</NameTxt>
      <P>It was rather hard to understand Deputy O'Sullivan's speech. He would not deny the powers given <Col N="1178" /> in this Act to the Government, but then he criticised them on the lines of the amendment.  The amendment does not deny giving all legitimate and reasonable powers to the Government, but refuses to give the Bill a Second Reading:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Until such time as this House obtains from the Government adequate assurances that the powers conferred on them by the Emergency Powers Act, 1939, will not be employed in future for the purpose of reducing real wages or of suppressing expressions of opinion concerning the social and economic consequences of Government policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Surely Deputy O'Sullivan, after his speech, can agree with the amendment, because the line he took up was definitely the line adopted in the amendment. Nobody denies the Government power to deal with the defence of the country or, as used to be said, against all enemies, foreign and domestic, but can it, by any stretch of the imagination be considered that the powers which were assumed under Emergency Powers (No. 83) Order, came under that category?  There is no denying that that order hit directly at the standard of living of workers.  That statement cannot be challenged here or outside this House.  The people look upon that order as a definite attack on their standard of living.  I cannot understand why that type of legislation, legislation by order, was invoked to deal with Emergency Powers (No. 83) Order.  If the Government thought fit to deal with the question of wages in the manner we were told they wanted to deal with it, why did they not bring in an ordinary Bill?  As a matter of fact, to show how farcical that order was, the Minister on reconsidering the points in that order, and on listening to the debate in the House, agreed to bring in amending orders to amend it.  I, for one, am definitely against that type of legislation, legislation by order.  It is a very dangerous tendency in any democratic country. It leads to bureaucracy.  It leads to legislation by Government Departments which are completely out of touch with the feelings, wishes and hopes of the ordinary people of the <Col N="1179" /> country.  That is the type of legislation to which we object.  It is the type of legislation which should not be implemented under emergency powers.  If you were to bring that to its logical conclusion, the next thing that would happen is that the Dáil could be abolished, closed down, and all the work of the House could be done by legislation by order under the Emergency Powers Act.  We are tending towards very dangerous, shaky ground in this Act.  While we recognise that the defence of the country is absolutely essential, and that all Parties are united as far as possible for the defence of the country, under this Act orders are made which, while this House is functioning, it should be the prerogative of this House to debate and to decide rather than that they should be flung across the House and across the people by order.</P>
    <P>To-day a very simple Bill, the Local Officers and Servants (Dublin) Bill, 1941, was brought in here and debated and, I am sure, will be passed in the course of the week.  This Bill concerns a number of workers in Dublin whose continuity of service in the employment of the Dublin Corporation has been broken by reason of a strike that took place.  But you had very important legislation brought in as an order which would not come before the House but for the annulment motion put down by the Labour Party.  In the one instance you had a Bill dealing with the fortunes of a number of workers here in Dublin.  In the other, you had an order dealing with workers throughout the whole Twenty-Six Counties.  The Government took the easy way out by implementing what they wanted done by order and, as I say, the House would not and could not have an opportunity of discussing one line of that order but for the annulment motion put down by the Labour Party. When we see things like that happening I think it is about time the Government should give a definite assurance that as far as matters affecting the social and economic life of this country are concerned, they should be dealt <Col N="1180" /> with by the ordinary methods of legislation through this House.</P>
    <P>During the operation of this Act we had Orders made on such matters as the amendment of the Public Holidays Act, the amendment of the Summer Time Act&mdash;and summertime is a rather contentious subject in different parts of the country&mdash;the suspension of the Civil Service (Transferred Officers) Compensation Act, 1929; the amendment of the Coroners Act, 1927&mdash;we had an instance in Cork which gave rise to a good deal of criticism, and rightful criticism, where the holding of an inquest was suppressed and the public were suspicious that matters were not really above board&mdash;amendment of the Conditions of Employment Act so as to exclude turf workers from its scope.  We had one referred to by Deputy Norton, the amendment of the Methodist Church of Ireland Act, 1928, which was a Private Act.  We had the establishment under the Emergency Powers Act of an Irish shipping company.  I do not know by what manner of reasoning the Taoiseach can tell us that these were matters which concerned the defence of the country, either internally or externally, or matters which could not be debated in the House.  We spent a whole week on one reading of the Trade Union Bill, which nobody in the country wants, and then we have orders slashed out in all directions because the Government think fit to use the powers they got under this Act.</P>
    <P>For those reasons we are asking the House to adopt this amendment.  The Act does not fall in until September. The Government will have time in the meantime to consider and review some of the orders that they have passed during the period this Act has been in operation and by a little reflection they surely will come to the conclusion that such things are not necessary where a Parliament is functioning in a democratic country, although we are in a very serious emergency.  Nobody denies or questions the seriousness of the emergency.  We quite agree with everybody in this House that it is serious but, at the same time, while you have a Parliament functioning, surely it is the right of that Parliament <Col N="1181" /> that legislation concerning the social and economic and internal life of the nation should come before it and be debated in the ordinary way.</P>
    <P>The question of censorship has been pretty fully dealt with both by Deputy Norton and Deputy O'Sullivan.  People are not inclined to believe what they read in the papers or anything they hear now because they know the censorship is so rigid even on ordinary internal matters.  They come to the conclusion that there is something being kept back.  The result is that you have crops of rumours spreading all over the country.  You have crops of rumours in Cork as to what is happening in Dublin, and <i>vice versa</i>, rumours in Dublin of what is happening in Cork. If the public could be assured that the censorship would be used in a reasonable fashion I venture to suggest that it would allay that suspicion, that distrust and doubt that operates in the minds of the ordinary people of the country.  Surely we still have some consideration for the people of the country.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party very seriously put this amendment to the Government and to the House in the hope that, on reconsideration of the orders and of all that has been done under this Act for the past 18 months, they will come to realise that, even though we are in a very serious position and that the emergency is very close to us, at the same time, the operation&mdash;shall I call it the wrong operation?&mdash;of such powers will cause a very serious position in the country.</P>
    <P>The outstanding example of that was the standstill order with regard to wages.  That order had to be followed by amending orders so as to meet points made in the debate.  On reconsideration the Minister for Industry and Commerce saw that it was necessary to put these in, but the order could not be amended as an ordinary Bill.  It had to be amended by the passing of further orders.  I, personally, am definitely opposed to legislation by order.  It is a very dangerous tendency in a democratic State.</P>

      <P>Before I come to discuss the amendment, there is a legal point on which I desire to get assistance from the Taoiseach and his advisers. <Col N="1182" /> This measure is one which will interlock with the provisions of Article 28 of the Constitution.  Like the one which it succeeds, it has a time limit.  It will end in September, 1942, if not further renewed.  Let us assume a situation in which the war will have ended before September, 1942, and in which there is no necessity for an Emergency Powers Act, what is going to be the situation with regard to people who have been treated under some of these Emergency Powers Orders?  There is, for example, power to take over, temporarily, people's property without paying anything for it.  I assume that no action can be brought&mdash; that Article 28 forbids any action being brought&mdash;until after the conclusion of the emergency, to enable people to get paid for property taken during the period of the emergency.  But suppose the Government hang on, then, I take it, that after the emergency they will be subject to the ordinary law and will have to pay.  I have recently seen a Turf Order in which, for the sake of bettering the position with regard to turf supplies, it was made possible for the Government or a local authority not merely to seize a person's land but to construct a light railway on it.  If the light railway is built during the period of the emergency the landowner cannot complain.  But when the emergency ceases, is he to be handed back his good land, or land that is encumbered with a light railway which he does not want?  I presume that if it is left there a moment after the emergency ceases the landowner will be entitled to go to the courts and get an order arising out of the devastation which continued to be done either by the Government or a local authority. I would like to have that matter considered and an answer given.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Previously, when the Constitution was being amended for the second time, I desired to find out how far the prohibition in Article 28 went.  The Constitution was amended so as to make it clear that one could not take an action to nullify any act done, or purporting to be done, in a time of war or armed rebellion, in pursuance of any law passed of this emergency type.  I am interested to hear that particular question answered, because of its reactions <Col N="1183" /> upon one matter on which members of the Labour Party spoke, and spoke with just resentment.  They referred to the stabilisation of various things&mdash;the bonus to civil servants and employees of local authorities, and of wages under the Emergency Order.  In addition to civil servants being treated in the way they were, there was passed an order which suspended the operation of a particular piece of legislation dealing with transferred officers.  When the emergency ceases, will that particular piece of legislation, which was suspended and not abrogated, come into full force?  Are we to take it that the position with regard to transferred officers is this: that while they cannot seek to nullify the suspension, they can put themselves in the position that after the emergency they can get reestablished to themselves all the rights and monetary compensation that they have been defeated in during the emergency?</P>
    <P>With regard to Order No. 83, which has been the subject of so much controversy in the House, as I read it, it is made up of two parts, one which relates to companies and the other which relates to employees.  The operative words in the two sections are, of course, distinct.  With regard to companies, the prohibition is that there shall not be a distribution of dividends greater than 6 per cent.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce, at the recent function which he attended at Clondalkin Paper Mills, said that the order did not prevent companies from making much more than 6 per cent.  It only prevented a distribution of more than that.  With regard to employees, the co-equivalent of the word &ldquo;distribution&rdquo; is the word &ldquo;pay&rdquo;.  The point has been made that it is up to an employer, who has contracts with his staff on a rising basis, to set aside so much of that money as will enable him, after the emergency is over, to pay it out.  Can the order be interpreted to read that a man shall not be prohibited from hiring a worker, although that word is not used in the order, at an increased rate, but only means that he cannot pay out, during the period of the emergency, wages that he had, so <Col N="1184" /> to speak, contracted to pay to an individual if they were on a rising scale? It seems to me that there is some force in the argument that has been put up, a force that was not seen at first to be in it.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce pointed out that the apt word with regard to companies had been used in the companies section: that what was prohibited was not the making of sufficient money to enable a company to pay greater dividends, but merely the distribution during the emergency of a greater dividend than 6 per cent.  The assurance seemed to be given that a company could charge such prices as would enable it to put aside money so that there could be, after the war, a distribution of suspended increases beyond the 6 per cent.</P>
    <P>I would like to have the position with regard to this standstill order on wages cleared up.  Is it intended to deal equally as between employees and companies?  If a company may charge such prices for its products as will enable it to put aside big moneys, more than sufficient to pay, say, the 6 per cent., is the order equally balanced with regard to employees: that an employer may do as is being done on the other side, put their extra emoluments into saving certificates for them&mdash;extra emoluments which his employees had earned from him under contract?  Are the prohibitions contained in the order equally balanced, that an employer may not pay out to his employees during the emergency anything above the wages they were in receipt of on a specified date, and that a company may not distribute a dividend higher than the 6 per cent?</P>
    <P>As far as I am concerned, I consider the Labour Party amendment to be thoroughly justified.  If anything it suffers from this, that in present circumstances it cannot be anything more than a demonstration.  I do not know what assurances from the Government would be regarded as adequate with regard to real wages, and as no longer denying the expression of opinion on the social and economic consequences of Government policy.  When the Government asked for this Emergency Powers Act in 1939, they would not have dared to tell the House that one <Col N="1185" /> or two of the consequences of the passing of that Act would be that they would reduce real wages or suppress the expression of opinion concerning &ldquo;the social and economic consequences of Government policy&rdquo;.  They would not have dared to tell the House then that that was their objective.  If one searches through the statements which were made when those powers were sought in 1939, I do not think there will be found anything which comes faintly near recognising that either of those things was in the Government's intention at that particular time.  It is quite clear that the wages order definitely does operate in breaking down the real wage.  We have an attempt, through the Budget, to deal with what are called excess profits, but there has been no attempt here, although there has been in other countries, to deal with excess incomes.  As far as the poorer sections of the community are concerned, it will mean a lowering of income as prices increase.  If the nominal wage still continues to be paid, its purchasing power definitely goes down, and real income is defeated.  The Labour Party have recited in the House a list of what the Government has done under the Emergency Powers Act. They have given the details.  Deputy O'Sullivan I think has phrased it in more general terms&mdash;that they have tended to look upon the powers given to them under the Emergency Powers Act as a substitution for the Dáil. Section 2 of the Emergency Powers Act, 1939, which is the clause generally under which the Government takes its powers, says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Government may, whenever and so often as they think fit, make by order...such provisions as are, in the opinion of the Government&rdquo;&mdash;</P>
    <P>this is to be the motive behind all orders&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;necessary or expedient for securing the public safety or the preservation of the State, or for the maintenance of public order, or for the provision and control of supplies and services essential to the life of the community.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>How, or under what heading, does the Taoiseach bring in the order that was mentioned here about the Methodist <Col N="1186" /> Church?  It is certainly not for the preservation of the State.  It is not for securing the public safety.  It is not to maintain public order.  Is it possible that it is contended to be &ldquo;for the provision and control of services essential to the life of the community&rdquo;? If it is not that, it cannot fit under any of the headings.  There was a further order which was referred to here with regard to coroners&mdash;the change of the Coroners Act.  Let the Taoiseach take any one of those matters which have been referred to by Deputies Norton and Hurley; will he fit any one of them easily under any of those heads under which he must bring an order if he is to be inside the principles of this Act?  And this is the Act that we are asked to continue.  I suggest to the Taoiseach that if he looks at it he will find that he has drifted into the habit of regarding the situation developed under the Emergency Powers Act as simply a substitution for government by the authority of the Dáil and Seanad.  Some of those things do not matter; the particular order about the Methodist Church does not matter, and may have been an ease to that particular community, but it was an abuse of the powers that were given under that Act.</P>
    <P>I feel all the more strongly on this Labour amendment because of this. When the Emergency Powers Act was first introduced I thought the Government had better have it, but I could only think of giving it to them for one reason, and that was that if they did not have it they would then have some excuse to offer to this House for the lamentable situation to which they have allowed the country to come. That Act was given to them to preserve the public safety, and the thing to which all our attention was directed when that Act was first discussed in 1939 was the provision and control of supplies.  As far as the provision and control of supplies is concerned the Government have not a friend.</P>
    <P>The Government dare not go openly to any meeting held publicly to justify what they have done with regard to supplies in this country.  Particularly, I do not think the Government could parade their new controller of turf at <Col N="1187" /> any public meeting in the country and let him tell what was the situation that he got when he was pushed into that particular post, how far he sees daylight ahead of him, and what he has to do to prevent there being a terrific scandal with regard to the provision of the necessary fuel even for the City of Dublin in the coming winter.  At the moment, as I see it, the situation could hardly be worse with regard to supplies if the Government had not those powers, but I should like at least to prevent them from having that excuse when they come to make their apologies to the people for the situation into which they have brought the country.  I should like to give them those powers.  I should like to see them as fully armed as they can be, so that they cannot make any complaint that this Dáil prevented them from taking any action which they considered necessary in order to secure supplies for the country.  The situation with regard to supplies has got so bad that even the thought of conveniencing the Government in that way weighs very little in the balance against the Labour amendment here.  I do not want to see powers which were given to them, and not used, for the &ldquo;control of supplies and services essential to the life of the community&rdquo; abused in order to bring about a reduction in the purchasing power of the poorer members of the community, particularly when they are going to be harassed by the inadequacy of the supply arrangements of the Government.</P>
    <P>The other point which is dealt with here is the question of censorship. There alone the Government can claim successfully to have operated the Emergency Powers Act.  They have done it with the same result which they have achieved in connection with services and supplies.  It has resulted in starvation.  We are getting no news. We are getting neither mental pabulum nor are we getting the ordinary foodstuff to which the people of the country were accustomed.  There is no necessity to go through the details of the debate.  We were told in September, 1939, that, while there would be a <Col N="1188" /> minor type of censorship at the beginning, it was possible that there might have to be a tightening up.  We were told in a very direct phrase that it was to be the suppression or censorship of news and not views.  We were told in particular that the pivotal point, the standard by which matters would be censored would be this: Would whatever was said or whatever was going to be suppressed give information of military use to one or other of the belligerents, or would it compromise the national position?</P>
    <P>That was a simple standard, which we all accepted, and if that standard had been adhered to there could have been no objection to a censorship operated in that way.  Let the Taoiseach now consider what was said in 1939 with regard to censorship.  Having read what was then said, and the justification that he made for getting those powers with regard to censorship, let him ask himself under what head of the remarks that he or any of his Ministers made in 1939 could he bring such a thing as the suppression of the imports of certain commodities into this country.  I know one reason why they are suppressed; it is because if they were revealed they would blow sky-high this case so often made by those on the Government Benches that the new Ministry of Supplies occupied itself for eight months after the war started in getting in vastly increased quantities of the supplies we needed. The mere publication, month by month in tabulated form, of what was got in of certain commodities, either late in 1939 or early in 1940, would completely dissipate any view which might otherwise be imposed upon the people that the Ministry of Supplies did any work of any real importance to the country at that time.</P>
    <P>How can the Taoiseach reconcile the present position with the promise which was made that the only thing which would be censored&mdash;and particularly with regard to Dáil debates&mdash;would be some item of news which had inadvertently crept into the speech of some Deputy here, but that there would be no suppression of views expressed in this House?  Will the Taoiseach, remembering what was said <Col N="1189" /> then, inquire into all the activity which takes place here after a debate on an important point?  The first thing that happens is that a message is flashed from the censorship office to all the newspapers that not a word is to be published until they have seen what it is proposed to insert.  Dáil debates may not be censored in the official records, but, as far as the Press of the country are concerned in getting news to the public, the full force of censorship seems recently to have been more persistently directed to the reports of Dáil speeches than anything else.</P>
    <P>There is also the peculiar and odd circumstance that one of the most rigid rules of the censor's department is that no newspaper may refer to any censorship instruction.  There was always the habit in previous years that, if anything was suppressed, a gap was left so as to show that something had been cut out, or there was a blank put in, or a note to the effect that news had been cut out, or that something had been cut out by the censor.  Nowadays, the way the censor operates is that he cuts out certain items and the newspapers have to close up the gap and run the type together, and in that way there is very often put into the mouths of people speaking here, for instance, something which is completely and entirely a distortion of what was said here.  The result is that a completely wrong impression is given to people down through the country with regard to what some Deputy may have said here, and the impression given to the people is not of what a man actually said, but of something that may be a complete distortion of what was said as a result of a censor's stupid intervention.</P>
    <P>There was one recent example of the evil lengths to which censorship can go. This city suffered from a bombing experience on the North Strand, and we were told that communications were being sent to the German Government indicating that evidence had accumulated to show that these bombs had been dropped from German machines.  We waited for a long time to get any response to that, and when we got it I must say that I felt it was well worth while, from the German point of <Col N="1190" /> view, for the Germans to have bombed the city because, after admitting part of the bombing, and denying part of it, we got from them a half-hearted apology for one part of the bombing and a less satisfactory explanation of the other part of it, and then we had, by way of advertisement, an amazing display of the good feeling existing between the Government of this country and the Government of the German Reich.  Of course, not one word of that was censored because presumably, it might be against the established canons of neutrality.</P>
    <P>I listened to a broadcast some days ago in which I heard an item of news in which a certain phrase was used, but when I opened my paper the next morning to see what was said in answer to that, I found that not even was the phrase that was used referred to.  That silence lasted for five days, and then it was let through that President Roosevelt had told the Press correspondents over there that there would not be any arms for Ireland, and on to-day's Order Paper we have an answer given to a question on that matter.  But everybody who listened to that broadcast was left for five days in suspense as to what the Government were going to do about the matter&mdash; whether they were going boldly to deny it, or to admit it, or to wait until public curiosity lapsed and then leave it unanswered.</P>
    <P>Recently, the Prime Minister of Great Britain made a speech&mdash;it was in the form of a broadcast to America &mdash;and within 48 hours the Press comments came swarming in.  It was proposed to publish these comments, but the censor's order was &ldquo;No&rdquo;&mdash; that the comments that had reached the shores of this country up to that point were either American or South American and were all favourable to the speech delivered by the Prime Minister of Great Britain, and that they would have to wait for some comments from Germany and Italy so that a balanced view could be presented. It was not that the Press here had picked favourable comments: it was that on the first day no unfavourable comments could be got and the <Col N="1191" /> Press situation, as laid down by the censor, was that they had to delay publication until such time as some unfavourable comments came in, and then the mixed salad of the good and the bad could be presented to the public here.  If that is not distortion and perversion of news, I do not know what is.  That was not anything that was going to aid the enemy.  These comments had been made, and it was notorious that they had been made, and I do not think it is even going to ease our national position if we are going to appear so flabby and so insecure or unsure of ourselves that we cannot put in something favourable to one side until we have it balanced by something definitely unfavourable from the other side.</P>
    <P>However, that is with regard to outside matters.  It is with regard to the censorship of opinion in this country itself that I am deeply concerned&mdash;the censorship of views here on internal matters and the censorship of material that would help to educate opinion in this country.  That is more important than censorship of outside matters, and I agree with what was said by Deputies on the Labour Benches and by Deputy O'Sullivan, that we have to consider our present position both from the point of view of the present emergency and from the point of view of the post-war period.  If we have a little bit of foresight, we shall look ahead and think of what will happen in the post-war period and try to educate this community of ours so as to enable them to form some opinion that will not weaken their strength during the time of war and that will strengthen and improve their position by leading them to have a good outlook on the post-war situation. The present censorship, as Deputy Hurley correctly and truly said, amounts to this: that nobody bothers about any item appearing on the newspapers if they feel that there was a possibility of the censorship having operated on it, because they do not believe that it is a reflection either of honesty, accuracy or truth.</P>
    <P>They do not believe that such a news item can be anything but a garbled version which will suit the particular <Col N="1192" /> period, or which will suit some mixed mood of timidity or semi-cowardice and, possibly, a leaning or tendency towards one or other side in the present struggle.  With regard to what is happening outside, they know that they are getting a complete and entire perversion and distortion of the truth, but if I could believe that the Government would give us assurances of an adequate type that they would censor ruthlessly anything with regard to happenings outside the country, so long as they would allow to percolate freely here news with regard to the things happening here in this country, such as about our economic policy, about how the Government is doing its work, or about how some members of the Government are doing their work and others are not doing it, and about contrasting policies or whether new ideas which are abroad, some of which are coming in here, might suit this country or should be discarded because they are alien to our mode of life here, I should be satisfied.  As a result of the present policy, the people are devoid of any guidance or leadership and they are being left without any material upon which to inform themselves, not alone with regard to the present war situation, but with regard to the post-war situation which will have to be faced.  If I thought that the Government would give us facilities to have free discussion and free Press reports on internal matters such as I have referred to, I would not worry so much about the war situation as between the belligerents.</P>
    <P>I hope the Labour Party will press this motion through and that the Government will meet it satisfactorily.  I know that the Government defence is going to be that they have not reduced wages and that they have not suppressed news, but they know that, so far as the censorship is concerned, they have ruthlessly suppressed expressions of opinion.  Deputy O'Sullivan has pleaded for some relaxation in the censorship regulations, if only as a start towards a better attitude.  Let us have that at least, and then we may agree to give the Government these powers which they now seek for a further year, but without that relaxation <Col N="1193" /> I shall certainly associate myself with the Labour Party in supporting this amendment of theirs.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyJMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is no harm to emphasise again the reasons for which the Emergency Powers Act was originally passed.  In fact, there was one main reason, and one reason only, and that was that it was necessary to arm the Government with the powers conferred by this Act for the purpose of preserving the neutrality of this country. Certain doubts were expressed in the House on that occasion as to whether the Government would exceed or misuse the powers conferred on them under this Act, and I can very well recall the fact that the Taoiseach, who is now asking for a prolongation of these powers, rose in his place and smote us, in his wrath, for suggesting that the powers given under this Act would be misused in any way.</P>
      <P>I can remember his even making a differentiation between the responsible and irresponsible members of the Labour Party, when he said he was glad that the more responsible members of the Labour Party did not share the views which were expressed by some others.  Well, responsible or irresponsible or whatever we are now, all of us in this House have had an opportunity to see how this measure is worked and to watch the trick that has been worked on this House and on the people of this country, to carry through by Order matters which never should have been dealt with except through the ordinary channels of this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputy McGilligan has said, the new outlook towards things of this kind is that the methods of the Order are more convenient and more handy, to supersede the ordinary legislative machinery of this House.  That outlook is not confined to this particular sphere: that is the outlook in local government at the present time and that is the outlook that is to be operated under the Managerial Act. This shows impatience of discussion and debate and a tendency to avoid awkward situations and awkward criticism.  It means stealing a march on the ordinary liberties of <Col N="1194" /> members of this House and of the people by quick short-circuiting processes of the kind to which this Act has been devoted.  The Government outlook is steadily becoming more Tory and more reactionary, more stale and more tired and, consequently, more impatient of discussion and debate of any kind.</P>
    <P>I want to be brief and refer principally to the unfair and unjust use of this Act for the purpose of passing the proposal to reduce wages.  We were told here last week that that proposal was passed in the interest of the poor.  I dissented from that view then, and I dissent now.  It is an outrage on the intelligence of the poor and the working people, to suggest to them that an Order to reduce their wages was carried out in their interests. That is the kind of specious reasoning and special pleading that has been characteristic of the present Government and their administration, not alone in that respect but in many respects, for a number of years.</P>
    <P>Certainly, the most astonishing example of the unscrupulous use to which the censorship powers could be put was the example that occurred recently with reference to an article contributed to <i>The Standard</i> representing the experiences of a correspondent of that paper in the town of Tipperary. His presence attracted large numbers of people, who wanted to know if he was the man from England who was recruiting workers to take across to England.</P>
    <P>That article represented the facts of the situation, not only in Tipperary but in many parts of the country at the present time; it was an article the clue to which could be verified not alone in one town, in Tipperary, but in several towns throughout the country, and at every railway station that affords a way to leave this State and go across the Border to Belfast.  There could be no doubt about the authenticity of the position described in that article.  It was held up for a week and graciously permitted to appear, belatedly, after it had been duly considered and, I presume, microscopically examined.</P>
    <P>Even if we had the assurances asked <Col N="1195" /> for in this amendment, I have little hope that they would be honoured in the future.  We had the most specific assurances when this Act was passed in 1939.  We were asked to sit up here through the night and early into Sunday morning, to pass a Bill, and we were assured that it would be used for one purpose and one purpose only.  It has been used unscrupulously and unfairly, and I doubt if the persons who have used it unscrupulously and unfairly in the past have been converted to any better viewpoint as to the use to which they might put this Act in the future.  This amendment is necessary, and this proposal and this discussion are necessary, if for no other purpose than to show the people how the powers that we were asked for in their name, and with the desire to protect their liberties, have been unfairly used and abused, and applied for the purpose of depriving the elected representatives of the people of their just right and their main function to express their opinions and to contribute their criticisms, if necessary, to whatever proposals might be put forward in this House in the ordinary way.</P>
    <P>I do not want to say any more about this matter.  It could form the subject of a very long discussion.  Certainly, I think the Taoiseach should be thoroughly ashamed of himself in coming to this House to-night to justify the seeking of powers for the continuation of this Act, in view of the fact that the most specific assurances given to us on the late Saturday night in September, 1939, have been flagrantly violated and dishonoured, and for no other reason than to accommodate the Party and the Government that have been afraid, unwilling or unable, perhaps, to face criticism in this House, or to face the consequences of their own actions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment proposed by Deputies Norton and Davin is, in my view at all events, entirely a reasonable one.  In fact, the only criticism that I can feel disposed to offer to its terms is that it does not go sufficiently far.  In effect, what this <Col N="1196" /> amendment asks is that the Government will, before the Second Reading of this Bill is given to the House, give a solemn undertaking in public that the powers which will be given by the Act, if it is continued by this Bill, will not be abused.  The amendment put down by the Labour Party, instead of enumerating various matters that are referred to in Section 2, sub-section (1) of the Act, confines itself merely to three matters.  They ask for assurances that the Government will not abuse the powers of this Bill in the direction of reducing real wages or suppressing expressions of opinion concerning the social consequences of Government policy, or expressions of opinion concerning the economic consequences of Government policy.  I would like an assurance and an undertaking from the Government that they will use these powers only for the express purposes mentioned in Section 2, sub-section (1) of the Act.  These powers were very clearly set out, and fall under three or four sub-heads.  Orders can be made which are necessary to cover cases which, in the opinion of the Government, are necessary or expedient (1) for securing public safety or the preservation of the State, (2) the maintenance of public order, and (3) the provision and control of supplies and services essential to the life of the community.</P>
      <P>I would like to pause here and mark this illuminating fact that, while there emerge from the printing presses every night sheaves of orders under this Act, in no single one of them on its face is there any indication as to which of these three sub-heads the particular order falls under.  The Government took very good care to confine themselves merely to stating that &ldquo;the following order is made in exercise of the powers conferred on them by the Emergency Powers Act, 1939&rdquo;.  That is a well-known legal device to dodge the issue, and to make absolutely certain that the Government never can be attacked in court.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>It is perfectly clear that that is the purpose of the device that is resorted to in making these <Col N="1197" /> orders.  So far as I am concerned, I would like an assurance from the Government that before an order is made it will, at least on its face, make it clear for what purpose or purposes mentioned within the three categories in Section 2, sub-section (1) of the Act, the order is about to be made.  The Supreme Court has held that, once the opinion of the Government is expressed, it cannot be attacked.  In other words, although criticisms have been levelled&mdash;and properly levelled&mdash; by speakers who preceded me in this debate, on the ground that these powers under the Emergency Powers Act, 1939, have been and are being operated with a view to superseding Parliament, the fact is that, if that Act is continued, the result will be to put into the hands of the Government an instrument by which they can supersede Parliament in its entirety.  They can do everything under this Bill, if it is passed, whether or not it comes under any of the categories set out in sub-section 2 (1).</P>
      <P>Before this Second Reading is given, it is essential that an assurance should be publicly given by the Government that they will state on the face of each order hereafter to be promulgated the category into which the order is being put.  Any lawyer examining, for instance, the standstill order, as it is called, or the cease-fire order, as it has been called within the past few weeks, from the legal point of view, would fail entirely to place it within any of the three categories set out in Section 2 (1).  An analysis of the order stabilising the bonus of civil servants would, again, entirely fail to place this order in any of these three categories. An examination of the order taking away the Treaty rights of civil servants under Article 10 would absolutely fail, by any stretch of imagination, not to talk of legal interpretation, to bring it within any of the three categories.  What I suggest is entirely desirable merely to prevent abuses.</P>

    <P>Once this power is again put into the hands of the Government, we cannot, except by criticism in Parliament, which is not entirely effective and sometimes hardly effective at all, <Col N="1198" /> prevent the Government from abusing the powers we gave them.  Certainly, we cannot test these matters in court. We ought to get, therefore, an assurance that, when an order is made in future under this Bill, if it be passed into an Act, the Government will indicate its opinion that the order is necessary, secondly, state why it is necessary and, thirdly, state into which of the three categories to which I have referred the matters comprised in that order will fall.  I have no doubt that no such assurance will be given.  If no such assurance is given, no Deputy ought to vote for the continuance of this measure.</P>
    <P>We have had experience of the operation of this Act for nearly two years.  As Deputy Murphy has said, we can recall the atmosphere in which the original Emergency Powers Bill was introduced to and passed through this House.  Perhaps the recollection I have of that debate differs somewhat from that which Deputy Murphy has.  It was, certainly, an atmosphere of complete unity, with members of the House, representing every section of the people, prepared to put this instrument into the hands of an Irish Government confronted with an unprecedented situation.  We have had two years' experience of the working of that instrument now.  It is right and proper that we should pause for a short time and examine that experience when an opportunity is afforded by this debate. The country would have been entitled to expect that Deputies, before being called upon to discuss this measure, would have heard from the leader of the Government a justification of the operation of the Act during the past 22 months.  We got no indication of how this Act has worked.</P>
    <P>A spate of orders has emerged from the Government under this Act.  How much better off are we to-day by virtue of the operation of this Act and the pouring out of these orders than we would have been if this Act had never been passed?  Is there not only one answer to that?  We are much worse off than if this Act had never been passed.  What has the Government achieved for the people by the operation of this Act?  In September, 1939, <Col N="1199" /> this country might have been faced with a position in which neither Government nor Parliament could properly function.  During the past 22 months, Government and Parliament have properly functioned.  Nevertheless, we have not the utilisation of Parliament as a democratic assembly, nor the utilisation of the machinery of Government through Parliamentary institutions but the utilisation in wholly unnecessary fashion of the vast powers given by this Act.</P>
    <P>Have prices been brought down under these orders; have supplies been secured or has order been maintained; has the safety of the State been buttressed up in any way by any of these Orders?  I should like to hear the leader of the Government refer to any single achievement in 22 months in connection with supplies, public order or the safety of the State by virtue of any of these orders or the accumulation of them.  Is it not true that in September, 1939, and for some months afterwards, the whole force of public opinion was solidly behind the efforts of the Government and the Parliament of the people in securing the safety of this State and the maintenance of supplies?  Is it not undeniable that public opinion has seriously deteriorated, particularly in the past six or eight months?  Nobody can deny that there is disillusionment throughout the country or that there is a feeling that nothing has been, or can be, achieved by the operation of these orders under the Emergency Powers Act.</P>
    <P>We have the position that the papers are flooded with the most extraordinary criticism.  We had a debate on censorship recently and we have had the operation of the censorship denounced to-day by previous speakers&mdash; and properly denounced.  The censorship has not helped to prevent the deterioration of public opinion and the expression of that deterioration in the public Press in references to the institutions of the State.  We have had a spate of criticism of Parliamentary institutions and we had a placard issued by one periodical saying that the Dáil had &ldquo;gone to seed.&rdquo;  We have <Col N="1200" /> criticism that Deputies are not doing their work, that they are not attending to their duties, that Deputies sit in Parliament only once a week and Senators only for an hour or two once a month.</P>
    <P>Instead of doing the things that have been done by orders under the Act of 1939, would it not have been more appropriate and would it not have better served the reverence which the plain people of this country ought to have for institutions of the State if this deteriorating and demoralising criticism, publicly made, had been avoided? Would it not be far better if this House had been occupied during autumn and winter of last year in discussing the measures dealt with under the Act of 1939 instead of sitting only one or two days per week or one or two days per fortnight?</P>
    <P>Criticism has been levelled, and I say properly levelled, at the Government for misuse of their powers under the Act of 1939.  Far greater use ought to have been made of the fact that Parliament was functioning all this time.  It would be far better for public opinion, and for the security of the State if the people had the safety valve of the Dáil and the Seanad, the Oireachtas as a whole, for the expression of their views in connection with the matters that were dealt with in these orders.  I think there was little to be proud of in the achievements of the Government during the last two years.  Whether that is a proper subject matter for discussion on this Bill or not, there is one thing quite clear: that from an impartial examination of the operation of the powers given under the Act of 1939 during the last 22 months, the inevitable conclusion must be drawn that, so far from being in any way better from the point of view of supplies, the point of view of the public, or the point of view of public safety, the country has seriously deteriorated in every aspect, notwithstanding the fact that Parliamentary powers have been usurped in a rather outrageous fashion, due to the operation by the Government of the powers under this Act.</P>

      <P>My experience of the use of the Emergency Powers Act by <Col N="1201" /> the Government during the last 12 months is that people are becoming suspicious that the Government are prepared to take every advantage of the powers given them.  I had a very interesting experience during the past month when a man was arrested under an Emergency Powers Order because his son, whom the Guards wanted to arrest, could not be found.  He was arrested on the grounds that he was harbouring his son and sheltering him from being arrested.  I had occasion to speak to the local authorities on the matter, and they told me that he was arrested under an Emergency Powers Order.  I had known this man for a number of years, and I was satisfied that he had no connection whatever with any organisation detrimental to this State.  However, they quoted for me certain clauses of the Emergency Powers Order under which he was arrested.  I asked was it because the son could not be found that the man was arrested, and this person told me that that was more than he could say. I came to Dublin and discussed the matter with the Minister for Justice. I informed him that I was satisfied that the father of this boy was arrested because the boy could not be found. The Minister for Justice said: &ldquo;We do not stand for that; we have not gone to that extreme yet; I would not hold the father of any boy responsible for what his son may do.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That happened on Wednesday.  On Friday I went back to Cork and I was surprised to learn that the man was still in custody.  He had been taken out of his job.  Strange to say, one of his other sons had also been taken out of his job last year and detained for five or six weeks.  When he was released he would not be taken back to his employment and has not since been employed.  The father was taken out of employment with the same firm and was kept in custody for four days, because he would not tell where his other son was.  I rang up the local authorities and asked was it possible that this man was still in jail, and they told me he was.  I said: &ldquo;I have been talking to the Minister, and he told me that he would never expect such a man to be responsible for the doings of his <Col N="1202" /> son, and I understood the man was to be released immediately.&rdquo;  The person to whom I was speaking told me that the man was arrested under an Emergency Powers Order and he would have to await instructions.  I told him that I was not giving him any instructions, but that I was surprised to learn, after what the Minister told me, that this man was still in custody.  That man lost five days' wages, I think, and that was all done under an Emergency Powers Order.  I agree with Deputy Costello in many of the things he said about the disregard there is for the Dáil and for Parliamentary institutions. When I talk to men who have some interest in the country they simply scorn the idea of the Dáil and say: &ldquo;What is the good of going to the Dáil, everything is being done by Emergency Order?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>As one who has some experience of dealing with employers in connection with wages and who has some knowledge of the mentality of the masses of the workers, I want to tell the Taoiseach that he has created a very bad feeling amongst the masses of the workers by using the Emergency Powers Act for the making of a standstill order in connection with wages and working conditions.  I was one of those who more or less agreed that the Government were entitled to get those emergency powers in such a crisis. There were some Deputies of this Party who objected to giving those powers to anybody, no matter who was in power. At that time, the Taoiseach, I think, said that we could rest assured that those powers would not be used for any other purpose except for the defence of the State.  I think it is an abuse of those powers to bring in a standstill order with regard to wages.  My experience is that there is a very bad feeling in the country, a great disregard for this institution and for other institutions, and that, instead of having improved the public mind, it has disturbed the public mind a good deal.  One thing we have to bear in mind is that a lot of people are giving fine service in connection with A.R.P. and the Red Cross and in the Local Defence Forces, people who were prepared without any instructions from this institution or any <Col N="1203" /> Emergency Powers Order to stand in defence of the country.  I think it is going the wrong way for the Government to exercise the powers they have exercised under this Emergency Powers Act.</P>

      <P>I agree that certain orders made under this Act were an abuse of the powers given, but I want to draw the special attention of the Taoiseach to some ill-considered orders which have been issued, if they were considered at all.  Let me take one of the most recent orders, the one dealing with turf.  The Taoiseach will remember that we had a long discussion here a week ago on the question of turf and home-produced fuel.  We were told by the Parliamentary Secretary of the necessity for getting, not only a second, but a third harvest of turf.  What happened?  An order was issued prohibiting the movement of turf out of the turf areas.  The first and immediate result of that order was that a very considerable number of those engaged in cutting turf stopped cutting turf and we have had a considerable stoppage in the cutting and saving of turf at the most important period of the year.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Because what was being done was as fully explained as it could be&mdash;why it was being done and what the purpose was.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. D. Morrissey Mr. D. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>That explanation may have been made, but I neither heard nor saw it, not to say the men who are spending their time almost from dawn until dark working in the bogs.  In any case, whatever the intention may have been, the effect of the order was to stop the people from cutting turf.  Another order was issued within the last week, also, apparently, without any consideration being given <Col N="1204" /> to it.  That order provided for a complete stoppage of the sale of coal, even in the smallest quantities, in what are called the turf-producing counties. Again, what was one of the effects of that order, because it was not fully considered?  There are blacksmiths' places in the tillage areas packed with farm implements that require mending and there is not as much smith's coal in these places as would heat one bolt. They are not allowed to buy it and they cannot get it.  Every Deputy knows that.  The information is not confined to Deputies on this side of the House. I dare say other Deputies have had the same experience as I have had.  I have got several letters from blacksmiths and others in the last four days calling attention to it.</P>
      <P>I know that in the northern part of my own county, one of the most intensely cultivated districts in the country, there are at least two men whose whole time at this period of the year is devoted to the repair and tightening up of agricultural machinery, but it is impossible for them to carry on that work at present because it cannot be done with turf. I could go on quoting other cases, but I take the case of these two men as being the most important.  The fact is that these orders are being turned out so quickly that they are not being considered. Someone simply decided that there are 14 counties out of which no turf will be allowed or into which no coal will be allowed.  The result is, as I say, that mowing machines, tractors, reapers and binders, things that are essential at the moment and the loss of which for even two days might mean all the difference between saving and losing a crop, are held up because somebody, in making the order, had not the foresight to see that it was essential that smith's coal should be available for work of that kind.  I want again to give the information to the Taoiseach that as a result of the Turf Order there are dozens, if not hundreds, of men that were cutting turf last week, who are not cutting it this week, and who will not cut it so long as the order remains in force.</P>

      <P>I agree with Deputies who say that there is an increasing <Col N="1205" /> number of people in this country who are losing all respect for the power and authority of this Parliament to do good for the people.  It has been pointed out by leader writers in the Press, from time to time, that about one-third of the Deputies of this House absent themselves.  Some of the absentees at the same time take advantage of platforms which they secure outside this House to say that Deputies and Senators are paid excessive allowances. I read a speech delivered by a Deputy, a very decent Deputy, some three or four months ago, in which he criticised the allowances paid to Deputies.  At the same time, every member of the House now listening to me knows that that Deputy has been very seldom seen in the Division Lobbies of this House since the last general election.  That is the kind of talk that brings this House into disrepute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my opinion, every order issued under the Emergency Powers Act places more power, not in the hands of Ministers, but in the hands of highly-placed civil servants.  All these orders are prepared and inspired by highly-placed civil servants for the sole purpose of giving them more authority over the people in their everyday lives. The worst of the orders issued under the Emergency Powers Act was Order No. 83, an order which has been amended on two occasions inside a period of two months since it was issued.  I understand that some of the matters arising out of Emergency Powers Order No. 83 were pointed out to the Minister for Industry and Commerce by a deputation which waited on him, and he inquired as to why this information was not supplied to him sooner.  Nobody sitting on these benches was made aware beforehand that it was intended to issue this drastic and revolutionary order, but the Minister, by amending the order twice since it was issued, admits himself that there was something radically wrong with the order.  The latest amendment that was made to that order lays it down that in the opinion of the Government, and particularly in the opinion of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, no working-man living in this city is entitled to apply for or secure <Col N="1206" /> a payment at a higher rate than £2 10s. 0d. if he happens to be in receipt at present of £2 10s. 0d. per week. The Minister by that amendment puts the hallmark on a wage of £2 10s. 0d. per week as being a reasonable or living wage for a person employed in the City of Dublin under existing circumstances.</P>
    <P>This order, when it was issued, was related to the powers that were being taken by the Minister for Finance in a Budget Resolution to collect excess profits from those engaged in profiteering. That section of the Budget has since been dropped by the Minister for Finance, while at the same time the Government are insisting on maintaining in operation the powers contained in Emergency Powers Order No. 83.</P>
    <P>If the Government used the powers contained in the Emergency Powers Act to stabilise prices and to prevent profiteering there might not have been the same good reason for the complaints that have been made from these benches about the introduction of Emergency Powers Order No. 83.  The Taoiseach knows perfectly well that during the period from the 1st September, 1939, the outbreak of the present war, until the end of April of this year, over 1,000 complaints were made to the Department of Supplies by citizens of this State concerning excessive prices.  The Minister, here in the House, during the recent discussion on the Estimate for the Department of Supplies, admitted that only three persons out of the 1,011 cases reported were brought before the court and fined sums totalling £3 7s. 6d.</P>
    <P>I listened to the Taoiseach addressing representatives of parish councils of two or three midland counties at Tullamore not very long ago, when he indicated what would be done with those farmers who would not till their land in accordance with the terms of the Compulsory Tillage Order.  At the same time, he indicated that the fines imposed on such people up to that time were not sufficiently harsh, and that they should be increased.  If farmers who will not till their land in accordance with the terms of the Tillage Order are to be brought before the <Col N="1207" /> courts and fined heavily, if in some cases their lands are to be confiscated for not producing the food which they should produce for the people in a period of emergency, surely there is the same justification for bringing before the courts persons who in the opinion of the Minister for Supplies are guilty of charging excessive prices?  The Minister for Supplies admitted, in the reply to the debate on the Estimate for his Department, that in 17 per cent. of the cases where complaints had been made during the period referred to, the people concerned were found guilty of charging excessive prices, but instead of bringing them before the courts and giving them the advertisement before the public that they rightly deserve, instead of fining them reasonable sums for not complying with the law, they were merely invited to make a refund of the amount of the excess charge to the people whom they had overcharged and they were not brought before the courts.  Why should there be one law for farmers who fail to till the specified acreage of their land and another law for those who are found guilty of profiteering?</P>

      <P>If a trader who gets a licence from the Minister for Supplies to sell tea at the price fixed by the Minister ignores the conditions under which he gets the licence and is found guilty&mdash;and the Minister for Supplies has admitted that&mdash;surely the first thing that should be done with the person who gets such a licence under false pretences is to deprive him of the licence and, in addition, he should be tried in court in the same way as a farmer who refuses to comply with the terms of the Compulsory Tillage Order. Only in three cases out of 1,011 during the period referred to were persons found guilty of profiteering brought before the courts and fined the sum of £3 7s. 6d.  That is not deterrent punishment and I would be surprised if the Taoiseach suggests it is.  The Minister for Supplies said they had not broken the regulations.  I suggest that the Minister for Supplies and other members of the Government can, if they wish, use the Emergency Powers Orders to deal with profiteers in the same way as they have been dealing with farmers who do not comply with the Compulsory Tillage Order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have mixed as much with the people of the country, and particularly with the people of my constituency, as any of my colleagues in that constituency and I say deliberately that those people are losing faith in the power of this Parliament to protect their interests and that loss of faith is largely due to the failure of the Minister for Supplies to use his emergency powers against profiteers in the same way as he and other Ministers are using emergency powers for the purpose of stabilising low rates of wages while at the same time doing absolutely nothing to prevent an increase in the cost of living. I, and other Labour Deputies, were challenged because we raised a question here regarding profiteering.  The Minister for Supplies accused us of not doing our duty to the people by reporting cases that came under our notice.  I reported cases and I have a letter from the Minister for Supplies admitting that in one case there was evidence against a certain person that he was selling tea at 5d. an ounce to poor people in County Dublin without <Col N="1209" /> inviting them to produce a ration card.  I do not know whether that person has been brought before a court or whether he has been asked merely to refund the difference between what he has charged for the tea and what he should have charged.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am relating it to the Bill in this sense, that I would like to emphasise that the people of the country are losing faith in the power of the Parliament largely because the Emergency Powers Orders are being used in a way quite contrary to what was indicated by the Taoiseach and the Minister for Supplies when those powers were given to the Government in 1939.  It was never intended, and the Taoiseach never suggested, that those powers should be utilised by the Minister for Industry and Commerce or his advisers to bring in a measure like the Emergency Powers (No. 83) Order, particularly when they were not prepared to face the question of stabilising prices or taking steps to cut out profiteering.</P>
      <P>I do not know what will be the position of the people in the coming winter.  I am not a pessimist, but I must say I never felt so doubtful about the future as I do now.  I have grave fears regarding the coming winter, particularly with the shortage of essential commodities and the prices that the Government are allowing to be charged to the poor people.  If you use the powers contained in the Order it should be mainly for the protection of the poor more than anybody else.  The wealthy and middle-class people have plenty of tea, sugar and other commodities and they are not going to run short.  The poor people had not the money to buy supplies of these things when supplies were available and they are going to be up against the wall, so to speak, during the coming winter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Emergency Powers (No. 83) Order has caused a revolutionary feeling among Irish workers.  There is no necessity for anybody on these benches to explain to them the meaning of that <Col N="1210" /> order, which was brought in under false pretences for the purpose of reducing wages in a time of emergency. Its introduction has created a feeling which is very undesirable under existing circumstances.  I was present at a number of area conferences called by the Irish Labour Party and Trade Union Congress in connection with the Trade Union Bill and Emergency Powers (No. 83) Order.  I can name very prominent members of the Fianna Fáil Party&mdash;perhaps I should say people who were up to recently associated with it&mdash;representatives of the Party on public boards who were present at this conference, and they complained very bitterly, more bitterly than the supporters of the Labour Party, about the powers contained in the Emergency Powers (No. 83) Order.</P>
    <P>I listened to statements made by two prominent representatives of the Fianna Fáil Party at conferences recently. They indicated that they had tendered their resignations from the Party, and would have nothing further to do with it as representatives on public boards so long as the Government maintained the policy enshrined in the Emergency Powers (No. 83) Order, or persisted with the Trade Union Bill. There is a far greater feeling of revolt among people of that type than among the supporters of our own Party.  In the House recently I read a letter from the secretary of a midland branch of the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union.  Deputy Allen was listening to that letter being read.  I can tell him that that was addressed to me by one of the most active workers in my constituency in the last election on behalf of Fianna Fáil.  He is a man well known in the national movement in Tipperary, Leix and Offaly, and perhaps other midland counties.</P>
    <P>Possibly it is not too late for the Taoiseach and his Government colleagues to consider the consequences of the policy they are now pursuing.  They are using the powers contained in the Emergency Powers Act for censorship purposes and wage reduction purposes. Why was it considered necessary to bring in the Emergency Powers (No. 83) Order, which enshrines such an extraordinary <Col N="1211" /> policy, at a time when the Government have not indicated their mind in connection with the country's financial outlook?</P>
    <P>Question have been addressed to the Minister for Finance on several occasions during the past 12 months, asking whether the Government had yet made up their minds upon the reports submitted by the Banking Commission. The answers given were to the effect that the Government had not yet come to any considered conclusion as to whether they were prepared to adopt the Majority or Minority Reports, or any of the Minority Reports but, at the same time, they are apparently adopting a policy under the Emergency Powers (No. 83) Order which does not seem to fit in with any section of the findings of the Banking Commission, except the Majority Report or so-called Majority Report.  I do not think that anybody sitting on the Government Benches will take any note whatever of any warning issued from this side of the House, but I am warning them that if they are really sincere and desirous of maintaining the spirit of national unity in this period of emergency, the Government would be well advised to reconsider the reasons why they ever used the Emergency Powers Act for the purpose of preventing reports of discussions in this House being circulated to the people, and that they should withdraw the Emergency Powers (No. 83) Order in view of the assurances given by the Taoiseach in September, 1939.  Their action in bringing in the Emergency Powers (No. 83) Order is in complete conflict with the assurances given by the Taoiseach on that occasion, and their action on more than one occasion in using the censorship for Party purposes has not served the interests of Parliament with people who should have respect for this Parliament and the laws passed by it.</P>

      <P>I think it is time that those of us who are aware of the chaos <Col N="1212" /> in the world around us should speak on the question of confidence in the Government.  As a Deputy for a county constituency I deny emphatically and specifically that there is any suggestion of revolt amongst the people against the Government.  I deny that there is any suggestion either through speeches in the local Press, or through communications to me, verbally or written, that there is any revolt amongst any section of the people against the Government or the powers exercised by the Government under the Emergency Powers Act. There are grumbles.  There are complaints. There is, perhaps, quite serious criticism.  There are doubts about the future, but I would like to say here and now that I cannot find any evidence of any revolutionary spirit growing up amongst the workers or amongst any of the ordinary people.  I think it would be better if we faced facts in the light of reality rather than suggestions that we are about to witness something similar to the revolutionary period of the Bastile against the Government.</P>
      <P>Members of the Government cannot repeat too often or at too great length the reasons that lay behind the Emergency Powers (No. 83) Order, because I honestly believe it is difficult for the average worker to appreciate the new economic conditions that have arisen as a result of the war, and compelled this Government, in common with a number of other European Governments, to take measures under the order to prevent the inequitable distribution of supplies and monetary inflation.  The average person, when he is informed and knows the facts that have arisen as a result of the war, can appreciate what is taking place.  As far as my constituency is concerned, I find that when the matter is explained fully, the people understand the reasons for the order.</P>

      <P>In the first four months of 1939 we imported goods to the value of £16,000,000; the figures were £14,000,000 in 1940, and were down to £7,000,000 in 1941, showing a very serious diminution of supplies of many <Col N="1213" /> of the commodities which the public wants.  These figures are weighted to 1930 prices.  It is perfectly obvious that as a result of increased prices and imports falling in volume, if one section of the community is going to ask for an ever increasing reward for its services, the only result will be a decline in purchasing power for raw materials or commodities.  In fact, the Emergency Powers (No. 83) Order, far from reducing the real wages of the people, ensures as far as possible that real wages will decrease equitably as a result of increased prices occasioned by the war, and will affect the poorer section to the least possible degree. The Government have also closed the circle that might be described as the circle of inflation by controlling dividends and profits under the order, and through the action of the Prices Section of the Department of Supplies.</P>
      <P>The only matter on which there is still a considerable difference of opinion amongst the public is the control of prices.  It would be to the advantage of the Government in carrying out the Emergency Powers Act for the second period to have a further discussion on the question of price control.  It is quite obvious when one goes down to discuss matters with people in small towns that they appreciate the difficulty the Minister for Supplies has about price control.  They appreciate the fact that if you exercise price control too rigidly the public will become their own worst enemy, including the poor people, and in order to get goods they will give a higher price. They appreciate the fact that it would require an army of inspectors to deal continuously day by day with price control while, at the same time, it is extremely difficult to get a body of voluntary citizens to come together to provide the Government with advice to enable prices to be controlled.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like the Taoiseach to tell us whether he is prepared to try the experiment with regard to price control based on voluntary committees, even if it was only <Col N="1214" /> tried in one county or in a few towns, because, although everybody in the country appreciates the reasons that lie behind the prevention of inflation by the orders that were passed, I do not think the public have been yet convinced sufficiently of what has been done to control prices.  If we could try one experiment for the greater control of prices by voluntary committees or by the publication of prices, I think the public would be satisfied we were controlling inflation by every means possible, and that the Government was trying to see that commodities which were becoming scarce would be equitably distributed.  I am quite aware of the difficulty of any such experiment being carried out.  I know very well, in my own constituency, where farmers have been obtaining meal, that it would be very easy to act ruthlessly with regard to price control of meal, because there are farmers who are evidently prepared to pay more than the controlled price if they can get it.  That will inevitably affect the interests of the poorer section, who would like prices to be controlled.  It would be extremely difficult to regulate that position.</P>
      <P>In so far as other aspects of the present Emergency Bill are concerned, I think it would be well if there could be more regular information given to the House and to the public by the Minister on the various orders that are issued.  We may have, in some way, to adopt Parliamentary procedure to that end.  I can understand the objection of certain Deputies, when they receive sheaves of orders by post each day, unless they are in touch with the Department, or unless a Parliamentary question is asked&mdash;which is a most unsatisfactory way&mdash;getting some definite statement on particular aspects of policy and orders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Taoiseach would consider some way of adapting Parliamentary procedure so as to have regular discussions of a disciplined kind on some of the orders, so that we could avoid discussion through either the question of an Estimate or through a question asked in the House, so that we could have some other way of discussing the procedure <Col N="1215" /> of the Government with regard to the emergency, I think it would be a very good thing for the country, because I do think that the publicity in connection with the Government policy could be improved.  Although the Ministers are working tremendously hard and announcing new policies all the time&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;I say absolutely sincerely that there are certain things that cannot be repeated too often to the people of this country.  Whether it is because they do not read the speeches in the Dáil or whether they do not listen to the radio, there is a certain lack of contact between the people and the Emergency Orders that are passed, and I think it should be possible now for the Government to devise a better system of publicity, as I said before, in connection with these orders and their effect on the public mind.  I do not think, for example, the reasons for preventing inflation were sufficiently explained to many of the working people.  When they were explained, as a result of the opposition&mdash;and not before the opposition was created&mdash;then the workers began to understand the measure.  I think the reasons for preventing inflation could have been explained to the people long before the opposition took place in this House.  In so far as the future is concerned, my own belief is that the Government may have to be far more ruthless than they have been even up to now in matters economic. I am perfectly sure that if we reach a crisis in the war and if supplies decrease as they have been decreasing up to now the whole finances of the State will have to be kept under rigorous week-to-week control by the Government.  The Emergency Powers Order No. 83 may seem to us, 12 months from now, a very mild measure compared with the sort of changes that will have to take place if we are to overcome the inevitable effects of rapidly decreasing supplies in a country dependent on imported raw materials.  It would be just as well if we warn the people of this country <Col N="1216" /> that, far from being too drastic, we may have to be far more drastic than we have been and that the Government may have to take far more serious measures to restrict the liberty of this country, solely with the object of preserving peace and order.</P>

      <P>I think, therefore, in asking for a renewal of the Emergency Powers Act we should take a strictly realistic point of view.  In conclusion, I would ask the Taoiseach whether he thinks there could be a better method of discussion of these measures and whether there could be a more satisfactory form of publicity with regard to supplies and with regard to the issue of Emergency Orders.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to allow the prophesies of more economic ruthlessness and more restriction of liberty on the part of the present Government to drag me away from the realities of the situation which force me to intervene in this debate.  The reality that I want to mention in discussing this Bill is that there are poor classes of the people in the City of Dublin to-day who cannot cook their food because of the operation of orders issued under the Emergency Powers Act.  They cannot cook their food because they have not the fuel to do it. There was an order issued rationing coal for the month of June to a quarter of a ton.  There was an order issued rationing coal for the months of July and August giving a quarter of a ton for the two months.  There is the statement that while we are getting 60 per cent. of our normal requirements of coal into the country very little of that is suitable for domestic purposes and the result is that people in the city have to depend upon turf.  But now there is an Emergency Powers Order restricting the movements of turf in certain counties.  The order was issued by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance to secure that turf would not be moved from what are called &ldquo;turf&rdquo; counties into the non-turf counties.  You have the position of the poor people something like this: <Col N="1217" /> A person running a small store and having 180 persons scheduled as his retail customers buying by the bag got from his coal suppliers, when the June order with regard to rationing was issued, six tons a week.  In order to provide a bag a week, that would be a quarter of a ton for the month, he ought to have got 11 tons in the week. He was provided with six.  Then, when the July-August order came on, he was cut down to three tons a week.  In so far as coal is available, the people on his retail list, in the poor districts of Dublin, could get one quarter of the ration until last week, but neither on Saturday nor on Monday nor on Tuesday could any coal be got.  Coal did come into his supplier during the week, but that coal was being held by his normal supplier for distribution to the supplier's normal, better-class customers.  No arrangement was made in the rationing of coal by which there would be secured for the poorer parts of the city some small ration of coal. In addition, the bellmen, as a class, who supply the poorer parts of the city, are being left without coal and are being squeezed out of the business.  The larger distributors of coal are holding whatever coal they have, putting the bellmen out of business, and in the supply of coal to the smaller stores they are cutting them down in such a way that some of the poorer parts of the city which, up to last week, could get a quarter of what was normally put down as their ration, to-day cannot get any.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Turf is required, and the position with regard to turf is that turf is not allowed to come into the city.  Many voluntary bodies have developed themselves in the city on the lines of the parish councils to try to foresee and to provide against difficulties in every possible way so as to ameliorate the conditions, particularly of the poorer classes.  One of these bodies, looking ahead, ordered 500 tons of turf from a Kildare turf-cutter.  They were told recently that they could have the 500 tons of turf at 46/- a ton, delivered, and that if they would take another 500 tons at the same price the cutters in Kildare could then go ahead and cut more when they had cleared out the <Col N="1218" /> 1,000 tons that were there.  They were prepared to put down the money, and to take the 1,000 tons.  They are not able to get permission to take from Kildare the 1,000 tons of turf and, in the meantime, as I say, there are poor families in this city who, through lack of fuel, cannot to-day cook their food. When we discussed turf the other day, I raised a question with the Parliamentary Secretary who is shouldered with the responsibility for the production, through the county council machinery, of extra turf.  I raised the question with him that somebody should be responsible for seeing what the estimated requirements of the City of Dublin were likely to be for the coming winter.  I asked who was going to be responsible for that estimate, who was going to be responsible for seeing that the turf reached Dublin, and I pointed out that if it did not reach Dublin within the next couple of months, the transport would not be there to bring it in.  I quite admit that the Parliamentary Secretary is standing up to his job of production.  When I wanted to know who was responsible for calculating how much turf would have to come to Dublin, the Parliamentary Secretary said: &ldquo;That seems to me to be an inversion of the position.&rdquo; But, surely, it is an inversion of the position to concentrate on the idea that the production of turf is the one thing we want.  We only want the production of turf because we want turf, and what we want it for is to burn it. There is no use making a person responsible for the production of turf unless we also make somebody responsible for the distribution of it. At the present moment there is a serious and urgent need for turf in the City of Dublin, but Emergency Powers Orders are operating to prevent it coming into the city.  Let us face realities. Why cannot turf be brought into the City of Dublin?</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Why could it not be brought into the proper place for discussion&mdash;on the Order?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>We were not allowed to continue discussion on the Order after the Parliamentary Secretary had benefited by the questions that <Col N="1219" /> were put to him and by the questions that were raised.  We are put in the position that I have referred to in the City of Dublin because Emergency Powers Orders are operating against the situation here.  Deputy Childers has pointed out that it is essential we should take all the opportunities we can of seeing that the great powers we have put into the hands of the Government under the Emergency Powers Act are effectively and sensibly used.  The Taoiseach pointed out that he thought we were dependent, for the greater part of the solution of our difficulties, for an increase in turf production by the people who normally produce it, but the Parliamentary Secretary told us that he was building up an iron ration.  If there is one way to get the people in the country who produce turf to produce more and more of it, it is to do what the Kildare people have asked should be done, and that is to take the turf out of the areas where it has been cut at the earliest possible moment, so that the people can cut more.  Whatever justification there may be for the faith which the Taoiseach has in the ordinary turf cutters producing enough turf to meet the situation, the greatest chance there is of getting that hope realised is to take the turf out of the areas in which it has been cut at the earliest possible moment, turf that has been cut by county council machinery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My point is that to-day there are empty grates and uncooked food in the City of Dublin due to the fact that we have not fuel here, and that Emergency Powers Orders are preventing turf coming in.  I agree with Deputy Childers that one thing that is wrong is that orders are made and that there is no chance of discussing them.  They are made by whatever Minister is responsible, and concocted by whatever Department is responsible, without a review of all the facts, of their possible effects and likely reactions.  We can all appreciate Deputy Childers' astonishment that Order No. 83 should be issued and no explanation given.  He suggests that some different kind of machinery may be necessary, where you have such a large number of orders, in order to have effective discussion on <Col N="1220" /> them.  We have machinery here in Parliament, but if we have not, and if you have very complicated orders, surely Parliament could be asked to assemble to set up a committee of selection to examine them with their implications and possible effects before actually putting them into force.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Supplies has been through the country recently, saying that in the light of to-day there are no party politics.  They are dead.  Again, there should be no necessity for Party politics.  The problems that confront us are very real, even if they have to be looked at through the magnifying spectacles of the Minister for Supplies. They are very big and require a considerable amount of intelligent and firm handling.  Instead, however, of being handled in a firm way, they are being handled in a blundering way. If our intelligences have not been brought to bear on these orders, if they have not been explained to every section of the House and, through it, to the country, as well as their likely effects, what can we do with regard to them?  Our trouble is that we have put great powers into the hands of the Government.  The Government have handled these powers in a blundering way.  There is no co-operation between Departments.  There is no thorough examination of any question by any Department issuing an order. The result is that we have fireless grates in the City of Dublin to-day in which food cannot be cooked. The 1,000 tons of turf which the Kildare turf cutters are anxious to get rid of, and for which people in Dublin have agreed to pay 46/- a ton, are held up by an order made on the 21st June, which forbids the removal of turf from Kildare or any of the other turf counties, without a licence, and the licence is not forthcoming.</P>
    <P>When small traders in coal and turf go to the Department of Supplies and complain about the inequitable distribution of such coal as there is by the big suppliers, they are told that it cannot intervene or do anything, so that as well as mal-distribution you have a very essential part of the fuel distribution machinery of the City of Dublin&mdash;the bellmen&mdash;deprived of the <Col N="1221" /> opportunity of making a living.  Unless something is set up to maintain machinery for the control of coal and turf, a very considerable hardship will be inflicted on a certain number of those people in the matter of earning a living, and on the poorer classes in the matter of securing supplies of fuel. That is one of the realities of the situation&mdash;the manner in which these Emergency Powers Orders are operating against the arrival of fuel in the city. I say that is all due to the fact that we have put great power into the hands of the Government.  Ministers and their Departments, instead of handling those orders effectively and giving proper direction, are simply blundering along.</P>
    <P>We are told it is Party politics when we speak of these things.  As Deputy Childers has said, there is grumbling, there are complaints, criticism and doubts about the future, and while you have these things, then you are going to have what the Taoiseach and his colleagues call Party politics.  When the things that hit our people, injure their morale and create doubts about the future are things that arise internally, when you have inefficient handling of powers, the haphazard making of orders: when the Government adopt the plan that they will issue their orders in such a way that they need not come before the House for any kind of reasonable, effective, constructive criticism, you then reach the position in which you cannot criticise in a constructive way an order like No. 83.  In order to make a gesture by way of offering constructive criticism of it you have to start off by condemning the whole thing, and asking Parliament to annul it.  I admit that orders of this particular kind have to be issued, but if they have to be of such complicated nature that they require explanation and the intelligence of a large number of people to be brought to bear on what their likely effects are going to be, then there ought to be an <i>ad hoc</i> Parliamentary committee set up for the purpose of examining them.  The position with regard to censorship has been discussed at length.  The real criticism that I make with regard to censorship is that it is a kind of congenital defect of the Fianna Fáil Party and Ministry <Col N="1222" /> that they confuse themselves with the State, and that they think that the protection of their Party and their Government from vocal criticism is synonymous with the protection of the State against aggression or against difficulties.  That is why we find the censorship so easily extended as to suppress resolutions of parish councils or speeches of Deputies.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach was questioned in the Dáil to-day with regard to the misunderstanding of our attitude by no less a person than the President of the United States.  The President of the United States is reported as saying that: &ldquo;Armament aid for Ireland must follow an assurance that the Irish would defend themselves against German attack.  No such assurance has been received.&rdquo;  Yet, we had a Minister over there for some weeks.  We had occasion to complain in public of statements by that Minister, reported in the Press here, misrepresenting the position of affairs which existed between ourselves and Great Britain. We pointed publicly to the fact that it was a misrepresentation, but those statements of ours were suppressed.  If what was published in the Press as being stated by the Minister for Co-ordination of Defensive Measures in America was wrong, then it ought to have been contradicted here, and the fact that we questioned the accuracy of those statements ought not to have been suppressed.  When we see that particular type of suppression, and when we see published a statement of this particular kind by the President of the United States, we are entitled to ask what kind of face-to-face negotiations could there have been between our Minister in the United States and the President of the United States when the President of the United States is left under the misconception which is suggested in his statement published in the <i>Irish Press</i> of 30th June last.  Those things utterly undermine our confidence in the Taoiseach and his diplomacy.  When we relate that to the inefficient handling of detailed problems here at home, surely the Taoiseach can understand our desire, by criticism and question, to get at the facts, and to try to see that the <Col N="1223" /> clear line that Irish policy is pursuing will be understood&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Our statement should be made as plainly and simply as that statement, and surely the Taoiseach understands that not only we here in this House, but many people throughout the country will be wondering and having misgivings if they cannot see a plain reply.  The Taoiseach is very insistent that we stand on very solid ground.  We do stand on very solid ground, but the solidity of that ground is in relation to our own mutual understanding with one another, and one of the troubles is that we are carrying on our business in such a way that there is not that mutual understanding, and I do not see why there should not be.  I do not see why any man in any Party could not talk plainly and openly with another member of any other Party with regard to any of the things concerning this <Col N="1227" /> country, whether economic, financial or political.  As I say, the operation of the censorship is such that we are reduced to the fact that we cannot do so.  If the situation were dealt with more clearly, more openly, and more confidently by the Government, then some of us could afford to keep some of our opinions to ourselves.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked a simple question.  I said first that this statement was made by the President of the United States.  I said that we had criticised a speech made by the Minister for Co-ordination of Defensive Measures, and criticised it publicly, as misrepresenting the relations that existed between ourselves and Great Britain, and that when we denied that the reported statement here was a true statement of the position, we were suppressed. The lie is given in the Press. We are not allowed to contradict it, and the Government does not contradict it.  This, apparently, according to the Taoiseach, is another lie.  It is given in the Press, and it is not contradicted, and when we ask why it is not contradicted we are told that we are abusing our positions and that these things ought to be asked privately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should be very glad if there were a better understanding as to the things that could be asked privately and if there were fuller information given privately, but whatever information is given privately it could not possibly affect the public aspect of our relations in that particular way, and there would not be this thing of statements being made without any explanation, or any denial, or any statement to the effect that it is untrue.  We are standing on very simple ground, and I think we should stand simply and courageously on it, but we have the same kind of blundering here&mdash;if it is only blundering&mdash;that we had in relation to another matter to which I want to draw attention, and that is that the Emergency Powers Act is being used to-day in such a way that the poorer <Col N="1228" /> classes of the people of the City of Dublin have no fuel in their grates, and that the fabric which, as a distributing machinery, served them, is being squeezed out of existence by the people who are permitted to handle the supplies of coal in the city.  It is inevitable that the Government will have large powers, but it is wrong and disastrous if these powers are being handled in a blundering kind of way, and some better machinery will have to be adopted with a view to foreseeing what is the result of issuing these powers, and some better machinery will have to be set up to keep in touch with the realities of the situation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>It appears that the Government have not yet fully realised the position so far as matters in the City of Dublin are concerned.  Deputy Mulcahy has brought to the notice of the Government the many hardships which our people are bearing.  It is true that there are fireless grates and empty teapots in the homes of our poor people at the moment.  I ask the Government to go further into the matter of fuel supplies.  We have all read in the papers that one of our parish councils in the City of Dublin made a very gallant effort to secure fuel for those of our people who have made no provision for the coming winter.  They had been encouraged, by speeches in this House and by Ministers outside, to form and help these parish councils so as to enable them to make efforts to meet their fuel requirements. One of them in the City of Dublin, who made that effort, has been refused a licence to get in coal or turf into the city, with the result that there will be many empty grates in the coming winter.  The empty grates are with us already, so far as our tenements are concerned, and the empty teapots are there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our people are bearing great hardships, and the Government have not yet taken them into their confidence. There is no doubt but that the censor will censor this debate.  There are matters which will be reported, and other matters which will not be reported.  We have great and increasing unemployment, and where <Col N="1229" /> it is not full unemployment there are very large numbers of our people going on reduced earnings as a result of reduced hours of work, and also having to meet with increasing rises in prices almost daily.  I know that certain supplies of coal that are in stock at the present moment are being held back for an emergency period, for industry, or for home use, and I think the time has come to release that coal.  We have reached a crisis so far as the City of Dublin is concerned. Deputy Mulcahy has mentioned the fact that a number of men who used to sell coal in small lots have now lost their means of living.  They are now seeking relief work.  They are offering their ponies and carts, or their donkeys and carts, with which they used to draw coal to sell in bags and stones, for relief work to draw building materials for the corporation if there is any such work for them to do, but there are already too many engaged in that.  The result is that the horses and ponies and donkeys will also go hungry.  I think the Government are asleep and out of touch with matters so far as the unemployed classes in Dublin are concerned. I would ask the Taoiseach to fully realise the position, and do something quickly for those who are now suffering the hardships referred to by previous speakers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Government of Éire ought to have the Emergency Powers Act, and that they ought to get this Bill.  I say that because I believe that any Government of Éire in office requires the powers of this Bill to carry this country through the emergency through which we are passing at the present time.  Much of the criticism levelled against the Government to-day has been unfair because the Government is a thoroughly incompetent body. We all knew that it was a thoroughly incompetent body, but we did not choose the Government.  The people of this country chose them and probably by and large they are doing the best they can.  You cannot take a quart out of a pint pot and what people are asking in this House to-day is that each of these pint pots on the Front Bench of the Government should yield a quart.  They cannot do it and you <Col N="1230" /> might as well make up your mind to it. If you look at the lot sitting behind them, do you blame the Taoiseach if he says we will have to get on as best we can?  This is the plain fact and everybody in this country knows it and it must be faced.  There is the Government chosen by the majority of the Irish people and no Government in Europe has a better title to occupy its position than the Fianna Fáil Government of this country.  It was elected in a democratic election freely held and the people voted as freely as it was humanly possible for them to vote and with the maximum information at their disposal&mdash;lies and counters to those lies, and they voted for the lies.  It is their constitutional privilege to do so and, having done it, now we must carry the baby and do the best we can with the Government we have got.  There is no use in our battering heads against the wall and saying: &ldquo;Why do you not do what able men would do in this situation?&rdquo; They are not able men, and cannot do what able men would do.</P>
      <P>Now, facing the situation, we should realise that there is a great deal in what Deputy Childers said here to-day. I often look around gatherings of intelligent men in this country and am amazed at the equanimity with which they look forward to the future. As we all know, that is largely due to the operation of the censorship.  People in this country are drugged&mdash;drugged into that disastrous sense of security which obtained in Holland and obliged a man of my acquaintance to confess to me that, as the Germans were passing the publichouse in which he was sitting in Eastern Holland, he was arguing with his friend at the bar that the Germans would never invade Holland. He was so completely dazed by the rigid censorship that obtained in Holland, to support the policy of the Prime Minister Kolijn there, that he was convinced no serious danger was lying ahead and at that moment the German army actually was rolling past the door of the publichouse where he was sitting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are people in this country with no more realisation of the difficulties with which we are confronted at the <Col N="1231" /> present time, and of the trials and tribulations that lie ahead of them, than the veriest baby in the cradle.  I say, deliberately, to this House that there is no tribulation which will surprise me in the course of the next few years, burdened and harassed as we are by the Government that we have got; and the only thing I am prepared to do is to thank God devoutly if we get through this situation without being kicked into this war on the wrong side, if God spares us the disaster of being kicked into this war on the German side and against the British and Americans.  I have said before, and I want to say again, that I do not think the Government is pro-German or pro-anybody else&mdash;I do not believe it is.  I believe it is just incompetent and flabby, and I always believed that; and I have told our people that from the hustings time and time again, and I might just as well have been talking to the wall.</P>
    <P>Let us face facts: there is no use in our getting up in this House and deploring the consequences of having a futile and flabby Government, when our own people put them in.  They are there and we must do the best we can. Deputy Childers has developed a didactic manner which makes many people react very violently against him when he speaks; but he is perfectly right when he says that inflation must be avoided if the poorest of the poor are to be protected.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. D. Morrissey Mr. D. Morrissey">

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not talking about Emergency Powers Order No. 83, but I am going to do so.  Deputy Childers is perfectly right when he says that the first consequences of inflation would be that the poorest people in this country would suffer most.  The principle underlying Order No. 83 is one which I will support and defend at any cross-roads in this country.  I believe that the principle is sound and right, and I have said that here before. I think it should be accompanied by effective measures to safeguard the low wage-earner or any person whose real <Col N="1232" /> income has shrunk to a point below that at which he can secure the necessaries of life.  Order No. 83 should be accompanied by safeguards for that class of person.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. D. Morrissey Mr. D. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>But it is not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Wait a minute.  I am not going to start off and say &ldquo;that something must be done&rdquo;, but I will say what I would do if I had to give effect to something analogous to Order No. 83.  We see the world crashing down around our ears, and this is not the time for anyone to rise and say, simply, that &ldquo;something will have to be done&rdquo;.  I said here before that, if we must beat down or keep down wages to the existing pre-war level, or to the level that obtained at the time Order No. 83 was made, we must ensure that the people whose wages are restricted will get an amount sufficient to enable them to live.  We must ensure that every citizen of the State will arrive at the same modicum of comfort, and we must go seriously about doing that forthwith.</P>
      <P>I am a shopkeeper who sells everything from pins and nails to ploughs, from peas to calico, and I defy all the price controllers that ever were born or bred to control prices.  You cannot do it, unless there is rigid control of the whole national economy such as is exercised in Soviet Russia or Nazi Germany, and even then you will find a &ldquo;black market&rdquo; against you.  That is the plain fact.  What can you do if you have Canadian dried peas&mdash;to take one article of commerce&mdash;and the merchant has on the shelf six bags that were bought at 56/- per cwt., six that were bought at 75/-, and six for which he could produce an invoice dated the day before yesterday at 90/- per cwt.? How can you control the price of the peas which he bought at 56/-?  He has got an invoice based on the last invoice price, and he is in a position to produce that to any price controller.  He cannot be obliged to keep the price of his peas down to a retail price based on 56/-, and what is the use in codding ourselves that he can?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Go out and ask any grocer, any draper, or anybody who knows about these things.  Even if you are dealing <Col N="1233" /> with nobody but individuals with angelic good will&mdash;with merchants of angelic good will, who have no concern but to co-operate 100 per cent. with the price controller&mdash;I still believe you could not do it.  But we are all human. Take the man who gets two bags of peas such as I have described.  Is it reasonable to suggest that he will continue to sell peas on the market day until 25 minutes past one at 8d. per lb., and that a woman coming in at half-past one will have to pay 1/-?  You must change your price some time.  If you charge half the people in Derryna-gerraghty 8d. for peas up to 25 minutes past one, and those who come in the afternoon from the same townland, 1/-, you will ruin yourself.  You must start out on Monday morning and say the price has gone up, and charge the same price to everyone.</P>
    <P>I speak thus freely and plainly because, sooner or later, we will have to face the facts, and much the most important fact is that we have one of the most incompetent Governments in Europe, led by the most astute politician in Europe.  So long as that man can go to this country on a purely political issue, he is the greatest politician in Europe and he cannot be defeated. Provided he can get off on a political issue, you will find that at every election he will ride a white charger with Kathleen Ní Houlihan behind and the horse blindfolded with a green, white and yellow flag.  In that position, he is unbeatable.  But bring him down to any practical problem in God's creation and he loses all interest, tosses his head and attempts to shout at the Opposition.  Then, he says: &ldquo;I will leave it to my colleagues to deal with that.&rdquo;  That is the plain fact.  Let us face that situation because it is we who live in the country who have got to make the best of it. I say that the principle of Order 83 is sound.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Even though it was made by Fianna Fáil?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  You can fluke your way into a sound thing in moments of aberration.  You set up a body like the Banking Commission and you shy away from it like frightened horses when you see what you have given <Col N="1234" /> birth to.  Nevertheless, something does sink in.  We have hammered something into the Taoiseach's head during the past ten years.  It is a slow and arduous task but it is worth doing.  So long as he is capable of riding the white horse, the more we can hammer into his head the better, because it gives rise to some scruples regarding matters which he never dreamt of before.  I believe that Order 83 is sound in principle.  But the only effective way you can safeguard the man who has suffered by reason of the impact of that order is by a scheme of family allowances and the deliberate subsidisation of certain essential foodstuffs. Deputies on the Labour Benches should face facts.  They are simply barking up the wrong tree when they talk of effective price control.  Let us have price control by all means.  Do the best you can in that way, but if you think that that is going to safeguard the mother of a big family in securing food for her family, you are daft.  When I see a woman hungry, my interest in theory comes to an end. All I want to do is to put into that woman's hand the wherewithal to feed her children and to see that there will be in the shops or, if necessary, in Government depots, the essential foodstuffs to maintain that woman's children in health.  I want to be able to say to that woman: &ldquo;Go and get food for your family with the allowance I have given.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps I am wrong; perhaps I am a pessimist but I believe that we shall be faced with a situation next winter which will make us kick ourselves for not having adopted the scheme I have outlined in time.  It cannot be done on the spur of the moment.  We should take time by the forelock.  We have a situation now in which Deputy Mulcahy says there is no coal in houses in certain areas in the city.  The Taoiseach gets mad when brought up against a practical proposition because that is his nature.  If we were talking about the Constitution now, he would be &ldquo;as happy as Larry&rdquo;.  He would wrangle here to-night with the greatest relish if we were discussing an amendment to Article 3 of the Constitution, which does not matter a damn to anybody who is faced with the problem of putting <Col N="1235" /> coal into a tenement fireplace.  But he loses patience when presented with a problem of this kind.  It is not that he is unsympathetic.  I do not believe that he is.  In fact, I think that he is somewhat of a sentimentalist and always was.  But he has no capacity for this sort of thing at all and it irritates him and makes him impatient to have to deal with it.  He is right to recognise his limitations.  He realises that he is unequal to that type of test and it irritates him to have his nose pressed down upon it.  If people have no coal to cook their food and if we cannot get coal for them, we ought to establish communal kitchens at once.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Hickey is not being helpful.  If there are rooms in Dublin without fuel to cook food for the family and we foresee that that situation will be worse next winter, surely we ought to take precautions now to ensure that there will be food for the people and that the people who get it will be in a position to cook it. By recognised stages, we should set up a system of communal kitchens to which people could bring their food, cook it, take it home and share it out to their families.  I do not like these communal dining-rooms where people are treated as if they were rabbits; where they come to eat vegetable leaves and are then sent home to their burrows.  I like a home to be a home whether it be a room or a mansion.  I should like to see the food cooked in these communal kitchens and then brought home and distributed amongst the children around the household table.  If we did that, a change might come which would wipe out the scheme and render the whole business uneconomic before next winter.  It might be that the whole expenditure would be wasted.  During my schooldays, I was familiar with an old Latin phrase &ldquo;<i>splendide mendax</i>&rdquo;.  Would not this be money profitably wasted? Many times have we prayed to God that something would turn up which did not turn up.  Then we were all saying: &ldquo;Why did we not do what we <Col N="1236" /> should have done nine or ten months ago?&rdquo;  Are we never going to learn that lesson?</P>
      <P>There is hardly a single problem which would not be immensely simplified if we had a national register. The reason we have not that is that the Minister for Supplies did not think that rationing would ever become necessary on a large scale.  None of us is perfect.  All of us can make a mistake. That was a bloomer and a half or, if I may lapse into the vernacular, it was a bloomer with knobs on it.  Is it not clear from what the Taoiseach has said, from what the Minister for Supplies has said and from what Deputy Flinn, the turf director, has said that we are going to have an acute fuel shortage next winter?  Is not now the time to put the communal kitchens in hand and let us avail of the misfortunes of those to whom Deputy Mulcahy referred to do a public service?  Let us call these people who have now difficulty in getting fuel together, help them to get their food cooked and learn from them how we can improve the service so that, if necessary, it may become a universal service in the winter that lies ahead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not going to dwell at great length on family allowances because I have adumbrated my views on that question time and time again.  Ample material is available regarding the schemes in Australia and in New Zealand.  We can learn from the publications of the Governments of these countries how the various schemes work.  Deputies have pointed out that this Emergency Powers Act has been used for purposes for which it was never intended.  If I may say so, it has been used almost for purposes of casual legislation, with the result that you get men making orders which are grotesque. For instance, nobody west of the Shannon can sell a cwt. of coal at present.  I think that Deputy Morrissey has already referred to that.  I saw a man in Ballaghaderreen take out his horse, with two shoes off its hind feet, to draw turf.  When he went to the blacksmith, the blacksmith had no coal and I could not sell him smith's coal, although I had six tons of it in stock.  I could not sell to him what <Col N="1237" /> would blow his bellows, if I kept within the law&mdash;which I did not.  If the Taoiseach desires to institute a prosecution against me on that score, I shall bring him to the Supreme Court. But it is a detestable business to have to break the law, even when the law is intolerable, because it gives bad example. It is difficult to keep track of all these infernal orders and, when made by the best meaning civil servant in Europe, without any understanding of the country as a whole, these gross anomalies not infrequently arise.</P>
    <P>Now the last thing I want to mention is the censorship.  Mind you, I have a crow to pluck with the Labour Party about this.  I raised the question of the censorship here some time ago and on that occasion I said to the House:&mdash;&ldquo;Much of what I am telling the House about is in itself insignificant but, if taken together with the other facts I mentioned, it shows a trend, then we should act to prevent grave abuse in the future and tell the Government we are not satisfied with their administration.&rdquo;  The Labour Party's attitude on that occasion was, &ldquo;Dillon is doing a bit of Party propaganda; to hell with him&rdquo;, and they all trotted out of the House.</P>

But the Labour Party walked out of the House. Now they are being hit.  Now they are discovering that the censor is sending out messages to the papers, &ldquo;Do not print a word of what Corish says; do not print a word of what Norton says; print all that MacEntee says&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>Exactly, truth is truth, whoever speaks it.  God help poor old Pontius Pilate if the Taoiseach had been in the crowd when he asked: &ldquo;What is truth?&rdquo;  The Taoiseach would have replied: &ldquo;Me,&rdquo; and Pontius Pilate would be scratching his head ever since.  The Taoiseach believes that there is a simple answer to the question: &ldquo;What is truth?&rdquo;, and that is what the &ldquo;great white chief&rdquo; thinks at the moment, and if circumstances alter things, including the Taoiseach's mind, then that is truth from that time on, and woe betide anybody who differs from him; he is not only wrong but he is maliciously wrong.</P>

      <P>I would want to read that sentence and then consult the Taoiseach as to what he meant by it before I would really understand it.  I <Col N="1239" /> have learned that from long experience. What is the fact is that every word that the Minister for Industry and Commerce said was to be printed and every word that Deputy Corish or Deputy Norton said was to be combed to see if it could not be cut down and the meaning taken out of it.  You can say you never knew that, but that is the truth.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach is a past-master in getting other people to do the dirty work; but the net result of it was that what the Minister for Industry and Commerce said was printed, but what Deputy Corish and Deputy Norton said was not.  What the blazes do we care how that was manæuvred? It was done and there is no use in concealing the fact, because it is common knowledge to every public man in this country&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that if anyone disagrees with the Government, his voice is deliberately wiped out, and people cannot hear what he has to say.  I believe that that is a disaster for us.  Are we to go back over the cases I cited before? Are we to go over the letter of Senator Milroy that was suppressed because it stated that the Minister for the Co-ordination of Defensive Measures told one story in Dáil Eireann and another in Dundalk?  Are we to go back over the censorship that forbade a newspaper to say that the Taoiseach's broadcast was criticised?  Are we to go back over the hundred and one stories that I produced in this House and forced the Taoiseach to admit, because I showed him the originals with the deletions made by the censor?  I do not want to reopen a matter that was argued <i>ad nauseam</i> here, and that is printed on the records of the House for anybody who cares to read it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Do not let the Taoiseach think we are fools.  Do not let the Taoiseach think that by shaking his locks he can intimidate this House, as he can intimidate a member of the Fianna Fáil <Col N="1240" /> Party, because he cannot do it.  We are anxious to let this incompetent Government stagger along, but we are anxious that this country should not sink as a result of the unhappy choice made by the people.  We do not challenge that choice.  On the contrary, most of the Deputies on this side of the House would gladly give their lives in defence of the proposition that that Government has, by the law of God and man, the right to govern, and we will never challenge it by violence.  But we are not blind to the fact that our people chose unwisely.  I think we are all equal to the duty of doing our utmost to repair that choice.</P>
    <P>For God's sake, let us face facts.  If our people are likely to be hungry next winter, let us plan in order to share with them what we have.  In any crisis I never knew our people to be asked to do the impossible that they did not rise above the most sanguine hopes of those who looked to them.  All they are asking to be told is what they are to do, and how to do it.  What they are complaining of is that this Government is at sixes and sevens, and nobody knows what they want us to do. Is not that amply demonstrated by the fact that in this hour of acute difficulty the Minister for Industry and Commerce has held Dáil Eireann for ten days here discussing a Trade Union Bill which nobody but a few experts in the House understands, which nobody wants, and which is dealing with a situation about which complete agreement, I believe, could be got from all sides of the House if it were approached in the proper way?  Is that in itself not evidential of the ineptitude and the folly of this Government?</P>
    <P>I have a last word to say.  Deputy Mulcahy raised a matter to which I attach supreme importance and the Taoiseach thought he could shout him down by giving evidence of anger and impatience.  I say that it was inept to send the Minister for the Co-Ordination of Defensive Measures to America. In view of the fact that the censor issued an order that his trip was not to be referred to unless every syllable written about it was first submitted to him, I say it is fair for us to say that if the statement of the President of <Col N="1241" /> the United States of America is the fruit of the trip to America of the Minister for the Co-Ordination of Defensive Measures, God knows he was a poor choice to send.  We are a small country and we cannot be off squaring the United States of America in one direction and Great Britain in the other or anybody else without courting very formidable consequences.  I do not believe that anybody in this House, from the Taoiseach down to the youngest member of it, desires anything but the most cordial relations of goodwill and friendship with the United States of America.  Every one of us must appreciate the delicacy and discretion with which the Taoiseach must approach the matter of making a rejoinder, either in a communication or by a public statement, to the President of the United States of America.  But, surely, we are entitled to say that if the fruit of our Minister's trip to America has been to evoke that kind of reaction from the Administration of the United States of America, it is poor evidence of the Government's capacity to deal with the immense problems with which the country is confronted at present.</P>
    <P>It is not good enough for the Minister for the Co-Ordination of Defensive Measures to say: &ldquo;I was misunderstood; they have drawn a wrong meaning from what I said.&rdquo;  He was there for three months careering about Washington, New York, Chicago, Los Angeles and San Francisco.  We were hearing echoes from him of the most ambiguous character from the four corners of the United States, including Washington.  If that is all he could attain after all the noise he made, would it not be much better for him to stay at home?</P>
    <P>Is there anything wrong in adverting to that?  Is there anything impolitic in deploring that the special envoy sent from this country failed so signally to make our position clear to a powerful neighbour, a neighbour whom every citizen of this country is anxious to conciliate and demonstrate our warm friendship for?  Surely the Government have no reason for self-satisfaction if they have failed to make our position clear in that matter.  Surely it is something <Col N="1242" /> for which the Government should be most anxious to give an explanation? Surely it is a thing to be regretted by every responsible person in this country, if there is published in the United States a statement which suggests a grave misunderstanding of our position, that there is not rapidly forthcoming a reiteration of what I understand the Taoiseach has declared to be our attitude&mdash;the full resolution of this country to meet with all the resources at our disposal aggression against our sovereignty, no matter whence it may come?</P>

      <P>What is the use of the Taoiseach trying to treat the President of the United States as if he were a second form schoolboy?  It is all right for a schoolmaster to say: &ldquo;Now, Tom, you were told that on Monday, on Tuesday and on Wednesday and if you have not learned it by this time, you are going to be sent to the headmaster,&rdquo; but you cannot talk in that way to the President of the United States.  If the President of the United States indicates a misunderstanding of our position or desires further and better information, the sooner and the more courteously we welcome an opportunity of reiterating our position and appreciating the courtesy of the people of the United States in inviting us to declare our position, the better for us all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Surely there is no sabotage, there is no desire to embarrass the Government in the handling of foreign affairs, if we express, as I do express, an earnest solicitude that any communication from the President of the United States should receive the maximum consideration, and that the utmost possible courtesy should be employed in the rejoinder, and the utmost possible promptitude availed of, so that there will be borne in on the President of the United States a realisation that his <Col N="1243" /> word carries weight in this country, and that so long as the relations of the two countries continue on the happy footing on which they have existed for so many years, the word of the President of the United States will be heard with respect in this country, and that any courtesy it is in our power to afford him we deem it a privilege to extend.</P>
    <P>I think that every man of goodwill in this House should be prepared to give any and every co-operation that is asked for, whatever it may be, to meet the difficulties that confront our country in the immediate future.  I think that Deputy Childers is right when he says that we may be confronted with problems in the early future that will stagger liberty-loving men.  I urge on the Government to examine its own conscience and to ask itself, has it at its disposal the resources requisite to meet the problems that are likely to confront us in the early future, and, if it has not, what is it going to do about it?  Now, they can see for themselves that the Emergency Powers Act given to them in 1939, given freely and generously to a Party Government, an action to which I do not suppose any other democratic Parliament in the world would have consented, to-day has given rise to grave misunderstandings. There are many Deputies in this House who consider that it has not been used for the purposes for which it was intended, and that its administration has been in many particulars highly unsatisfactory.  Whether that is inevitable in the administration of such an Act by a Party Government, I am not quite sure, but I think the Taoiseach should consider the position very carefully and, availing of our readiness to co-operate to any limit in order to protect our people from hunger and want, resolve to take such steps as can be agreed upon either in this House or outside it, to do for the country what the country may stand in need of before very long.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Hannigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not believe that any member of the House will ever forget the occasion, a year and 10 months ago, when we met here under the <Col N="1244" /> gathering clouds of war.  At that time, we all fervently hoped that the cloud would not burst.  We almost prayed that some miracle from the skies above would help us to avert the deluge which threatened to engulf the world and destroy for ever the hardwon rights and privileges of small nations.  At that time, the Government could not have been other than moved by the magnificent co-operation given by members from all sides of the House, irrespective of Party or of opinion, in what were considered urgent matters of the day.  I refer firstly to the declaration of our neutrality and secondly to the very wide powers given to the Government in the shape of the Emergency Powers Act, which enabled it to govern by decree for the duration of the emergency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A year and 10 months has passed since the Emergency Powers Act was first enacted by the House.  During that period we have been happily saved from the physical impact of the war except in one or two isolated instances. Generally speaking, we can say that we have escaped the war and succeeded in preserving our neutrality.  Our neutrality has been respected by the major participants in the struggle. During that year and 10 months the Government had a peaceful breathing space in which they might operate the Emergency Powers Act for the general well-being of the entire community. They might have utilised the time to secure for the people, in addition to the joys of peace, a fair share of goods, work, wages and supplies.  During that period they might have done great things because they enjoyed, for the major portion of the time at any rate, the goodwill, and I believe the good faith, not only of members of the House but of the country generally. We did expect, and we had a right to expect, that the Emergency Powers Act would be used to organise the entire resources of the country for the benefit of our people as a whole.  We had reason to hope that the Government would be wise enough to foresee that, with no ships of our own on the high seas, an acute shortage of commodities would arise, commodities which were necessary not only to maintain <Col N="1245" /> our baby industries but to save the poorer sections of our community from the pangs of hunger and want as the war developed.</P>
    <P>Instead of this wisdom, we had the folly of Ministers talking on the radio, urging individuals who had sufficient means to buy everything they could lay their hands upon.  The result was that the small wage-earner, the man with a large family, the unemployed and the sick, were left short of essential commodities, and they had to try to cope with an artificial increase in the price of whatever commodities they could purchase.  I think it is not unreasonable to ask why the Government, in the early stages of the war, did not issue a decree in order to borrow compulsorily the barren millions lying in the banks and, with this capital, set themselves up as the nation's shopkeeper, and secure gigantic stocks of essential commodities to be released when a real shortage arose.</P>
    <P>I consider I am justified in asking why the Government, in the early stages of the war, did not introduce a rationing system in relation to essential commodities.  If they had done so&mdash; and I claim to be the first Deputy to advocate such a rationing system&mdash;we would not now be witnessing such deplorable things as a bachelor in Mullingar with a hundredweight chest of tea for his own use, while large families in places like Oliver Bond House are tied to the official ration, and are unable to afford the luxury of five or six cups of tea during the week.  We have ample evidence in Dublin of the hoarding of many commodities.  We can observe the effects of the hoarding of white flour throughout the country. Already this commodity has made its appearance behind Dublin shop counters at 7d. per lb.  White bread has altogether gone off the tables of the poor, and the Minister for Supplies has confessed his inability to supply it to delicate people, even on the certificate of their medical attendants.  At the same time, white bread can be purchased in many Dublin streets at 8d. for a small loaf.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephHannigan" hpid="Dr. Hannigan Dr. Hannigan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hannigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I submit that they are perfectly related to the Bill.  Certain orders have been issued in relation to supplies, and surely it is quite in order to discuss certain shortages that have occurred, largely as a result of the inefficiency and the incompetency of the Department of Supplies.  In respect of many commodities such as tea, flour, petrol and coffee a racket has been established and, if one can rely on the rumours that are circulating, before very long sugar will be included in that list.  If the Government had exercised their powers under the Emergency Powers Act and issued the right sort of order at the right time, those abuses would never have taken place.</P>
      <P>During the period in which the Emergency Powers Act has been in operation the only impression one could get&mdash;and many people have come to the same conclusion&mdash;is that the Act has been woefully and wilfully abused.  Let me take the censorship as an example I do not believe that anybody outside the most sanguine supporter of the Government will deny that the censorship is being used, in the main, for the suppression of every type of oral and written criticism of the Government. So many matters touching on the censorship have been referred to in the course of the debate, I do not intend to pursue that aspect any further, but it is really deplorable that the views expressed by members of the Opposition in this House on important matters so far as this country is concerned, have been ruthlessly suppressed, while the views of Ministers seem to have a monopoly in the papers generally, but certainly in one paper. By reason of the method in which they exercise the censorship, they are able to pass on to the public the views that they express.  On a number of occasions I have had experience of the unfair manner in which the radio has been used.  That has also been referred to in the course of the debate and, although it was dealt with at great length on the censorship motion which was discussed here, there is no improvement so far as I can see.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Emergency Powers Act has <Col N="1247" /> been used to filch from the workers their right to secure some compensation against the soaring cost of living. The order issued recently very effectively provides against a worker seeking any increase in wages to meet the increasing cost of living.  The damnable feature of all this, its most distasteful aspect, is that when we put all these little matters together we discover, beyond all shadow of doubt, a tendency, under an alleged democracy, towards the corporate State.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that there has been a complete breach of faith on the part of the Government so far as the use of the Emergency Powers Act is concerned. Unless an assurance of a more <Col N="1248" /> definite and reliable character than was given on the occasion of the introduction of this legislation and its continuation last year is now given&mdash;a more genuine assurance, an assurance that we can have some confidence in, an assurance that we will feel will be properly honoured&mdash;I am not prepared, and I sincerely trust Deputies generally will not be prepared, to grant to the Government a continuation of the powers conferred on them under this measure.</P>
