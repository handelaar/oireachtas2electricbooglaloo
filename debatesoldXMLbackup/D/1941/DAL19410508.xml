    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if he is aware that on the night of 24th April, five Dublin hospitals could not find accommodation for a patient who died on the night of the 25th April; if he will cause enquiries to be made into the matter, and if he will speed up the provision of additional hospital accommodation in Dublin.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Dr. Ward)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have had no previous representations on this matter. If the Deputy sends me fuller details I will ask the Hospitals Commission to investigate the matter.  My Department has done everything in its power to facilitate the provision of additional hospital accommodation in Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister kindly communicate with Dr. Waugh, of Ranelagh, who made the application to the hospitals mentioned, and whose patient was refused and died next night in the Dublin Union Hospital?</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the latter portion of the question, I wish to ask the Minister if he would speed up the building of additional hospital accommodation, so that our Dublin working class people who meet with <Col N="204" /> accidents or illness will not always be ordered to the Dublin Union Hospital? I want to say, in passing, that it is a very good hospital, where the patients get plenty of attention, but people dislike the idea of going there.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>In so far as it is possible to speed up the provision of additional bed accommodation in the city hospitals, it will be done, but, as the Deputy is aware, the speed with which we can make additional beds available must be related to the amount of money which can be released from the Hospitals Trust Fund.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonnONeill" hpid="Mr. O'Neill Mr. O'Neill">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Neill</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if it is a fact that in March, 1936, a communication was sent to the West Cork Board of Health saying that after due inspection and report by officials of his Department, it had been decided that Bantry was fixed on as the most suitable place for a central hospital for the West Cork area; and if so, what steps are now required to be taken to put this decision into effect and when will such steps be taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>In March, 1936, a communication was sent from my Department to the West Cork Board of Health and Public Assistance in which it was intimated that the Hospitals Commission had recommended the development of the hospital at Bantry as a hospital for major medical and surgical work for the West Cork county district.  Ordinarily the steps necessary to give effect to the proposal would have been initiated by the board, but so far as I am aware no definite action appears to have been taken. The commitments of the Hospitals Trust Fund exclude any possibility at present of allocating further grants for the provision of new hospitals.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonnONeill" hpid="Mr. O'Neill Mr. O'Neill">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Neill</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>The principle of developing the hospital at Bantry as the principal <Col N="205" /> hospital for the area has not been departed from, but, owing to the present position of the Hospitals Trust Fund, further extension of the hospital cannot be undertaken just at the moment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Supplies if he will consider setting up a committee representing petrol companies and agricultural interests presided over by an officer of his Department to examine into and advise him on the requirements, supply, storage and delivery of compound fuel for agricultural tractors for harvest and autumn works, including delivery of beet and grain.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister consider offering to tractor owners, who use their tractors for agricultural purposes, the granting of supplies in instalments as they become available, where tractor owners have storage available?  A great many of them would not have that storage and could not avail of the scheme, but some may have the storage and would this not relieve the supply problem during the rush time in the autumn and spring?</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will state the amount lost to the Exchequer for each year of the six years&rsquo; period ended 31st March, 1941, arising out of moneys irrecoverable from persons or firms who received advances under the Trade Loans Acts, and in each such year what relation per cent. did these bad debts bear to the total sum advanced in the year.</P>

      <P>No persons or firms received advances under the Trade Loans Guarantee Acts in the years referred to by the Deputy.  I presume, however, that the Deputy seeks information as to the sums issued out of the Central Fund and the total sums which have been paid into the Exchequer in repayment of sums so issued.  The information has already been furnished to the House during the month of April in each year in accordance with Section 6 of the Act of 1924 and Section 11 (2) of the Act of 1939.

      <NameTxt>Mr. P.S. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Co-ordination of Defensive Measures if he is aware that a leaflet has been distributed to the effect that children availing of the Government scheme for evacuation will have to produce a certificate showing that they have been immunised against diphtheria; that there are no indications on the leaflet as to the authority which issued it; if he will state whether this leaflet comes from any official source, and whether, in view of the fact that the British public health authorities have not stipulated any such conditions for the children of evacuees and that the Canadian Government has not applied compulsory inoculation measures to children from England, he will assure the Dáil that compulsory inoculation will not be introduced in this country and, if no such assurance can be given, if he will indicate how far it is intended to press for a compulsory scheme and the special conditions necessitating such measures here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P.S. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Co-ordination of Defensive Measures whether it is intended that a child who has registered for evacuation and whose parents do not need to avail of State assistance in respect of it will be denied the necessary facilities for transport in a crisis if the parents object to the child being immunised against diphtheria; if so, whether any guarantee will be given that compensation will be provided should the child suffer injury as a result of the inoculation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan (for the Minister for the Co-ordination of Defensive Measures)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take questions Nos. 5 and 6 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Government decided to arrange for the evacuation, in certain circumstances, of specified classes of the civilian population from Dublin City and Dun Laoghaire Borough, it assumed the obligation of ensuring, as far as practicable, that no undue danger to the public health would result <Col N="208" /> from any such mass movement of the population, more particularly when it was obvious that it would be necessary, for the success of the scheme, to resort to compulsory billeting.  In discharge of that obligation, and in consultation with the medical officers of the Department of Local Government and Public Health, it was accordingly decided to make inoculation against diphtheria a condition of evacuation for those children for whose removal from the evacuation area the Government is prepared to assume responsibility.  The medical precautions to be taken by persons making their own evacuation arrangements would be entirely a matter for such persons, subject to compliance with the provisions of the Public Health Acts and regulations made thereunder in regard to preventing the spread of infectious disease and provided that such persons did not propose to seek accommodation for their children in the reception area earmarked for those who are availing of the Government scheme.</P>
    <P>The evacuation scheme is voluntary as regards intending evacuees, and the question of compulsory inoculation against diphtheria does not, therefore, arise in connection with it.</P>
    <P>The name of my Department was inadvertently omitted from the leaflet referred to by the Deputy which was designed to publicise the facilities for free immunisation against diphtheria which had been arranged by the medical officers of the Corporations of Dublin City and Dun Laoghaire Borough in consultation with the Department of Local Government and Public Health.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if he is aware of the great increase in the appeals to the various organisations administering relief to necessitous people in the City of Dublin, and, if in view of the growing unemployment and resultant increase in the numbers of applicants to these societies he will permit the sweepstake authorities to organise an early event for their benefit so as to enable these societies to continue their charitable work and to meet the increasing withdrawals from their funds.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Minister for Defence (Mr. Traynor) Oscar Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Traynor)</NameTxt>
      <P>Marriage allowance in respect of the wife and child of Thomas O'Connor, No. 75193, is not being paid because, on the 12th February, 1941, Private O'Connor was found guilty, by courtmartial, of the offence of deserting the forces.  He had been absent without leave from his unit for a period of 196 days and surrendered himself to the Gárda Síochána authorities on the 2nd of January, 1941.  The regulations governing payment of marriage allowance provide that a soldier found guilty by courtmartial of desertion shall not be readmitted to the married establishment until at least 12 months after the date of his return to military service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that the soldier in question has now resumed his normal duties, what justification has the Minister for still withholding the separation allowance from his wife and child?  Surely it is not <Col N="210" /> desirable that the wife and child of a man serving in the National Army should be dependent upon the home help authorities?  Will the Minister reconsider this case?  So far as I understand, there was some misunderstanding about the question of desertion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister may have wished, in his statement, to place his financial proposals before the House unencumbered by any restrictions he might be tempted to make in order that the House might get an opportunity clearly of seeing the enormity of the bill presented to the people.  I do not think a Budget was ever presented to the House without some kind of examination of the position of the country, the extent to which the country could expect to bear it, and some kind of comment on the future of the country from an industrial and an economic aspect.  If ever a Budget statement should have embodied a review of the economic position, and the kind of economic future we are faced with, the Budget presented yesterday should have.  When, in the middle of March, we discussed the motion for the setting up of an Economic Council and had to face the discussion on the Vote on Account, realising what the situation was in the country, realising that additional taxation would inevitably have to be borne by the people, and wishing to bring about a situation in which the people might have some confidence in the way in which the economic and financial situation was being treated, we did our best to get the Government to discuss the economic situation in order to show the country that at any rate the Government understood some of the most important facts in the situation and were impressed with the importance of taking definite steps to deal with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During that debate we did not get the response to our enquiries that I think we were entitled to.  We pointed out that so far from giving the country any idea that they appreciated the seriousness of the situation, the Estimates for a certain class of expenditure <Col N="213" /> presented to the Parliament at that time showed that the Government under-estimated the situation.  We pointed out that in presenting a statement of the proposed expenditure on relief schemes the Government were presenting an amount that was £400,000 less than the amount they pent last year.  Between the amount they were estimating to spend on unemployment assistance and on works under the Board of Works and Land Commission, there was another reduction of about £400,000; so that an expenditure of £800,000 less than last year was being estimated for this year.  It showed either that the Government did not understand the situation in the country or that they were presenting an estimate to the Oireachtas here in which they did not believe.  We did not get from the Government at that particular time a reply such as I think the people of this country, being presented with such a bill as we have to-day, were entitled to get.  So far as any statement as to the possible outlook on the country is concerned, and the additional work to which this additional expenditure is going to be applied, if we were to depend on the Minister&rsquo;s statement yesterday, all that we heard was that there was an increase in the armed forces amounting to four times what it had been, an increase in the Civil Service, an increase in connection with the schemes we have to subsidise or finance in order to procure substitutes for the necessary raw materials which we formerly procured from overseas, and also the cost of the distribution of food, under the new technique, which amounts to £520,000.  Then, we have to take into consideration the expenditure by the local authorities of, let us say, about £200,000.  In addition to the increased Army expenditure, the increased Civil Service expenditure, and increased expenditure on subsidies, we have about £900,000 worth of food coupons.</P>
    <P>Now, what Deputies who have been in any kind of close touch with the position, in either our rural or urban districts within the last 12 months, ought to realise, is that all that has happened as a result of all the <Col N="214" /> promises that were made by the Government last year as to what was going to be done for the benefit of this country, is the dissemination of about £900,000 worth of tickets or food coupons to be presented to local shopkeepers by the people for bread, milk and butter.  Deputies should exercise their minds in seeing how the Government are approaching the problems of 1941.  From everything we have heard here in the House, there has been no word of complaint from the general run of the ordinary members of the Government Party as to the way in which the Government carried out its business last year.  I, personally, thought the position an appalling one some months ago, and in dealing with this matter, last March, I made an appeal to the ordinary members or back-benchers of the Fianna Fáil Party to realise that, next to the members of the Government themselves, they were the people who were most responsible for thoroughly examining and discussing the situation here with a view to seeing that a more thoroughly progressive and active method was adopted in order to effect an improvement in the economics of this country.</P>
    <P>We were told yesterday that this is a War Budget.  It certainly is.  Ministers, on various occasions, in comparing statistical matters in this country with analogous matters in Great Britain, have used the formula of the 66-times ratio.  In March of last year the British Government, who were carrying on during an extraordinary war situation at home, and also fighting a war both on land and sea, were spending something like £12,250,000 a day in their whole expenditure, in order to carry on a war such, as I suppose, was never contemplated in history before.  If we apply to that expenditure the formula of the 66-times ratio, we find that we are expending per day the equivalent of £7,250,000, and should be expected to get that from the pockets of our people of to-day or of our people to-morrow.  What does that mean? Spending a £7,250,000 equivalent a day and dealing here only with the internal affairs of a small island.  We are meeting <Col N="215" /> our difficulties, no doubt, but are our difficulties to be compared in any way with those of Great Britain?</P>
    <P>I do not want to stress this question of the ratio of 66 as Ministers have done in the past, but to those who are fond of that kind of calculation, I put it that they ought to compare what is being done with that £7,250,000 equivalent here and what is being done by the people in Great Britain, even on the ratio of 66 times. It must be remembered that when we entered upon this present emergency, this country was already exhausted by a war.  It was not a military war: it was called an economic war.  But as a result of the years during which we were engaged in that economic war our whole economic foundation here was weakened.  It was weakened first and foremost by the way in which our agricultural industry was hampered, and, in another way, by the wiping out of certain small industries, even though we were building up greater and bigger industries, employing a greater number of people. If an examination is made of the figures in connection with the Census of Production, from 1926 to 1936, in connection with industries, one of the things particularly to be noted is that, in spite of the increase in production between 1926 and 1936, a large number of small firms were wiped out.  As I have said, our agricultural position was seriously injured by the way in which it was hampered, and the capacity of our people to maintain their ordinary economic standard of life was very seriously injured by over-taxation.  In the year ended March, 1932, for instance, the total amount of taxation collected from the people was £21,286,000.  In the last year before the outbreak of the war that had been increased by £4,701,000.  By the end of the year 1941 it had been increased by another £2,837,000.  So that the amount of taxation taken from the people in the year ended March, 1941, was £7,538,000 more than in the year ended March, 1932.  That was the amount taken out of the people&rsquo;s pockets by taxation.  It is now proposed to take, this year, if the Minister&rsquo;s Estimate <Col N="216" /> is realised, an additional sum of £1,802,000; so that, this year, it is intended to take from the people by taxation £9,340,000 more than in the year ended March, 1932.</P>
    <P>In addition to all that, there was taken, out of the people&rsquo;s pockets, additional taxation in another form: taxation that was kept from the public eye or from any eye.  This was to meet the cost of the policy of home-grown wheat, to subsidise the export of butter, and also to meet increased costs with regard to bread, bacon, etc.  All that taxation was hidden away from the eyes of the public.  Accordingly, over and above that additional taxation of £7,538,000 that was taken out of the people&rsquo;s pockets between the years 1932 and 1942, at the same time, by means of rates, very considerable additional sums were taken out of the people&rsquo;s pockets also.  Up to 1939, £1,607,000 more was collected in rates than in the year 1931-32.  Last year that amount was increased by an additional £206,000.  The Estimates for the year ended 1941 are very substantially up, too.  I think they are up by £442,000 in county districts alone.  Therefore, while State taxation has been increased enormously, the rates have gone up by more than £2,000,000 since this Government took office.  We are brought up against the present situation with our economy weakened in that particular way.  Not only is there lack of confidence in our State institutions, but at the same time, while our debt has risen, our agricultural position has been so weakened that thousands of men have left the land. Millions of pounds have been spent in the distribution of land and on the improvement of estates, but all the millions that were spent and all the subsidies that were given to endeavour to maintain agriculture during the war period, have not availed to keep our agricultural population on the land.</P>
    <P>The attempted large scale development of industry went ahead for a while, but during the whole period of the last six or seven years the normal increase of persons in employment, and paying National Health Insurance contributions, showed a progressive decline <Col N="217" /> until in the last three years, it practically came to a standstill.  We know from figures given by the Minister for Industry and Commerce recently that during the last year the number of persons in employment and paying National Health Insurance contributions declined by the equivalent of 11,000 persons employed in a full year. Then we are faced with a situation in which, as far as agriculture is concerned, not only is the capital that agriculture badly needed taken from it, but the other requisite that our farmers needed in order to increase agricultural productivity during the emergency&mdash;manures&mdash;is practically unobtainable. The position with regard to the employment afforded by increased tillage is emphasised and commented on in an extraordinary way by the fact that it was necessary during January, February and March, 1941, to employ a very large number of men on relief schemes.  For the month of January the figure was 33,581, for February, 35,614, and for March, 41,875.  These figures are only slightly less than the number of persons that had to be employed on relief schemes in the spring of 1940.</P>
    <P>Since the outbreak of war our agricultural development has been very much hindered by, what I consider, the lack of definite and effective contact between the Department of Agriculture here and the Ministry of Agriculture in Great Britain.  There was no contact to enable our people either to foresee or to keep in touch with the changing agricultural policies in Britain in so far as they reacted on us here.  Lastly, we have had the outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease, the spread of which, many people consider, has been unchecked as a result of faulty handling on the part of the Department of Agriculture.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance tells us that he is alarmed by the situation, and he reiterates that &ldquo;without a sound agricultural economy no amount of juggling with financial machinery or bits of paper will avail, no national well-being can be assured, and all progress must be arrested.&rdquo;  I do not think anybody ever queried that the <Col N="218" /> foundation of our economic well-being here is the agricultural industry.  It the Minister only observes the way in which the rate demands for the year ended 1941 were met, he will realise how much agriculture is hit in the present time.  The increase in the amount of rates required for the year was £440,000, but the rate collection itself was behind on the 31st March by £1,250,000.  The Minister says he takes a serious view of that situation I say it is no wonder that he should.  I doubt if there is likely to be any quick recovery that will enable the farmers to pay up that money in any short space of time in view of the store cattle position at present and the outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease.  But at a time when, no doubt, there were opportunities in prospect which would have enabled the agricultural community to recover some of the losses of the last war, if they had the necessary capital, no capital was provided to assist them to get on their feet or to enable them to meet the new emergency or avail of the new possibilities.  They were also faced with lack of manures and nothing systematic was done to help them.</P>
    <P>A commission was set up some time before the outbreak of war for the purpose of reviewing the whole of our agricultural economy and to consider what should be done in a systematic way, and from a long-distance point of view, to improve the foundation of our economic well-being.  On the outbreak of war, instead of being urged to knit closer into its work, the Agricultural Commission was disbanded.  Instead of working night and day, to bring the best brains of this country to bear on the day-to-day problems of agriculture and on the long-distance hopes and possibilities of agriculture, our Agricultural Commission was disbanded and we are dependent for exhortation, control and administration in relation to agriculture, on the Department of Agriculture.  I do not think that anyone even in the Fianna Fáil Benches will have the temerity to say that that is sufficient.</P>
    <P>I would consider that there was some trace of hope, that there was <Col N="219" /> some suggestion to the people that they might have some confidence in the Government, if the Minister for Finance were able to announce that they were going to reassemble the Agricultural Commission, and going to get it to work week in and week out, reviewing in every possible way the future of agriculture from the next harvest.  There are too many things to be thought over and decided to leave the inspiration and direction of agricultural policy, in the circumstances which we are now facing, or in the future towards which we are going, in the hands of the Department of Agriculture.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce indicated yesterday that he had issued invitations, I take it, to representatives of workers and employers, to consider what steps should be taken to see that our industries can be maintained in a way that will give the greatest possible amount of work to the largest number of people at the present time.  During the discussion, I hope the Minister will be able to indicate whom exactly he has invited to that conference, the lines upon which it is proposed it will run, and an idea generally as regards his own thought on the industries that it will be possible to maintain fairly fully; what changes he thinks it will be possible to bring about in the regulations governing payment of unemployment insurance, so that workers will not necessarily be deprived of benefits they are insured against, or employers forced into working industries in a way that will give them less beneficial returns for the work than they might otherwise get.  Nothing is going to pay the bill that has been presented here but production, and that must come either from the agricultural side or the industrial side.  On the agricultural side, if we are going in the next two or three years to be left dependent on agriculture here to feed our industrial population, then, unless something is done to organise and to help farmers in a way that will show help them how to produce at lower costs than they are producing at present, there will be more than the people <Col N="220" /> who are now on home assistance to be maintained by the distribution of food tickets.</P>
    <P>There is a considerable amount of organisation and education to be done on the agricultural side.  Immediately on the outbreak of war we pointed out to the Government that we considered our main difficulties during this war were not defence difficulties but economic difficulties.  Even if we have defence difficulties, any defence machinery we erect here, unless it is substained by sound economics, is going as a weapon to fall out of our hands. If there is to be any strength in our defence machinery it will come from our economic roots.  One of the greatest dangers at the present time is lack of exposition of Government policy.  A great danger is that, through lack of confidence in the social and economic policies being pursued here, our people will lack faith and confidence in our defences.  If we are going to continue to spend £8,000,000 a year on maintaining an Army then the rest of the extraordinary taxation imposed on the people is going to be spent in the upkeep of the economic strength and the economic morale of the people who foot the taxes.</P>
    <P>I was rather astonished at the reference of the Minister for Finance to the Council of Defence and the way in which he put it.  When we wanted a council of defence we were told we could not have it.  We got a defence conference.  We were given to understand that the difference between a defence council and a defence conference was that a defence council would have some authority and some control, while a defence conference could merely advise.  As we felt that some kind of unity of outlook and unified contact was necessary, in order to get our people as a whole to support such defence machinery as the Government decided to set up, and such defence policy as the Government decided upon, we went into a defence conference.  The Minister, when he was faced with this very big bill, said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;My first drive, when confronted with the situation, was naturally to <Col N="221" /> secure a curtailment of expenditure, and here the Army seemed to offer the most promising field with its Vote of £8,313,000 and Allied Services of £1,048,000.  If their defences in the field are as strong as their defender in the Council Chamber, our soldiers need fear no foe.  All my attacks were repulsed.  I suppose I am revealing no secrets when I say that not even was succour forthcoming on my side from the Council of Defence....&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is news to me that the Minister for Finance had any suggestion to make with regard to the cutting down of Defence Estimates.  I should have been delighted to know of any proposals of that kind.  We of the Defence Conference have made three main contributions to strengthen the defences.  When the Government approached us and said that they required a bigger Army, as we were well within the war zone after certain happenings in Europe in May last, Deputy Cosgrave proposed that a defence council should be set up so that the united mind of the Parliament might be brought to the consideration of defence problems and steps taken to provide against them. However, a council was thought not to be the proper word, as the Government was going to be entirely responsible for defence policy and would not allow anybody to share in that.  We accepted a Defence Conference and, as the question has been raised, I want to say that our achievements have been three.  First, it was the Government&rsquo;s intention when they approached us, that men would only be admitted to the Army if they joined up for the ordinary period of two years and seven years on the Reserve; or if they joined the Volunteer scheme, it committed them to Reserve service of five years.  They also wanted to have a Local Security Force that would be associated with the police.</P>
    <P>In my opinion our first contribution was that we persuaded the Government that the only appeal which they had to men who joined the Army for the emergency was to join for the duration.  We got the Government to <Col N="222" /> accept that point of view.  Our next point was that if we were going to add to our Army, the amount of money we would be able to spend on it was limited, and that if we wanted an Army of an increased size, we also wanted reserves among the ordinary people, that they could not expect young fellows, with defence problems in the air, simply to join an auxiliary police force, on the one hand, and that, on the other, they were there to be given military training, and on a recommendation of ours, after some weeks&rsquo; consideration, it was agreed to divide the Local Security Force into &ldquo;A&rdquo; and &ldquo;B&rdquo; sections, and that the &ldquo;A&rdquo; section, now the Local Defence Force, would be the reserve army of the country, costing very little and getting a certain amount of local knowledge and training in dealing with military problems which might arise locally.  Our third achievement was about a year after when, in a very slow way, we succeeded in getting the Government to put the Local Defence Force under military authority.  I think that is about all we achieved, outside the big achievement of helping to get the people of every rank and class to rally to the various services being set up to deal with the emergency.</P>
    <P>Personally, I think that if the Government did not look at their defence problems through those Fianna Fáil mists through which they do look at them, which, like mists which rise against the sun, exaggerate and distort their problems, they might be able to run the Army a little more cheaply, but then Government policy is decided by Government, the outlook on our defence problems is decided ultimately by Government and the machinery set up is decided by Government. Our policy is to bring Government policy on right lines, to help to clear the Government view on defence matters, and we do our utmost to do so, but having got them to take what we consider to be the most sensible and the clearest views they can take, we have to leave it at that.  Having brought them to the best outlook and to the best policy to which we feel we can bring them, our policy is to support them.  That point reached they <Col N="223" /> get our full support.  Speaking as a member of the Defence Conference, if I wanted to nibble at the Defence Estimates, I could do so, but only by taking on myself the responsibility for undermining the foundations of the military machine which Government considered it was absolutely necessary to have at a particular cost and of a particular kind to meet the problems which they envisaged from their own peculiar and particular information.  I am conscious that I did recommend, and do still recommend, that an expenditure should be undertaken which is not provided for in the present Estimates, but which, I am sure, can be met within them.</P>
    <P>Considering, again from my own point of view, that A.R.P. organisation in our cities is the hub and keystone of our main and immediately likely defence problem, I believe that the personnel of the A.R.P. organisation should be maintained by a capitation grant at least as large as that given in the case of the Local Security Force and the Local Defence Force.  I understand that that is accepted, but I admit that in so far as that is an addition to the bill, I ask that it be added to the bill.  I am not aware that either any recommendation was received from the Minister for Finance that economies should be brought about, or that, if they were submitted, there was the big &ldquo;no&rdquo; which the Government Press this morning announced was returned from the Defence Conference to suggestions of that kind.  I am quite confident that if our defence position were thoroughly reviewed, we could spare on what we are spending at present in the directions in which it is proposed to spend it.  I am also satisfied that if we could equip certain sections of our Army with the equipment necessary to enable it to serve against dangers likely to come our way, it might not be possible to save much out of the £8,000,000, but that is entirely another matter.  I raise it in order to make the general position clear, and I say, quite frankly and openly, to the Minister that if he has any proposals to submit to the Defence Conference for reducing <Col N="224" /> the large expenditure on the Army, we should be most interested to hear his point of view and more than anxious to examine both carefully and energetically any proposals of such a kind that can be made.</P>
    <P>Quite a remarkable thing about the presentation of the Budget&mdash;and it emphasises the lack of perspective on the one hand, and the tendency, on the other, to attempt to reduce this Parliament further to the position in which some people think it ought to be, regarding it as a nuisance or an intrusion&mdash;is that when some Deputies wanted a copy of the Minister&rsquo;s speech yesterday, in order to study the elaborate details overnight and to take part in the debate to-day, the usual copies were not available.  Economy was being embarked upon.  A proposal to expend £40,000,000 was being presented to the House and the usual number of typewritten copies could not be made available to Deputies who are supposed to discuss it to-day.  That shows a lack of perspective which is condemnatory of the Government&rsquo;s approach to economy.  In the second place, I think it is an attempt on the part of the Ministry, or maybe the Civil Service, to reduce this Parliament to the position in which they think it ought to be.  If there was ever a moment when Deputies were entitled to every possible piece of information which would enable them to take part intelligently in the debate, it was last night.  I appealed before to members of the House to realise the responsibility on them as members of an Irish Parliament to stand up to the present situation.  I view with the greatest want of confidence the continuance of this emergency, or the period which may come after it, with this House conducting its business in the way in which it is being conducted, and particularly in view of the attitude taken by Ministers to criticisms, if you like.</P>
    <P>I had occasion a few days ago to deal with the excessive charges for fuel falling on the poorer sections, and I appealed to members of the Government Party representing the City of Dublin to discuss the matter and to help to get down to the facts.  Not a single voice, except that of the Minister, <Col N="225" /> saying that he would not allow members to get at the facts, was raised.  If the members of the Government Party are not going to continue to be like things covered over by a stone, white and bloodless, now is the time for them to speak out.  If they do not speak out, if they do not discuss the situation and make some kind of impression on Ministers to force them to face up to the situation, I fear very much for the future, because, if the present emergency continues, with the prestige of this House in the public eye injured as it is, then anything may happen here.</P>
    <P>If anything is to be saved in this country, it will be by Parliament doing its work and standing over a thorough examination of the situation.  When we started out on the present emergency, with the conviction instilled into our minds that our main difficulties would be economic, we asked the Government to take cognisance of the course adopted in Australia, where Professor Copeland, Dean of the commerce faculty in Melbourne University, was taken in as economic adviser to the Government during the war.  We suggested that it was advisable, particularly when taking a long-distance view, that a group of, if necessary, three persons be set up in this country, not to interfere with what was being done by the Government and not to have responsibility for administration, but to be watchers and advisers&mdash;men qualified to estimate what the likely effect of things being done from week to week would be on the economic situation, both immediate and distant, and who would watch things outside the country as well.  The Government did not approve of that proposition but our people who, more and more as time passes, look on the economic situation as the really important one, will expect, if they are to have confidence, to be told who are the economic generals directing our fight on the economic frontier.  For goodness sake, do not tell them that they are the members of the Government in their various Departments.  If the people are to have confidence in the situation, they are entitled to know the names <Col N="226" /> of their generals and it would be of advantage to this country if we knew who, either as a person or a group, were examining from week to week the implications of economic developments and of Governmental actions in that respect and who were estimating the likely effect of things happening outside on the economy of this country at present and in the immediate future.</P>
    <P>An endeavour was made in March last to get the Government to take the Parliament into its confidence and, through the Parliament, the people, as to their estimate of the general situation. I hope some endeavour will be made during the debate on this Resolution to outline the main features of the economic position here.  The Minister for Finance said yesterday:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The effects of these repercussions on our economy are too painfully familiar to Deputies, and, indeed, to all sections of the community, to need detailed recital here.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>When proposals for expenditure so enormous as those contained in the Budget are made to the House, even if the Minister be concerned regarding petty economies, I think we could spare a page or two of the Official Debates, and a few minutes of the time of the House, to set down a list of the things that are painful to Deputies, even if Deputies be fully aware of them.  We ought, at least, to be told what are the main distressing features which we are all to campaign against. Unless Ministers meet us in some way by attempting to tell us what they see in the situation, and by giving us an outline of what they propose to do, they will be striking another blow at this Parliament.  Voices may be raised in this Parliament against that, and some members may not be prepared to tolerate or allow it, but, in a really critical time for our people, that is not the way Parliament ought to be carried on.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>I was interested in the Minister&rsquo;s reference yesterday to &ldquo;equality of sacrifice&rdquo;.  When he states that he proposes to give 2/6 per week in connection with unemployment insurance in respect of each adult dependent, and 1/6 in respect of children, <Col N="227" /> does he mean that he is going to give 2/6 in addition to the 5/- and 1/6 in addition to the 1/- which these people have at present?  He proposes to make certain additional allowances available for those in receipt of unemployment assistance, old age pensions, blind pensions, and widows&rsquo; and orphans&rsquo; pensions. I should like to know what amount of assistance he proposes to make available.  He stated that the allowance would be granted only in urban areas and the townships, and, so far as unemployment assistance was concerned, that it would be issued only to dependents.  Am I to take it that the unemployed man without dependents, who has not got any increase in his unemployment assistance, will now get an increase?  I should like the Minister to make that clear before I proceed further, because I propose to deal with that matter.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>Then this talk of &ldquo;equality of sacrifice&rdquo; is mere emptiness. I am at a loss to understand how the Minister can claim that there is equality of sacrifice when a man receiving 14/- a week and who may have up to ten children is to get no increase on the 14/- and is to receive an addition only in respect of his dependents. While that continues, how can anybody claim that there is equality of sacrifice. Where is the justification for that statement when road workers, who were given an increase of 2/6 some time ago, have been deprived of that increase by order of the Government. An unemployed man in the city with five children receiving 23/- is now depending on a purchasing power of 13/- or 14/-.  The purchasing power of the allowance of the man in urban areas, with five children or more, is <Col N="228" /> no more than 6/- or 7/- a week.  The time has arrived when we have to come down to the simple truth, so far as the common people are concerned.  There is no justification for the statement in this Budget that it will make for equality of sacrifice.</P>
      <P>I listened with great interest to the statement of the Minister on the Government&rsquo;s attitude regarding the question of wages.  I want to say that they will have to be a little more careful in that attitude and go slowly with their assertion that the workers are exploiting their position during this crisis.  I say definitely that if there is anybody showing tolerance or a spirit of self-sacrifice during this crisis it is the unemployed and the poorly-paid workers.  I have in mind the mass of workers in this country and the highest wages for unskilled workers do not exceed £3 10s., while the average would work out from 58/- to £3 5s.  The largest increase any of these workers got since this war started was from 4/- to 7/6 per week.  I want to assert here that the purchasing power of £3 or £3 5s. to-day is not more than 42/-, 45/-, or 50/-.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We had the Minister yesterday, notwithstanding all that we have said to him for the past 12 months, putting on an excess profit tax and making it retrospective to September, 1939.  I do not find fault with that, but I say that it should be 100 per cent. for anybody who wants to make excess profits out of the emergency.  It is a scandalous thing that, while we had an order issued by the Government that wages must not increase notwithstanding the increase in prices, everything else can increase right away.  We have a statement from the Government this morning that if wages were to go up after prices there would be a vicious spiral created.  It appears to me that while prices were going up it seemed to the Government a virtuous perpendicular movement, but, when it came to a question of the workers looking for some compensation for the increase in prices, a vicious circle was created.  I want to say to the Minister, and I have some reason for saying it: &ldquo;Do not have your minds fixed on the workers.  What the workers are getting is not anything in the way <Col N="229" /> of profiteering.&rdquo;  I say that the increases to workers since the war started do not average 6/- per man, while the purchasing power of 60/- or 65/- is not more than 42/- or 45/-.</P>
    <P>Coming to the question of the unemployed and the old age pensioners and others, I want to say that, while we may talk about military defence and providing millions for it, we do not object to giving whatever is necessary for that; but if there is anything which will cause a collapse and bring any country to ruin it is the economic situation of the country.  An increase of 2/6 to meet the increased cost of living for an unemployed man, who gets 23/- a week to maintain himself and his wife and five or more children, is far from what I expected.</P>
    <P>Then we have this matter of giving vouchers.  I do not agree with anyone who states that the unemployed spend their money foolishly.  The marvel to me is how they can exist on what they are getting to-day.  If there are any heroines in this country, they are the unemployed men&rsquo;s wives, who are trying to make ends meet on what they get from the State to keep themselves and their families.  I think it is unfair that an old age pensioner, who may have done useful work for over 50 years, because he is reduced to the poverty line should be given a docket to get the food he wants, and that an unemployed man and his wife should be told: &ldquo;You are not capable of spending 2/6 or 5/- more; you will have to get a voucher and go to the shop for the food.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a good knowledge of what vouchers are.  I happen to be a member of a public assistance board and many of the recipients of home assistance, in addition to cash, get vouchers for which they <Col N="230" /> can secure food.  It was stated by the Minister for Finance that these people are to get bread, butter and milk for the vouchers.  Every shop does not sell bread, butter and milk.  Our experience of these vouchers given by the board by way of assistance in kind is that they are very much resented by most people who get them, because there are certain times, especially at the week-ends, when these people can get more value for money than they can get for a voucher.  In some shops they may get bread and butter but no milk.  Another shop may sell milk and bread but not butter.  Furthermore, I want to say that all those unemployed people who are to be presented with vouchers are simply reduced to that position by a system which has been created and which we are trying to maintain.  I say that we should not tolerate such a thing.  These people can spend their money as carefully and as thriftily as anybody who talks about giving them vouchers.</P>
      <P>So far as unemployment assistance is concerned, I should like the Minister and those associated with him to realise that in the Cork area there are places such as Douglas, which is an urban area where a great many workers reside; Blackrock, which is only one and a half miles from the city and which is a thickly populated area where industrial workers live; Little Island, Glanmire, Ballincollig, and other places from which workers travel to and from their work.  In some of these places there are men with large families who are unemployed and who only receive 14/- per week and for whom there will be no increase except what they get under the voucher system.  I want to say very seriously that the economic position of these people to-day and the lack of faith and of hope they have as to what their future will be is far more serious than many of us realise.  I appeal to the Minister to reconsider that aspect of the matter and to do something better for the unemployed than he is doing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I saw a statement in the paper this morning that some Cork businessmen were rather surprised that the income-tax was not to be higher.  If sacrifices are to be made, I think everybody <Col N="231" /> should make a sacrifice to help those less fortunate sections of the community. I know widows living in rooms for which they have to pay 5/- per week.  Their pension is 10/-, or, if it is a non-contributory pension, it is only 7/6.  As to old age pensioners, I know a number of them who are living in institutions.  In Cork we have certain homes where they can get a night&rsquo;s lodging for something like 7d. and a meal for 3d. or 4d. It is very hard on these men that they should now be presented with a voucher to get bread, butter and milk.  Very often they have not the money to buy clothes or underclothing. We are not treating that section of the community properly.  I do not suggest that income-tax should be increased further, but if sacrifices are to be made all sections should make them, and I am not satisfied that the unemployed section of the community are being treated as they deserve to be treated by this House.</P>

      <P>I am considerably impressed by some of the things that Deputy Hickey has stated. I think it would be wrong if what has been done in the matter of the vouchers was being done for the purpose Deputy Hickey stated.

      <P>If the Deputy will allow me, for a moment, it is because it is very important in the interests of the poor that that impression should not get abroad, that it should not be publicised, and that it should not come to be believed, that I am intervening now.  Deputy Hickey says that the position is more serious than we realise.  It is because the position is more serious than Deputy Hickey realises that this is being done.  Deputy Mulcahy said that the serious problem we had to face was more likely to be an economic one than to be a military <Col N="232" /> one.  I agree with him to this extent, that the economic difficulty is certain and that the military difficulty is proximate; but, in facing that fact, in attempting to deal, in advance, with the economic difficulties which are inevitable, we shall have to deal with them in the knowledge that the military considerations may completely upset the whole basis of the economic planning on which we may be working. To work out a scheme of sound economic treatment in present difficulties is like playing chess with a bull, because the whole basis of long-time planning, or short-time planning, may be upset in half an hour by considerations of a non-economic kind.  If one turns for a moment to the purely economic side, and assumes that those economic difficulties are going to have the opportunity of developing undisturbed by catastrophic military action, then, in my opinion, the position is so much more serious that men in the position of Deputy Hickey should make up their minds very clearly to understand the implications of it&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and very clearly take precautions not to aggravate them by any unconsidered word.  We are faced by the fact that there might be, due to the shutting off of raw materials, due to the shutting off of fuel and other power resources coming into this country, a very real and disastrous position in which a large number of people in this country who are at present contributing to the pool of wealth which is distributed over all the people, may not be able to contribute to that pool, while at the same time, due to the sterilisation of our resources outside, and due to the factual blockade and the physical blockade which prevents things that even could be bought from coming in here, the whole community may have to be kept out of what is now only part of the total sum of production in this country.  We have to face the fact that it might not be a question of money; it might not be a question of making sacrifices; it might not be money or income expressed <Col N="233" /> in any form of coinage which will matter, but the intrinsic value of the commodities which are actually in the possession, use and consumption of individuals.  It will not be the price of fuel, but whether you can get it; it will not be the price of food, but whether it is there or not.  Deputy Hickey, quite honestly&mdash;I am quite satisfied of that&mdash;speaks as if he thought that other people did not appreciate the seriousness of the problem.  He only illustrates the fact that he himself does not know how serious it is, and how drastic, and uncomfortable for everybody concerned, may have to be the methods used.</P>

I am dealing with the considered statement of the Deputy when he was on his feet, and when no one was interrupting. If you reach the position in which all that matters is whether you have the commodities, what is the best way of making sure that those who may not have money shall have the commodities?  You give them a cheque not upon a bank but upon the commodity, and that is the exact meaning and purpose of this.  This scheme may have eventually to be applied to people of a very different order in this country, but the first people who are being given a bearer cheque which cannot be denied, a bearer cheque on the existing stock of food in the country, are the people who most require it, and that is the meaning of what is called the voucher system.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not the slightest bit disturbed by a word of that kind. What I am satisfied of is that the Government is standing over its responsibility when it says to the poor: &ldquo;Out of the limited stock of consumable and necessary commodities in the country we are giving to everyone, but to you before anybody else a bearer cheque upon the bank of those goods, whatever may be their price.&rdquo; That is the spirit and that is the purpose in which this is being done.  At the present moment it is only being carried to the extent of the excess, or increased, provision which is being made.  It may be necessary to carry it further.  The more necessitous the condition of the whole country, the more will those who get bearer cheques, instead of money, upon the commodities that are there, be secured by the process.</P>
      <P>A time may come&mdash;and come very early&mdash;when every one of us will value our ration cards more than our bank deposits and might find our bank deposits inconvertible into what our ration cards will give us.  That is what will happen if a condition is developed in which there are no imports and no exports, and we have to produce inside this country the whole of the food, clothing and fuel which is required.  In my opinion it can be done, but it will mean that a considerable number of people who are now contributing to the pool of production with the labour used upon imported commodities will have to be kept by those who at the present moment have access to production which is not dependent upon outside importation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If I were in a position to give such a cheque as is now being given in the matter of food to every person in relation to fuel in the City of Dublin for 1941, in any adequate amount, I would be very glad and very proud.  Some 700,000 tons of coal are burned in the <Col N="235" /> City of Dublin in a year, and that is equivalent to 1,500,000 tons of turf. We may have to find some means of cutting that turf&mdash;even if the members of the Dáil themselves have to go out to the bogs and cut it.  It will not be the price that will matter: it will be the fact of its being there or not; and the cheque that the unemployment assistance recipient will want, and the cheque which he may have to value in 1941, may not be a cheque in money. He may not think much of that, but he may think much of a cheque expressed in so many cwts. of turf.  I wonder whether Deputy Hickey agrees or disagrees with that view.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The same statement is true in relation to vouchers.  The purpose of the voucher is to do now, in advance, for the poor man in relation to part of his income, what we may be very glad to be able to do for him later &mdash;God is good and if we work hard ourselves&mdash;in relation to a larger portion of his income.  It is in that spirit that this voucher scheme has been created, it is in that spirit it is being administered, and it is in that spirit that it should be accepted and publicised throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the debate yesterday it was suggested that one of the defects of this Budget was that there had been no <i>ad hoc</i> extra provision for unemployment. The reasons for that are twofold. One is that, at the present moment, it is not possible to predict with any degree of accuracy the nature and the size of that problem.  I do not wish to use any figures but those which are commonly known in this matter. Presidents of chambers of commerce and other distinguished publicists here have recently stated that we might envisage a position in which one-third of the total population of this country would be unemployed in six months. We know that a very considerable proportion of those who might become artificially unemployed due to actions of that kind would be in this city.  An examination made of that position <Col N="236" /> does not suggest that&mdash;on the line of supplies, on the line of imports of raw materials, and the slight possibility of providing alternatives&mdash;the position is quite as serious as was anticipated. There seems to be reason to believe that the position is somewhat easier than had been calculated.</P>
    <P>Fuel has emerged as the first bottleneck in production and, therefore, in the employment of industrial workers and their capacity to contribute to the pool in exchange for what they take out of it.  Fuel seems to be the most immediate and most dangerous problem.  For that reason, and for the domestic reason&mdash;the necessity of fuel &mdash;a big concentration has been made on its production here.  The amount which will be required this year may run into an extra 3,000,000 tons of turf. Whether, with the time at our disposal and the opportunity for preparation, any such figure can be attained or not I do not know: but I do know that every effort possible throughout the country is being made, and I am satisfied that there is being put behind the effort to get fuel an enthusiasm and a spontaneous organisation which is very promising.  If, in fact, the more or less critical side in relation to fuel this winter and next spring is relieved, it will be due to the enthusiasm and co-operation among all classes and kinds of people which is being shown at present.</P>
    <P>As regards the position for the following year, all the indications show that it will be very definitely worse.  At any rate, anyone who calculates that it would be only as bad would certainly be engaging in very wild and wishful thinking.  Whatever we may be able to do this year in relation to getting the quantity of fuel which is required, it will take a miracle of energy, co-operation and hard work on the part of all concerned to get it for next year.  But there is some good out of that evil.  Their production of fuel does present to the whole rural community an opportunity for employment of a width and value which they have never had before.  It happens to be my pigeon at the moment to look after this.  I am perfectly <Col N="237" /> satisfied already that the bottleneck of production is labour on the bogs and when we have all the rural labour which we can find put upon the bogs there will still be necessity for labour other than rural&mdash;urban and borough labour&mdash;to go out there and do the work.  There are certain places in which there are more bogs than men; certain places in which there are more men than bogs.</P>
    <P>There is a shortage of timber and there is a shortage of time which prevents us providing that amount of artificial accommodation on the bog which would enable those two necessities to be completely brought together but, to any degree in which extemporisation of huts and tents, of the use of local buildings, of skeleton accommodation, and the rest, is possible, it ought to be used.  There is an opening for every man who desires to work on it.  Certainly, people who to-day are on unemployment assistance and home assistance in anything near the vicinity of bogs should not regard themselves as being properly on unemployment assistance or on home assistance if they have that work at their disposal. It is going to represent inconvenience. It is going to represent transfer from their homes.  It is going to represent putting up with many things which they prefer not to put up with but they have the opportunity of work and they have the opportunity of assuring themselves that they will not be without fuel in the winter.  For that reason there ought to be in rural districts practically none of the unemployment which we have had in the past during the turf-cutting season.</P>
    <P>There has been great difficulty, we know, in relation to transport but the Minister for Supplies has met us in that matter and he has put a certain amount of petrol at our disposal for the purpose both of the transport of the first cutting of the turf off the bog in order to relieve the space for a second cutting, and also for the transfer of labour to the bog.  The conditions are pretty strict and we have to be in a position to make assurance sure that it is being used for that purpose and not for some other purpose.  But, subject to that, the Minister for <Col N="238" /> Supplies has been able to meet us and, therefore, even where men are not at the bog they can be transported to it. Men who think at the present moment that they could not cut turf will learn that in a very short time they can be very useful on a bog.</P>
    <P>That would cover the unemployment problem better, as far as I can see, than we have had any opportunity of covering it in any recent year during the summer months.  It is intended to carry that on into the winter.  What is required in order to increase the amount of turf produced are new, drained bog faces.  If I were to tell you the number of hundreds of miles of bog faces which are required to produce the amount of turf which we would require next year you would think I was romancing.  We propose during this year, during even the cutting season of this year, to prepare as many new bog faces as is possible and we propose to go on into the autumn and into the winter using the funds which in the ordinary way would be used for unemployment schemes on road works and the rest, in trying to give ourselves a flying start on a bigger platform next year for the production of more turf.  For that reason, it seems that in the fuel supply problem there are possibilities of absorbing both rural and a very considerable proportion of urban labour in the preparation of the turf campaign of this year and of next year.  At the same time, there is being prepared, to the extent to which it is possible, a survey of other possible schemes of employment to deal with a situation which might be created by industrial unemployment. I think I told the House before that I do not hold out hope that any large proportion of the catastrophic sum of unemployment which has by some been estimated could be dealt with in any degree economically by these methods.  You would find yourself driven to doing work in which perhaps only 25 per cent. of the total money that was spent by the State was going to the specific purpose of the relief of unemployment, I mean going into the pockets and going into the stomachs and on to the backs of unemployed men, and, therefore, one would <Col N="239" /> have to draw a line where one would say at a certain point that it is far better to give the unemployed man money without working or money for doing some work which was equiva lent to something as bad as digging a hole and filling it up again rather than spend three or four times as much money on work of doubtful immediate economic value which would only give him a small proportion of the total cost.  If that state of affairs was reached it would be at that point at which the reduced sum of production of those who have access to home-produced raw materials only would have to bear the brunt of the whole of the maintenance of the whole of the population.  At that time ration cards and quota cards and vouchers of one kind or another, entitling people to have direct access to that pool of goods as distinct from having access to a nominal claim upon money, would begin to operate.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mulcahy spoke of the necessity of keeping up the economic morale of the people.  I agree.  I think it is necessary that they should realise the fact of the seriousness of the situation, the fact that that seriousness may increase, but the fact which is even more important, that by co-operation among all of us and absolutely full hard work in the degree in which the thing is at our disposal, we can meet it.  We can, even if we are cut off altogether over quite a considerable period of years, feed ourselves on something which is good even if it is not the thing which ordinarily we do consume.</P>
    <P>In my opinion, if we put our backs into it, if we fully organise it and work together, we can provide ourselves with enough fuel to keep us warm and comfortable, and to keep our enterprises in operation.  Out of our native materials, while we may not be so fashionably or variously clothed, I think we can clothe ourselves in an adequate manner. Therefore, while I think an economic difficulty may be facing us, and we may have to face a drastic change in the nature of the commodities we consume, I do not think we need face a position in which there will be either hunger or cold among our people if we all work together in trying to prevent it.</P>

      <P>Whether speaking in support of a Budget or in opposition to a Budget, I always feel that my sympathy at this period of the year is entirely with the Minister for Finance, whoever he may be.  The Minister for Finance is the unfortunate instrument that has to come before the House every year, and, as it were, pick the pockets of the public for the expenditure of others.  I do agree with certain observations contained in his statement to the effect that it is common enough, in the House and outside, to find that the people who are continuously and clamorously demanding further expenditure are the first to kick when the expenditure so incurred has got to be borne by the people.  But I notice in this statement by the Minister the usual type of evasions which we have been experiencing for the last ten years, namely, that there is one major question, and behind that smoke-screen vast sums of money are collected from the people, the one major question being blamed as the cause of the total expenditure.  In the early years of the present Administration, &ldquo;social services&rdquo; was the domestic cat which was responsible for every mess around the house.  When the social services cat died, we had the economic war, and, as one Budget beat the other so that the previous one appeared to be a pigmy, we had one kind of catch-cry after the other.  Now it is neutrality, neutrality and the Army.  In its day, the increased development of social services did cost a considerable amount of money, but it cost approximately only 25 per cent. of the increases which were put on the people.  In a subsequent number of years, the economic war did cost a considerable amount of money, but again only about 25 per cent. of the extra sum asked for in the Budget.  Now our defence preparations are costing an increased number of millions, but again only a fraction of the increased number of millions demanded in this particular Budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before I came in here to-day I took a glance at the sum demanded for public services in each of the last 11 years, and in ten of those 11 years there was no war.  There was no big expenditure necessary to maintain <Col N="241" /> neutrality, but, nevertheless, by steady jumps of £1,000,000 or £1,500,000 per year every Budget left the previous one behind.  In the year 1931-32 the cost of public services was £21,900,000, or approximately £22,000,000.  In the following year it jumped to £24,000,000. That was the time when the social services cat was active.  In the following year it was up to £26,000,000, an increase of £4,000,000 in two years.  In the following year, 1934-35, it was up to £26,500,000.  The economic war cat was operating at this particular stage. For 1935-36 it was much the same figure. For 1937-38 it was up to £28,000,000. The cat was nearly dead then, but there was an extra £1,500,000 put on. Then we had the burial of that cat, and we had an increase of £250,000 in the following year.  But there was no war.  There was no neutrality to be defended.  There was no economic war to be paid for.  When that particular war was ended&mdash;the people having been living for years in the hope that all this exorbitant expenditure and heavy demands would be at least reduced when the economic war was finished&mdash;we saw a further jump.  Then in the year 1939, before there was any outbreak of war, before this neutrality expenditure had to be incurred, we had an increase of another £1,000,000, bringing the figure to £29,000,000.  We had a Supplementary Budget then&mdash;it could be called a war Budget in that particular year &mdash; to provide the necessary war expenditure, and the estimated figure for the present year is over £35,000,000.  The explanation given is that that is the price of our neutrality.  That is the price of the present Government, which is increasing at the rate of £2,000,000 per annum, and the longer you are there the higher will be the bill.  Ten years ago you were a very popular Party. You were very dear to the people. To-day I think you are too dear for the people.  The Minister himself must remember ten years ago.  When he spoke from this position here, and when the demands on the public purse were a very considerable number of millions less than what he is demanding to-day, the wails of the present Minister from this position here would bring tears to the eyes of a mummy.</P>

      <P>That is the effect you had on the mummies who were behind you at the time.  Every year we heard the same thing&mdash;that this country was being administered along the lines of a mightly empire; that the Ministers who were officiating at the time were aping in their channels of expenditure, the expenditure of the mightiest countries in Europe; and that the decent, honest, hardworking citizen in the country was back-broken by the ferocious demands of ruthless, thoughtless Ministers, who were demanding approximately half as much as the present Minister is demanding here to-day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A certain amount of the increased expenditure in this Budget is unquestionably due to war expenditure of one kind or another.  Portion of it may be directly due to expenditure on defence measures, but it is necessitated by difficulties arising, either directly or indirectly out of the war.  I think the Minister, although, as he says, it may not be the soundest kind of budgetary stance, is right, in an exceptional year of this kind, to come before the House and say frankly that there is still a very big gap left between expenditure and revenue and that that very considerable gap had to be bridged by borrowing.  Normally, I am told, that is a rather doubtful procedure, but, in a year such as this.  I think it is perfectly permissible.  It is certainly permissible and defensible when we view the weight of taxes that must be imposed even to narrow the gap to the distance that still remains.  I feel bound to say this, that I think in a House such as this, when we manipulate the income tax code to the extent that we propose, and when we increase the income tax on every ordinary person paying income tax to the alarming figure of 7/6 without considering our own position here exempt from income tax, it shows bad taste almost to the extent of indecency.  I think that a demand on the income-tax payers to the extent that is indicated here, by a House that has exempted its members from income tax, is going <Col N="243" /> to give a bad flavour and a bad colour to every demand in this Budget.</P>
    <P>If the position is so terribly serious that the income tax outlined here, and the other taxes outlined here, are absolutely essential, and that no further progress can be made to meet our difficulties through channels of economy&mdash;that there could be no clipping and saving in the way of expenditure&mdash;then I think an assessment should be made as to the amount of the allowances paid here that are properly allowances or compensation for loss suffered while attending here, and that income tax be paid on the portion of our allowances that could or should be regarded as salary.  I am not speaking with my tongue in my cheek, to use a familiar expression.  I believe, being a family man, that any further taxation on my shoulders would be felt very acutely, but we cannot get away from the fact that there are 138 of us here and most of us are going to march through the turnstiles any minute now and impose a tax of 7/6 in the pound on the earnings of the bulk of the people outside.  We will be doing that as people who have exempted ourselves from paying any income tax on an income of practically £500 a year.</P>
    <P>I am mentioning that without having had consultation with anybody.  I am mentioning it, as I think I am bound to do, not in the interests of Party, but in the interests of Parliament.  I think if Parliament goes ahead with these repeated income tax increases, they will be regarded as scarcely justifiable coming from a Parliament which has exempted itself from income tax.  The other taxes raised will, perhaps, affect considerably more people and may affect many of those people even more harshly and more heavily than the increased income tax will affect those who must pay it.</P>
    <P>I already made some reference to the alarming increase in the tax on petrol. I think petrol is normally a very fair and legitimate field for taxation.  We were accustomed at times of financial difficulty to increase the tax by one penny or so on the gallon of petrol.  At that time petrol was very freely used, easily obtained, readily sold.  It was <Col N="244" /> freely used by very many people and far more petrol was used for pleasure than for trade or business.  We have now reached the point&mdash;we certainly did up to the end of last month&mdash;when every drop of petrol consumed in this country was being consumed for the purpose of business.</P>

      <P>It is a terrible indictment of the Department of Supplies if there were people using petrol for pleasure purposes between Christmas Day and 30th April, and that was known to the Government.  In that period many people, whose own livelihoods depended on a sufficiency of petrol, and upon whom the lives of hundreds of others depended, were left stranded on the roadside, glad to get a lift in a bus, a cart or a trap.  I was never sufficiently uncharitable to say about the present administration that when that appalling set of circumstances existed it was within the Government&rsquo;s knowledge that many people were getting and using petrol for pleasure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was supposed to be a system in operation since 1st January under which no one could get a thimbleful of petrol for any purpose other than essential business, and even for essential business they could get only 10 or 25 per cent. of their normal requirements. I think the Minister&rsquo;s information is wrong, but, if it is right, I am glad he spoke before the petrol motion came on.  I will amend my <Col N="245" /> remarks to this extent in deference to the Minister, who has information which I have not got, that the bulk of the petrol being used in the country at the moment is being used for business purposes.  The people using petrol are of two classes, the poorer classes of people, namely, the hackney-men and the poorer lorry owners, and the other class would be mainly commercial and professional people whose livelihood depends on the use of petrol and who make their living on the road.  They are subject to all the increased taxes that are outlined here, subject to the very large income-tax increase and, in addition, to the increased tax of 5d. for every gallon of petrol they use.</P>
    <P>I think, roughly speaking, it would be an extra 5d. for every 25 miles covered.  The same would apply to the hackney-men and the lorry owners.  I think that that is an indefensible attitude for the Minister to adopt. When we had a foreign Government in this country in another war situation &mdash;perhaps not as terrible as the existing one&mdash;and when that Government found it necessary to put a tax on petrol, they discriminated, in putting on that petrol taxation, between those who got petrol, or had to buy it, for purposes of trade, profession or business, and those who got it merely for their pleasure, and there was a system by which those who were paying the full petrol tax, and using that petrol for their means of livelihood, got a rebate, according to the amount they purchased&mdash;not a rebate for the whole amount that they purchased in a month, but I think a rebate of about 50 per cent. of the tax.</P>
    <P>Now, let us take the case of the tobacco tax.  The Minister says, quite rightly, that that tax always gives a big yield, and he estimates for a further and bigger yield.  Now, whatever may be said for a further heavy increase in the tax on cigarettes, I think that an increase of 4d. an ounce on the cheapest type of tobacco is excessive.  There is a provision in this Budget, no matter how it may be criticised or who may criticise it, to do the best that can be done, in terribly difficult financial circumstances, for the poorest sections of our people, and I <Col N="246" /> welcome that; but I do think that the one person who is getting very severely knocked about in this Budget is the person who is on the next rung of the ladder to the very poorest person who is absolutely destitute or unemployed or in receipt of unemployment assistance or home help.  I am referring to the man who is in employment, and not in receipt of any of these benefits.  The man who is in receipt of unemployment assistance or home assistance is getting some relief in this Budget as a result of the increased cost of living generally, but the man who comes worst out of this Budget, in my opinion, is the man who actually is in employment and who is trying to rear a little family and who has no bonus or no extra help from the State or any other source.</P>
    <P>Now, an ounce of tobacco a week, which I suppose is the very minimum that any smoker would use, means an extra 4d. a week to that man; and worked into the Budget there is a determined statement of policy that no matter how hard such a man works, no matter how successful he is at his job, or no matter how exceptionally great satisfaction he gives to his employer, not by one farthing a week can his wages go up.  That man is the butt of taxation there, and there is a rigid rule here to say to such a man: &ldquo;You can never improve your position.&rdquo;  In other words, the Minister takes credit&mdash;and is entitled to take credit, in a difficult year&mdash;for trying to balance or to even out, as against the increased cost of living, the lot of the really destitute, those who are out of work and receiving unemployment assistance or home help; but the case that I have argued repeatedly here and elsewhere is this: that the man in regular employment, with a big, dependent family of, say, ten or 11 children, is in fact, a poorer man than the unemployed man with, say, one or two dependents.  I have found here in this House and elsewhere a tendency to face up to anything except the capitation weekly rate of income for a household. If we have anything to give away, I think it should be given away along the lines of giving it to the households with the lowest weekly <Col N="247" /> capitation income.  Take the case of an employed man with a wife and eight children, and, let us say, a wage of 30/- a week.  The weekly capitation rate of income for that man and his children would amount to 3/- per head per week.  On the other hand, take the case of a man, with one dependant, who is not employed, with 12/- a week, let us say.  The weekly income capitation rate there is 6/- as against 3/- in the case of the other man.  Now, I do not want to take anything back from that unemployed man&mdash;that 6/- for himself or 6/- for his dependant&mdash;but it seems to me that the other case is more worthy of consideration, and although it is not every man&rsquo;s fault, or any man&rsquo;s fault, that he is out of work, there are others who are out of work through their own fault.</P>

      <P>Very few, I admit, but at least we have to take off our hats to the man who has held on to his job, in spite of the fact that he has only a small wage, and in spite of the fact that his weekly income capitation rate is only 3/- as against the unemployed man&rsquo;s 6/-.  I want to see that whatever is to be paid by the State in relief to the people shall be used to the best effect.  I know that that means administrative labour and all kinds of difficult returns, and that it is handier to take the unemployed men who are in receipt of unemployment assistance and, after them, those who are in receipt of home assistance, and if there are harder cases than either of these, not contained in either of these lists, then we say that that is too bad, but these other cases should be dealt with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>After all, you have a machinery now in this country such as you have never had in the history of this country before&mdash;the machinery that exists through the medium of the parish councils.  Through the machinery of parish councils very real cases of hardship, that could be properly regarded as greater cases of destitution than those of any unemployed people, could be brought to light, and I would urge very strongly on the Minister the advisability of taking the weekly capitation <Col N="248" /> rate of income into consideration and saying: &ldquo;We will include, for purposes of registration, the households of people who may be at work but whose weekly capitation rate of income is lower than that figure.&rdquo;  It may mean a bigger increase.  It may mean a much bigger increase than the sum necessary to be issued for present purposes.  I only know that in my own day-to-day or week-to-week experience I visit the homes of poor people where the income per head in the workers&rsquo; houses is lower by far than in any of the houses of smaller families who are officially regarded as destitute and are, in fact, unemployed.</P>
    <P>On that point, I listened to a discussion between Deputy Hickey and the Parliamentary Secretary on the question of issuing vouchers.  Like most other Deputies, I have seen both systems working.  There is at least a debatable kind of argument against vouchers, that there is a stigma of pauperism attached to them.  On the other hand, even though it may not be true in the majority of cases, certainly in some cases where you are making an issue and that issue is meant for dependents in a household, the goods may not always reach these dependents. Again the Minister&rsquo;s colleagues and others need not tell me that there is any water-tight assurance in respect of a voucher system that a voucher for a lb. of butter is not going to produce a packet of &ldquo;fags&rdquo; and be put down in the books as butter.  I had experience in an administrative area where the voucher system was completely withdrawn for the simple reason that that kind of thing was happening and it was happening very much against the interests of the person with the voucher because where there might be a voucher for a lb. of butter that cost 1/7 at the time, the person with the voucher would say to the shopkeeper: &ldquo;I do not want butter,&rdquo; and he got instead a packet of cigarettes, value for 1/- at that time, instead of 1/7 worth of butter.  In that area at least the system had to be discontinued. But I take it from the statement of the Minister that really what he was announcing here is the intention of the Government to supplement, in some kind of way, the nourishment <Col N="249" /> income of various householders and that he is no more wedded for all time to the voucher system than to the money system.</P>
    <P>With regard to the arguments of the Parliamentary Secretary, I certainly could not follow him.  I see here that it is the Minister&rsquo;s intention to give vouchers for goods up to a certain amount a week.  I do not see any indication that these vouchers are going to have precedence over money.  Except the vouchers are going to have precedence in the grocer&rsquo;s shop over money. then there is no point in the remarks of the Parliamentary Secretary.  His argument was that we had better give these people a cheque for food than a cheque for money as food might run short.  If food runs short, the vouchers cannot buy food.  If loaves of bread are not in the shop, the fact that a man has vouchers is not going to produce them.  On the other hand if the intention is that these vouchers are going to take precedence over money, so that if two men go into a shop, one with a voucher and the other with money, and there is only one loaf left, the man with the voucher must get it, then there is some point in the remark, but certainly I did not read that into the Minister&rsquo;s statement.</P>
    <P>In the course of a very lengthy statement with a lot of which I feel compelled to agree, I think the Minister was rather unfortunate in some of his remarks.  I think it was rather unfortunate that in a statement dealing with such an important matter as the Budget he should have thought it advisable to try to make the Defence Council share responsibility with him. I think more unfortunate still was the way in which one newspaper featured that particular portion of his remarks. The implication to be drawn from the Minister&rsquo;s references is that he was fighting like a tiger against expenditure on the Army, that he looked here, there and everywhere for anybody to lend him a hand in his fight, that he appealed to the members of the Defence Council, and that there he got no more help than in any other place.  I think it entirely inadvisable to bring into a debate here in any kind of argumentative way, any of the matters <Col N="250" /> dealt with by that body.  I have no authority or right to speak for that body but, speaking as one member, I am bound to say that that is the first I ever heard of any fight being put up by the Minister for Finance against Army expenditure.  The circumstances under which we took up duty on the Defence Council were that we understood that we had no say in matters of policy.  Whoever happened to be the Government laid down policy and, within the four corners of that policy, we would try to create the best defence machine we could in the country.  I think the Minister will agree that, directly, our help was never asked by him in that matter, and seeing that when it was asked, it was never refused, it would have been better if there had been no references to that particular body.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should not have intervened in this debate were it not for the fact that included in the Budget we have an enormous, and to my mind, an unjustifiable, increase in the duty on tobacco.  I think it very unfortunate that the Minister should have decided to allow this increase to be included in this year&rsquo;s Budget.  It is not only unfortunate; it is unwise.  Much has been said in support of the policy of the Government in giving a certain amount of relief to the more destitute sections of our people but there is no one who feels at the present time in greater need of relief than the man who is engaged in manual work&mdash;the man who is working in the bog providing the nation&rsquo;s fuel or the man who is working in the field producing the nation&rsquo;s food.  These are the men upon whom the nation depends to-day even more than on the Army, the members of this House or the members of the Government. If the manual worker, whose wages in many cases are less than 30/- a week, is placed in the position that he is unable to provide himself with a sufficient amount of tea, or of the food to which he was accustomed, it is impossible to visualise how he could be expected to work in a satisfactory manner, especially when tobacco has been taxed more heavily.  I am sure if the Minister had any practical experience of what it means to work in a <Col N="251" /> bog, or in a field or in a factory, and found the supply of tea cut down to once daily, at least he could find comfort in the tobacco to which he was accustomed.  Now the price of tobacco is increased by 4d. per ounce.  That may not seem a severe imposition to some people, but to a working man with a wage of 4/- or 5/- a day, it is a severe burden.</P>
      <P>The Minister might be excused for imposing that tax on working people if there were no alternative sources from which he could derive revenue.  I know that it is always considered imprudent for a Deputy who is not burdened with the responsibilities of the Finance Department to suggest other sources of taxation.  In this case the injustice to the working people is so severe and the discontent that this tax will create amongst the poorer section so great, that any Deputy who can suggest alternative means of providing revenue should do so, and the Minister should withdraw the tobacco tax in its place.  I do not know why the Minister has concentrated upon this small luxury of the poorer people, and passed over expensive luxuries indulged in by other sections of the community. In the course of his Budget statement the Minister expressed the view that people were turning from the consumption of beer and spirits to other things.  I was hoping that the Minister would follow up that statement by announcing increased or new taxes on luxuries or amusements that are taking the place of beer or spirits. I wondered why the Minister did not increase taxation on amusements, particularly on cinemas and race meetings.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quite certain that if taxation were imposed which would press as heavily on the people who now enjoy those amusements as the tobacco tax presses on working people, it would provide a considerable amount for the Exchequer.  I readily admit that taxation such as I suggest might be a little more difficult to collect, and necessitate mental labour greater than collecting <Col N="252" /> the tax on tobacco, nevertheless I feel in justice to working people that the Minister should have considered other alternatives.  Very considerable sums of money are spent on various forms of wearing apparel which, in an emergency such as this, could be dispensed with or otherwise bear additional taxation.  I offer these suggestions to the Minister as alternatives to taxing tobacco&mdash;the only luxury left to the working people.  A manual worker who is engaged from 7.30 in the morning until 6 p.m. has very little time for other forms of amusement.  His pleasure is generally derived from his pipe, and for that reason the Minister should seriously consider withdrawing the tax on tobacco.</P>
      <P>In regard to income-tax, Deputy O'Higgins drew attention to the fact that Deputies are exempt from the payment of income-tax.  That is a state of affairs that should not be allowed to continue.  It is certainly a cause of grave dissatisfaction amongst all sections of the people.  It is a position that could not be justified and, as far as I know, has never been justified. No one has attempted to justify it either here or outside.  I am wondering if Deputy O'Higgins will have the courage to put down a motion proposing the withdrawal of that exemption.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyLinehan" hpid="Mr. Linehan Mr. Linehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Linehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I rather sympathised with the Minister when I heard Deputy Cogan asking for a withdrawal of the tobacco tax, much as I should like to see it withdrawn.  The bulk of the Minister&rsquo;s statement was in praise of the weed without which, he said, his Budget would be in a very hopeless position.  Deputy Cogan referred to other forms of taxation, but what I am afraid of is that there again you are not going to get equality of sacrifice. Take the increased duty on oils and petrol.  In order to justify the increased duty and petrol rationing something should be done to tighten up the regulations.  I do not know what is wrong but, in the eyes of the public, something is wrong when there is increased taxation which will fall equally heavily on the shoulders of persons earning a living and persons using petrol for pleasure purposes. <Col N="253" /> There will be a certain amount of public resentment at that state of affairs.  I wish the Minister would invent some system of taxation, as far as the use of motor cars is concerned, whereby he would be able to tax every car that appears at a golf course, a race meeting or a football match, or that drives people to Mass, when they could very well walk.</P>
      <P>I am quite certain that it is not beyond the ingenuity of the Revenue Commissioners, if these people are still entitled to allocations of petrol, to do something to put the bulk of the burden on them.  I think the Minister will agree with me that, if there are certain sections of the community who are receiving petrol coupons now who need them only for driving to dances and race-meetings, it would be a patriotic act on the part of these people to report to the Department that, for their essential business, they require only so many coupons and do not need the rest, because it is very hard, when the burden of taxation crushes everybody, for the hackney-car driver, with a wife and family depending on him, to have to try to spin out his few gallons for the month, while seeing somebody in a professional position driving his car to the golf course.  That is one thing I should like to see the Minister do, and I hope that before the next Budget&mdash; I hope the war will not last so long but if it is still on&mdash;the Minister will have adopted some means of dealing with the playboys who are merely making a laughing-stock of the situation throughout the country.  I believe that 90 per cent. of the people are acting up fairly to the spirit of the arrangement, but there is always a certain type of person who wants to do more than his neighbour and who takes great pleasure out of driving around now, when he knows that his neighbour cannot do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister was rather wise when he promised to look into the question of the betting tax on race-courses, because I think he will admit that, so far as betting is concerned, the humble office in the country town has been quite a source of revenue to him.  In a war period, the fact that a person goes to a race-meeting means that he is indulging <Col N="254" /> in a luxury to a certain extent. A great number of people get a livelihood from racing, I agree, but a person who can bet on the tote and can afford to invest a pound, or the bookmaker who can afford to pay odds to a pound, can afford to pay a contribution to the State.  That tax, I think, did exist at one time, and I see no reason why he should not introduce it again.</P>
    <P>This is the first occasion since the Minister became Minister for Finance on which I have nothing to say to him about death duties.  I am quite sure the Minister will appreciate that, because he knows as well as I know that, either personally or professionally, the figure of £10,000 is not likely to affect me very much, so that the extra taxation he is imposing will not worry me in the slightest.  I am very glad that he did not descend to a lower level.</P>
    <P>To my mind, the most important part of the Minister&rsquo;s statement was right at the beginning when he referred to the various theorists on economics, national finance, currency, credit and banking.  The present emergency situation, and the taxation arising from it, has led to a terribly prolific crop of that type of thing.  Every paper in the country, daily and weekly, has adopted its own pet scheme of currency control, and the extraordinary thing is that the Minister rather helped them by his hint that he was not very orthodox.  The Minister may not have meant that, but I am quite sure that the Minister, who, I expect, reads these diatribes nine times out of ten, has not yet read anything in the new spate of lectures on the currency with which he would agree, no matter how unorthodox he is. I should not have minded if the Minister had been far less orthodox in this Budget, because when I realised what the deficiency was, and also that the deficiency was practically the total amount of expenditure on the Army, which we hope will not be a recurring item, I was terribly sorry that the Minister did not take his courage in his hands and borrow for the whole lot. It might have been unorthodox, but I believe this was a time at which he should have done it.</P>
    <P>I believe that, for two reasons, it <Col N="255" /> would have been easy.  Firstly, there would be, nationally, a good response to a loan at present, and, secondly, I am quite sure that there is a certain amount of money dribbling back into the country, that when people, having &ldquo;got the wind up&rdquo; about investments, got an opportunity of cashing them in at a reasonable rate, did so, and that the bulk of that money is now on deposit in the banks at 1 per cent.  There would be a considerable sum available for investment in that direction, and, speaking from memory, I think the figures of bank deposits increased by something like £12,000,000 last year, which, in my opinion, is due to a considerable extent to money coming back into this country from the cashing of investments.  From my own small experience, I know that if the smaller investor, the man with the couple of hundred pounds invested in British War Loan or British Post Office Savings Certificates&mdash;it might represent his life savings&mdash;if he were able to draw out his money and put it on deposit in the bank, he did so.  I think the Minister could have avoided what is the real bone of contention, the tobacco tax, by borrowing for the whole lot.  I do not think the country would object, and I go so far as to say that, if I were in his position and facing a situation in which I knew that estimated revenue may not come up to the mark, I would have borrowed £15,000,000, and I imagine that it would have been possible to get it at 3 per cent. or 3½ per cent.  The interest on that sum would not be such a terrible blow to the finances of the State at present, even though it would have to remain there.</P>
    <P>What I am afraid of is that, if this emergency period lasts, the Minister, as time goes on, will have to assume that his revenue will decrease and that he will not be in a position to reduce any of his expenditure, and, sooner or later, he will come to a point at which he will not be able to attempt to bridge the gap by taxation.  I think he might have started doing it this year and it might have given the country a far greater shock and brought them to a better realisation of the taxation <Col N="256" /> position, if he had done so.  The Minister was very clever from the point of view of the reaction of this Budget on his Government and himself.  For the last three months, everybody looked forward to a terrible Budget.  I was in a shop in Dublin yesterday morning and I saw a lady buying an article for a little girl she had with her.  The sales-talk of the assistant about a purchase tax and everything else sold that lady three articles instead of one.  The result of that was that the lady who bought the three articles felt that she had been &ldquo;codded,&rdquo; but the rest of the country did not, and they were quite delighted when the purchase tax, the tax on bicycles and even the suggestion that the gap of 3/6 between the two rates of income-tax might be narrowed by more than 1/- did not materialise.  The position is that, when the Minister went only a little way in the matter of taxation, I am sorry he went that distance at all, but it is a very clever Budget, because, having scared the wits out of the entire country&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyLinehan" hpid="Mr. Linehan Mr. Linehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Linehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister did.  I do not think that, in any of his statements on financial matters for the past 12 months, the Minister was ever very optimistic. Previously he was always optimistic and I remember that his first Budget was extremely optimistic.  Last year, he was very optimistic even when he referred to the fact that Budgets were being worn unbalanced.  At any rate, somebody scared the people and they were terrified about taxation, with the result that immediate reaction yesterday evening was: &ldquo;All that has happened is that tobacco has gone up.&rdquo; There are people connected with the licensing trade who, I am quite sure, would have lit bonfires for the Minister on Leinster Lawn last night.  It is a brilliant Budget from the political point of view, but the funny thing is&mdash; and I find it very hard to appreciate how people regard these things&mdash;that when people expect high taxation and it does not come off, one would imagine that they had not to pay taxation at all.  Last night, when they heard that <Col N="257" /> nothing but tobacco, postage, and petrol were taxed and that income-tax had gone up, one would imagine that they had not to pay this sum of £41,000,000 at all.  One would think that the Minister by a wave of the hand had knocked off the other £4,000,000 or £5,000,000 for which he had not imposed increased taxes.</P>
      <P>I am afraid that there is a danger of a very rude awakening sooner or later. If the Minister had budgeted more severely, he would have given the country an indication of our financial position and he would have brought home to our people a more serious realisation of that position.  I was very glad that the Minister, at the opening of his speech, referred to agriculture. He said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Without a sound agricultural economy, no amount of juggling with financial machinery or bits of paper will avail, no national well-being can be assured and all progress must be arrested.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That is a statement with which everybody will agree.  On his own statement, the Minister admits that his position as Minister for Finance rests on a sound agricultural economy.  I am very much afraid that the Minister will have to get after his colleague, the Minister for Agriculture&mdash;I do not want to criticise the Minister for Agriculture on this Resolution&mdash;in order to get a much more definite and a better-planned policy for dealing with agriculture, even in the small things, than we have now.  Things have not been too bad up to the present.  People have been able to pull out but I am afraid that certain things are going to arise in the agricultural industry, through foot-and-mouth disease&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Minister referred to the reaction of the outbreak of that disease on our national economy, and I wanted to point out the danger of further reactions.  The areas which are not affected are hit exactly as the areas that are.  In the cattle and bacon trades, people are being hit harder every day and as regards the other major agricultural industries&mdash;for instance, the dairying industries&mdash; unless something is done to improve the price of milk at the creameries, dairying will be in a bad state.  At any other period of agricultural depression, one industry might be losing while another would be paying.  Cattle might not pay but pigs would pay.  Pigs might be down but cattle would be up.  If both were down, the milk cheque would help the farmer.  I am afraid that the three of them will be drifting down together. I fear that the people do not realise that.  We are pulling along and not facing the position individually.  I believe that if the agricultural situation&mdash;agriculture being the foundation of our national economy&mdash;was examined by the Minister&rsquo;s own Department, from the point of view of its reaction on finance, he would be satisfied that there should be careful planning, even in the smallest details of agricultural activity, if we are to pull through a long period of emergency. Even the consumption of cigarettes and the duty payable on them will be affected by the condition of our agricultural economy.  If a man has not the money, he cannot buy cigarettes.</P>

    <P>I was glad to hear the Minister refer to the question of Supplementary Estimates.  I was delighted to hear him say that Supplementary Estimates <Col N="259" /> were a habit, that this habit had been growing, that it was a bad habit and a habit he hoped to end.</P>

      <P>I think that the Minister was quite right when he said that the people are entitled to see the bill on one sheet of paper.  Under these circumstances, I wonder was the Minister just to himself.  If he felt that his figures for revenue were optimistic, he should not have been optimistic.  If he felt that his figures for expenditure were optimistic, he should not have been optimistic.  He should have shown us the worst side of the picture and, by doing that, he might avoid Supplementary Estimates.  Is not the position that the Minister has fixed in his Budget statement the amount that he expects to spend?  If he has to spend more, it will mean the introduction of a Supplementary Estimate.</P>
      <P>If he gets in less in revenue than he expects, it will also mean a Supplementary Estimate.  If, at the back of the Minister&rsquo;s mind, there is a feeling of optimism about one or two items, would it not be better to seem to be pessimistic and avoid Supplementary Estimates?  People will get the feeling that this is only a spring Budget, and may think there is a danger that we shall have a harvest Budget.  This idea of having a Budget every six months takes people&rsquo;s minds away from a realisation of the true position.  If the Minister puts 4d. on cigarettes now and 2d. more later, that does not seem to be as bad as if he put the 6d. on at the same time, but it is not a good system.  I believe the Minister would find it easier to avoid Supplementary Estimates if he made the bill a real one and made it appear to be as bad as it possibly could be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister refers to orders which are to be introduced dealing with wages.  I find it hard to understand <Col N="260" /> that, because I imagine that, at the moment, there is little likelihood of terrific increases of wages in any of these public utility or sheltered occupations.  If present conditions remain, I doubt if many people will be in a position to look for higher wages or if many people will be in a position to pay higher wages.  I wonder if the Minister was wise in introducing orders of that nature.  It looks bad&mdash; whatever the real effect may be&mdash;to say to anyone: &ldquo;You may not earn more than so much per week; we shall not permit any increase.&rdquo;  I agree with the Minister&rsquo;s viewpoint regarding wages chasing the cost of living and the cost of living chasing wages.  It is like the story of the egg and the hen; nobody knows which came first.  I do not think it is a good thing from the point of view of public policy to have an order of this House stating that a person may nor earn more than so much per week.  The Minister may have sound reasons for this course, but I do not like to see such a matter appearing in an order of the House. It will, in fact, help the type of propaganda that Deputy Cogan referred to when he spoke of the allowances and salaries paid to members of this House. I was rather amused at Deputy Cogan&rsquo;s reference because, after taking advantage by propagandising about it, he asked whether Deputy O'Higgins would introduce a motion on the subject. I thought that it would be much more effective if Deputy Cogan had said that, as Deputy O'Higgins had not done so, he proposed to do it himself. Why he side-stepped the issue by handing the onus to Deputy O'Higgins, I do not know.  With public opinion fluctuating, the smallest handle is good enough with which to hit the institutions of State.  I do not think that that type of criticism or that the type criticism we get in some of the papers is doing the slightest amount of good. At a period when the same matters were in issue, I do not think that a lot of the people who are so anxious about us now worried very much about us.  It is very easy to be converted and to be honest and sincere after the issue. It is remarkable how these things can be picked out and utilised.  I think <Col N="261" /> the Minister is unwise in giving the type of person anxious to make capital out of everything of that nature a handle by an order of this nature.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that the country is very much interested in what happens to Deputies&rsquo; allowances.  When the matter of Deputies&rsquo; allowances was in question, I think the country was not very interested in it, and that it did not make twopence worth of difference.  This silly sort of thing that has been utilised by a lot of cranks is not helpful to anyone.  The very people who are making most noise about it, if they were in here themselves, would be horrified by that attitude.  If the Government had to go to the country to-morrow and they went on the issue of income-tax on these allowances, I do not think the country would worry very much about it.  At the same time there is this to be said about it.  The Minister in his Budget statement referred to equality of sacrifice, and that is the very statement which is being picked up.  The danger I see is that an order has been made stabilising wages for certain sections of the community, and the Minister will not adopt the suggestion made by Deputies in this House about our own position. These people will use that and say it is very easy to talk about equality of sacrifice as long as the equality does not apply to yourself.</P>
    <P>I am sorry the Minister gave these people that handle, because I do not think this is a time when any of these minor matters will make the slightest difference, and the less talk we have about minor details the better.  When these things were in issue in this House these people did not seem to be very interested.  There was a lot of time wasted in this House when Deputies&rsquo; allowances and Ministers&rsquo; salaries were in question, but I do not think the country got into any frenzy of enthusiasm on one side or the other.  At the same time, when public opinion is fluctuating and may jump in directions it never would jump otherwise, the less opportunity the Government and Parliament give any crank to talk about these things the better.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="262" /> I want to make a reference to the charming little booklet which the Minister circulated in which he shows the items which were larger in 1940-41 than in 1941-42, and the ones which were less.  It is rather unfortunate that if people examine this table they will find that one of the biggest drops in any Estimate is the drop in the Estimate for unemployment insurance and unemployment assistance, which is brought about by the extension of the Unemployment Period Orders.  Again, that is the type of thing that is causing that line of agitation in the country.  They will pick out the Minister&rsquo;s phrase about equality of sacrifice, and say that it is not equality of sacrifice when certain people, by an Order, are put off unemployment assistance for certain periods.  That is the danger I see in that type of Order.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister will have to consider, so far as unemployment and other things are concerned, dealing with them in a national manner.  I regret very much that there are at present such things as parish councils, Muintir na Tíre, and guilds of goodwill, because they are very handy for the Government.  When anything is required, such as turf production or something like that, these bodies will be told to do their part.  If they were not there, the Government would have to face matters like turf production as national matters and deal with them themselves.  I really think it is their job.</P>
    <P>No matter how good these voluntary organisations are, and some of them are very good, or how active they may be, they will never get the same result during an emergency as the Government would by dealing with them as a national matter.  If we are to carry out a big scheme of that kind this year, I ask the Minister to see that it will be made a national scheme and, so far as employment is concerned, that it will be made a national unemployment relief scheme.  I ask the Minister seriously not to permit any members of the Government or the Government as a whole to pass over to these voluntary organisations work that should be done nationally.  I agree that these voluntary <Col N="263" /> associations will try to do their best.</P>
    <P>When representatives of parish councils for an entire province meet and are addressed by the Taoiseach, who tells them what ought to be done as regards food production and turf production, I am afraid that that is not very much use.  These people will go back with the best intentions and will try to do all they can, but they have not the organisation, the money, or the equipment to deal with the matters as they ought to be dealt with. In addition I am sure the Minister realises how quickly voluntary enthusiasm evaporates.  When 200 or 300 people have been listening to a stirring address by somebody who wishes to impress on them the seriousness of a situation their enthusiasm will be at white heat.  For the next few days they will be all business.  The sounder people will keep up the pressure; but in a short time the enthusiasm of the bulk of them will begin to dwindle. The Minister knows that as well as I do.</P>
    <P>I think it is a pity that in the present emergency we ever heard of parish councils, or Muintir na Tire, or guilds of goodwill.  I think they are doing too much for the Government; they are allowing the Government to get away with a lot of things.  The Government are in the happy position that they can go to some section or other of the community who are bursting with energy; the Taoiseach or a Minister will address them and the problem is solved for the time being.  I am afraid that unless these matters are dealt with in a national manner they will be dealt with in a very slipshod manner. The first indication I saw of any really serious attempt to deal with the problem of turf production was when the Government brought in the county surveyors all over the country to deal with it as a great national matter.  I think that is the ideal way of doing it.  I hope that the Minister, to whom they must come for the money, will see that any such schemes will be dealt with in a national manner and will not be left in the hands of voluntary bodies, except in so far as they can assist of their own accord.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="264" /> I think the one tax that definitely shows equality of sacrifice is the increased postal tax.  One thing about it is that you pay as you use it, and I do not suppose anybody will quarrel with that.  I did not realise until shortly after the Budget statement, when I began to think over it, how that might apply to various people.  I can imagine people saying in their first enthusiasm that the Budget was not so bad after all, and that they would not mind this halfpenny extra, as it was a small matter. I am afraid, however, that after a few months, when people begin to realise what it means, they will have a different idea about the slight increase in the postal rates.  I can visualise that the Minister will get more out of shops and offices in the country by virtue of this extra halfpenny than he will get from them by the shilling on the income-tax.  One can visualise the position of a small business in the country where the expenditure on stamps might be 50/- a week.  The increase would be 12/8 per week on that, or about £30 per year.  The person running that business might not pay that much in income-tax.</P>
    <P>I think that, after a while, the people will begin to realise that in yesterday&rsquo;s Budget they got a substantial little whack from the Minister.  He got over several items in it in quite an easy fashion.  For example, he said that a tax of ½d. on 2d. was not going to hurt anybody.  The people, however, will realise what these taxes mean when they come to prepare their weekly budget, and find how much extra they will have to pay for the few ounces of plug, the packet of cigarettes, the box of matches, and the rest.  It is then, I suggest, the real criticism of the Budget will start.  The Minister can be very happy about it because, by the time all that has sunk into the minds of the people, his Financial Resolutions and his Finance Bill for the current year will have been passed, and he can rest content until next year unless, in the meantime, he is obliged to introduce a Supplementary Budget.</P>
    <P>Since the Minister for Finance cannot say with any certainty what the revenue from any particular item in the Budget may be, if the emergency continues, <Col N="265" /> or what amount of extraordinary expenditure he may be called upon to meet, I am sorry he did not resort to borrowing in order to cover the gap there is between his estimate of revenue and expenditure.  It may be quite unorthodox to suggest that, but as the people of this generation have already been called upon to finance several wars, economic and otherwise, I do not see why they should be called upon to shoulder the whole of the burden arising out of the present war.  I believe that, in time, the Minister will have to come round to my view and borrow.  It may be that there are members of my own Party who do not agree with me.</P>
    <P>The Minister is proposing that the sum to be defrayed by borrowing will be in or about £4,000,000.  Allowing for the items for which he takes credit on the other side of his accounts, he will need another £4,000,000, so that really the gap to be bridged may be said to be about £8,000,000.  If the Minister is obliged to bring in a Supplementary Estimate during the year to meet increased expenditure, or to make up the further gap caused by a falling revenue, he will have to raise money somehow.  He will probably have to borrow.  My suggestion to him is that he might as well borrow now. I think if I were in his position I would borrow in or about £15,000,000 in the hope that the interest charges on that, which would remain a national liability, would be small compared to the cost of borrowing £4,000,000 now, and another £4,000,000 in the near future.  It is not at all unlikely that, if the present situation continues and if the blockade tightens around us, the amount of revenue derived from tobacco, oils and so on will be very small.  If that should happen we will be faced with a situation that will be entirely new to this country&mdash;the possibility of not being able to get revenue from any source.  Would it not be wise to take steps now to meet that possibility?  I suggest that we should do so by borrowing and, as the Minister himself has suggested, by attempting economics.  The Government some years ago set up an economy committee.  I think it may be <Col N="266" /> said of it that it did not do very much damage.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in his statement, expressed the hope that when peace returns we may be able to bring our expenditure figures down to what they were in normal times.  Does he realise that that never happens?  Even in normal times, there is the tendency for taxation to increase.  Say that in peace times your expenditure is £25,000,000. It grows from year to year, and then, when an emergency arises, it jumps to £35,000,000 or £40,000,000.  People had hoped that, when the emergency was over, taxation would drop back to the old figure of £25,000,000, but experience shows that never happens.  We all hope that, so far as our defence expenditure is concerned, the Minister will not be asking the House next year to vote the sum which appears in this year&rsquo;s Budget.  I am sure he will agree that even the last war of our making, the economic war, left us in a rather bad position.  The ordinary Estimates show that our expenditure, in respect of each one, is much higher to-day than it was before the economic war started.  The point I want to bring home to the Minister is that a return to normal conditions does not mean getting back to the old position, so far as taxation is concerned.</P>
    <P>What I am afraid the country does not realise is, that if this emergency continues, this House may be called upon a year hence to vote a sum of £40,000,000, and that the Minister may not be able to raise more than £25,000,000 of it.  According to his statement yesterday, if it were not for the sums received from the tobacco and liquor duties his revenue this year would have been cut by more than half. Therefore, we ought to think of the situation we may have to face in 12 months&rsquo; time if this emergency continues. The Minister may want £40,000,000, and yet cannot hope to get more than £20,000,000 or £25,000,000 from revenue.</P>
    <P>Now is the time to face that situation. I do not believe in being unduly pessimistic.  On the contrary, I am optimistic about our financial and national position.  I think that the <Col N="267" /> country is standing up magnificently to the strain that is being put upon it. I think that, individually, the people are reacting very well to the shocks they are getting every other day.  You may hear criticism from people, but no one is grumbling.  The people are satisfied that we are pulling together. If, as I have said, the emergency continues, then sooner or later the country may be asked to deal with a situation that has never arisen before.  For that reason I ask the Minister to face the situation that confronts us and the country&mdash;that in 12 months&rsquo; time the most he may be able to get will be about half the revenue he requires. Now is the time to make preparations. Before the House adjourns for the Summer Recess, the Minister should certainly have his mind made up as to how he proposes to meet that situation, should it arise.  He would be adding to his own reputation as Minister for Finance and would be doing a good day&rsquo;s work for the country and the people by telling them bluntly what the situation is likely to be in a year&rsquo;s time, if the emergency continues. What I fear is that the people in general have not a proper understanding of the situation as regards our finances.  It has never been brought home to them, and never will be, as long as we follow the orthodox lines. Even the Minister himself has contributed to that lack of understanding of our financial position on the part of the people in the type of Budget that he introduced yesterday.  Having succeeded in scaring them during the last two or three weeks he brought forward a Budget yesterday which enabled them to sit back and say: &ldquo;Well, after all, it is not so bad.&rdquo;  The people, viewing the Budget in that light, seem to think that they are not being called upon to pay as much as they had expected. The country was eased by the Minister&rsquo;s pleasant little surprise, but what I feel is that when the people come to realise what the financial position of the country is likely to be, it will be too late for the Minister to do anything about it.</P>
    <P>I seriously think the Minister should give the country a terrible shock about the position.  It would be good for the <Col N="268" /> country, it would waken the people up and make them realise the position we are in.  I am quite sure the Minister will appreciate that, without having anybody to help him or to suggest to him what he would have to do if he finds himself in a much different position this time 12 months.  I am quite sure it would seriously horrify the people to think we may be in a position then where the Minister could only estimate 50 per cent. of the revenue for his requirements.  That is a situation which would have to be dealt with in a terribly drastic manner, and I am quite satisfied that it would be harder for the Minister to deal with it this time 12 months, as things are, than if he warned the country now about the possible position.</P>
    <P>After all, he said, in his own Budget statement, that the taxpayer ought to know what his bill is.  I will go further and say not alone ought the taxpayer know what his bill is but what it is likely to be.  In normal times, the Minister for Finance and the taxpayer have some control over the amount the bill is likely to reach, but at the present time I am afraid neither the Minister nor the unfortunate taxpayer has any but the most remote control over the possible magnitude of the bill. The Minister should make that clear now.</P>
    <P>The Minister did something yesterday which made him briefly popular. When you hear of anything like super-tax, excess profits tax, or corporation profits tax, it always suggests that those taxes refer to the other fellow, and it helps along the slogan &ldquo;Equality of sacrifice,&rdquo; because it is regarded as equality of sacrifice by the other fellow.  We are all human enough to hope that &ldquo;Equality of sacrifice&rdquo; means that.  However, I think the Minister will find that at the present time, the people feel that there are several corporations&mdash;to use the word generally used in the Finance Bill&mdash;in the country who, owing to the emergency circumstances, are possibly making more money than would be regarded as equitable profit in normal circumstances. If the Minister for Finance is going to dip his hand into their profits for relief to the general taxpayer, that <Col N="269" /> is certainly equality of sacrifice.  I am sure Deputy Corry will agree with that. I have often heard references in this House to people who were described as monopolists, and so on, and the references have been in terms which I would not use.  The reaction to the Budget in that respect is that people believe that, at long last, the Minister will get after some of those people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Linehan</NameTxt>
      <P>All I can say is that the Deputy who says that it is no good is far better acquainted with monopolists and others who have been attacked here in the House, than I am. The major people attacked generally are the people who deal in agricultural produce and sell products to farmers. I am quite sure he knows more than I do about that, and is a better judge than I am.  I remember that, not very long ago, he was horrified by one man making £60,000 by holding up grain.  I am quite sure he is delighted that the Minister is now in a position that, if that man is going to get £60,000, he will have to pay the excess profits tax and that the Minister can dip his hand in deeply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Linehan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the &ldquo;equality of sacrifice&rdquo; attitude again&mdash;let the other fellow suffer the &ldquo;equality&rdquo;.  In general, I would again warn the Minister that the feeling about this wage order is that it is a retrograde step. The Minister did not fully explain the reasons for it in his Budget statement. Possibly on some future occasion we will hear the reasons and the type of people most likely to be affected.  At the same time, I think the order highly unnecessary, for the simple reason that, if business conditions in general continue as they are, the employers will not be in a position to give increased wages and, in nine cases out of ten, the employees will realise that they are not in a position to demand them.  Any tinkering with thinks like that looks like a retrograde step, and is bound to give rise to criticism that is certainly not helpful and very often malicious.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="270" /> For that reason, I wish the Minister would say that, as far as employee and employer are concerned, in view of the way people have stood up to the situation, the Government is satisfied that the people, as groups and as individuals, will make no drastic attempts to disturb the relations of employers and employees.</P>
    <P>I believe most people will admit that, as regards even businesses which were badly hit by the petrol shortage and other emergency difficulties, every effort was made to keep staffs going, even at great sacrifice.  Many concerns tried to spread out the work or make other work to carry them over the period, and took on work which it was not normal to do at the time.  There were cases of contractors who, when building stopped, started people making concrete blocks and pipes and so on. There was a fine spirit between employer and employee for the past 18 months to meet situations like that.</P>
    <P>I think it cannot be inferred from the statement of the Minister that the order proposed is necessary, or that the country has reached a situation where demand after demand is being made for increased payment by everybody, and where the people are being forced into a situation which will result in inflation and with which no other method could cope.  I believe the people really do see their position as far as that is concerned.  The order will react badly on the minds of many. For the sake of argument, take the man earning £3 a week.  He finds that that income is being reduced week after week, and that he is left each Saturday night with a smaller sum for his needs &mdash;owing to the increase in prices. Those people would well resent the idea of having to cut their outlay simply because they are on a wage-earning basis, and they would be surprised that a person who is his own employer in business, or who is in a profession should have a chance of adjusting his output or his professional capacity to the circumstances which he himself controls, while the worker will be fixed by maximum wages and will not get an increase to meet the higher cost of living.  I hope the Minister will <Col N="271" /> explain his reasons for the order, as it has been very perturbing.</P>
    <P>The Minister certainly codded the country completely and gave them a very pleasant surprise&mdash;or at least they thought it was pleasant, unpleasant though it may have been in fact.  First of all, he might have borrowed for the whole lot this year, instead of increasing taxation at all, and secondly, he should at the earliest possible date make a clear statement to the country about the financial position as it may be at a future time if the blockade continues, and if there is a reduction in our imports, which will affect the revenue in the way we both think it will affect it.  The Minister would do a great day&rsquo;s work for the country by making the position clear, and would prepare the country properly for any further emergency.  These facts should be brought home to the people.</P>
    <P>There is always danger that while we sail along they may be a little careless. Most people are acting up to the situation, but all of us are rather careless about it.  We are quite satisfied so long as to-day is all right and we hope to-morrow will be the same, though we do very little to ensure that that will be so.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will start doing something to ensure that next year will be all right so that he will not have to come in next year and drop a bomb unexpectedly.  I am sorry to have to refer to that situation, but it is a very real one in an emergency period.  We should look further ahead than normal times and a normal Budget.  Is the Minister satisfied that the annual revenue is likely to be sufficient to carry us over?  He is facing a period now where he does not know what may happen about either revenue or expenditure.  I think he will do a great day&rsquo;s work if he makes a statement to the country that his figures this year are based on the assumption that things will remain as normal as they have been for the last 12 months, that if there is any worsening of our position, if there is any depreciation in our imports or anything of that nature, the situation will be far worse and that people must not assume that <Col N="272" /> because the last 12 months was all right the next 12 months will be all right.  I am quite sure if the Minister does that he will have eased the position for himself next year.  If he does not do it, and if he has to present a Budget for the same amount of expenditure next year, and if the revenue is down by £7,000,000 or £8,000,000, then he will be in a situation which he will not get out of very easily.</P>
    <P>I think in justice to the people of this country they should get the shock of being told what the position might be. If the situation does not remain normal&mdash;and we have absolutely no control over it&mdash;if the emergency continues and if the blockade, owing to the terrific belligerent situation on the ocean, continues, we can do nothing about it.  If it gets worse, the Minister will be in the unfortunate position of looking at dwindling revenue returns and will not be able to do anything about it; he has nowhere else from which to get revenue and, because of the reaction that would have on the economic life of the country, he would possibly have to go in for far greater expenditure than he normally would. The cutting down of imports of that nature would have such a serious effect on the normal life of this country that he might have to Budget for a situation, in regard to unemployment, that he otherwise would not have to meet.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister ought to warn the country seriously that nobody in this country can assume that the figures for expenditure or revenue in this Budget are anything but an optimistic estimate&mdash;and they are optimistic because they are based on the hope that the next 12 months will be as normal as the last 12 months&mdash; that the Minister is guaranteeing nothing to the people of this country and dare not guarantee any more to the people of this country than that, if things go all right, those are roughly the correct figures but, if things do not go all right, he cannot tell what is going to happen.  He would be most foolish to try to tell them what would happen, but he would be very wise if he warned them about what could happen.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to ask the Minister when the emergency order giving the list of employees whose wages are stabilised is to be introduced.  I suggest it would be a very bad precedent if we were to pass one portion of the Budget before another portion of it has been introduced.  I rather assumed from the Minister&rsquo;s remarks yesterday that we would have had the emergency orders this morning, and I am anxious to know when that particular one will be produced, and, in fact, I think it should be produced before these Resolutions are passed.</P>
      <P>The next thing I want to ask the Minister is about the corporation profits tax, Resolutions 23 and 24.  There has been some reference to the income-tax which was at 7/6 in the £, but it looks as if another 2/- had been put on what amounts to the income-tax of a big portion of the community, so that in a great many cases the income-tax will amount to 9/6.  The question I would like to ask the Minister about numbers 23 and 24 is how far these taxes are to be retrospective.  I rather gathered from the Minister&mdash;I do not know whether I took him up correctly yesterday&mdash;that it was only the excess portion of the corporation profits tax that would be retrospective.  What I mean is that the Minister has reduced the exemption of firms from £5,000 to £1,000.  I take it that a firm, say, who have paid corporation profits tax or ascertained their liability for 1940, would not be called upon to make a further contribution except under the provision in regard to excess profits. I would like the Minister to be very clear when replying, and to tell me how far the provisions of these two Resolutions are to be retrospective, because certainly, if the ordinary corporation profits tax, as set out in number 23, was to be made retrospective, I think most people would agree that retrospective taxation is very bad, and ought to be undertaken only under the direst necessity.</P>

      <P>The Minister, in his concluding remarks on the Budget statement, said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Though we are neutral, I think I may claim that, to some extent, this Budget is a war Budget.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="274" /> So far as this huge and oppressive burden of taxation, this culmination of Fianna Fáil financial policy, is concerned, I agree with the Minister that it is a war Budget.  It is a war on the pockets of the taxpayer, pockets that have already been drained by a policy of &ldquo;squander-mania&rdquo; for the past ten years.  I do not think that any Deputy will attempt to criticise the necessity of providing additional finances to meet the emergency through which the country is passing.  I think it is necessary to provide those finances.  I think the responsibility is on this country to provide, within our means, adequate defences.  I agree that a substantial amount of this increased burden of taxation is due to the cost of providing those defences.  I do not propose to criticise the expenditure of that huge sum of over £8,000,000 on the Army, but I do hope it is being spent to good purpose, that it is being spent in providing essential equipment for the Army and for the Defence forces.</P>
    <P>I think we all must agree that, having built up a very considerable force of young men in this country to defend our national territory and our national rights, we must make every possible effort to equip them to the best advantage.  What I do regret is that we have some men in the Local Defence Force who are still unarmed although they are in uniform.  To my mind, it is a crime against the individual to put a man into a uniform if you do not put a weapon in his hand to defend himself.</P>
    <P>In my effort to criticise the present financial position of this country, I am not inclined to direct my attention to criticism of the items for which we have to provide money in this present Budget, but to the whole financial policy of the State during the past few years.  I think a sound financial policy in any country would be that during the normal life of the country we should preserve and strengthen our financial resources and reserves, so that in a period of emergency we would be in a position to draw on those reserves, but the policy pursued in this country in recent years has been to tax the unfortunate taxpayer to the utmost capacity, to call on him to make ever-increasing <Col N="275" /> contributions to State services, with the result that our people are in a very weakened financial condition to bear the enormous demands made on them now.  When we consider that the present Government got into power ten years ago by promising the people that the burden of taxation which was then in force would be reduced&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;as the country was over-taxed by at least £2,000,000, the taxation for Supply Services at that time amounting to £24,000,000, and that during their period of office there has been a steady spiral of taxation, culminating in a figure of £36,000,000 for Supply Services in this year, with the total figure for taxation, including the Central Fund, amounting to £41,000,000, I think I am right in saying that what the people have to worry about is the policy pursued by the Government.  As I said before, I do not think anyone who is concerned with the finances of the country would worry about increased taxation during an emergency period.  That is inevitable. No Government could prevent that.  It is good government to provide extra financial resources for national services to tide the people through an emergency of this sort.  It is the policy which has been pursued by the Government during their term of office that has left the people in their present weakened position.  It is the stranglehold on the industries of this country, particularly on its main industry, that has prevented the expansion of production here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has admitted&mdash;it is the first time we have had such an admission from a Minister for Finance here in recent years&mdash;that this is an unbalanced Budget, unbalanced to the extent of, in round figures, £4,000,000, but unfortunately we have had experience of unbalanced Budgets for a number of years, all of which have contributed towards the ever-increasing national debt.  Notwithstanding all the new taxation imposed by the Minister, in my opinion the gap <Col N="276" /> to be bridged is more than £4,000,000. I think the Budget is rather cleverly presented, and that the estimated figure for revenue returns is an optimistic one.  I cannot understand how the Minister for Finance hopes to get a return of £8,270,000 from customs duties, when the yield from that source was £11,688,000 last year.  Up to a few months ago the supply position was fairly normal.  It is only within the last few months that the crash came in that respect.  It is only within recent months that we have been told by the Minister for Supplies that we can count on only very few ships reaching our shores in the months to come. Bearing that in mind, I suggest that that figure of £8,270,000 is an optimistic one.  If we have no imports, we cannot collect customs duties.  The tightening of the blockade, and the activities of German U-boats in the blockade zone are going to be still further felt by this little island, with the result that there will be a greater contraction in the revenue from customs duties than is anticipated by the Minister, so that the gap which has to be bridged will be greater than the estimated £4,000,000.  The Minister has given us some information with regard to the national debt.  It is alarming to find that the national debt of this country is now over £101,000,000, including the debt of the local authorities.  I presume that that is the gross national debt of the country.  He did not give us any information about the deadweight debt.  I believe it is approximately £70,000,000 to £75,000,000.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister gave us the figure of £101,000,000.  We have already been warned by a commission set up by the Government of the danger of permitting that national debt to grow to immense proportions, imposing very severe annual burdens on our people.  Evidently, the Government does not heed the warning from that commission, and still pursues its policy of extravagant spending.  It is usual for the Minister, in introducing the Budget, to review the economic position of the country, but on this <Col N="277" /> occasion, while he did make a passing reference to it, he did not deal with it in detail.  He did say that without a sound agricultural economy no amount of juggling with the financial machinery or bits of paper will avail, or no national well-being can be assured.  I agree with him absolutely, and I am sure that every other Deputy will also agree with him.</P>
      <P>The peculiar thing about our agricultural economy for many years is that there has been no improvement. Our agricultural position has remained unchanged over a long period of years. In fact, there has been a contraction of the profits arising out of agricultural activity.  That is an alarming state of affairs.  It is an amazing situation to find that countries in competition with this country in the market right beside us have, during recent years, effected an enormous expansion in their agricultural output, and, notwithstanding the efforts made by our Government to expand agricultural production, no progress has been made.  Possibly various phases of political activity in this country have helped to retard or put a brake on agricultural production.  The economic war, undoubtedly, had a very serious retarding effect, and now we are experiencing all the difficulties attending the present international conflict.  We are well within the war zone, but we have none of the economic advantages that flow from increased spending in a country involved in war.  Then we have the fact that the agricultural community have, unfortunately, in this difficult year, experienced the scourge of foot-and-mouth disease.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we come to examine the capacity of the country people to meet increased burdens of taxation, including local rates, we find that they are in a very weakened financial condition. We are passing through the period that normally brings to the farmer a decent return for the store cattle that he had cared and fed during the winter months.  He hoped to net a reasonable profit on them.  Many of our people are to-day in the unfortunate position that they cannot sell their live stock. There is also the consideration that prices would have been far better if we <Col N="278" /> had not had the dreadful scourge of foot-and-mouth disease.</P>
    <P>We have missed the market; we are too late, and the price we will get for fat cattle, or that we are likely to get when we start to export good forward stores, will not be nearly as good as if we had a free market during the last two or three months.  I have no doubt that if the normal export trade had operated within recent months the price of good forward stores would be in the neighbourhood of 60/- to 65/- a cwt.  Stores are changing hands in the free areas at 50/- a cwt. and that means that the farmer is dropping about 10/- or 12/- a cwt. on good stores.  Most of those cattle were purchased at a fairly stiff price last October and November and, after the winter feeding, they are realising very little, if anything at all, over their cost.  I do not blame the Minister for Finance, but his colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, is to some extent responsible, because he did not make a determined fight against the disease in its earlier stages.</P>

      <P>That subject was dealt with at length on the Estimate for the Department of Agriculture, on which the discussion has not concluded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am merely saying that &mdash;I am not going to go any further on that subject.  We are in the position that many of our industries are on the point of closing down for want of raw materials.  We set up a Department of Supplies in 1938 to deal with the supply position.  It has proved to be a fairly costly Department.  We were assured that we would accumulate the necessary raw materials here.  Judging by recent returns, no supplies were accumulated and we find many of our industries practically at the end of their tether through lack of raw materials.  In that situation we find the Minister proposing a tax on excess profits.  I agree that where excess profits occur the principle is sound and it is wise to collect the tax, but, having read the Minister&rsquo;s statement, there are certain aspects that are not quite clear to me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot understand how some industries that were started in 1935 and <Col N="279" /> 1936 are going to be dealt with, and, perhaps, the Minister will give us more details in that connection.  According to his statement, the two best of the three years ending in April, 1939, are going to be taken as a basis for determining what is a fair profit and the money over and above that will be regarded as excess profits upon which the special duty proposed will be payable. Some industries started immediately prior to that and they may not be in a position to show any profit. The Minister says that special consideration will be given to industries that show a loss.  What about the industry that will show a very light profit in those basic years?  Let us assume there are two industries, A and B, with the same capital, A showing a profit of £200 over those two years and B a profit of £5,000.  That is quite possible. Am I to take it that anything over and above the £200 in the case of A is going to be regarded as excess profit&mdash; and the earnings of that company may have gone up considerably in the meantime? Suppose that B has a steady profit of £5,000 over the period and shows no increase, does it mean that that company will not be charged on any excess profits?  I would like the Minister to clear up that matter because I know that some of the small industries in the country are rather worried about the position.  I know of the case of one or two men, to whom I was speaking to-day, who started an industry in or about the years 1934 or 1935, and whose business, in the first few years, showed a very poor or very little profit, but whose business has improved in the meantime.  If those years, during which they were making little or no profit, are to be taken as a basis, they will be very badly hit. However, I admit that I do not fully understand what the Minister proposes to do, and I am sure that we shall get more information on the subject when he is replying.</P>
    <P>On the question of the tax on petrol, I think that this is rather a stiff increase in the amount, especially when one considers that there has been a very substantial reduction in the <Col N="280" /> amount of our imports of petrol.  I understand that we are promised about 20,000,000 gallons for the present year, and I think that our consumption, last year, of petrol amounted to about 33,500,000 gallons.  I think we may take it, accordingly, that very little petrol is being used for pleasure.  I heard the Minister saying that some was being used for pleasure, but I think that the amount used for that purpose would be very small&mdash;a negligible quantity.  For that reason, I think that an increase of 50 per cent. in the duty is such an increase as could hardly be justified because it has imposed such a tax on a great many people who have to make their living out of petrol, such as hackney people, garage men, and licensed hauliers, that, owing to the shortage of petrol, they will have to charge more than the normal rates, in order to make their living, than they charged before there was the scarcity of petrol.  Now, in addition to that, they find themselves in the position of being called on to pay an increased tax of 50 per cent., or 5d. per gallon.  I think that that is the worst impost under this Budget.</P>
    <P>The Minister&rsquo;s Parliamentary Secretary referred to turf, and told us that a great many of our people did not seem to realise the position which we are facing in this country.  I agree with the Parliamentary Secretary, and I think that many of our people do not realise the position we are facing here in this country, particularly in regard to fuel.  Bad and all as the position may yet be for want of certain essential supplies, such as tea, it will be disastrous if our people find that, even if we can provide other substitutes for tea, such as the Minister proposes in the way of bread, butter and milk, for the necessitous poor, they have no fuel in the coming winter.  I agree with the Parliamentary Secretary that it is essential that our best efforts should be put into the production of fuel at the present time, but I do not agree that the methods the Government have for producing fuel for next winter are the best methods that could be adopted.  It simply means passing on the responsibility, or &ldquo;passing on the baby&rdquo;, to other people&mdash;to the local <Col N="281" /> authorities, generally.  I do not think that the local authorities are the best people to deal with that matter. Already many of the local authorities are in a very difficult financial position. They already have heavy bank overdrafts owing to the fact that the local ratepayers are not in a position to meet their rates at the present time.  I think that the Government&mdash;particularly in the case of the bigger cities and towns &mdash;should have gone out on a direct scheme themselves for producing fuel for the coming winter.  I know that in the County Kildare, in areas close to the city here, very little effort is being made by the Government to produce, from the bogs there, turf that will be essential for the City of Dublin next winter.</P>
    <P>While I agree with the Parliamentary Secretary that it is necessary to put our best efforts into this work, and to produce all the turf that can be produced now, while the weather is good, much more will have to be done by the Government and by the Parliamentary Secretary himself in that respect. After all, many of the local authorities are not in a position to produce turf in great quantities, and a great many of them do not fully realise the magnitude of the work, the amount of labour that is involved, the huge question of transport, or the question of development, drainage and road transport in connection with these bogs. Accordingly, I do not think they are putting their best efforts into it.</P>
    <P>I am glad that the Parliamentary Secretary referred to this matter, but I would say that a direct effort by the Government, through his Department, will have to be made, and that it should be a very big effort, if any attempt at all is to be made to solve this problem of the provision of fuel.  I think the Parliamentary Secretary gave the figure of about 2,000,000 tons as our normal imports of coal, and if we have to substitute turf for that amount of imported coal, I agree that that is a very big problem, and that it is one that must be faced immediately.  I confess that I am rather alarmed about the position because I do not think our best efforts are being put into the job at all.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>In the concluding paragraph of the Minister&rsquo;s Budget statement he said: &ldquo;Neutrality may not be a heroic rôle, especially for Ireland.&rdquo; My heart went out to him when he said that, because, really, when I look around this country sometimes, and listen to people waxing eloquent about the glorious destiny of Ireland to maintain our neutrality, it is refreshing to hear at least one honest man speaking from the heart and saying that although it may not be glorious to consecrate this nation to the task of saving our hides, at least it is safe, albeit expensive.  If we are going to devote, to consecrate, the destiny of Ireland to the task of saving our hides in this generation, let us at least be honest about it.  It is not heroic, and it is damned expensive.  So, perhaps for the first time in our respective political careers, I find myself in agreement with the Minister for Finance when he says that neutrality is not a heroic rôle for Ireland, especially for Ireland, but it is damned expensive.</P>
      <P>I do not think that in the circumstances in which we find ourselves, any reasonable person can complain of substantial taxation.  I do not think it will serve any very useful purpose to go back over the history of the last ten years and to deplore the dissipation of our savings during those ten years&mdash; savings that could have been very usefully used at the present time.</P>
      <P>That milk is spilt and we cannot collect it, but I do not altogether agree with some Deputies in this House in the view that we can continue to pile taxation on our neighbours in the scared cause of neutrality without undertaking a share of the burden in some measure ourselves.  I think there is a great deal to be said for making the Parliamentary allowance subject to income-tax.  Every time we add a shilling to income-tax we raise our own Parliamentary allowance by £60 or £70 per annum, and while shedding tears of sympathy for the taxpayer of this country who is called upon to bear this extra heavy burden, we add to our personal revenues an additional substantial sum by the financial resolution imposing that tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="283" /> There is such a thing as positive injustice. There is also such a thing as the morale of the people, and I think it is common knowledge that it is much easier to suffer if we are all suffering together than it is to bear the same suffering in the midst of universal prosperity.  If the people believe that we are suffering together the same imposts and the same difficulties, I think it is much easier for them to shoulder the burden we are calling on them to shoulder.  Although income-tax on our Parliamentary allowances might not result in any substantial contribution to the Exchequer, I think it is a legitimate grievance to those who have to pay the extra tax in the country when they see us completely free of the impact of the taxation for which we ourselves are responsible.  I believe the morale of the people would be improved if we undertook to shoulder our share of that burden.  I venture to say that if the Minister for Finance introduced a resolution to that effect, very few Deputies would vote against it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Linehan spoke of the tendency the country naturally shows, and that indeed all of us show, to close its eyes to the dangers that may lie ahead.  I agree with him, but I should like somebody to tell me&mdash;and I challenge the Minister for Finance to deal with this matter in his concluding observations&mdash;can anybody make any intelligent forecast of what the condition of the world will be or what the value of money will be at the conclusion of the war?  I have discussed the matter with economists, with people who professed to be experts in this matter, but I cannot find any person who will give me any intelligent forecast of what the value of money will be, or what sort of economic picture this or any other country of the world will have to face, at the end of the war. I pride myself on being a conservative financier.  I believe with Mr. Micawber that if your income is £1 and your expenditure 19/11¾, you are happy and in a sound position, but that if your income is £1 and your expenditure £1 1s., you are confronted with immediate disaster.  But then Mr. Micawber <Col N="284" /> did not live in a day when the British Government were spending £12,000,000 per day on armaments.  Mr. Micawber did not live in a day when the Nazis were robbing and plundering everybody upon whom they could lay their hands.  Mr. Micawber never saw the day when the Nazis, having invaded Norway, purchased the entire output of the Norwegian canning industry with Norwegian notes, printed in Nazi printing presses.</P>
    <P>I do not know what effect that kind of operation is going to have on what we used to term orthodox finance after the war but, for the first time, I find myself inclining to the view that it would be better to raise all the money we can, wherever we can raise it, and buy something that neither the Nazis nor anybody else can make away with. If we can build a good concrete road, though Adolf Hitler &ldquo;bust&rdquo; his boiler, he cannot bring that away.  If we drain land, Goering may get apoplexy but he cannot undo the digging of the drains.  They will be there and the land will be worth much more than it is.  Unless they exterminate us at the end of the war&mdash;and I do not believe they will get the chance; I think they will be exterminated themselves first&mdash; or if they should attempt it, we shall have these things.  If we try to save money, on the other hand, we may find ourselves at the end of the war with large credits on foreign countries which these countries will not pay us but will write off.  I remember at the end of the last war, certain friends of mine in Germany who for safety sake had deposited their money in what they believed to be an eminently safe bank there, went down one morning to draw their money and were informed that the bank clerk had drawn his pencil through their deposit of £12,000.  They were told that it had shrunk so much as the result of inflation that it was then impossible to find any coin to represent it.  Are we going to find a similar situation widespread after the war or are we not? Here are we, 130 odd men and women, solemnly sitting in this deliberative Assembly planning for the next 12 months and the post-war period, and, as far as I can find out, not a single <Col N="285" /> one amongst us has any intelligent anticipation of what the situation is going to be.  I take the view&mdash;though I am open to correction and open to persuasion that I am mistaken because it is a view quite new to me&mdash;that we ought to put our minds to acquiring any tangible assets we can get our hands on for the benefit of our people and, if necessary, pledge our credit to that end.</P>
    <P>That makes me think at once of the railways and the Transport Tribunal&rsquo;s Report.  We committed to a special tribunal the task of examining our entire transport problems and they gave us two reports&mdash;a majority and a minority report, neither of which any of us has seen.  I understand that one of the reports recommends that for the railway system there should be substituted a comprehensive system of motor roads.  We have the material and we have the labour wherewith to construct them.  I have the feeling that we might be very well advised to start now.  So long as our heroic rôle of neutrality is maintained we can get on with the roads, and if we have even half of them built before Adolf Hitler comes to disturb our neutrality, we can take precautions to ensure that we shall get on the road first and keep Adolf off.</P>
    <P>That may have certain strategic value in the defence of our country, but post-war we will have a comprehensive system of roads to carry on whatever kind of traffic, commerce, trade, or business, that may remain to us.  In the meantime, we would have put a very large number of the most difficult type of men to employ into employment, and we could use almost exclusively products that we produce from raw materials available in this country, that is, cement.  That seems to be well worthy of consideration.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance, who is present, has been concerning himself for a very considerable time with the report on the general drainage situation.  There was a lot of &ldquo;codology&rdquo; talked about drainage.  Everyone who wants to solve unemployment proposes to put the whole unemployed population working <Col N="286" /> on drains.  That is all nonsense.  It is true that anything approximating to arterial drainage has been virtually suspended since the commission started.  It must have recommended something.  If any of the recommendations are worthy of consideration, they should be put in hand now.  Unless the Nazis use shovels and spades on them, we will have drainage whatever way the cat jumps.  I think the Government have at last adopted a proposal I made five years ago, to facilitate individual farmers in the making of flag drains on their own land.  That is an admirable scheme.  I believe that one of the most effective ways to stimulate it is to carry out the drainage of the whole country, as far as that is practicable, and not necessarily economic in the old sense of the term, so that when they are tempted to go in for flag drains on their own land, they will be persuaded to do it by the knowledge that it is the only possible way to get water carried off. At present I do not attempt to drain certain parts of my land, because when I made drains the water did not run to the river.  Naturally, I am not inclined to employ men to make such drains, but if the river, which drains the valley in which my land is situate, were improved, a great deal of work could be put in hand.  That goes for every farm along the valley of that river, and for hundreds of other rivers.</P>
    <P>I want to draw a comparison from that subject and to emphasise that drainage work should now be undertaken from the point of view of what is practicable.  I remember going to the Board of Works department about a drainage scheme which I thought would confer very considerable benefit on a large area, but before I left, the experts there assured me that if more than 99 per cent. of an improvement were made by the Exchequer, the 1 per cent. which would be repayable on the land improvement would render all the land in question uneconomic.  I thought the experts were talking through their hats, even though they were very civil. That was the frame of mind that obtained in that department at the time, and that obtains yet with regard to drainage.  I put it to the Parliamentary Secretary that the time has now come when the economic aspect of the question <Col N="287" /> should be regarded as a very minor one, and that the principle should be the practicability of a drainage proposal.</P>
    <P>I want to say deliberately&mdash;and it requires to be said&mdash;that if the world crisis through which we are passing has not resolved itself, or does not show immediate signs of resolving itself before next autumn, the Book of Estimates will have to be completely recast, and from it excised many services to which this State has grown accustomed and regards as indispensable. It may be impossible for us to raise money at that stage to carry on at all.  In any case, if the crisis does not resolve itself next autumn we may reasonably look forward to its continuation for two or three years.  While it may be good policy now to realise such assets as we can and convert them into permanent tangible assets at home, we have to look forward to the revenue problem over the next three or four years, in order to prevent any citizen becoming destitute or hungry. We may have so to recast our entire public services, in order to make it possible to carry them on, and next autumn the position will have to be reviewed or we will have to assume the worst.</P>
    <P>I believe the task that will then lie ahead will be one that no Party Government in this State will be in a position to deal with or to carry through.  That is something that this country ought to be thinking of between now and next autumn.  Certain States in Europe openly declared that they preferred guns to butter.  That is a choice this country has never made so far, but circumstances may impose that obligation upon us in the time to come.  It will not be guns we will have to choose.  Butter we will have to go without&mdash;butter in the figurative sense of the word&mdash;and luxuries of every conceivable kind, and, in my opinion, our people will regard that as so revolutionary a departure that it will be quite impossible for us, unless there is unity of effort, to lead the people down into that valley of destitution and difficulty, and through it up on to the other <Col N="288" /> side.  If it ever becomes incumbent on us to meet that situation the time for controversy is past and there will have to be a pooling of the best brains, and of all the good will we can command. Otherwise, in the collapse which may ensue we may find too many neighbours anxious to come in and take over our affairs and get us through the difficulty that we had demonstrated ourselves incapable of negotiating alone.</P>
    <P>I am not worried about the excess profits tax.  I think it is the usual incompetent Fianna Fáil kind of thing. I did not expect anything from Fianna Fáil but flabbiness and incompetence. People in this country are very unreasonable.  I hear them howling about the incompetence of the Minister for Supplies, the folly of the Minister for Finance and the political stupidity of the Taoiseach, as if that were something new.  What did they expect to happen?  Did they expect a metamorphosis overnight&mdash;that men who led the country from one disaster to another would suddenly spread their wings and acquire haloes and the wisdom of Solomon?  They are acting precisely as Fianna Fáil would act. They are floundering from one error to another.  Some of us were able to prop them up and cover their mistakes so as to carry on until they got on their feet again.</P>
    <P>It has to be remembered that they have a clear political majority which was secured at the freest election ever held in this country.  They secured that majority from the Irish people and, so long as the people inflict them upon the country, it is the duty of every public-spirited man to help them as best he can, because the country belongs to all.  No matter what follies our neighbours may be responsible for, and no matter what Government they may inflict upon us we have to do our best for the country.  Unfortunately that is what we have on the bridge.  The best thing we can do for ourselves is to get to the emergency tiller and try to steer the ship as best we can away from the rocks towards which these gentlemen led it.</P>
    <P>As to the excess profits tax it was not imposed until the profits were made.  Of course, all the gentlemen <Col N="289" /> who have been plundering their neighbours are the Minister for Supplies&rsquo; own children.  He created them.  The Minister for Finance and the whole crew have habitually defended the principle of sky-high tariffs.  That was a standing invitation to every cut-throat robber from all over Europe to come here and suck the blood of our people, as has been done for the last ten years. It makes me laugh to hear about the &ldquo;boys&rdquo; getting indignant about excess profits being made in the last 12 months.  What about the excess profits that were made for the last ten years?  What about the flour millers? What about the bacon curers?  But there is one consoling element in all this.  I do not like taxation which is bad in its fall, but I do extract a certain satisfaction from this particular incompetence.  It is a grand precedent. I look forward with satisfaction to the day when this precedent can be quoted to go back on the flour millers&rsquo; accounts, not for 12 months, but for 12 years; to go back on the bacon curers&rsquo; profits, not for 12 months, but for 12 years; to go back on the Roscrea dead cow factory, or &ldquo;ould&rdquo; cow factory, not for 12 months, but for five years.  Then we shall see excess profits, and these gentlemen can have full and fair notice that their excess profits will be as rigorously dealt with as those of the guiltless gentlemen referred to in the Budget statement.  Some day we will get after them.  It may be for years, but it will not be for ever.  They had full and fair notice of that when they were making their plunder, and, by the mercy of God, out of this world conflagration one blessing has come: there is no desert island left where they can bury it.</P>
    <P>I wonder, when the excess profits Resolution is being implemented, what is going to be done about the &ldquo;boys&rdquo; who watered their capital.  I know an enterprising little mill in this country. It is a modest little mill&mdash;a flour mill, I need scarcely tell you&mdash;a private company, the capital of which was £20,000.  It went into court in a winding-up symptom, and the judge ordered them to reduce the capital to £18,000, because that was what their assets were worth.  The &ldquo;boys&rdquo; were not one <Col N="290" /> bit abashed; they said: &ldquo;As your Lordship pleases,&rdquo; and the capital was accordingly amended.  Then the country chose these captains for the bridge, the Fianna Fáil Government came in and the industrial revival began.  The &ldquo;boys&rdquo; got their heads together and determined to open a new mill.  This was one of the new factories and there was great rejoicing.  I am not sure whether one of the Ministers did not get a golden key for going down and opening it, but when the new mill was opened the capital was not £18,000 but £150,000, and, since it opened, the &ldquo;boys&rdquo; collected 10 per cent. profit every year on £150,000, with ample appropriations for depreciation and contingency reserves and now, like lambs, they are not going to make any more than 6 per cent. and they are not going to be made to pay any excess profits.  I wonder will the Minister for Finance take note of the fact that 6 per cent. profit on £150,000 is 50 per cent. profit on £18,000, which was the value which the judge and the court set upon this mill?  Some poor &ldquo;gom&rdquo; down the country, who always capitalised his company at the full capital value and put his own money into it in order to present an honest balance sheet, will be charged excess profits tax if he makes 8 or 10 per cent. profit, but the tulips in the mill can make up to 50 per cent.&mdash;and they are innocent poor lambs whom nobody must shear.  I invite the Minister for Finance to brood on that, and, if he asks some of his colleagues to identify the mill, I do not think they will have any serious difficulty.</P>
    <P>I suppose that at the present time old controversies may be well left aside, but, seeing that I have gathered together seven members of the Fianna Fáil Party, I should like to invite them to spend the rest of this evening asking themselves whether self-sufficiency is as nice a thing as they used to think it was, because they are beginning to experience it, but only just beginning. Thanks to Adolf Hitler, our old friend, they are going to learn a lot more about it before this war is over, because the Chancellor of the German Reich has announced that he will sink every ship bringing goods to Ireland his fleet can reach and he has fixed us <Col N="291" /> with full and fair notice of that fact. The Minister for the Co-ordination of Defensive Measures said that if he sinks them all, we shall be so much better off.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;If there were no ships sailing the seven seas,&rdquo;</P>
    <P>says that Minister,</P>
    <P>&ldquo;we could be much better off than we were with all the ships coming in.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now we are having it, how do they like it?  I notice a uniform gloom on the faces of the seven representatives of the Fianna Fáil Party.  They do not seem to like it at all.  They have been, like the chubby child in the Pears&rsquo; soap advertisement, for the last seven years, protesting loudly from the house tops that they would not be happy till they got it, and, now they have it, they do not like the taste of it.  We have been warning them for ten years that soap was not something to be eaten.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I see that the Minister, very properly, has recognised that something had to be done with regard to the food situation, if individual citizens of this State were not to learn hunger as a result of the crisis through which we are passing.  Let me say at once that I am perfectly satisfied that the Minister for Finance is just as solicitous for the poor of this country as I am, and I think the attempt to meet their special difficulties, resulting from the rise in the cost of living at present, is meritorious, but I have adumbrated a certain matter on more than one occasion here, and I deliberately put it in issue now.  We are passing a Finance Bill now and we have stipulated in that Bill that the rate of income-tax shall be 7/6 in the pound.  A man who has £1,000 a year is entitled to deduct from his taxable income £100 in respect of his wife and £60 in respect of each of his children.  I am thinking now of the farm labourer&mdash;never mind the unemployed <Col N="292" /> man&mdash;who has a wife and five children and whose wages are 33/-, and compare him with the man who has an income of £1,000 a year and who has a wife and five children.  The farm labourer is told to get on on his 33/- as best he may, and to be glad he has a job.  The man with the £1,000 a year is entitled to deduct from his income, for purposes of income-tax, £400 in respect of his wife and five children, and that means that he is excused taxation at the rate of 7/6 in the pound on £400, which means that this State gives him £150 a year because he has a wife and five children.  Now, do I over-state the case?  Is that unfair?  His liability under the law is to a certain level of taxation.  We collect that from him, but, because he has a wife and five children, we refund it and tell him that he need not pay.  We give him a family allowance of £3 per week.  To the man whose entire income is 33/- we give nothing at all.  What sense of justice is there in that?  If it is just to make a substantial grant-in-aid to the man who is earning £1,000 a year in respect of his wife and children, how is it unjust to ask for a similar grant-in-aid for a man earning 33/- per week who has the same family responsibilities?</P>
    <P>I put it to the House that, instead of fiddling about with food tickets and elaborate administrative arrangements designed to protect citizens of the community from literal starvation, it would be much better for us to make up our minds to this proposition&mdash;that if a man raises a family in this country, he will not be made to suffer.  At present if a man is an agricultural labourer and has two or three children, every subsequent child born into that household is a menace to that family&rsquo;s existence.  Every additional mouth born into that home means that the children already in it are going to learn the meaning of malnutrition and semi-starvation. I do not believe that a single Deputy here desires that that state of affairs should continue, but they will be inclined to say that the expense of remedying that apparent injustice is out of the range of possibility. Surely, if we can find money to give a family allowance of £3 a week <Col N="293" /> to a man with £1,000 a year, we can find money to pay a family allowance on a much more modest scale to a man with 33/- a week.</P>
    <P>Nor is there anything revolutionary in this proposal.  It is not as if it were something that nobody had attempted to do before.  It has been in operation for the past 20 years in Australia and in New Zealand.  It has been in operation for years in France, and in a considerable number of other countries. I can assure Deputies&mdash;those of them who have visited Australia or New Zealand will confirm what I say&mdash; that if you suggested they should abolish the system of family allowances in these countries your proposal would be received with the same amazement as a suggestion to abolish voluntary hospitals would be received in this country.  The people there would say: &ldquo;What are they to do if their children are hungry?&rdquo; When you say that a man has 33/- a week in Ireland, that his children are sometimes hungry and there is nothing you can do, they simply do not believe you.</P>
    <P>I never believe in raising difficulties if I am not prepared to propose remedies. One of the great difficulties about family allowances in this country would be to determine what should be done with the farmer living on a small acreage.  In many cases, you would discover, on close investigation, that his income was less than that of the agricultural labourer drawing wages.  In some years, reversals and losses would completely wipe out the small farmer&rsquo;s income.  In other years, if he had a poor crop or met with some untoward happening, he might have, over the 12 months, no more than 30/- a week.  In other years he might have an income of £2 or £2 10s., according to the size of the farm.  You cannot by legislation provide for every conceivable contingency.  The feeling I have is that we ought to say that the man with a valuation of £20 will be deemed, for the purpose of the Act, to have an income of £2 per week.  Then, we ought to say that our aim is to ensure that the man with, say, £2 per week&mdash; these figures are purely tentative&mdash;will receive no family allowance and pay <Col N="294" /> no tax.  A man with £3 per week will pay income-tax, as at present.  A man with 35/- per week will receive a family allowance at the first level.  A man with 30/- per week will receive a larger family allowance.  A man on the dole will receive the largest family allowance.</P>
    <P>In that way, you would have a graduated system whereby the married man of lowest income&mdash;the man on the dole&mdash;would receive the maximum family allowance.  The man receiving the agricultural wage would receive the second-highest family allowance. A man receiving something between the agricultural wage and £2 per week would receive the third-class of family allowance.  The man with £2 per week would get nothing and the man with from that sum to £3 per week would neither pay tax nor receive any allowance. At £3 per week, he would pay his tax like anybody else.  I need hardly say that the figures I am quoting are of the most tentative description and would have to be carefully reconsidered and, quite possibly, recast when this problem has been investigated with scientific accuracy.  I have not got the machinery to carry out that inquiry but the Government have.  In the statistical branch of the Department of Industry and Commerce and in the statistical branch of the Department of Local Government and Public Health there is all the material necessary to carry out the investigation requisite to determine the levels on which the allowance should be based and it would be quite legitimate to consider whether the first child of a family should not be excluded from the allowance.  There are some countries in which the allowance is so formulated that a man, wife and first child receive nothing, but an allowance is payable in respect of the second and subsequent children.  If that system operated in this country, outdoor relief, dole, means test, and this card system for food would become unnecessary because we would ensure that there would be money going into any house in which there was want to ensure that wife and children would get a sufficiency of nourishment to maintain a reasonable standard of health.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the answer and I cannot see any escape from it.  I do not think that any reasonable man, facing that fact, can see any escape.  I do not know that this might not be as good a time as any to make an attempt, at least, at this scheme.  I make this concrete suggestion.  I am not trying to rush the House into anything blindfold.  I fully recognise the complexity of the problem I am putting before the House but I have no doubt about the possibility of resolving it.  However, an ounce of experiment is often worth a ton of theory.  I say to the Government: &ldquo;Why not implement now the family allowance in respect of the unemployed?&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Why not let us do away with the means test altogether?  I do not know that the Labour Party will nod their heads so vigorously when I am finished, because I would confine the unemployment allowance at a level sufficient to keep a single man from destitution. Over and above that, for every unemployed man who is married I would give to his wife a family allowance for herself and the children.  If that were done, I think it would have two very good effects: (1) It would establish the principle of the family allowance, which is a sound Christian principle in my judgment; (2) it would remove that quality in the unemployment problem which is the food of the unscrupulous agitator in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nobody will ever start a revolution in this country because able-bodied lumps of fellows are unemployed, when in fact they could join the Army or the Construction Corps.  I am talking now of able-bodied single lumps of fellows who have no family responsibilities. Nobody is going to lose a <Col N="296" /> night&rsquo;s sleep over a strong fellow of 23 or 24 years of age who has no family dependents and who is unemployed; he will make it out one way or the other.  I would not like to see him hungry in the street, of course.  To be frank, I would not provide any dole for him at all; I would tell him to look for work or join the Construction Corps or the Army.  I do not think that a young, health, strong fellow needs the dole.  I think one of the greatest curses that came to this country was the payment of unemployment assistance to unmarried young fellows in rural Ireland.  Any persons who want to go round and dance the &ldquo;can-can&rdquo; and bring that up against me in County Monaghan can do so; I invite them to do so.  The greatest curse that ever came to this country was the dole for the unmarried man in rural Ireland.  I never worry unduly about their position, because they will be able to make it out.  The man whom we must worry about is the man who has undertaken family responsibilities when he had an income and suddenly finds himself on the scrap-heap of unemployment.  We are constrained to sympathise with that individual&rsquo;s own mental and physical suffering, but we are also bound to bear in mind that the suffering of his wife and children is an additional burden on him in addition to that grief and distress.  The family allowance would remedy the worst part of that problem.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the House that it might be a very good thing at this time experimentally to operate the family allowance in respect of the unemployed. I believe that if we once got it working we would never let go of it, because we would have discovered one of the most effective keys to the solution of the general sense of guilt that we all feel about those men who are willing to work but cannot find work to-day and whose families are in a state of destitution, not through any fault of their own, but because the man simply cannot find a job at which to earn a living.</P>
    <P>It is bad enough for an energetic, industrious fellow to find that he cannot get work; it is bad enough to force him to experience the tedium of hanging <Col N="297" /> round a labour exchange or reading the columns of a newspaper looking for a job; but it is absolutely intolerable that we should sanction the additional burden of his going home at night to look at his wife and children half hungry.  I believe there is no Deputy who would not agree that we ought to go into the household of that man and say: &ldquo;Whatever else you have to go through, when you come home at night you will find your wife and children fed; let that worry be off your mind; if you have spent a long day looking for work, at least you have the assurance that there will be a coal fire on the hearth and a cheerful face before you.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is unnecessary to make dramatic appeals describing the hardships of the unemployed to Deputies, because they know and sympathise with their circumstances as much as I do.  It is no harm, however, to call these circumstances to mind from time to time with a view to remedying them so far as we can.  The Minister and the Government showed that they are conscious of the gravity of that problem at present by introducing this card system for food. I avail of this opportunity then of recommending the family allowance instead, with a view ultimately to spreading it as a permanent feature of our social life through every stratum of our society.</P>
    <P>Before I pass from the card system, I want to put this point to the Minister. I see what he is at, of course. He is trying to canalise this added assistance into certain restricted channels of nutrition primarily produced at home for the family.  I can sympathise with that objective, because I think it is a sound objective.  But I do not think he is going the right way about it for several reasons.  In the first place, I do not think it is a good thing when a man is suffering under the adversity of unemployment&mdash;and there are a lot of young men experiencing unemployment for the first time in this period of crisis&mdash;to require him to go down to the grocer and identify himself as a recipient of charity.  By producing the card, he identifies himself as a recipient of charity not only to the tradesman with whom he has <Col N="298" /> been dealing before, but to such of his neighbours as may be in the shop at the same time.  I do not think that that is a desirable additional hardship to inflict on a person in tribulation at the present time.</P>
    <P>Now, in addition to that, the system is open to fraud, because the old hard &ldquo;chaws&rdquo;, who do not give a fiddle-dee-dee about cashing the card, will very often cash the card for tobacco or some other commodity they want, with this peculiarly objectionable feature in the transaction: Suppose they have a card for 1/7 worth of butter.  They will go in with that card and say: &ldquo;Will you give tobacco for that?&rdquo; The shopkeeper will say: &ldquo;Yes, I will give you 1/4 worth,&rdquo; and they will get 1/4 worth of tobacco for the card which is worth 1/7.  The shopkeeper will collect the threepence difference as a kind of poundage for having accepted the card illegally for a commodity for which it was never intended.</P>
    <P>Why do we not go the other way about it?  Suppose we want to orientate consumption along certain lines. Why not do what was done in Great Britain, namely, subsidise these particular commodities?  I think it is a pretty widespread experience that if you give free milk to groups of families &mdash;people who normally buy a pint of milk and who the medical officer thinks ought to have three pints of milk&mdash;in 50 per cent. of cases the children will get the extra milk; but in the other 50 per cent. of cases you will find that where you mean three pints of milk to go to the house, in fact what will happen is that only two pints will go there.  The woman will give up buying the pint that she used to buy and will spend the money so saved on some other commodity she wants.  In some households it will be a commodity primarily designed for the improvement of her children&rsquo;s diet; in other houses it will be perhaps cigarettes or some frippery which she ought not to purchase at all.  In that way there is indirect employment of the money for a purpose for which it was never intended.</P>
    <P>Suppose you approach this problem from another angle and say: &ldquo;We will not positively attempt to orientate the <Col N="299" /> expenditure into a particular channel, but will ensure that every family will have enough money, if expended prudently, to secure them the necessaries of life and we will do that (1) by giving them the money in the form of a family allowance, and (2) by subsidising those essential elements of their diet which we can produce here at home and, which, if we make them sufficiently cheap, will compare so favourably in value with alternative items of diet that 90 per cent. of housewives who are living close to the borderline will buy them.  In England they are subsidising flour, coal, electricity and gas because they have large industrial populations there depending on gas and electricity for cooking.  I suggest that in this country we should quite deliberately subsidise potatoes, milk, oatmeal, coal and sugar in the urban centres, and make no bones about it. I think it might be possible to do that through the ordinary channels of trade at present existing, but, if it is not, let us do it through new ones: let us set up a milk depôt in Dublin and bring milk here from whatever quarter we have to bring it, pasteurise it and sell it to the people at 1d. per pint.  Let us bring in potatoes.  If they can be sold through the ordinary channels of trade at a low price, the subsidy will reach the consumer.  Let us bring in oatmeal, coal and sugar and offer them at subsidised prices.  The effect of that would be that 90 per cent. of any family allowances provided for destitute people will be spent on potatoes, milk, oatmeal, coal and sugar.  Is not that what we want?  We have done as much as we can do in the circumstances, but the difficulty will be to resolve the problem of destitution that will confront us next autumn.</P>
    <P>I think that the Minister for Finance may legitimately reply to me: &ldquo;All that is lovely, but where are you going to get the money to do it?&rdquo; I said early on that, if this crisis is not over by the autumn, we have got to make up our minds that it will go on for a long time.  If that is so, the Book of Estimates has got to be recast.  We have got to strike out of it services that <Col N="300" /> we have grown accustomed to regard as indispensable in this State.  We have got to appropriate the revenue we can raise to the primary task of feeding the people, whatever that may involve.  I think it may involve adjustments so grave that no Party Government in this country will be able to carry it through.  I said before that I thought it might be necessary for us all in this House to combine and pool the best brains we have in courage, endurance, and in qualities of leadership, whatever they may be, in order to bring our people through the difficulties that may confront us.  Whatever the situation may demand, we should be prepared to face it, distasteful as it may be to us. If a situation arose in which our people were hungry, and the only thing that stood between them and the food which would relieve their hunger was our capacity to raise money where with to provide it, then no departure from political life, as we know it in this country, would be too drastic or too grave to undertake in order to achieve our prime duty as public men in this State, and that is to ensure that the people for whom we stand trustees shall not be neglected for the want of courage on our part, granted that we have the goodwill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGovern" hpid="Mr. McGovern Mr. McGovern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGovern</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Dillon&rsquo;s view about family allowances. I am not at all satisfied that the money that is being provided by the State is, in all cases, reaching the most deserving hands.  Only a few weeks ago I put down a Parliamentary question with regard to a married man with a family of eight.  He has a small bit of land on the mountain, the valuation of which is about £3.  His only means of support is what he is able to earn from casual labour, and the proceeds of his bit of poor land.  The question suggested continuing the payment of unemployment assistance to people with extra large families.  The Minister&rsquo;s reply was that the only relief he could afford to such men was that they should apply to the board of health for home assistance. That man would not hear of home help.  No matter what happened, he would not take it for one of his family.  He is a man of spirit, and has the feeling that to apply for, or to take, <Col N="301" /> home help would be a slur on his family.  Even though that is perhaps a foolish view, yet it must be conceded that men like him are good citizens. They should be respected, and provision should be made for them, especially when we think of the big sums of money that are being provided by the State for other classes of people who, in many cases, do not deserve it.  A man like him has a great deal of responsibility. He has eight dependents, so that in all nine people have to be provided for, and he has practically no means.  I think his case provides an unanswerable argument for considering the points raised by Deputy Dillon. To what extent the Minister would be able to meet all such claims is another matter.  It is a point of view that should be carefully considered, and one that I would strongly support.</P>
      <P>This Budget, Deputy Linehan said, is not so bad from the point of view of the taxpayers, that is, taking the short view of it.  But, unfortunately, when one takes the long view, we find that we are piling up a load of debt against the Budgets for the years to come. We are not going to see the end of the debt this year, next year, or in ten years&rsquo; time.  It is true, I suppose, to say that the same thing applies to last year&rsquo;s Budget and to earlier ones.  One may ask, whither are we drifting? We have increased the deadweight national debt by £2,500,000 over the last year, and we are preparing to increase it by practically £4,000,000 this year.  These figures do not take into account the amount of the Supplementary Estimate which is sure to come along later.  Neither do they take into account the deadweight debt of our local bodies which must be paid by the ratepayers.  It does not matter to our unfortunate citizens whether all these debts have to be paid as rates or in taxation.  What matters is that they have to pay them.  The Minister for Finance admitted yesterday in his Budget statement that our resources are contracting, and contracting at a dangerous rate.  These burdens are being piled up for the future, and yet we are going merrily along the road that leads to national bankruptcy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no compaint to make at the <Col N="302" /> effort that is being made to try to provide the money needed to meet the extra expenditure on the Army in the present grave crisis.  In connection with that, where the trouble arises is that over the last eight or nine years no provision whatever was made for the rainy day.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce, who happens to be in the House, used to boast when he was Minister for Finance about the buoyancy of the revenue, and of the growing prosperity of the State. Where is the growing prosperity now? What resources have we left to fall back upon in this time of crisis?  We have none.  We have spent all the money that was earned, and more, and now we find ourselves with an unbalanced Budget.  The same prospect faces us as regards future Budgets. Deputy Linehan spoke about borrowing to the extent of £15,000,000.  I do not know if that is necessary.  Even if it were necessary, I do not know if it would be wise to borrow to that extent. The State should be run within its means, just as every individual has to try to live within his means.  There should be no difficulty in doing that. After all, we are not engaged in a war; we are in a crisis resulting from a war between other nations.  We are deprived of certain imports and certain other things and that, more or less, creates difficulties for the Government in office.</P>
    <P>After a number of normal years, the State should have been in a position, by wise government, to meet a crisis of this sort without increasing the burden of national debt from year to year and that of local debt as well. How will these debts be met?  When the war is over a world slump will follow.  At the present time, our neighbour country, in the midst of a costly war, is providing against such a slump by paying wages now at a reduced rate and reserving some of the wages to be paid after the war in order to meet the slump.  The provision we are making for the slump is to pile up debts to be met then.  If they are not met then, they must be left over for future generations, and I believe the next generation will have little to thank us for if we go on merrily spending <Col N="303" /> the savings of those who have gone before us and pile up debts for them to clear.</P>
    <P>Like others on this side of the House, I have been recommending the Government to consider living within their means and effecting savings wherever possible.  Instead of doing that, however, the Government has increased the burden, year after year, and has increased the number of officials in each particular office.  The number should have been reduced and an attempt should have been made to enable the nation to live within its means and not drift to bankruptcy. Notwithstanding all the money that is being spent on social services, many of our people are in serious want and no provision has been made to meet their needs.  All Parties should co-operate; and all Parties are willing to co-operate with the Government in any way they can in an attempt to solve these difficulties.  There is no use in our burying our heads in the sand and pretending that the difficulties do not exist.  We must not wait until some great crash comes and the whole country loses confidence in the Administration.  It is better to tell the country straight that we are facing such difficult times and that co-operation is necessary.</P>
    <P>If we were engaged in a European war, we should have to find very much more; and if we had a navy to provide for it would increase the Estimate enormously.  Having regard to the fact that half of our Army is a free Army&mdash; even boots are not bought for them, and they have to pay part of the price of those they wear in the service of the nation&mdash;there should not be so much trouble about balancing the Budget.  I believe it shows there is something radically wrong with the way this country is run when we find such financial difficulties amongst sections of our people.  An effort must be made to put these matters right.  I know the Minister will rise and ask where economies can be made.  That is for the Minister to find out.  Each Minister of the Government found means to increase taxation, instead of reducing it by £2,000,000 as they promised.  They <Col N="304" /> found means to increase it more and more, until now we are unable to raise the money.</P>
    <P>Yesterday, the Minister admitted that there were certain luxuries which he would like to tax, but said they were taxed to saturation point and that, instead of winning by it, he might easily lose by it.  Tobacco was singled out, not because it was a commodity he would like best to tax, but because those addicted to tobacco could not give it up, because they were slaves to the drug and must stick to it, no matter what tax is imposed.  Therefore, he hoped to collect £1,800,000 on that commodity.  That falls proportionately heavily upon the poor man. After all, it is a small thing to a man with plenty of means to pay the extra 4½d. per ounce on tobacco; but it is a big thing to the man who gets only £1 or 25/- a week, and who has to provide everything for a big household.  He has to pay at least 9d. extra for his two ounces of tobacco&mdash;no smoker uses less than two and some use four ounces&mdash; and when he has to purchase food and clothes and so on it is but little consolation to him to light his pipe and have a smoke that costs him 9d. extra per week.</P>
    <P>I remember the time when this country was over-taxed enormously, because the whole of Ireland was taxed to the tune of £11,000,000 a year.  Now, one portion of it is taxed to the extent of £41,000,000 and the other portion is taxed to nearly £30,000,000, I think. Surely we are taxed to the hilt this time.  It is five or six times what it was then.  Something must be done about it.  The Minister should have begun in the Government Departments, in this House, and in the Seanad, and should have set a headline for the country.  He should have got everybody to make a fair sacrifice, and should have tried to get everybody in the country into productive work as far as it was possible to do so.  Every possible effort should be made to get all our unemployed men engaged in some productive work&mdash;in something that would give a return or benefit the nation, directly or indirectly, and so improve the morale of our people. Unless that is done, we are drifting <Col N="305" /> surely towards the precipice of bankruptcy, and it is only a matter of time until we reach that point.  The country will lose confidence in Parliamentary institutions altogether unless an honest attempt is made to improve the position.</P>
    <P>There is another thing which makes our difficulties greater.  The inefficiency with regard to the treatment of the foot-and-mouth disease has added another £500,000 at least to the burden of taxation, and it is still growing. We do not know how far it is likely to go before it is finished.  It may cost £1,000,000 or £1,500,000 in taxation and, at the same time, as the Minister said, our resources will be contracted because, after all, the live-stock industry of this country is the greatest resource we have to meet all kinds of payments, taxation or anything else.</P>
    <P>The value of our live stock has been reduced by at least £6,000,000.  I think we used to export 1,000,000 cattle annually, roughly, and they are reduced by at least £6 a head for this year.  No matter how soon the mess is cleared up, the farmers of this country will lose £6,000,000 as a result of that disease, and it is all due to inefficiency in the Minister&rsquo;s Department because it could have been stamped out had he taken strong measures at the very outset.</P>

      <P>I hope to.  In so far as it affects the Budget, I am making a passing reference to it.  That is all.  It is contracting the means for meeting these extraordinary burdens.  The country would have been in a better position to pay the Budget taxes this <Col N="306" /> year if the cattle trade had been thriving. That is all I wish to say about it. As other Deputies have pointed out, I think the Minister could find some other commodity, some other amusement or some other luxury to tax instead of imposing this tax on tobacco.  If this tax would have the effect of stopping many of our young people smoking cigarettes I would say it would be a good thing, I would approve of the tax, but unfortunately I am afraid it will not have that effect.  I would ask the Minister, if possible, to find some other commodity or some other amusement that he could tax instead of putting the tax upon tobacco.  I hope the Minister, in consultation with the other members of the Government, will make an attempt to put all our unemployed into some useful work that will give a return to the nation either directly or indirectly, and that he will make an honest effort to reduce expenditure wherever it can be done.  I think he could make a beginning both in this House and in the Seanad, and in the various Departments of the State that are overstaffed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that even much as one might dislike it, we will have to admit that this is a pretty good Budget, far better than we expected. I listened for the usual opposition from Deputies opposite, and even Deputy Linehan could not find anything. Deputy Linehan merely told us that next year would be a lot worse, and it would be better if the Minister told the people about next year instead of this year.  He could find no fault with the present Budget or the manner in which the money was to be found. Deputy Dillon steered clear of it altogether.  He gave a little lecture such as you would give in a school to school-children.  We had a general election address from him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dillon told us, in plain words, that under some scheme he had in mind 75 per cent. of the people of this country would pay no taxes at all. He said that for every family in this country living on less than £2 a week he was going to find a family allowance. In addition to that, every family <Col N="307" /> in this country living on £3 a week or less was not going to be asked to pay any tax at all.  So that, roughly, about 20 per cent. of the people of this country were going to be taxed for the rest of them.  That was Deputy Dillon&rsquo;s summary.  Twenty per cent. were to pay all the taxes; the remainder were to go free.  I do not know how he was going to do it.  I asked him where he was going to find the cash.  He did not say where he was going to find it.  Let us consider the Budget.  Let us take first the tax on tobacco.  It is to my mind a burden that falls very heavily on the ordinary poor and working people of this country.  In this year we are going to take £1,870,000 extra from the people for tobacco alone.  Most of that is going to be paid by the people that Deputy Dillon thinks should get family allowances.  As a matter of fact the total revenue from tobacco this year will be about £7,000,000, roughly.  If Deputy Dillon had his way, 80 per cent. of the people would not pay any of that tax.  That would mean that our revenue from tobacco would be, roughly, about £1,000,000.  Deputy Dillon is going to get the other £6,000,000 from 20 per cent. of the population.  There is a very hopeful outlook for them if Deputy Dillon ever gets preparing a Budget.  It is a very hopeful outlook that the only people who will pay tax in this country will be 20 per cent. of the population.  The tax on sugar and tea will be taken off, and of course the tax on petrol will come off.  Every man under £2 a week is not only going to be free from taxation but is going to get a family allowance from Deputy Dillon.  Those between £2 and £3 are going to be left free from all taxes.  I do not know where Deputy Dillon lives, and I do not know at what he spends his time, but, if that is his serious contribution as a Budget speech, it is a gem. I wonder what all the wealthy financiers who were circularised by Fine Gael to swell their election fund at the last election would say to that? I suggest it would be worth while sending out another circular to them in the form of that gem of Deputy Dillon&rsquo;s.</P>
    <P>The principal objection I see is that <Col N="308" /> we are not planning well enough for the position as we see it, and as anybody would have to see it.  We are not planning well enough.  The unemployment problem in this country is acute already, and will become worse, and very much worse.  To my mind, it is a problem which seems to be forgotten. I am visualising the position in my own constituency, and I am visualising the results of that position, which are going to be very serious. The repercussions right along into other industries which are giving a large amount of employment at the present time will be more serious still, arising out of the position of one industry only which is at present closed down.  In that connection, the Government are not doing their job. The Government can say to the farmer: &ldquo;If you are not prepared to do so-and-so, I will take your land and do it for you.&rdquo;  Well, then, in the case of an industrialist who is not prepared to produce the things which the nation needs at the present day, his industry should be taken over and worked by the State.  Let us have an end to this damn nonsense about it.</P>

      <P>The factory is there. There is no bother as far as other things are concerned.  The men are there.  Unless iron is produced to supply the needs of this country in the next three or four months, there are going to be at least ten other firms closing down, and their employees thrown as an extra burden on the taxpayers <Col N="309" /> of this country.  That is a problem we have got to face, and the sooner the Government wakes up to its responsibilities the better.  There is no use in hiding it.  There is no good in pretending that private people have any interests whatever.  There is no good in Martin Corry telling the Government that his farm is his own, and that he can do what he likes with it.  If he does, the Minister for Agriculture will very quickly tell him: &ldquo;If you do not plough so many acres, I will take your land and plough it for you.&rdquo;  In the case of those industrialists who are not going to meet the demands made on them and produce all the iron and steel necessary for this country, it is time the Minister said to them: &ldquo;Get out, and I will do it for you.&rdquo;  I am not concerned with any private individual, or what his interests are to-day in this country.  I am concerned with the needs of this country, our needs here.  It is all very well for Deputy Dillon to be blathering about self-sufficiency.  But for our efforts at achieving self-sufficiency we would have nothing, and there would be very little use in depending on Deputy Dillon&rsquo;s pals across the English channel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Evidently, the Departments are losing sight of a lot of things.  I was faced with a problem in my constituency last week.  Unemployment assistance was stopped in rural areas, on the grounds that those men could now find employment in those areas.  A scheme of employment was brought in there.  The County Council of Cork subscribed £1,000.  Another £1,000 was subscribed out of the Unemployment Assistance Fund, and £1,000 from the Road Fund. The conditions under which that scheme was put into operation was that the unemployed people of Cork City, whose authorities contributed nothing to the scheme, were to get two-thirds of the work.  There were 52 unemployed families drawing home assistance within one mile of where that scheme was started, and the Parliamentary Secretary insisted on sending down 12 men from Cork City to work at the very doors of those people who had ceased to get unemployment assistance because there was supposed to be work for them in the area.  But <Col N="310" /> when the work was there, they would not get it.  This kind of nonsensical thing has to stop.  The unemployment problem in this country is one that has to be faced, and if we plan ahead now we can end it, or practically end it.  At the present day there is work for practically every idle man on the bogs of this country.  It only remains to get them there.</P>

      <P>God knows we are paying enough officials to get it done, if they have any brains.  God knows, when you see the bill for salaries, it looks as if we are paying enough for brains, if there are any brains to be got.  There should be no difficulty whatsoever in erecting huts on the bogs, getting the unemployed people from the cities down there, and putting them to work. There is plenty of work for them.  If that is not done, we will get only about 50 per cent. of our fuel requirements next winter, and there is no use in blinding ourselves to it.  There is plenty of work there.  Get them out to it and put them at it instead of giving them money and leaving them idle.</P>
      <P>We hear a lot about income-tax, surtax, and corporation profits tax.  There should be no excess profits at the present day.  Deputy Linehan said that I ought to join in, but I am not prepared to join in any kind of alliance between the Government and some looter down the country.  The looter collects the loot and the Government act like the monkey with the nuts long ago&mdash;they sweep the most of it.  We have unfortunate farmers in my constituency whose cases I have already mentioned. They were robbed&mdash;I cannot describe it in any other way&mdash;by the merchants.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>No Deputy can deny that they were robbed, and now they are to be satisfied because the Minister extracts so much in the pound off the merchants and others and leaves them with the balance.  That is very little use to the unfortunate farmer when he <Col N="311" /> gets his bill for the annuities.  He has paid most of his money to the merchant for the seed.  It is little comfort to him to be told that the Government are collecting 15/- in the £ by way of excess profits tax.  The money has gone from the farmer and that is all he knows about it.  I do not believe in those excess profits.  They should not be there.  If there are excess profits, the members of the Prices Commission are not doing their duty. That commission should not be there if there are excess profits.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope I shall have another opportunity of dealing with these matters on the appropriate Vote. I was anxious to mention the few points that I have mentioned because to my mind they are urgent.  It is a good Budget, because it does not hit people too hard.  I think the Minister, before putting a tax on tobacco, should have considered the cinemas and tried to get a little more out of them.  The ladies and gentlemen who go into the cinemas can better afford an extra few pence than the unfortunate labourers can afford to pay extra money for the ounce of tobacco.  The Minister could follow that up with another little bit on the income-tax payer, and it would not hurt him too much either.  I have very little sympathy with those people. Look at the salaries that are paid to some of them, and add to that the cost-of-living <Col N="312" /> bonus.  No one can have any sympathy with them.  From the way some of these fellows earn their incomes in my constituency, I only wish the Minister would collect 30/- in the £ off them.  Something like that should be collected off the engineer who got away with £7,400 in fees. That man could well afford to pay 19/6 in the £1.</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no sympathy with these gentlemen.  I will go part of the way with Deputy Dillon, and perhaps a fair part.  I think that before any further burden is placed on the ordinary working people, the taxes on those other people should be increased. We should go to the 10/- limit before we put a tax on the poor man&rsquo;s tobacco.  If you are going to work on the basis that ordinary wages are not to go up, that the wages of the ordinary workers in the country, 34/- a week, should not be altered, and at the same time you put an extra burden on them in the shape of a tax on tobacco, then they will soon be in a very miserable position.</P>
      <P>I do not agree with Deputy Dillon&rsquo;s viewpoint with regard to 20 per cent. of the population paying the taxes.  I cannot see how we could collect £41,000,000 in that way, and that was Deputy Dillon&rsquo;s proposal.  Deputies, generally, have admitted that the Minister did very well in his job.  I am merely pointing out the few blanks that he could very well fill up, and the few matters that the Government should take in hands and get to work on.  God knows there are enough over-paid officials in various Departments, and there is enough work for them.  The only mistake the Government made at the start of the emergency was that they did not stop the Civil Service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickGiles" hpid="Captain Giles Captain Giles">
      <NameTxt>Captain Giles</NameTxt>
      <P>This Budget, like all the Budgets the Fianna Fáil Government have brought in, is an unpleasant one.  It is definitely a Fianna Fáil Budget.  It is one more rung up <Col N="313" /> the ladder.  There has been a jump of £2,000,000 a year for the last ten years. When will they reach the end of this high taxation?  We hope this year they will reach the climax of their activities. For a small island like ours, there is no question that taxation has got out of control, and it is beyond the capacity of the people to stand the burden.  It is a great thing that they have such patience, but I think their patience is almost at an end.</P>
      <P>We have reached the stage when no type of tightening up of administration can reduce taxation.  Nothing less than a real revolution will bring about the change that is so much needed, and you will have that revolution if you do not wake up soon.  At the moment the people are looking outside this House to see if they can get some one to lead them out of the mess into which the Fianna Fáil Administration has brought them.  If they do not get a leader on the outside, all we can do, and all that ordinary people can do, will not save the country.  For ten years they have been promising that they are going round the corner and that things are getting better.  This year we are told that the outlook was never so black.  What else can you expect when you have incompetent men dealing in an incompetent way with the affairs of the country?</P>
      <P>If decent business methods were employed, even during the last five or six years, a curb could have been put on this desperate taxation.  We had an economic war, which drained the lifeblood out of our people, and after that war ended we were told that agriculture must bear more and more taxation. Agriculture was in the front line during that war, but the farmers got very little out of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When that economic war finished, it was the duty of the Government to cut their cloth according to their measure, and they should have got rid of the horde of officials that were brought in to run the economic war. They brought in dozens and dozens of new officials, and those officials hung on to their jobs.  If they were not needed in one Department, they were shoved into another, and the result is that now you have a redundancy of officials, one <Col N="314" /> trying to make a job for the other.  The people are not satisfied, and they want to see the State managed in a clean, competent way by a small band of competent men.  Now, however, we have tens of thousands of men drawing huge salaries for the purpose of bolstering up the Fianna Fáil régime, a régime of failure and falsehoods.  Agriculture, which could be the backbone of this country, which should be, and which will be the backbone of this country, has been treated in a most miserable way.  If all the tens of thousands of pounds that have been spent in trying to bolster up the failure and falsehood of the Fianna Fáil position in this country had been spent on agriculture, what a happy position we would be in to-day! Instead of that, however, the unfortunate farmers of this country have been bullied and bludgeoned.  They have been told to till more land, grow more wheat, and all the rest of it, but there has been nobody to tell them who will pay them for their work.  No; all the farmers are told to do now is to take off their coats and work harder than ever in order to pay these gentry&mdash;the very gentry who took millions from the people during the past few years&mdash;the gentry who now tell the people of this country: &ldquo;We are the masters, and you are the servants.&rdquo;  They are the masters to-day&mdash;the people on the Front Bench of the Government Party, who do not know either their own business or the business of the State.  They can go around, dashing around the country in their swanky cars, while the unfortunate people of the country cannot get a gallon of petrol to enable them to go about their own business.  But all that will come to an end, and I believe it will come to an end shortly.  I hope that the people of this country soon will take in hand the task of letting the Fianna Fáil Party know who is master and who is servant.</P>
    <P>We are all agreed that there is a time of emergency at the moment and that a fair amount of money must be spent on the Army and on Defence, but are we getting a decent return or decent service for the amount that is being spent?  I believe that there is a <Col N="315" /> huge amount of squandermania in connection with this matter.  I am not at all satisfied with the manner in which I see military lorries dashing all around the country while, at the same time, people have to wait for hours at railway stations for trains because they cannot get petrol to bring them about their business.  I see dozens and dozens of these military lorries dashing and splashing around the country at the expense of the people, while, in every other country in Europe, you have armies going through the most intensive drill in order to make themselves fit.  As far as I can see, the people in our Army will not even walk across the street; they have to be carried in lorries.  The people will not put up with this kind of thing.</P>
    <P>I think it was really a disgrace and that it was a saddening thing for the people who are putting up this money to see the huge demonstration of armed might that was put up by the Government a few weeks ago here in the City of Dublin, when they brought out thousands upon thousands of their Army, and spent many thousands of pounds in doing so, merely for the purpose of showing that they, and they alone, had made it possible for that Army to exist and had made it possible for the occasion which that demonstration was designed to honour. But the real people who made it possible for that demonstration to take place had to remain at home.  They could not be there, because they had not the wherewithal to be there; but there was not a Minister, or the wife or son or daughter of a Minister, who was not there.  In a time of emergency such as this, and in view of the worse times that may yet come upon us, I think a much better use could have been found for that money than in lashing it around on a demonstration in the streets of Dublin for the purpose of bolstering up the Fianna Fáil Party, in the guise of honouring those who helped to put them where they are.  It was as a result of the sacrifices of other people, and the promises they made to the people, that they are in the position in which they are, but the people are now awakening to the reality of the position.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="316" /> I really thought that, in view of present circumstances, the Minister who brought in the Budget would at least cover the matter of amusements in this country.  There may be a tax on amusements at the moment, but I believe there should be another tax on them.  It seems to me that, at the moment, the only thing that concerns the boys and girls, is where the next dance or picture will be. In view of the crisis with which we are faced at the moment I do not think that pleasure should be the order of the day, and I believe that a tax on amusements is essential in order to make these young people take a grave and serious view of the situation confronting us.  A tax on such amusements, on which these young people spend a lot of money in going to frivolous dances and remaining up all night, would not do the least bit of harm.</P>
    <P>I think, also, that the tax on tobacco is too severe.  I agree that some tax was necessary, but this tax is too severe.  After all, tobacco is almost a necessity to the poor man.  When he has finished a hard day&rsquo;s work, the first thing you see him do is to light his pipe, but the Minister now has taken the pipe out of his mouth, and that was a foul blow.  It would have been better to put another 6d. on amusements, or on some other source of income, than on the tobacco of the poor man.</P>

      <P>The Minister was in a smoke-screen when he was bringing that tax in.  I think I have almost said enough.  But I ask the Minister, in the name of Heaven, to wake up to the realities of the situation. Anybody would think, to look at him, that he was quite unconcerned &mdash;and I believe he is quite unconcerned, because he has a very happy way of looking at life.  I suggest, however, that he should take a few days&rsquo; holidays down in the country and go around amongst the farmers&rsquo; plots and see what is being done there, instead of coming in here and telling certain people that they must do their duty or <Col N="317" /> that he will take down his whip.  I believe that in a very short time there will be a change of Government here. Each and every one of us is sick and tired of Fianna Fáil.  We have been tired of Fianna Fáil for the last ten years.  We were tired of you before you ever came into power.  We knew that you would be a failure.  Before you ever came into power, we knew you were a failure and that you would be a failure.  You told the people, and shouted from the housetops, that once you got into power, you would give them everything.  What have you given them?  You have given the people nothing but misery.  You shoved the people of this country through a war that they did not want, and then, through your own incompetence, you have forced them to pay many thousands of pounds as a result of the foot-and-mouth disease.</P>

      <P>Yes, and they robbed them also before they started to break them.  I would ask the Government to be honest with the people of this country.  When you ask people to pay taxes, I hold that you should start at the top.  When you ask people to pay taxes, you should at least be men enough to pay taxes yourselves.  We have an allowance here as Deputies, which enables us to travel around the country and visit our constituents, and I think that at least we should have the decency to pay income-tax on our own allowances when we are asking the people, who have put us here, to pay income-tax.  I am not saying that our allowances are sufficient&mdash;in my case, they are not by any means sufficient&mdash; but I hold that it is unfair to ask the people, who pay to put us here, to pay taxes that we will not pay ourselves. I think the Minister should think twice about this matter.  I know that he got on his high horse because of articles in certain daily newspapers with regard to salaries and allowances paid in this House.  I do not blame him for that because I suppose these papers went too far with their nonsense but, at the same time, I would say that we ourselves ought to give a lead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While our people are downtrodden and still have to bear these taxes, we <Col N="318" /> should give a lead.  If we do give a lead, we shall satisfy the people to a great extent.  The people at present are up in arms.  There is not a town or village to which you go, that people do not say to you: &ldquo;We put you there but we got nothing in return from you.&rdquo;  I believe it is our duty to give some return to these people, and we ought to give them a lead in this matter.  In all well-organised armies, the lead always comes from the top.  In this instance, however, it appears as if we were standing behind and shoving the &ldquo;mugs&rdquo; of taxpayers to the front.  We ought not to ask our people to do more than we are prepared to do ourselves.  If taxation has to be increased in order to make good the deficiencies caused by the incompetence of the present Government, it is our duty to bear part of that burden.  We have certainly not given the return to the people they expected from us.  I would ask the Fianna Fáil Party if they are not going to be decent with the people, at least to get out of the way and let somebody else take their place.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>This Budget, as the Minister rightly said yesterday, demands from the taxpayers a very substantial contribution towards the maintenance of the social and administrative services of the State.  It imposes not merely some new and some hard taxes but, what is often overlooked, it continues old taxes some of which press with considerable rigour on the masses of poor people in the country. Judged by orthodox standards, the amount demanded is indeed a colossal <Col N="319" /> sum for a country with a relatively low standard of productivity such as we have.  What strikes one on examining the amount of money to be raised under the Budget is that, notwithstanding all this expenditure, we are still apparently content, having raised this vast sum of money, to leave unremedied, and completely unrelieved, the widespread poverty and misery which abound in this country to-day.</P>
      <P>Let us examine the Budget from the standpoint of the masses of the working-class people.  We have, according to the statistics of the Department of Industry and Commerce, approximately 71,000 persons registered at employment exchanges throughout the country.  We have now cut off the register approximately 40,000 workless people by the operation of the recent Employment Period Order. Therefore if you add the 71,000 people who are registered at present to the 40,000 people who have been cut off, we have in this country, satisfying the rigorous test of unemployment, approximately 111,000 people.  That problem would be bad enough if it were a diminishing problem, but it is not a diminishing problem.  It is a growing and an ever-widening problem, a problem which would be very much worse were it not for the fact that, notwithstanding the &ldquo;blitzes&rdquo; in England and in Belfast arising out of the war situation, large numbers of able-bodied men, many of them skilled craftsmen, are willing to defy the bombs and the bombing planes, in order to secure in Great Britain and the Six Counties the employment with which we, through our incompetence, are unable to provide them here.  Were it not for that steady stream of emigration, a steady stream which can be checked up, as the Minister well knows, by consultation with the shipping authorities, with the railway authorities and the labour exchanges&mdash;which in many cases are acting as agencies for that emigration&mdash;we would be faced with an unemployment problem of even greater magnitude than the already serious problem which presents itself to us to-day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I looked through this Budget carefully&mdash;I <Col N="320" /> not merely listened to the Minister&rsquo;s speech, but I read the Budget statement subsequently&mdash;to ascertain whether any effective steps were being proposed to deal with this vast reservoir of unemployment and destitution which confronts us to-day.  If you take, on the one hand, the large numbers who are registered as unemployed, and, on the other hand, the large numbers who are depending on the relatively destitution rates of home assistance and out-door relief, the large numbers who are living on insurance or on charitable organisations of one kind or another, and if you say that that is the roll-call of destitution in this country, then I venture to suggest that not less than 300,000 persons will answer that roll-call.  To relieve that large mass of poverty, this Budget makes no effective contribution.</P>
    <P>The Minister told us that a certain sum of money was being provided which in the long run would find an outlet in the provision of employment, but the Minister forgot to say, or perhaps skilfully omitted to tell us, that some of the spending departments, such as the Office of Public Works and the Land Commission, had substantially reduced their estimates this year. The reduction of these estimates means that for many people in the rural areas there will be a substantial diminution in the employment which was formerly available to them.  There is no provision whatever in the Budget to meet the general problem of expanding unemployment, and, apparently, if this Budget represents the last thought in the minds of the Government, no provision whatever for that new type of unemployment which is growing up as a result of the war situation&mdash;the unemployment of large numbers of people in cities and towns throughout the country.  It is the daily experience of every member of this House who has contact with cities and towns that there is a type of worker now being thrown on the unemployment market who formerely was rarely confronted with unemployment. The building trade has already contracted substantially.  Not merely has private building been substantially curtailed, but official statistics <Col N="321" /> show that the number of workers engaged in municipal housing schemes has also been substantially reduced. Such building activity as there is tends to contract even further.  The shortage of petrol has thrown large numbers of persons out of employment formerly provided in garages, in transport undertakings and in private employment. The general dislocation caused by shortage of raw materials and our inability to store them has again contributed to the serious aggravation of the unemployment problem in cities and towns throughout the country.</P>
    <P>We will probably be told before the debate concludes that the winning of turf is going to provide a substantial amount of employment this year.  I hope it will, not merely from the standpoint of those who must try to exist, but also to win for our people the fuel that can no longer be imported.  If we examine the problem from the standpoint of the employment possibilities of turf, I do not think any Deputy with any knowledge of turf will be prepared to say that it will offer employment beyond April to September, or probably May to September.  What is to happen in September?  Supposing we cut all the turf we require by September, and if it cannot be saved by then it cannot be saved at all.  Assuming that it is cut and saved, by the end of September that work will be over, and we will be facing a bleak winter. The picture will be one of unrelieved gloom.  What is to happen the thousands of people who may have got work on the bogs, and to the thousands of unemployed whose numbers will be growing by the force of events between now and then?  What is to happen to the daily growing numbers unemployed in towns and cities?  The unemployment problem in these areas will be intensified every day and every week that passes between now and next winter.  What is to be the lot of these people?  What can we offer them?  Is their lot to be the employment exchanges and the home assistance officers?  We talk of freedom, but the freedom that thousands of our people know is the freedom to go to the labour exchanges, and the freedom to suffer hunger, because we suffer from legislative <Col N="322" /> laziness and incapacity to organise our resources for the provision of employment.</P>
    <P>At this stage I want to address a simple question to the Minister for Finance, because I regard him as the pivot of the whole position.  What does the Government propose to do for the new large numbers at present unemployed? What do they propose to do for the new type of unemployment arising in the towns and cities?  What do they propose to do for the growing unemployment which inevitably will arise?  The unemployment problem was described by the Minister for Supplies as constituting an economic crisis of the first magnitude.  This Budget leaves the problem unsolved.  It indicates no hope of relief for the mass of unemployed people.</P>
    <P>One can only imagine that the Government appears to have got tired of hoping to grapple with unemployment, much less to provide an effective remedy.  One is tempted to ask what about the palmy days when the Government had a plan that would not merely put all the unemployed people into work, but when they would have to send to America to bring back the exiles?  Far from finding it necessary to bring back the exiles from America, the position now is that we cannot keep them from going to Belfast, to Britain and into other areas strewn with mangled bodies.  There was a time when the Government told us that unemployment was an easy problem to solve here; that it could be solved by a policy of self-sufficiency.  Have we not had plenty of opportunities to develop to the utmost the policy of self-sufficiency?  Nobody wants to sell us anything to-day; nobody wants to give us anything, nobody wants to export anything to this country.  If self-sufficiency is the blessing that some people claim it to be, what is to prevent us having a 100 per cent. self-sufficiency policy, and bringing about that kind of El Dorado that was one time supposed to be the hall-mark of a policy of self-sufficiency?  We were told from the Government Benches that unemployment was an easy problem to solve.  When speaking on the question <Col N="323" /> in 1931 the Taoiseach according to the Official Debates, Volume XL, column 2362, said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;And the cure for unemployment in this country lies in supplying ourselves with manufactured goods which at the present moment we needlessly import....&rdquo;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;...the solution of unemployment is easier to find in this country at the present moment than it is in any other country facing that problem.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>How is it, after ten years, notwithstanding the application of the plan and the many devices resorted to by the Fianna Fáil Party, that we have still an unemployed problem that is worse than it was when the Government assumed office in 1932?  For many years the present Minister for Supplies was charged with the task of solving unemployment.  Speaking on the same occasion as the Taoiseach, the following were his views on the subject.  They appear in the same volume, column 2380:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Deputy de Valera showed&mdash;and showed fairly convincingly to anyone open to conviction&mdash;that unemployment need not exist here, that it exists very largely because of the lack of directive ability on the part of the Government....&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If unemployment still exists here, and is more intensified now, is that due to the same cause?  If unemployment was then due largely to lack of directive ability, presumably the problem is curable by the application of directive ability.  The Government had nine years to apply directive ability, but notwithstanding the application of the species of ability they possess, we have still an unemployment problem which is worse than it was then, and that tends to become still worse, because the Government has got tired of dealing with it, because they have no plan, because they suffer from illusions that amount almost to hallucinations.  The wilful neglect of the problem would be inexcusable in peace time, but to permit it to develop until it becomes a greater cancer, is to be guilty of criminal neglect in existing circumstances.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="324" /> I believe what the Taoiseach said in 1931, that it was easier to deal with unemployment here than in any other country, but I do not believe that it could be solved by the Taoiseach&rsquo;s methods.  I believe that other methods are necessary.  I believe that unemployment is probably a problem with which we can deal more easily than any other country, but I do not believe that it can be dealt with by the methods the Government employed during the last nine years.  If unemployment in the view of the Taoiseach was curable in 1931, and according to the Minister for Supplies curable by directive ability, and did not need cash or coupons but directive ability, what is the difficulty about applying directive ability now?  What is the difficulty now in surveying the possibilities in this country and harnessing to the development of these possibilities the brain and brawn that are lying dormant to-day?  I see no difficulty in providing work for our people if we have the necessary courage and energy to break with methods that have given us such tragic results in the past.  Nobody will deny that there is an abundance of work to be done here.</P>
    <P>If you take the field of public endeavour alone, and certain private endeavour, and compare them with such developments in other countries immediately preceding the war&mdash;of course, we must exclude the present war period from any comparison or survey&mdash;a vast amount of work immediately comes to one&rsquo;s mind.  We have, on the one hand, an abundance of work to be done; we have men and women able to do it, on the other. What prevents the men and women from doing that work?  I may be told that the difficulty is to try to organise these unemployed people and to finance their activities in such a way that you will not break from the standards and methods of the past, and I am sure that every mind that can influence the Minister, every mind that wants to live on Victorian concepts of money, every mind that wants to live on the hoary concepts of money which have broken down with ignominy throughout Europe and the rest of the world, will tell the Minister that it cannot be done, and the Minister, <Col N="325" /> as his Budget indicates, will probably be prepared to believe that.</P>
    <P>There was a time, probably not so long ago, for many countries, when the issue of money had to be related to reserves of gold, with a relatively small uncovered note issue, but many countries discovered that they could not only issue money but could, in addition, keep their people in employment, provide them with at least as high a standard of living as we provide for our people and avoid the relatively extensive unemployment problem we have without having gold at all, or a relatively negligible quantity of gold, and they did not feel it was necessary to buy the securities of a neighbour whose ultimate financial stability might possibly be in considerable doubt.  The Minister must know that many countries in Europe to-day &mdash;the chief antagonists in the present conflict, for instance, and one of them in particular&mdash;have long since ceased to relate their note issue to a gold backing, and, instead, are backing their note issue by work, by industry, by toil, by the creation of wealth and are completely unconcerned with shortages of gold.  Another belligerent who formerly and, in fact, until recently, clung tenaciously to the gold standard as a cover for its note issue has been compelled to abandon even what remained of its gold backing for notes in the interest of the prosecution of the war from its own standpoint.</P>
    <P>The two chief belligerents in Europe to-day are backing note issues by work and industry.  Both of them, in fact, are backing their note issues to-day by bombs and bombing planes, and if these two belligerents can back a note issue by bombs and bombing planes, by instruments of destruction and death, surely it is possible for us to finance our constructive beneficial activities by backing a note issue with houses, with afforestation, with drainage and with land improvement&mdash;to mention just a few of the many possibilities open to us as really constructive work for the tens of thousands of our unemployed who are denied the opportunity of work to-day.  But to do that means breaking with the conservative policy of the past.  It means the application of <Col N="326" /> energy and of the directive ability for which the Minister for Supplies at one time sighed, and because it means breaking with the past, because it means the application of energy, thought and directive ability, this Government will not do it.  It prefers, instead, to cling to the outworn methods of the past, to the laziness of peace time, to a reliance on the methods of peace time, notwithstanding the ineffective, the appallingly ineffective, results which these methods have given us.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister that he has probably reached his last Budget based on the financial methods of the past and that, whether he likes it or not, the force of internal circumstances here, a growing unemployment problem and our relative isolation, will compel him, as Ministers of Finance in other countries have been compelled, to abandon the methods on which they, too, relied so long and which gave them equally poor results.  The Minister might well, while the reins are still in his own hands, while he can do it in an orderly and planned way, with the good will of everybody who wants to see poverty and unemployment ended in this country, try to seek a solution of our unemployment problem on the lines of putting men to work by the creation of State credits, allowing the capital value of the State credits in due time to reduce the State credits which have been issued to finance these activities.  If other countries, ten, 20 times greater than ours, have been able to do that, to do it successfully, and with satisfactory results to their people, and to do it in a way which we might well copy, there is no reason in the world why we should seek to be the one nation in Europe still to cling to an outworn financial policy.</P>
    <P>In a very lengthy survey of the financial position yesterday, the Minister touched on many aspects of our national and economic life, and indeed on some aspects of our international relationships, but there was one striking omission from his speech: there was no mention whatever of the intentions of the Government with regard to profiteering and racketeering.  There were plenty of threats for other people, <Col N="327" /> but the Minister had not a single threat to utter against the profiteer, against the person who, in times of emergency, or times of strain and stress, is prepared to milk the consuming public to the greatest possible extent.  There were no threats for the profiteer and not even an indication that any drastic action would be taken against him.  Yesterday, the whip was reserved for the worker, but the profiteeer had no indication that this country would not continue to be his Mecca and would not continue to be a place in which he could exploit the consuming public and demand exorbitant prices to satisfy his rapacious appetite.  The only threat the Minister made was made against the workers.</P>
    <P>We were told by the Minister that he had issued two orders of first-class importance, and one of these orders might well be described as an order regulating the stabilisation of wages of workers.  I had an opportunity since yesterday of perusing Emergency Powers Order No. 83, and, in this order, one can discover on the part of its authors a most ruthless brand of totalitarianism.  There is not a dictator in Europe who has ever done in respect of workers&rsquo; wages what is done against workers&rsquo; wages in that document, and when the workers of this country wake up to a realisation of its full significance, it will require more than one press censor, and probably a dozen press censors, to censor the newspapers in respect of the indignation they will utter at the publication of such a document.  An order is now being made of first-class importance, according to the Minister, and its purpose is to peg down the rate of wages of the worker to the level in operation on 7th May, 1941.</P>
    <P>For two years, we have seen the cost of living rising, a rise represented in the upward movement of the index figure from 73 to 118, and, after prices have been allowed to soar from 73 to 118, after many commodities have been allowed to increase in price by 100 per cent., after there has been an increase permitted by the Minister for Supplies in respect of practically every commodity, <Col N="328" /> while no steps were taken to curb their upward tendency, while the workers still have no compensation for that increase of prices, this vicious order was made by the Government. The object of it is not only to peg down the wages of the workers to their present inadequate levels, but to tear up many pieces of legislation and many agreements which have regulated the wages of workers in the past.  It is impossible in the time at my disposal to go through this lengthy form of about 16 pages, even if I were disposed to do so, but some portions of it are well worthy of mention.</P>
    <P>Let us take firstly the trade boards. The Trades Boards Act of 1909 was passed by the British Government for the purpose of endeavouring to regulate wages in what were then described as sweated industries.  The British Government realised that, if left to the free play of economic forces, the unorganised workers in these industries would be no match for their exploiters, and they passed the Act of 1909.</P>
    <P>The purpose of that Act was to endeavour, by representation of workers and employers, with an independent chairman, to raise the level of wages of those workers whose occupations were governed by the Act.  Wherever trade boards existed, with some unusual exceptions, the rate of wages was quite low.  Everybody applauded every movement in wages, in occupations under the trade boards, in an upward direction, and it is to the credit of the workers&rsquo; representatives and the broadminded chairman that there was a general movement of wages in an upward direction.  Everybody hoped that that policy would continue.  What does the Minister now do?</P>
    <P>The Minister has now made an order preventing trade boards from recommending any increase of wages to workers in any industry governed by a trade board.  But he does not stop there.  He goes further, and even apprentices of tender years do not escape his machinations, because he makes provision that no rules relating to minimum rates of wages or rates of wages for overtime made by an apprenticeship committee can be effective <Col N="329" /> after the 7th May, 1941.  Not even the underpaid apprentice, no matter what skill he displays, can get an increase in his wages, because apprenticeship committees are now being prevented from making any recommendations which would increase the wages of even these lowly-paid young people. Four or five years ago we passed the Conditions of Employment Act, the purpose of which was to create a wages agreement register and allow trade unions on the one hand, and employers on the other hand, when they settled wages by agreement to have the agreement registered in the register. The Minister has now made an order rendering the whole Act abortive by abolishing the wage agreement register.  No group of employers and no group of workers can now register an agreement under the Conditions of Employment Act, and they cannot, therefore, register any agreement which allows any increase in wages whatsoever.  Three years ago, we passed the Shops (Conditions of Employment) Act, the object of which was to establish, amongst other things, a shop wages board.  That board was empowered to make wages awards. The Minister now makes an order preventing the Shops Wages Board from functioning, which means, in effect, that the sweat-shop employer can pay any rate of wages he likes.  He can continue his exploitation with the goodwill and benediction of the Minister.</P>
    <P>It is provided, too, in this document that, in respect of a very substantial number of what are described as &ldquo;scheduled employments&rdquo;, an increase of wages is not to be permitted. Nobody employed by a railway, air transport, tramway or canal company or by a person carrying on a road passenger service will be permitted to look for an increase in wages, nor will the employer be permitted to grant an increase.  No employee of a local authority can be given an increase of wages.  Nobody engaged in the supply of gas or electricity can secure an increase in wages.  Increases to those in the service of any person carrying on the business of banking will not be permitted. Employment in the service of <Col N="330" /> an insurance company will prevent one from receiving an increase of wages. Every employee of the Currency Commission, the Agricultural Credit Corporation, the Industrial Credit Company, the Sugar Company, the Turf Development Board, the Cement Company, the Industrial Alcohol Company or the Tourist Board, is prevented from receiving an increase in wages.</P>
    <P>As if that were not enough, as if Shylock&rsquo;s demands were not satisfied, the Minister has devised other prohibitions. Employment in the manufacture of wearing apparel prevents one from getting an increase of wages, as does employment in the manufacture of tobacco, textiles, textile material, soap, candles, polishes, paint, varnishes, fertilisers, metal articles, building or constructional work, building materials, manufacture of leather, paper or cardboard, printing, saw-milling or articles made of wood or glass, or glassware or articles made wholly or mainly of rubber.  Has anybody ever listened to a catalogue of vindictive vengeance more comprehensive than that?  And all this under a Budget in which not a single reference is made to curbing the activities of profiteers, or to the reduction or curtailment of prices! I should like to hear the Minister justify the exercise of powers of that kind.</P>
    <P>We gave the Minister an Emergency Powers Act to protect the State, but we did not give him that Act for the purpose of making a savage war on the working class, depressing their standard of living in the manner indicated in this order, or to enable him to escape all the criticism that would be justifiably levelled against him if he had to come to this House and proceed by ordinary legislation to get the powers which, in fact, he has obtained, as evidenced by the issue of this Emergency Powers Order No. 83.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask members of the Government Party if they stand for this order.  Will they try to justify it on any ground?  I have described it as ruthless totalitarianism.  I say that no dictator in Europe did worse than <Col N="331" /> this, or delivered a more vicious attack on the workers than has been delivered by that order.  The road may not be as comfortable as the Minister or the Government think, and I hope every inch of it will be fought by people who want to see this emergency legislation used for the purpose not only of protecting green fields and rocky coasts but for the purpose of protecting the standard of living of the people who have to reside in the country.</P>
    <P>I said at the outset that this Budget involves the raising of a colossal sum of money, and that it was not clear to me what it was doing in regard to relieving poverty and distress.  In fact, the only thing this Budget will do, as can be seen from that vicious order, is to debase the standard of living and intensify poverty and distress.  The methods contained in the Budget would be worthless in peace time, but they clearly indicate that the laziness and ineffectiveness of peace time are being carried into the present war situation.</P>
    <P>So far as this Party is concerned we are opposed to this Budget.  It is a Budget which seeks to peg down the present low standard of living for the workers in face of rising prices.  It is a Budget which does not defend the country against aggression, and merely makes war on the mass of the workingclass people who still live within the country.</P>

      <P>Amongst the tables issued by the Minister for Finance on the occasion of the Budget beginning about 1937 was one showing the national liabilities and assets.  Taking the liabilities for the year 1937 and adding the £10,000,000 which was paid to Great Britain in the following year, you get a sum of £33,346,272.  The corresponding figure, according to the table furnished to us on Wednesday last, is £43,473,591.  We have, therefore, added to the deadweight debt in these four years a sum of £10,000,000.  There may have been some assets created during those four years which are not recorded on the assets side of the account, but they would not amount to very much.  Assuming that they were £500,000 per year, we have a deadweight <Col N="332" /> debt of £8,000,000 for which there is nothing to show.</P>
      <P>Now, this year, going on the same basis, we are adding £5,000,000 to that deadweight debt, assuming the Minister&rsquo;s inability to check expenditure during the year and making no allowance whatever for his anticipation of Supplementary Estimates.  It may be that more allowance can be made for having an unbalanced Budget this year by reason of the special circumstances; but, if it is a matter merely of doubling our customary addition to our deadweight debt, a day of reckoning must come sooner or later.</P>
      <P>It is interesting in that connection to note what has just been stated by Deputy Norton.  He cited one particular country which tried the experiment that he is recommending us to try here &mdash;an experiment by the way which Dean Swift denounced many, many years ago.  At any rate, the sponsors of the proposal in his day were at least giving something.  The people then got some sort of metal coins, but, according to this new proposal, we are to get paper.  I read the first speech made in 1933 by the Leader of the country which Deputy Norton referred to but did not mention; it was probably the ablest speech he made either before or since.  The people of that country had experience of the bad money proposal that Deputy Norton is recommending to us.  The result of that was that in the 15 years following the Great War there were 225,000 suicides in that country, an average of 15,000 per year.  If we apportion that to this country, we would have 300 per year&mdash;a nice prospect.  Deputy Norton&rsquo;s scheme and the Minister&rsquo;s scheme have only a difference of degree between them, the Minister&rsquo;s policy is going directly on the lines of Deputy Norton&rsquo;s, but with moderation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ten years ago this country was promised a new Utopia.  The Leader of the Government said down the country: &ldquo;Do not let Mr. McGilligan and Mr. Cosgrave deceive you.  We can cure unemployment.&rdquo;  At any rate, the Government have had the experience of making an effort to do it, and they have not succeeded. <Col N="333" /> This new proposal would swell the unemployment list to five times what it is at present and leave the country in a far worse position than it was before if it were put into practice.  It is not a lack of money that is responsible for unemployment in this country, because it is a creditor country.  What you want is a method for employing that money and getting value for it.  The system recommended by Deputy Norton was tried in a far richer country than this or the neighbouring country, in fact the richest country in the world, and it did not succeed. Within the short period of 12 months 2,000 out of 4,000 banks closed down in that country.</P>
    <P>The principal objection I have to this proposal is that, from the returns published in the Banking Commission&rsquo;s Report, it appears that notwithstanding some very big deposits&mdash;the Government, I suppose, was a big depositor in those days&mdash;the average deposit in the banks was about £250. If one were to exclude the large depositors and to work out what the actual amount per person was, it is possible that the vast majority of the deposits were in the region of £50 or £100.  I object to robbing those people, depreciating that money and turning it into bad money.  It would not make anyone rich and it would rob the poor people of the country of their hard-earned few pounds if we tried this experiment.  There is none of my money in it, I may say.  I would not advise any man to leave his money there if it is going to be subjected to the watering that is now proposed.</P>
    <P>There is no attempt this year, as there was no attempt last year, to limit expenditure in the State.  If public money and taxation could solve unemployment and add to the wealth of the country, there is ample evidence of sufficient money being taken from the people either in this year&rsquo;s Budget or in last year&rsquo;s Budget to solve the unemployment problem.  In the year before the Government came into office something like £26,000,000 was taken from the pockets of the taxpayers. Now we are going to take £40,000,000 &mdash;an increase of £14,000,000.  If that sum were distributed over 140,000 <Col N="334" /> families it would mean £2 a week for each of them.  If the money were for the purpose of solving unemployment it is there.  The Government, however, are spending it, and they have not solved the problem of unemployment. There are two figures in this year&rsquo;s Supply Services&mdash;these form the bulk of the charges that have to be met this year&mdash;and both are of some significance. One is the Estimate for the Office of the Revenue Commissioners. The figure for the year 1931-32 was £671,000.  This year it is £926,000, an increase of £225,000.  I will admit that they are collecting more customs, more income-tax.  By reason of that the Minister may claim that more staff has to be provided.  Let us take another Department at random, one which does not show any great expansion over the same period.  The Office of the Minister for Education is estimated to cost this year £190,000.  The estimated cost ten years ago was £169,000, a difference of £21,000.  This Department is not employing more teachers now than it did ten years ago or distributing any extra money.  One gets in these two cases an example of extravagance.  If one went through all the other Estimates the same thing might be found.  It is in the Estimates that economies should be effected.</P>
    <P>What are we to get for this £40,000,000?  We are making provision for old age pensions, widows&rsquo; and orphans&rsquo; pensions, and other services, of one kind or another.  Is it within our capacity to meet the cost of those services?  Do they add, in any way, to the national wealth, and have they the effect of increasing the number of persons in employment?  I do not know that there is any plan, or that there ever was a plan.  Would it not be advisable for the Government to see if, in the first instance, they could not do something to reduce the cost of the administrative machine which they control?  Before they got into office the &ldquo;plan&rdquo; explained that they would be able to save £2,000,000 a year on the public services without reducing the efficiency of any one of them.  What do we find?  That in practically all cases there have been increases.  In the Budget of 1931-32 there were certain items in respect of the Supply Services <Col N="335" /> at that time the cost of which had to be met then, but which has not to be met now.  If we are going to continue, year after year, adding to the national burden, increasing interest charges and the charges for Sinking Fund, is it not obvious, whatever the intentions may be for the future, that there are limitations as to the country&rsquo;s capacity to bear all those charges?  In the case of the First National Loan, the Sinking Fund charges were very much heavier than those arising out of the Conversion Loan, so that this Government escaped that particular liability.</P>
    <P>How can we expect people to be honest, upright and efficient when they get the example of extravagance from the State, the example to postpone the payment of their debts, to increase their liabilities and not to add to their assets?  Apart from the annual increasing sums which are being taken from the pockets of the taxpayers it has also to be borne in mind that the local rates, the charges on the ratepayers, have gone up by nearly £2,000,000 a year.  During the period in which those increases have taken place, the national wealth has not increased, and one may say that the national income has remained almost stationary.  It has gone down, in fact. I suggest that the Government&rsquo;s efforts ought to be directed towards seeing whether it would not be possible to increase the confidence of industrialists and of those engaged in commerce in the State, as well as by lessening the charges that fall upon our main industry which gives employment to so many and pays them so badly.  It may be that just now the prices in that particular industry are a little better than they were over the last few years, but they are not yet sufficiently good to warrant the increased charges that are falling upon it.  Indeed, one may say that this Budget is particularly severe on the agricultural industry.  The increased taxation on tobacco and matches&mdash;tobacco was formerly regarded as a little luxury&mdash;will fall heavily on those engaged in that industry.</P>
    <P>It is impossible to increase the cost <Col N="336" /> of the public services without spreading the net, and the responsibility for paying for them.  Probably there was not as much attention paid to this years ago as there is now.  The effect of a change of Government had, at least, this advantage, if no other, that the cost of educating the new Government, if it has been very expensive to the State, has increased the knowledge of the members of it.  Their statements to-day are very different from what they were ten years ago.  They were not now so optimistic about solving the problems that then seemed to them so easy of solution, but I suppose we will have other people coming along seeking office who will be ready to promise to do all those things.  Has it ever entered into the mind of the Government, apart from the plan to get better value for the taxpayers by reducing the cost of the Government machine, to see whether or not some improvement could not be made in the economy of this country?  Are there not certain commodities the public have to buy which are dear by reason of their association with certain districts in the country rather than with others?  Are there not some things the cost of which could be lessened if more efficient methods were employed for their production and distribution? These are times when, by reason of the enormous costs affecting industry and commerce, we see certain charges falling upon the State.  They will continue to fall upon it, so that one must say there seem to be very few chances of improving the national income.  In view of that, surely the best thing to do would be to see what could be done to lessen costs.</P>
    <P>There are some 70 State services. Surely it ought to be possible for the Minister to insist upon savings in some of them.  Let us, for example take the Oireachtas.  We ought to set the example ourselves.  There are two Houses in the Oireachtas.  I do not know whether it would be possible to reduce the allowances made to the members of both Houses by some £60 or £50 a year&mdash;to give evidence at any rate of our appreciation of the difficulties of the time.  The sum I have mentioned is a negligible one.  Sometimes, <Col N="337" /> when one hears criticism of what is paid to members of the Oireachtas, one wonders if the people who make it ever look at any other item of State expenditure. At any rate, by reason of the activities of the different political Parties over the last 15 or 20 years, it is thought by the public outside that this is a matter of more importance than it really is.  To do what I have suggested would give evidence of our good faith.  I do not think it is necessary for members in any part of the House to suggest alternative methods of raising taxation to the Minister.  He has very good advisers.  If he were to hear of any suggestions of the kind it would be a temptation to him to add them to his list.  There seems to be no prospect whatever that these matters will be reconsidered when the war is over.</P>
    <P>This Budget is not by any means a satisfactory one.  The portion of it to which Deputy Norton made reference in the concluding part of his speech might, I think, have been left over by the Minister for another occasion.  If it seemed wise to the Government to introduce a new order scheduling quite a number of occupations in which no increase in wages can be paid, a matter of that sort ought, I think, be considered by the House on a special motion brought in by the Government.  When power was given to the Government to make these orders it was not intended that an order of such a drastic nature as this should be made except on a motion brought formally before the House.  If the Government can make a case for that, the House ought to hear it patiently and give it their due consideration. It is unwise to dismiss it with a few pages of comments, as has been done in this House.  It is scarcely the province of the Minister for Finance, in the course of his Budget speech, to do it.  It is disconcerting that it should come in at a time such as this, as it should not be associated with the Budget at all.  We are prepared to listen to the case that is to be made in respect of it.  The Ministry has not got my confidence by any means, but that would not prevent me from giving the most careful consideration <Col N="338" /> to whatever is in the mind of the Government&mdash;with all the information at their disposal&mdash;in making such an order as this.</P>
    <P>We have referred to the Ministry&rsquo;s own shortcomings before with respect to the difficulties confronting the country.  Unemployment is one of our problems and it has always been.  It is intensified now.  The difficulties of the situation are enhanced by reason of the shortage of commodities, imported supplies, and so forth.  While the Government has responsibility in that connection and while it is unequal to its responsibility it certainly should now take counsel to see what possible remedies can be effected, to see how it is possible to stimulate employment.  One of the first steps to that end is to reduce the national expenditure.  They would obtain much more cordial co-operation from others if they themselves showed they were really in earnest in cutting the cloth according to the measure and according to the capacity of the people to pay the bill.</P>

      <P>If the financial position of the people of this country is to be measured by the demands being made upon them to provide increased expenditure for the maintenance of our Defence Forces, and if the sums raised for that purpose are considered to be reasonable and fair for the purchase of weapons of destruction and machinery for defence, then the people of the country are in a fairly sound financial position.  If the wealth of the people, on the other hand, is to be measured by the increased amount of money that is being put into the banks of the country on deposit during the past year, then the people are in a far better position than some of the Deputies and people outside the House would like to say they are.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the year ending 31st December, 1940, there was an increase in the amount of deposits in the banks by no less than £10,780,253.  I am not one of the people who think that the increase in the deposits in our banks is any indication whatsoever of the prosperity of our people.  I cannot see why, in these times of poverty, destitution, and increasing unemployment, the money that <Col N="339" /> is in the banks cannot be used for productive purposes.  It is alarming to find that, while the amount of money being put into our banks on deposit is increasing, the number of destitute poor and the number of unemployed are increasing at the same time.  The members of this Fianna Fáil Government have proved themselves to the people of the country to be a very good pack of Party politicians, but their administration over a period of ten years&mdash;taken in conjunction with the promises they made before they took up office&mdash;proves that they are not a very competent body of Departmental administrators.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to refer to the criticism that has been poured out on the Government by Deputy Norton and other speakers, but there is no doubt that numerous quotations can be given from the records of this House&mdash;both before and after this Government came into office&mdash;to prove to those who desire proof that the Government have not made any attempt to honour promises which they made with regard to the solution of the problem of unemployment and other problems which they foresaw before they took office.</P>
    <P>This Budget itself appears to take no notice whatsoever of the problems that will arise out of the war and after the war and after the emergency has passed&mdash;if we have, with the help of God, the good fortune to escape being dragged into the war itself.  The problem of unemployment has been solved in part by a number of accidents, as a result of the emergency. The Minister for Finance knows better than the majority of the members of this House the number of additional recruits brought into the Army as a direct result of the emergency, and knows also that, were it not for the large increase in the personnel of our Army, the people who have been called into it would otherwise have been added to the number of our unemployed people.</P>
    <P>As pointed out by Deputy Norton&mdash; and the Minister is, no doubt, also aware of this&mdash;large numbers of our citizens who were unable to find work <Col N="340" /> in this country have been recruited, especially in recent times, for work outside the country.  That drain upon the population of our craftsmen and unskilled labourers is going on up to the moment, and that can be checked up by the Minister for Finance through the Departmental agencies responsible for supplying lists of men who were prepared to take up work outside this country.  If the Minister or his colleagues wish to check up on the figures, they also can get fairly accurate figures from the secretaries of trade unions in this city and other cities, and from some of the industrial people who have been asked to furnish names of large numbers of persons who would be willing to take up jobs on reconstruction work carried on outside this country.  These two agencies &mdash;the increase in the Army at home and the large number of people who have taken up civilian jobs outside&mdash;have helped to reduce the number of persons who would otherwise be unemployed. To that extent, the Government is fortunate to be able to find berths for thousands of people who would have to rely on the payment of unemployment assistance, poor law relief or unemployment insurance.</P>
    <P>The Budget does not make any provision&mdash;and I am not aware and, I daresay, nobody outside the Government is aware, of any plan which the Government have in mind&mdash;for dealing with the situation which would arise as a result of the termination of the emergency.  I take it, and it must be taken for granted by the people of this country, that if the emergency situation disappeared to-morrow thousands of men would have to be demobilised from our Army.  Where are these thousands to find work or maintenance if and when that situation arises?  We are told, of course, that the national drive for the production of more turf will give employment to every civilian in this country who is willing to undertake such work.  I hope that is so. It should be done and I believe it can be done, if there is some better organisation at the head of the Government for giving general directions as to how every unemployed person and every person willing to undertake the production <Col N="341" /> of more peat can be usefully employed on that very necessary national work.  The Head of the Government and his colleagues have appealed to the people as a whole to produce three times more turf this year than was produced in any previous period, and the Government has the full and unqualified support of every member of this House and every patriotic citizen of the State in the drive for the production of more turf, in order, in the coming winter, to try to provide sufficient native fuel for the people who cannot get imported coal.  I hope the Government and all who agree with them in that matter will get the response to which they are entitled, but I have certain very grave doubts that, without a central organisation giving directions from the Head of the Government, the unemployed population in the country will be used in the proper way for that purpose.</P>
    <P>Most of the turf that has been produced in the turf-cutting areas during the past few years has been produced by family labour, by the labour of the farmer and his family, who cut turf for their own domestic purposes.  I suggest to the Minister that you cannot increase by more than 50 or 60 per cent. the turf produced by family labour, because the people who produced turf by family labour during the past few years in and around the bogs that are available for that purpose in the country will have to look after their own farms, the production of beet, wheat and potatoes and other crops that will have to be produced in increasing quantities.  If you want that type of person to produce all the increased turf which is required by the population as a whole, then it means that you expect they will ignore the needs of their own farms at a time when they should be giving much more attention to their farming activities than they gave to that kind of work in the past.  If the increased turf which is required for the nation is going to be produced in this country during the three, four or five months ahead of us, it will have to be produced by men who were previously unemployed and who want a weekly wage in order to maintain themselves and <Col N="342" /> their families.  I want to know from the Minister whether that aspect of the matter has been carefully looked into and whether we have or will have agencies established in this country in the immediate future which will give employment on turf production to the person who needs a weekly wage to maintain himself and his dependents. That can only be done by central direction, by Governmental assistance and by financial assistance where necessary, or by the direction of the Government, by the local authorities with the machinery which the Government should place at their disposal for that necessary and very urgent purpose.</P>
    <P>The members of this Party believe that the only body that is capable of doing the work that requires to be done in the interests of the people is the Turf Development Board or some other body of that kind.  If it is going to be left to the goodwill of the individual farmer who has to look after his farm, or even the parish council or, in some cases, the county council, these people will only produce what is needed for the people of the locality and will pay very little attention to the requirements of bodies such as the Irish Coal Importers&rsquo; Association or other agencies that may be looking for turf for distribution in the coming winter to those who live in towns, and especially those who live in the cities.</P>
    <P>I listened to the address that was given recently by the Taoiseach in this matter and I have read all the addresses he delivered on the same subject.  I heard him in my own constituency delivering threats to the farmers of my constituency that if they did not produce more food in the country the Government would take ruthless action against those who would not come up to the Government&rsquo;s requirements in this matter. When he was delivering that ultimatum on Saturday week last, he was addressing the representatives of parish councils of two counties in this country that are at the head of the list so far as tillage is concerned.  If he took the two counties of Leix and Offaly and some of the adjoining counties he would find that even before the present year, they were tilling more than is <Col N="343" /> required by the Minister for Agriculture under the terms of the Compulsory Tillage Order.  I do not know why people of that kind should have to listen to threats.  These threats should be delivered to people in other areas where they have not come up to scratch in connection with this particular matter.</P>
    <P>However, when I heard the Head of the Government delivering these threats and telling farmers that if they did not till more land and produce more beet, wheat, barley, potatoes, oats and everything else of that kind, I, like Deputy Norton, was wondering why it is that none of these threats is being delivered to the people who make so much out of the activities of the farming community.  The farmers were being threatened in these speeches that if they did not produce more eggs, more butter and more of the essential commodities that are required, their land would be taken from them and that prohibitive fines would have to be imposed, but nothing whatever was said about the people who are engaged in the distribution of these commodities and who are, in some cases, making 100 per cent. profit on what they secure from the farmers as a result of their labour.</P>

      <P>I am very sorry to say I cannot agree with the Minister for Finance on that matter.  Only a week ago I drew the attention of his colleague, the Minister for Agriculture&mdash; and I produce the official records of the House to prove it&mdash;to public advertisements that were being issued in the public Press.  Up to this week, in spite of what the Minister has been doing or says he has been doing, mangold seed, which has been short in all the towns in my constituency, is being advertised publicly for sale at the rate of 5/- per lb.  The Minister for Finance, with his knowledge of the conditions in the tillage areas&mdash;and I know he has intimate knowledge of what is going on in some of the tillage counties&mdash;would surely not suggest that 5/- per lb., in <Col N="344" /> present circumstances, is a reasonable price to pay for mangold seed.  I suggested to one of my friends who was looking for mangold seed and who was unable to secure a supply in his own area, that he should reply to one of these advertisements.  The gentleman who inserted the advertisements was a Dublin bookmaker, who was selling mangold seed at 5/- which he probably smuggled over the Border at 2/- or not more than 2/6 per lb.</P>
      <P>I reported a case to-day to the Minister for Supplies&mdash;because I have raised the matter several times in this House, both by question and in discussions&mdash;of an individual who was selling tea yesterday and the day before at 5d. an ounce.  Does the Minister for Finance consider that that is a reasonable price to charge for tea, or that it is right to sell that tea to individuals without asking them to produce a ration card?  That is not an isolated case.  We have many of those cases. When the Head of the Government was addressing the parish councils in Tullamore last Saturday week, and making threats as to what would happen if more food was not produced, I made inquiries as to the price given in Tullamore for eggs.  Fresh eggs were being sold in the urban area of Tullamore on Saturday week at 1/4 per dozen.  When I came back here to Dublin I discovered from certain family friends that in the area where I reside they were being charged 2/9 per dozen on the same day, and not less than 2/6, as far as I could see, was being charged in any of the retail shops in the City of Dublin.  While 1/4 was being charged in Tullamore, 2/6 and 2/9 was being charged in Dublin for eggs not as good as those which were being sold in Tullamore.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Have the Minister for Finance and his colleagues considered what is going on even at the moment in connection with the price of turf in the City of Dublin?  On a recent occasion, being a member of the parish council in the area where I reside, I was asked to interest myself in getting a supply of turf for the people of the parish, including the parish priest in that area.  I wrote to the manager of the Turraun Peat Works, asking if he could give a <Col N="345" /> quotation for a supply of turf to be brought to Dublin by canal, which is the best means of getting turf from Turraun to Dublin, and asking him to state what the charge would be on canal at the nearest point to the Turraun works where the turf was being produced; also whether it would be carriage paid or to pay, and in either case what was the cost of carriage to Dublin Grand Canal Street harbour.  I was given a quotation of 19/2 on boat for a 40-ton load at Turraun, and 10/7 per ton carriage to Dublin; that is 29/9 per ton, which in my opinion is a very reasonable price for turf, which is of the very finest quality, delivered at Dublin.  I understand that the council in a parish adjoining mine asked for a quotation from another area in the County Kildare, and were quoted 62/6 per ton, delivered, I admit, to the Blackrock area.  Now, there is something radically wrong there.</P>

The bog from which the turf was to be supplied to the other people was a bog in County Kildare, which is nearer to Dublin than Turraun.  If we even allow that 7/6, or 10/- at the very most&mdash;and that is an excessive figure in my opinion&mdash;would be a reasonable charge for delivery at Blackrock or some parts of that area of County Dublin, there is still in my opinion an unreasonable amount to be accounted for.</P>

      <P>Some time ago in this House&mdash;I will give the reference if necessary&mdash;I put down a question asking the Minister for Supplies how many cases of complaints of excessive prices were received by his Department for the year ended 31st December, 1940; in how many of the cases in which complaints were made legal proceedings were instituted, and in how many cases convictions were secured.  He informed me that 585 complaints were received in his Department during the year alleging that excessive prices were charged for different commodities. There were four prosecutions and three convictions.  I do not remember reading in the paper the report of any of those prosecutions, but I accept the Minister&rsquo;s figures.  I think it is alarming to find that out of 585 complaints there were only four prosecutions and three convictions.  Might I suggest to the Minister and his colleagues that, if they are going to remove from the public mind the impression which is there&mdash;it is in the mind of almost everybody&mdash;that profiteering is going on unchecked in this country at the present time, when they do bring cases into the courts, which they believe they are justified in bringing to the courts, they should advise the censor to put his blue pencil in his breast pocket, and let those people who are profiteering get the full benefit of the publicity in the papers, in other words, make an example of them.</P>

After careful consideration with other people who have discussed the matter with organisations or representatives of organisations quite recently, and having some knowledge myself of what goes <Col N="347" /> on in those turf-cutting areas, I suggest that, if the Government want to prevent profiteering in connection with the price of turf to be sold to the people in the City of Dublin and other cities during this year, they will do their best, make a decent attempt at any rate, to fix the price of turf at the bog, or at some central dump as near as possible to the bog where the turf is produced.  I am making that suggestion to the Minister, and I am sure he will give it some consideration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been considered; therefore, I will put the other question to the Deputy.  Supposing the people who, normally, cut the turf, make up their minds that they will not cut turf at the price we fix, what remedy has the Deputy to suggest?</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very glad to be able to tell the Minister that the commissioner who administers the affairs of Leix and Westmeath started off, and rightly so, by fixing a price of 5/- per perch; in other words, agreeing to pay the landlord or bog owner 5/- per perch, and is giving the Minister for Industry and Commerce and his colleagues a good foundation upon which they can fix a reasonable price to be paid by the coal importers of Dublin or by other users for turf produced on the bogs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Cannot the Deputy see that the problem is not the same? He is talking about turf in Kildare, where the turf banks are owned by small men&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggested before the Minister came into the House that he is not going to get a big increase in the production of turf from the people who have farms, and who previously produced turf by their family labour, because the farmer who produced turf previously by his family labour, and who is still the owner of a farm in areas <Col N="348" /> which I know, where there is increased production of other commodities on his farm, will have to look after his farm, and cannot give up farming activities for the next three or four months.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not going to refuse to give an answer to any straight question on this matter which the Minister puts to me.  I hope I am not wasting his time in asking him to listen to my suggestions.  I do not want, and I am sure the Minister does not want, to see an excessive price charged for turf to the poor people of Dublin during the coming winter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>The relationship, as far as I can see, between the best turf and coal is two to one.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>We want to see the turf produced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>And the Minister can have my assurance of the wholehearted support of everybody sitting on these benches, and of everybody on whom we can exercise any influence, in getting the greatest possible amount of turf produced this year, and I do suggest to his colleague, the Minister for Finance, that if that is to be done there must be some central controlling organisation.  In order to get the turf cut as quickly as possible, we will have to organise the unemployed in this country, the men who want a weekly wage to maintain themselves and their families, and put them under the charge of somebody who will employ them on the cutting of more turf.</P>
      <P>I move to report progress.</P>
      <P>Progress reported.  The Committee to sit again on Wednesday, 14th May.</P>
      <P>The Dáil adjourned at 10.30 p.m. until 3 p.m. on Wednesday, 14th May, 1941.</P>
