    <P>(a)  The figures shown represent the number of officers serving in a substantive capacity in the grades on the first working day of the calendar year.</P>
    <P>(b)  The figures given for the grade of Assistant Principal are not strictly <Col N="3" /> comparable from year to year for the reason that a number of posts formerly designated by various other titles were subsequently renamed Assistant Principal posts in the course of Departmental reorganisations extending over a number of years.  Only those posts designated as Assistant Principal on the relevant dates have been included in the statement as after the lapse of years the identification of the several renamed posts is not practicable.</P>
    <P>(c)  Cadets serving in the Department of External Affairs who are on the same scale of pay as Junior Administrative Officers are included under this heading.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonnONeill" hpid="Mr. O'Neill Mr. O'Neill">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Neill</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if it is the intention of the Government to introduce during the present session legislation dealing with (1)  the setting up of a central bank as already indicated, and (2) the financial problems that will arise out of the inflation of the pound sterling as a war aftermath.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of setting up a central bank is under active consideration by the Government and legislation is at present being drafted on the subject.  It is too early yet to say when such legislation <Col N="4" /> will be introduced, but there will be no avoidable delay.  As regards the second part of the question, financial problems of the nature referred to by the Deputy are kept under constant observation, but in view of the many uncertain factors in the post-war situation, I do not see any basis on which we could at present frame legislation.  It is not to be assumed, as the Deputy apparently does assume, that inflationary forces are not at work here on a scale somewhat comparable to that in Great Britain.</P>

      <P>I will deal together with questions numbered 10, 11, 12, 14, 15 and 16. Particulars of the numbers of tons of turf cut and saved by each county council, estimated on the basis that ten cubic yards of raw turf are equivalent to one ton of dry turf, will be issued in tabular form with the printed report.  These estimates are the best available, but must be treated with some reserve, more particularly in cases where large quantities of turf were obtained by contract, and where the calculation of the tonnage figure will not give the correct relative results.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The compilation of the other statistical information asked for by the Deputies, on the assumption that the necessary datum is available, and in many cases it is not, would require a considerable amount of the time of the staff who are engaged on the urgent and immediate task of making provision for fuel supplies for the non-turf areas; and I am not in a position to take them from this work.  A statement <Col N="11" /> setting forth the general position in regard to the supply of turf to the non-turf areas will be made immediately after questions, and this will cover such matters referred to in the Deputies' questions as I am in a position to deal with at present.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Supplies whether he is aware that hundreds of householders are unable to secure supplies of paraffin oil because they are stated not to have registered in time; and whether he will direct the reopening of the paraffin register so that those not so far included may in future be given supplies, within the limit of the total quantity available for distribution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware that householders are unable to obtain supplies of paraffin oil because they are stated not to have registered in time. A domestic consumer of paraffin, who is entitled under the regulations to a supply, but who has not yet registered with a licensed retailer, can effect his registration with such retailer at any time.  Domestic users were advised by public advertisement on the 15th September to take immediate steps to register with their normal retailers and were warned that supplies might not be available for any domestic user during October who had not registered by the 30th September.  Whilst every effort will be made to secure an equitable distribution of paraffin oil amongst domestic users generally, I cannot give an undertaking that supplies will be available for users who have not taken steps to secure registration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that thousands of householders in this country notified their retail suppliers of paraffin oil that they wanted to get their monthly gallon from them; that those retailers forwarded to the Department of Industry and Commerce a statement of the number of persons who had registered with them, with the request that they should get a licence to purchase the appropriate gallonage of oil; that those retailers were then requested to give the name and address of each of the persons who had registered with them; that, by the time the Department had made up its mind that it wanted that information, 1st October had come and gone, whereupon the Department said: &ldquo;Seeing that you, the shopkeeper, were late in <Col N="16" /> effecting a registration, we will authorise you to purchase 20 per cent. of the paraffin that you purchased in 1940&rdquo;, with the result that the majority of paraffin retailers in this country, instead of having a gallon for each of their customers, had about half a pint; that a large part of the rural population of this country have, for the last month, been sitting in the dark, and that in one case at least a woman was delivered of her baby by the lights from the head-lamps of the doctor's car, which were projected through the window of the kitchen, where she had been carried, because there was no paraffin oil?  That is a gross scandal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy asked me whether I am aware that supplies of paraffin oil are not available to householders because they had not registered in time, and whether I would direct the reopening of the paraffin register so that those who had not registered could now do so.  If the Deputy knew the regulations he would know that there is no limit to the time wherein a householder can effect a registration.  He can do it at any time, and no householder failed to get paraffin oil because of any such regulation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Wait a minute.  Will the Minister now say that paraffin was issued to the retailers in sufficient quantity to give their retail customers the gallon that he promised them?  I know that it was not.  Will he guarantee now that, in the future, his Department will see that there is delivered to each retailer a gallon of oil for every person registered with him, and that the people will be able to get it?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy obviously did not read or understand his own question.  He has now asked another question which I shall answer.

      <P>There was obviously something wrong, as the Deputy aptly remarks.  From the information supplied by the retailers who had effected registration up to the middle of October, it was quite obvious that the number of persons supposed to have registered as consumers of paraffin and who were entitled to a supply&mdash;that is persons occupying households which were not equipped to receive a supply of gas or electric light&mdash;was about twice the total number in the whole country according to the census.</P>

She did not happen apparently to see these notices in the Press, with the result that I, and everybody like me, have been deprived of our quota of paraffin oil.  I am telling you what I have received for the months of September and October&mdash;one quart and no hope of getting any more.

      <P>They are also published in all the daily papers.  Therefore every available means is used to bring them to the attention of the public.  I suggest that members of the public who are interested in these matters have an obligation to acquaint themselves with the regulations and to see that they are enforced if they want to get the benefit of the regulations.  On many occasions during the course of the year we discussed the practicability of devising a ration scheme for paraffin oil, and I continually expressed the opinion that it was going to be a very difficult matter to issue the limited quantity of oil available to those who really required it and to exclude householders who did not require it.  I want to repeat that it is not possible for the Department to do that unless we get wholehearted co-operation from retailers.  That wholehearted co-operation was not given to us generally in September and, consequently, a number of people did not get their quota.  I expect the position will have improved by November. In any case where there is a breakdown, it will be entirely due to the fact that the retailer concerned has not made himself aware of, or has not been willing to conform to the regulations.</P>

I am sure they did not get the amount they applied for, because they usually exaggerate the amount they require.

      <P>asked the Minister for Supplies if the allocation of sugar to retailers has now been amended to permit of each person receiving 1 lb. per week and, if not, when this will be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the Emergency Powers (Sugar) Order, 1941, each licensed sugar retailer is entitled to receive deliveries of sugar at the rate of 80 per cent. of his 1940 purchases. These deliveries should suffice to enable each such retailer to provide the ration at the prescribed rate of 1 lb. weekly per person to every householder who was a regular customer for sugar during the year 1940 and I see no reason to increase the allocation.</P>
      <P>Since the introduction of the sugar rationing scheme cases have come to notice where householders have been unable to obtain their full ration.  The difficulties in these cases arise mainly from the fact that many householders did not register for sugar with their usual suppliers, as they were advised to do in the public notices issued by my Department.  Steps are being taken to deal with the cases of difficulty, but these cannot be entirely removed unless the householders will change their registration to the traders from whom they ordinarily bought sugar.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister not realise that the whole system of the distribution of sugar is ridiculous?  The Minister said that it is distributed on the basis of 80 per cent. of last year's purchases.  Surely a very much simpler method would be to ascertain the number of persons registered with each retailer and to see that that retailer received one lb. per person.  That seems the rational thing and it has occurred to everybody in the country except the Minister.  The position is that many persons do not buy consistently in one shop, for one reason or another.  Now they have to buy in one shop.  It is ridiculous to send round a circular, such as was recently sent to the retailers, to say that they should more or less chase their customers away and tell them to go somewhere else.  I think the Minister should give the matter more consideration.</P>

He received 80 per cent. of his sugar less what the Sugar Company said he drew in excess in the months of April, March and February.  Half the retailers were not getting as much as 80 per cent., but only 40 per cent.  It is not good enough to kick the shopkeeper to conceal the Minister's inefficiency.</P>

      <P>As I have indicated on previous occasions to the House, I am not prepared to answer questions of <Col N="38" /> detail about the administration of Irish Shipping, Limited.  The company was established for the express purpose of endeavouring to provide shipping facilities for the importation of essential supplies from overseas to this country.  I also told the House quite frankly that ships cannot now be bought on a basis which could in normal times be justified by any commercial criterion; and the difficulties are even greater to-day than they were when I made that statement.  I think it is not unreasonable to ask Deputies to wait until this company has been in operation for at least a year before attempting to form any judgment on its activities.</P>
      <P>As regards the &ldquo;Irish Hazel&rdquo;, I may say that the company purchased this vessel with the knowledge that she would require extensive repairs, and this fact was allowed for in the purchase price.  It has not yet been found possible to have the repairs put in hand because of pressure of work in the Liffey Dockyard and the vessel has not yet, therefore, been put into service.</P>

      <P>I understand that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance desires to make a statement giving a fuller reply to some questions addressed to him regarding turf.  For that statement to be made consent of the House is necessary.</P>

      <P>Is it proposed to deal with that matter before the House deals with the question of the Order of Business, because so far as this side of the House is concerned we would strenuously object to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance making a statement on turf and fuel without affording the House an opportunity of discussing that statement? If it would suit the convenience of the Government that time should be provided to-day or to-morrow for a discussion on fuel, paraffin oil, etc., we would be glad to meet the Government in regard to the time chosen for that discussion, but we would object most strenuously to an <i>ex parte</i> statement on the part of the Government without any opportunity being given to Deputies who have come up from the country for the purpose of discussing that question with a view to having any existing evils abated.</P>

      <P>The Deputy, like other Deputies, is aware of the fact that all Dáil business originates in a motion.  No motion has been submitted regarding peat fuel.  If objection be taken to a statement being made by the Parliamentary Secretary in the manner in which he purports to make it, that ends the matter.  Possibly on a motion for the adjournment such a statement might be debated if the Parliamentary Secretary and the Government so desired, and if the Opposition Parties are agreeable.</P>

      <P>The question of the provision of fuel is a very vital matter in present circumstances.  The Parliamentary Secretary apparently proposes to make a fairly lengthy statement.  It is, therefore, desirable that an opportunity should be afforded to the members of the House to discuss that <Col N="83" /> statement.  Will the Government agree to allocate some time this evening or to-morrow, so that members of the House may have an opportunity of discussing any statement which the Parliamentary Secretary makes?  It is essential that there should be some discussion of his statement.</P>

      <P>I do not think the House has any objection to the Parliamentary Secretary making any statement he likes.  In fact I think the House would welcome a statement, but what has been put to the Government is that this matter is so urgent&mdash;it is of such paramount importance&mdash;that an opportunity should be provided not only for the House to listen to the Parliamentary Secretary, but that the Parliamentary Secretary and the Government should have an opportunity of listening to the representatives of the people: that they should have an opportunity of having the people's views put before them in regard to the whole fuel situation.  In view of the fact that we have been told that there will be comparatively little public business before the House this week, this matter is surely of sufficient importance and urgency to merit time being provided for a full discussion on it.</P>

      <P>There is only one way of having these matters arranged, and that is prior to a sitting of the House.  Every effort was made yesterday to secure the best possible means of discussing the number of questions addressed to the Parliamentary Secretary in relation to turf. We felt that the best means of doing that was to have a full statement from the Parliamentary Secretary covering all the questions that were put down, and of dealing, in fact, with the whole general position in relation to turf. That suggestion was conveyed by me to Deputy Mulcahy and Deputy Norton. After some discussion with the former Deputy I agreed not alone to that course but to allow those who had questions on the Order Paper to ask any supplementaries that they might <Col N="84" /> decide to ask in order to secure a further elucidation of any point that might be obscure.  I felt assured that I had got agreement on that&mdash;that I had secured the agreement of those with whom I could get in contact to that course.  Now it seems as if nothing can be agreed on through that channel which is the only channel we have for arranging these matters.  Why must we have, irrespective of any discussions that take place beforehand between the Whips of the Parties, a full dress discussion on matters that can be discussed and agreed upon in the ordinary normal proper course?</P>

      <P>I do not quite understand the Parliamentary Secretary. I would like to protest against the suggestion that there is no chance of doing business between himself and myself.  When it was conveyed to me yesterday that the Parliamentary Secretary was going to make a statement I raised the question of a possible debate on it.  The Parliamentary Secretary says I agreed.  I, at any rate, said that I would have an opportunity of consulting with my people last night, and would discuss the matter again with them this morning. After consultation last night with some of my people, I informed the Parliamentary Secretary this morning that we wanted a discussion on turf, and that we would also invite a statement from the Minister for Supplies on kerosene and flour with a view to discussing it.  The Parliamentary Secretary did not agree with that, but it was put quite formally to him about a quarter to eleven this morning that we wanted to debate the Parliamentary Secretary's statement.  I stated the previous day that I would &ldquo;contact&rdquo; him and let him know our position. That was put to him again at 12.15 to-day, so that it is unreasonable to suggest that we cannot be clear as to what we want.  If the complaint is that a motion should have been put down in order to get the matter discussed, that is another question.  The number of questions on the Order Paper to-day dealing with this matter is a suggestion to the Government that the adjournment should be moved for <Col N="85" /> the purpose of having a debate at this stage.  I rose simply to say that it was made perfectly clear that we desired a debate on the statement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Mulcahy is fully conversant with the means available to members of the House to secure a full-dress debate on any particular matter.  Here, it was a question of the number of queries on the Order Paper dealing with this subject.  I made a suggestion to the Deputy as to what seemed to me to be the best means of having these questions disposed of.  If he was not satisfied with the method I suggested, he should have said: &ldquo;We do not think that is the best method; let them be disposed of in the ordinary way.&rdquo;  If he wanted a full-dress debate on the turf position, he and the members of his Party know that a motion could be put down and that the Government could be asked to give time for discussion of it.  If that course had been taken, we should have to try to facilitate them if we regarded the matter as one of urgency.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

      <P>When it was indicated to-day that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance would make a statement in reply to these questions, I assumed that that statement would be debated.  Apparently, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach wants the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance to have an opportunity of making a speech and Opposition Deputies to be allowed only to ask questions regarding the speech.  Why should we be prevented from discussing fuel supplies? It is obviously essential that we should discuss them.  The question of fuel supplies is much more urgent than some of the Bills we are to be asked to deal with to-day.  Let us have some time to discuss fuel supplies and nothing but good will come of the discussion.  Let the people know what the fuel position is.  Let the Government tell us what that position is and let us tell them what the views of the people are.</P>

      <P>This is a matter which might be arranged in the usual way.  It is clear that no debate can follow a statement by a Parliamentary Secretary or a Minister unless there is a motion before the House. It is the practice here and elsewhere that, by permission of the House, a Minister may make a statement not to be debated.  If a debate on turf fuel is desired, other steps should be taken.</P>

      <P>The question might be debated on the motion for the adjournment, as I originally suggested. The position, however, is this.  There were several questions on the Paper about turf to which the Parliamentary Secretary desired to give a comprehensive reply.

      <P>The easiest way out of the difficulty is, I think, to take the statement from the Parliamentary Secretary as if it were a comprehensive reply, as I understand it was intended to be, to a number of questions.  If there is a desire on the part of the House to have the whole question fully <Col N="87" /> discussed, there will be no objection to giving time.  The arrangement the Parliamentary Secretary thought he had made did not contemplate a discussion. The statement can be taken now, and the only question will be whether a discussion should take place to-night or to-morrow.  If that question is left over we shall be able to settle it.</P>

      <P>My object was to give the House any information it required in a form which would be better than that of answers to questions, with the limitations that that method imposes.  Many of the questions on the Order Paper to-day would require a very considerable amount of research and a lot of detailed information, very little of which would, in fact, contribute, in my opinion, any benefit at the present time in relation to this emergency.  It might be of historical or other informational value, but most of it was not going to add a ton of turf to the supplies or provide material for one coal fire.  My attitude was that these questions were intended to be an expression of the desire of the House for information in relation to the position, and that Deputies would like to get obscurities and difficulties cleared up by the answers to these questions.  My object is to give the House such information as is in my possession which seems to be significant in the present position.  The House has, in relation to this whole matter, adopted an attitude which is both reasonable and helpful, and I feel that I am bound to meet the House in that spirit, and to be as helpful and co-operative as I possibly can.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first question in people's minds is: what amount of turf has been cut, and where has it been cut?  I shall circulate in the Official Report the actual <Col N="88" /> figures, but I shall give them now, in summary, to the House, so that Deputies may have them as a background to this statement.</P>
    <P>We do not yet know the amount of turf cut by the general community.  At the present moment a census is being taken to find out what the ordinary people have cut, but how far that is going to give a satisfactory return I am not yet in a position to say.  What I am in a position to tell is the amount of turf which has been cut as national turf by county surveyors under instructions from the Government.  The total amount cut by them, taking as an estimate ten cubic yards of raw turf to one finished ton of dry turf, is 1,000,000 tons.  I am giving round figures. Carlow cut 3,000 tons; Cavan, 10,000 tons.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>It might clear up our difficulty if the Parliamentary Secretary, instead of reading out a long litany of figures, which may be useful to Deputies who want to participate in a debate which may take place later, could assure us that we could get this information in some kind of statistical form to enable us to debate them intelligently. There is no use in reading out figures now.  Could the Parliamentary Secretary make some effort to give them in tabular form so that we might have them to-day or to-morrow?</P>

      <P>Yes.  These are the figures in tons from the county surveyors: Carlow, 3,000; Cavan, 10,000; Clare, 50,000; Cork, 50,000; Donegal, 240,000; Dublin, 2,500; Galway, 130,000; Kerry, 121,000; Kildare, 12,000; Kilkenny 4,500; Laoighis, 17,500; Leitrim about 8,000; Limerick, 32,000; Longford, 25,000; Louth, 2,000; Mayo, 74,000;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="89" /> Meath, 14,000; Monaghan, 22,000; Offaly, 10,000; Roscommon, 37,000; Sligo, 32,000; Tipperary, North and South, 52,000; Waterford, 6,500; Westmeath, 24,500; Wexford, 700; Wicklow, 12,600.  Of the 1,000,000 tons, about 700,000 are now saved and stacked on the sides of the roads or distributed.  About 150,000 tons have been distributed by county surveyors to the local authorities, to hospitals and the like, for consumption.  The total amount expended by county surveyors up to the last date that I have was £825,000.  As the House is aware the country is divided into two areas, one a turf area, and the other a non-turf area.  I have a map which will illustrate the position to the House. The large dark portion represents that part of the State which is at present a turf area.  Deputies will notice that it covers practically the whole of the centre and the west of the country, leaving a fringe all the way up the east coast.  Inside that area, by means of over 2,000 petrol lorries, somewhere about 900,000 tons of turf have been already distributed, and from my observation going around I should say that even more has been distributed by horse transport.</P>
    <P>It is certainly true to say that there has never been in the history of this country a time when more turf has been put into circulation.  As far as that turf area goes it covers nearly three-quarters of the total area of the State and about one half of its population. What is significant and what we have to deal with is the relation of that one half of the population to three-quarters of the area of the State, and we may take it that the fuel prospects of this year, due to the provision by providence of turf, are practically secure.  There may be odd spots of population who still may have difficulty, but within the whole of the brown area, representing three-quarters of the State, I think we may safely regard the position as moderately comfortable and secure.</P>
    <P>There are two areas which are at present outside the turf area, Meath and part of Limerick, the incorporation <Col N="90" /> of which in this area is in contemplation. It is considered that their immediate problems for this year can probably be better solved by depending upon their hinterland of turf areas than under the present system.  They are both short of their total requirements of fuel, but it is hoped and believed that if they are incorporated in the turf area, with the breaking down of barriers which surround them, that that will enable the position to be put right.  It is certainly anticipated that next year these areas, Limerick and Meath, may safely be included in the turf area and regarded as places which ought not to cause us anxiety.  The actual position in relation to employment under county surveyors, which as Deputies know went to about 35,000, with an average of something about 30,000 for the main part of the campaign is that employment has rapidly dropped, and is now somewhere about 8,500 men, while there are a couple of thousand men in addition engaged upon works of development.  The sum of £172,000 has been spent this year on works of development in relation to the production of the turf of this year and in preparation for the larger production during next year.  So much for the turf areas.</P>
    <P>There remains the problem of Dublin, Cork, Louth, Wexford, Wicklow, Waterford and Kilkenny.  I hope that next year we may be able to provide some form of camps or some arrangement by which this area will be able to draw from its neighbours and be incorporated in that portion of the country which will be more or less self-dependent. One of the reasons why I read out the statement for you, and one of the reasons why the tabular statement which Deputy Norton asked for will be valuable and important in the debate, lies in the information it gives as to the acute disparities in distribution of the areas of supply of turf relative to the areas in which turf is required. Donegal, Mayo, Galway, Clare and Kerry, right round this fringe of the country-those five counties&mdash; contain between them 65 per cent. of the total amount of turf cut by the county surveyors.  A very much larger <Col N="91" /> proportion than 65 per cent. of the amount of turf which could be regarded as surplus to the areas in which it was cut&mdash;it might go up to 80 per cent. of the total amount of turf which could possibly be used outside its own area&mdash; is in these extreme western points, the furthest possible points from the places at which we wanted to get it.</P>
    <P>That summarises for you the actual problem of turf distribution in this year and the next.  As you are aware, there is turf over this whole area, right up to within 15 miles of the City of Dublin, up in the Wicklow mountains, and then right out into Kildare, Leix-Offaly, and the rest.  The natural feeling is that that is where we ought to go to look for the turf and that it should be possible to bring it in from there. Roscommon, Leix-Offaly, Westmeath and Kildare combined have not cut 10 per cent. of the total amount which was cut by the county surveyors this year&mdash;and the county surveyors' cutting of turf is typical of the position. In other words, when it is a question of getting a large quantity for the eastern counties&mdash;and especially for Dublin&mdash;you have to look right to the extreme end, and you can place practically no reliance even upon those excellent turf areas which are near at hand.  The one represents nominally 65 per cent. and the other 10 per cent. I believe, as far as surplus turf is concerned, the one would represent 100 per cent. and the other 5 per cent. or 6 per cent.  For that reason it was necessary to do exactly the opposite to what one normally would try to do: it was necessary to take it, as rapidly as one could, from the furthest place at which it existed and bring it over rails into Dublin.  The normal procedure which was in the minds of every one of us at the beginning, that we simply would collect the turf in lorries near at hand and bring it in and deliver it, turned out to be the exact opposite to what in practice was necessary and still is necessary.  While there is a certain amount possible in this inner belt&mdash;I will tell you how much later&mdash; as far as I know the total is small.  In so far as it is saved on the side of the road and in so far as we can bring it in&mdash;if we are prepared to go to the <Col N="92" /> expense of bringing it in&mdash;it probably is as good there as if we had it here in town because, if we bring it in here now at a rate in excess of consumption, it means that we will have to add to it the cost of putting it into dumps, stacking and clamping it and taking it out of the dumps again.  For that reason, while I am at the present moment engaged, and will be more and more extensively engaged, in scouring the inner belt&mdash;scouring it very extensively&mdash;for such turf as is available, the solution of the difficulty over the winter still must depend upon rail-borne turf from the outer areas.</P>
    <P>The total amount of surplus turf available in the counties is roughly as follows: Kerry, 100,000 tons; Leix, 7,000; Clare, 30,000; Meath, 15,000; Offaly, 5,000; Mayo, 100,000; Roscommon, 20,000; Longford, 20,000; Galway, 50,000; Donegal, 150,000.  That makes a total of 500,000 tons of apparently surplus and movable turf. This is all county surveyors' turf and, broadly speaking, you may take it that, where there is a large excess of county surveyors' turf, there is a very reasonable possibility of there being a further excess of home-cut turf.</P>
    <P>If you take the inner belt again, you will see that the total amount there&mdash; Offaly, 5,000 tons; Roscommon, 20,000; Longford, 20,000, and Leix, 7,000&mdash;is relatively small.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there no surplus in the other parts?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The surplus in the other counties is: Kerry, 100,000 tons, and so on.  I am giving the surplus, and all that surplus is right out on the extreme end.  I believe there is a certain amount even in areas like Leix-Offaly, Roscommon and Longford, possibly over and above the amount which I have named, but we all know the psychology of scarcity in relation to supply.  Immediately a thing seems to be scarce, it goes into hiding.  What I am anxious to do is to induce those who do possess a surplus, to regard it as something which they are prepared to put at <Col N="93" /> our disposal to the extent to which it is surplus.  At the present moment anyone who has turf has put in rather more turf than he requires.  Immediately a thing becomes short, people always hoard more than they want.  People may be anxious in those areas, lest the amount of turf which they have may run out. They may want to carry somewhat more than a year's supply.  I want them to understand that&mdash;whatever may be the position in any turf area this year&mdash;with the extra time which we will have at our disposal, with the organisation which exists, and with the knowledge and training which everybody has had in those areas in the last year&mdash;there is no question at all that in any turf area there cannot easily be produced more turf next year than they will require.  Therefore, they can safely unload anything which is in excess and they can wisely run a little below what is sufficient in order that the pool of nearby turf shall be increased in the national interest.</P>
      <P>Turf is now being carried by rail to Dublin from Mayo, Longford, Roscommon and Galway.  It is being carried also from Mayo both by Six County routes and by a combined route which goes over the Great Southern and Western, the Sligo and Leitrim and the Great Northern Railway of Ireland into Dublin.  I think we can say that every possible railway route has now been examined and, so far as mere routes and avenues are concerned, the whole position has been fully investigated.  Kerry is sending turf into Cork.  Galway, Clare and Offaly are sending it into Limerick&mdash;that is, over rails, and, on the roads, turf is coming from Leix and Offaly, with a certain small amount from Kildare, into Dublin. We were more anxious to build up a sound system of transport which would stand the strain over the whole year than merely to provide an immediate demonstration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Broadly speaking, things seemed to be promising fairly satisfactorily in the early stages.  By the middle of September there had been built up a transport of, roughly speaking, 2,500 tons <Col N="94" /> a day of national turf from the turf into the non-turf areas, and the hope was that that gradual increase would develop.  The daily average for the week ending 20th September was, I think, 2,340 tons a day.  It was hoped, with that gradual and steady rise, that by the time we hit the beet and wheat traffic we would have built up a position which would have enabled us to carry on with some degree of confidence.  Unfortunately, from the 20th September the position began to deteriorate.  It gradually deteriorated until the end of the month, when it became definitely critical.  It became worse and worse during the first three weeks of October.  This was partly due to the beginning of the wheat traffic and the invasion of that traffic into the available supplies of lorries. It was mainly due to the reduced quantity, and the utterly deplorable quality, of the fuel which was being used on the railways.</P>
    <P>As you are all aware&mdash;you have all lived through the experience of the last few weeks in connection with the railways&mdash;the position became practically chaotic.  We had cases where a couple of hundred of empty wagons were sent off and simply did not arrive at their destinations.  You had passenger trains which went out into the blue and remained in the blue. The end of it was that, by the middle of October, the railways had practically sat down, due to the amount and the quality of coal.  At that point the Department of Supplies released certain coal which they were holding as an iron ration for domestic supplies for the purpose of the railways and, by the courtesy of the Department of Defence, there was put at the disposal of the Turf Controller 1,000 tons of coal, which was exchanged for a promissory note on 2,000 tons of very excellent Turraun turf.  A public-spirited county surveyor in the west provided 500 tons of coal on his end of the traffic system, which came like manna from Heaven, and which was made available for railway purposes.</P>
    <P>The picture changed again.  From the 20th October on we began again to get into the daylight.  Last week we <Col N="95" /> carried an average of 1,650 tons of turf a day from the turf to the non-turf areas, and the indications up to the present are that that improvement is going to be maintained, and there is a hope that it may be increased.</P>

What we are concerned with is that there is now moving into the non-turf areas something like 1,700 tons of turf a day and we contemplate that by the end of this month, if things go as we hope they will, we will have raised that figure to about 3,000 tons a day.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want, as a matter of fact, to get anything like <Col N="96" /> that into this discussion.  When we were getting 2,500 tons of turf a day we had at our disposal something between 1,500 and 2,000 wagons of the 11,000 goods wagons available.  We had been calculating on a three days' turn-around of those wagons, which meant that you would have a third of the wagons moving every day full of turf, but due to complications, of fuel and the rest of it, that turn-around deteriorated to four and sometimes even to five days, but we had at our disposal that 1,500 to 2,000 wagons.  We have now struck the beet traffic stage.  In the meantime, the railway company have crated for us 500 or 600 wagons and are in process of crating more. They have converted the equivalent of two trains, of 40 wagons each, of passenger coaches, by taking the roofs off them to increase the turf wagon supply, but when all that is taken into account we are now faced with the fact that the total amount of wagons with which we will have to live for the present is not 1,500 or 2,000, but somewhere about 1,000.</P>
      <P>The significance of that, from the point of view of the House, is this.  You can get turf into this city&mdash;I am taking this merely as typical&mdash;either over the relatively short haul of the roads or the long haul of the rails, and there is any amount of lorries in this country.  As I told you, there were over 2,000 lorries engaged in moving turf in the turf areas, but those lorries can only be called upon in the limited supply of turf which is in the inner belt, and that can rapidly be exhausted.  The only place where there is a large quantity of turf to be tapped is in the distant areas and over rail, and if the position is to be made secure in the non-turf areas over the winter it depends upon adequate rail traffic.  We have pressed that point upon the railway companies, and the point has now been reached in which priorities in relation to traffic will have to be settled.  You have wheat, beet, wood, and general merchandise in competition with turf.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I grant you.  With regard to perishable traffic, the more <Col N="97" /> acute you make that, the greater the difficulty becomes.  They are in competition with a limited number of goods wagons, and on the decision as to what those priorities are, what the quantitative nature of those priorities is, will depend how secure we are going to be over the winter.  We are in the position now of being able to feed the railway with all the traffic they can take, and if they take all the traffic which we can give to them then the position over the winter might be moderately comfortable and secure.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall put it this way.  I have given you the total amount of national turf in the inner belt.  The amount of non-national turf in that inner belt, in my opinion, is relatively small.  In other words, you cannot assume that there is a large quantity outside that.  I believe there is more than is visible, and I want to get it, but the total amount of it is not large. We have, therefore, two interests in the matter.  There is one other interest in the matter of rail as distinct from road-borne turf: that rail-borne turf is going to be cheaper turf, but there is not going to be any cheap turf.  Rail-borne turf is going into the boroughs at an average price of somewhere about 44/- to 46/- a ton, free on rail, in those places.  Road-borne turf is 15/- to 20/- a ton more, on an average, at the distances which we are now hauling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>That is an eye-opener.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, it is, and it is a very interesting eye-opener, and the further you drive the road transport out to get turf, the bigger that discrepancy will be.  It takes, roughly speaking, a galion of petrol to move a ton of turf from a bog 20 miles away.  With that basis as <Col N="98" /> a calculation you can calculate how much it is going to cost me if I do&mdash;as I am going to do&mdash;bring turf from Roscommon and from Galway by road, if necessary, in order to fill this gap.  But my chief object in pressing this point at the moment is in order that the House may appreciate how important it is that the largest possible use shall be made of the railway system and that the largest amount of its stock as possible shall be rendered available for this purpose.  Now, the Army, as you know, has been highly helpful and co-operative in this matter from the beginning. It is at present itself engaged, or in the process of becoming engaged, in shifting some 70,000 or 80,000 tons of turf from the turf areas into the non-turf areas.  This turf is primarily for purpose of defence, but it is under an agreement that it shall be available for civilian purposes if that is necessary.  For that purpose they are using some 300 lorries of their own and they are putting at the disposal of national turf another 200 crated lorries for the purpose of bringing in that turf.  Well, now, what is the actual position up to the moment of turf stored as an iron ration?  The total amount is, roughly speaking, 100,000 tons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. D. Morrissey Mr. D. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Stored where?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>70,000 tons in Dublin, 8,000 tons in Dundalk, 500 tons in Drogheda, 10,000 tons in Cork, 3,500 tons in Wexford, 2,500 tons in Waterford, and about 7,000 tons in Limerick. That position will, we hope, not merely be maintained, but can be improved if we can reach the figure of 3,000 tons a day import.  We are, as a matter of fact, in one other matter trying to help the railway transport for turf. We did suggest at an early stage that it would be good and sound economy to use the coal which was in reserve for the purpose of enabling a larger quantity of fuel to be brought over the rails.  I think the amount of fuel required, the amount which is burned compared with what is brought, would be somewhere about 7 or 8 per cent.  Therefore, it is a good thing to take out of your reserve something <Col N="99" /> that would enable you to bring stuff in.</P>
      <P>Considerable technical difficulty, apparently, was found in the beginning from the railway point of view in segregating the stuff which was so delivered, but that difficulty seems to have been got over, and the 1,500 tons of coal which, by the courtesy of the Minister for Defence and the western county surveyor, we were in a position to give to the railway company, plus two wagons of turf which are being added to each train and which are part of their equipment, have resulted in &mdash; as far as it is possible for the railway company to give it&mdash;a guarantee that something in relation to a schedule will be kept in regard to turf trains from now until the end of January.  Another figure that the House may be glad to have, and which will become significant when we come afterwards to consider the cost of turf as a fuel, is that in regard to all turf delivered free on rail in the City of Dublin, some 66 per cent., or two-thirds of the total cost, is apparently represented by labour.  Turf stored on the side of the bog has practically 100 per cent. labour content, but even when it has reached the city it still has two-thirds labour content.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That covers the position, as far as I know it, in relation to this year and its campaign.  As far as next year is concerned, we hope to see Kilkenny, Cork, and Louth added to the turf areas, leaving only Wexford, possibly part of Wicklow, and Dublin, as the danger points; but, if we are to calculate, as is possible, that there might not be alternative fuel available in the form of coal, the position in relation to Dublin next year will still be critical.  For that reason the Government has authorised that there should be built a series of camps in the inner belt, which will enable turf to be produced in a position from which it could be transported. The intention is to build hutments for somewhere about 10,000 men, though whether we could build anything like that amount in the time available, or whether, having done so, we will be able to recruit that number of competent sleansmen for the purpose in the <Col N="100" /> time, is doubtful.  One of our objects in allowing places like Donegal and Kerry, and other places like that, this year to cut more turf than they could possibly use, or than we could possibly transport, is so that there will not be the necessity for the turf-cutters to remain in those counties during next year for the purpose of cutting their own turf.  We have built up a reserve by which those men, to the extent to which they are prepared to come and cut the turf in the Midlands, will be available to do it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>That I do not know, but I hope they will.  Naturally, we would prefer, if it were possible, to use the people who themselves are going to consume the turf.  It would be very desirable if, for instance, we could send out only Dublin men to cut Dublin turf, but experience up to the present has shown that the use of city labour for the purpose of cutting turf in virgin bogs at any rate has not been satisfactory, and that the cost of turf cut in those circumstances would be very greatly in excess of the cost of the turf if it were cut by men, say, from Mayo or Donegal or places of that kind.  In addition, it would mean the occupation of the very limited amount of housing accommodation by those who would not have the same output rate as the western men if they were prepared to cut.  It is for that reason that we are anxious to see the western men here cutting turf.  A great many of those who normally would be available for it are people who migrate during the summer.  Every possible inducement will require to be made and given to see that those who could cut turf here in their own country for the benefit and the salvation of their own people here will do so next year rather than go elsewhere.  The total cost of those camps will be, roughly speaking, £500,000, and at the present moment the staff is fully engaged on laying out the actual camps. Architects have been engaged for the purpose of designing the structure, and contracts will be let in a very short time.  I do not hope to see the equipment for 10,000 men provided between <Col N="101" /> now and the beginning of next season, but I do intend that the largest possible amount of accommodation that can be provided by the strongest possible pressure that we all can exercise will in fact be provided.</P>

      <P>Would the Parliamentary Secretary allow me to ask a question?  He will recollect that on the last occasion we discussed this matter in the House it was suggested that, at the end of the turf season this year, a very large number of men would become unemployed who had been employed for the season in the bogs. The number has dropped, I believe, from 30,000 to 8,000.  The Parliamentary Secretary, and the Taoiseach himself, indicated that the Department would endeavour to switch these men from turf cutting to dealing with scrub and other classes of timber, not only for the purpose of providing fuel, but also to provide employment for these men during the winter months. I should like to know if anything has been done in that direction as distinct from what he said in reply to Deputy Norton's question.</P>

      <P>Normally speaking, there are about 20,000 men engaged on the roads in the country.  We switched a very considerable portion of these on to the bogs early in the season and they are now being switched back again to the roads to do that minimum maintenance work which we had neglected during the summer.  The ordinary scheme of unemployment work during the winter will take place as usual, but most of the men, at least all of the men whom it is possible so to employ, will be used for the purpose of that development work.  At present, I think there are about 3,000 men in addition to the 8,000 actually engaged on development.</P>

      <P>It is common knowledge to Deputies that there is a considerable quantity of fallen timber&mdash; in a great many cases timber which has fallen into rivers.  That is the sort of timber that would be usefully dealt with now during the winter.  It could be removed from the rivers.  There is also scrub timber in old cut-away woods which could provide useful employment and a great deal of firing.  That firing is in very many cases in close proximity to cities and urban areas, a fact that would to some extent solve the transport problem.</P>

The Deputy may, however, take it that any scrub or emergency timber which is available will have very careful attention.</P>

      <P>It is not a question of clearing all the wood out in one year. Anyone who has calculated on the basis that this emergency will last only this year would be very unwise.  The intention is during the time of the emergency that all such scrub timber which can usefully and properly be put to use as fuel will so be utilised.  Next year, as Deputies know, we shall have a slightly different problem to face.  We certainly shall not be able to start out and say to everybody: &ldquo;Cut an unlimited amount of turf.&rdquo;  Next year, with the knowledge we have of our transport problems, it will be necessary for us to some extent to delimit the amount and the areas of production, always making quite sure that the total amount which is being produced will be sufficient for the country.  A surplus quantity of turf has been cut this year in certain remote areas but next year I think it would be more profitable for the State&mdash;and I hope at least equally profitable for the individual&mdash;to cut turf in some other place from which it will be more convenient for us to transport it.  I have given to the House, as fully as I can, that portion of the information which to me seems to be significant.  If there <Col N="104" /> is any other information which members of the House would desire as a contribution to the solution of the immediate difficulty, or a contribution to their own comfort in feeling that a proper attempt is being made at a solution of that difficulty, I shall be most happy to give it.</P>

I am speaking of people who buy coal blocks at 2d. each and a stone of green timber, which is too big for their fires, at 6d.  When will some of the fuel which is stored at the North Wall and the Custom House Docks be distributed among the class of people I have referred to&mdash;those who buy sixpence and one shilling's worth?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to that is, very shortly.  The actual position in relation to that I will put to you now. Originally, the definition of the functions of the turf controller was that he should be responsible for all questions of production, distribution and price of turf.  By an arrangement between the Minister for Supplies and the turf controller, it has been arranged that in the areas that are declared to be non-turf areas the turf controller shall function in that manner up to the point of actually bringing the turf in and putting it into dumps.  At that particular stage, and at the moment at which it is agreed that the turf shall be distributed, that turf will be handed over in those non-turf areas to the Minister for Supplies and he will be responsible for its retail distribution and price.  I think the time at which he will be prepared to allow this turf to come into circulation is coming very close.  There is no difficulty at the present moment, if the Minister for Supplies does in fact feel that a certain limited quantity is required for that particular necessity, why that should not be done.  That is a matter for his discretion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to say this quite frankly.  I have had complaints of the character <Col N="106" /> which the Deputy has mentioned and when I come down to brass tacks to try to get the names and addresses or identification of people of that kind, it has not proved to be very solid.  I do not believe that there is any real hardship at the present moment of a distributive character.  There is a borough which I have in mind in relation to which there was in the newspapers some time ago a statement that it only had three or four days' supply of fuel. There are 3,000 tons of turf in the possession of two coal dealers in that borough and they tell me that there is no demand for the turf.  That is an actual fact and you have to face it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a lot of people in this House trying to discuss this question, and all the Deputy is doing is providing a very foolish chorus. There is a psychological effect.  Where the thing is physically present, the demand falls off; but immediately there is a suggestion of a shortage, the demand is completely exaggerated.  I had the experience of showing the dumps that we had in Dublin to very responsible people in this city, and immediately they saw them their whole enthusiasm for the import of turf practically disappeared.  It seemed to be too much.  There is undoubtedly that psychology, and I want to warn people against it.  They see an amount of turf accumulating in a place.  They are not used to estimating the fuel value relative to its enormous bulk. They seem to think that things are all right.  The total amount of turf which is kept as an iron ration in any of the districts at the present moment is not sufficient to justify anyone in slackening up for an hour from doing everything that is possible to get the turf.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  The Constitution provides that, in the prescribed circumstances, certain legislative proposals may be submitted to the general body of the electorate for final decision.  It defines the proposals that must or may be submitted to the people by way of referendum and, in the case of ordinary legislative proposals, limits the time within which the decision of the people must be given.  Proposals submitted to the people may be either constitutional amendments or proposals for ordinary legislation other than a Money Bill or a Bill which has been passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>In Section 2, the definition section of the measure now before the House, definitions are given distinguishing a referendum taken upon a proposal to amend the Constitution from one taken upon an ordinary legislative proposal.  The first is referred to throughout the Bill as a constitutional referendum and the second as an ordinary referendum.  A constitutional amendment will be held to be approved if the majority of the votes passed at the referendum which must be taken upon it be in favour of it. A proposal for ordinary legislation will be held to have been vetoed if the majority of the votes be cast against its enactment, subject, however, to the over-riding condition that this amounts to not less than one-third of the total register.  Article 47 (4) prescribes that the taking of referenda shall be regulated by law in accordance with the Constitution.  The measure I am now submitting to the House fulfils that prescript.  It provides for that regulation, the taking of a referendum by law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Obviously, the first step in taking a referendum is to appoint a person who shall be responsible for the proper conduct of the whole proceedings. This is to be done under Section 6 in Part I, which provides for the appointment of a referendum returning officer.  One of the duties of this officer will be to prepare and publish <Col N="114" /> a certificate of the result of the voting at a referendum.  As first issued by the referendum returning officer, this certificate is provisional only.  If it be not challenged or upset on a petition, it automatically becomes final and conclusive evidence of the result of the referendum.  The electoral registers are prepared annually by the registration officers for the several constituencies and Section 7, which is also in Part I, requires these registration officers to give to the referendum returning officer the information he needs for the preparation of his certificate as to the numbers of electors on the register.  Sub-section 3 of Section 7 further requires every registration officer to inform the referendum returning officer of any alteration which he has been called upon to make in the register for which he is responsible in order to give effect to decisions of law affecting the right to be on the register, to correct errors in its compilation, or for other sufficient reasons.</P>
    <P>Part II of the Bill and the First Schedule detail the procedure to be followed at a referendum.</P>
    <P>This procedure follows as closely as possible the procedure at a general election of members to Dáil Eireann. Under Sections 8 and 10, when the Government determines that a referendum is to be taken on a particular proposal, that decision will be published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil,</i> and, within one week, the Minister for Local Govenment, the Minister named in the Bill, will by order appoint a polling day. The polling day must not be less than 30 days or more than 90 days after the date of the order.</P>
    <P>The terms of sub-section (1) of Section 8 have been questioned on the ground that they constitute an encroachment upon the provisions of the Constitution.  The objection appears to be based on the contention that when the conditions necessary to secure a constitutional referendum have been fulfilled, the measure must, under the Constitution, be referred automatically to the people for decision, whereas the sub-section in question provides that before such reference is made, the <Col N="115" /> Government shall determine whether the proposal concerned is to proceed to enactment, or whether its further progress to the Statute Book is to be suspended or discontinued.  The issue of repugnancy is referred to a particular tribunal and need not delay us long here, since, even if raised, it cannot be settled until the Bill has passed through the Oireachtas, but I should like to say that the point in question was adverted to and was very carefully considered in the drafting of this Bill. In regard to it, I have been advised that the taking of a referendum does not automatically follow on the passage through the Oireachtas of a Bill to amend the Constitution.  A decision has to be made subsequently as to whether a proposal is to proceed to the final and effectively conclusive stage of consulting the people, or whether it is to be permitted to lapse. The sub-sections which have been criticised have been drafted to provide for this accordingly.</P>
    <P>Section 9 gives power to the Minister to appoint the same polling day for a general election and for the taking of a referendum upon a proposal to amend the Constitution, should the need for such referendum arise.  In this connection, Section 15 provides that wherever two or more proposals are to be made the subject of referenda, the ballot papers must be so framed that a voter will be able to record a separate vote in respect of each such proposal.  That section furthermore prescribes that, in the case of ordinary referenda, the proposals shall be set out upon the ballot paper in the same terms as nearly as may be as they have been stated in the writing sent to the Taoiseach under the hand and seal of the President in accordance with Article 27 (4) of the Constitution.  In the case of a constitutional referendum, the proposal in issue is to be stated as nearly as may be in the same terms as it was set out in the Bill which was passed, or deemed to have been passed, by both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>This proposal will, in fact, have been set out in the preamble to the Bill to <Col N="116" /> amend the Constitution.  Section 11 of the Bill provides that the poll is to be taken on one and the same day throughout the State.  It will be taken by constituencies and will be conducted by the local returning officers in accordance <i>inter alia</i> with the rules set out in the First Schedule to the Bill.  The polling hours will be from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m.  Under Section 13, the electorate will be confined to persons entitled to vote at Dáil elections and such persons must have attained the age of 21. Section 21 accordingly enables the presiding officer at a polling booth to put the questions necessary to elicit whether a person voting has reached this age or not.  The voting will take place at the polling places fixed for Dáil elections, and, as Section 14 prescribes, will be by ballot which, of course, will be secret.  The votes are to be counted locally in accordance with rules Nos. 24 to 29, inclusive, which are set out in the First Schedule to the Bill.  The returns of the local counting are to be sent to the referendum returning officer who, under Section 30, will summarise them and issue a provisional certificate giving particulars of the voting at the referendum, and the result.  That certificate will become final if and when the referendum returning officer is informed by the Master of the High Court that no petition has been presented within the time specified in the Act, or that every petition presented in respect of the provisional certificate has become null and void.  I have mentioned that Section 14 prescribes that votes at the referendum shall be given by ballot.  That section, and Section 15, contain as well provisions regulating the form and general make-up of the ballot papers, and <i>inter alia</i> make provision for the taking of more than one referendum on the same day should this course prove to be convenient.</P>
    <P>It will be noted that the form of ballot paper prescribed in the Second Schedule to the Bill is such as to permit the voter's attitude towards the proposal upon which the referendum is being taken to be indicated by marking with a cross in the relevant column. Section 16, however, which prescribes the method of marking the vote on the <Col N="117" /> ballot paper declares that, so long as a ballot paper is so marked as to indicate with reasonable certainly the will of the voter, it shall not be invalid merely because the mark in the Act has not been used in marking it.  Section 17 of the Bill gives to any member of Dáil Eireann the right to appoint personating agents to attend at particular polling stations during the taking of the referendum.</P>
    <P>The right of appointment lies to as many polling stations as the member concerned may think fit, but is limited to the appointment by him of not more than one personating agent in respect of any one polling station.  Similarly, Rule 28 in the First Schedule gives to each member of Dáil Eireann for the constituency at which votes on the referendum are being counted, the right to nominate two persons to be present on his behalf at the opening of the ballot boxes and the counting of the votes.  The member of Dáil Eireann concerned may nominate himself as one of the persons in question.  Sections 18, 19 and 20 follow similar sections in the Electoral Act of 1923, and provide for the appointment of presiding officers, the keeping of order in polling stations, and voting by post. Section 21 is also similar in its general lines to the corresponding Section 29 in the Electoral Act of 1923.  I have already pointed out, however, that it contains a new provision which permits the presiding officer to elicit from an applicant for a ballot paper a positive declaration of having attained the age of 21 years.  I may say that the measure which was introduced to-day proposes to amend Section 29 of the Electoral Act so as to give the returning officer the same authority in the case of an election to Dáil Eireann.</P>
    <P>Sections 22, 23 and 24, respectively, contain provisions for ensuring the secrecy of the ballot and prescribe the procedure to be followed in case of a riot or where the ballot boxes or ballot papers have been destroyed or tampered with.  These follow the lines of similar sections in the Electoral Act of 1923 dealing with such matters.  The same applies to Sections 25, 26 and 27, which provide (a) for the use of schools and other buildings <Col N="118" /> for the purpose of taking the poll. (b) for the use of local government ballot boxes for the taking of the ballot, and (c) that no voter shall be required by any legal proceeding to disclose the manner in which he has voted at a referendum.  Section 28 provides that where the polling at a constitutional referendum and at a general election takes place on the same day, the polls will be taken together, separate ballot boxes being provided.  The section, however, also provides that the elector shall not be deemed to have spoiled his vote merely by reason of having put it into the wrong ballot box.  Section 29 applies the relevant sections of the Prevention of Electoral Abuses Act, 1923, to the taking of a ballot at a referendum.  I have already referred to Section 30, which provides for the issue by the referendum returning officer of a provisional certificate stating the voting at and the result of the referendum concerned. This section further provides that, when the returning officer has been informed in writing by the Master of the High Court that the provisional certificate has not been challenged or voided by petition, the provisional certificate shall become and be henceforth final and conclusive evidence as to the result of the referendum.  Section 31 provides for the punishment of officers guilty of gross negligence.  It follows the lines of Section 63 of the Electoral Act, 1923.</P>
    <P>Under Section 32 the Minister is authorised to issue to all or any local returning officers, or officer, such instructions or orders as he may consider necessary or expedient in order to ensure the smooth and efficient taking of the referendum, and to secure uniformity of procedure in regard thereto in all constituencies. The section, however, contains the limitation that no local returning officer shall be required or authorised by any such instruction or order to do anything which is contrary to the terms of the measure and which would directly or indirectly infringe the secrecy of the ballot.</P>
    <P>Under sub-section (3) of Section 34 of the Bill, which will be found in Part III thereof, a referendum petition <Col N="119" /> questioning the validity of a provisional referendum certificate may be presented to the High Court by any person who voted at the referendum or by the Attorney-General.  Accordingly, Part III of the Bill, consisting of Sections 33-44 inclusive, makes provision for the hearing and determination of such petitions.  Once a referendum petition has been lodged, certain special problems as to procedure present themselves. That arises from the fact that, at a referendum, in contra-distinction to an election, it is the fate of a proposal and not of a person which is immediately and directly involved in the final result. There is thus no individual whose peculiar personal interest it is to uphold the validity of the provisional referendum certificate in the face of a petition, whereas if the return to a parliamentary seat is questioned by petition, it may be taken that the person declared by the returning officer to have been returned will defend his right to sit in the House to which he has been elected.  Similarly, an election petition is abated should the person presenting it die, presumably on the ground that the effective interest in such a petition is a personal one, limited to the deceased.  On the other hand, in the case of a referendum, a petition questioning anything in the certificate may affect the entire result of the referendum and, therefore, the effective interest in it is a national one. Accordingly, even if the person responsible for the petition were to die, it would still be necessary to try this charge and ascertain the true result of the referendum.  Bearing these points in mind, I think it will be admitted that the procedure for dealing with a referendum petition must, in certain vital particulars, differ radically from that prescribed by the Parliamentary Elections Act, 1868, for dealing with election petitions.</P>
    <P>While it is true that the position in this regard could be met by an amending Bill to adapt the 1868 Act, the adaptations required would, in my view, be so drastic that it has been thought preferable, in order to meet the convenience of those who may be <Col N="120" /> obliged to have resort to the courts in these matters, to draft a new and complete code to regulate the conduct and determination of referendum petitions. This new code is set out in Part III of this Bill.  Naturally, many of the provisions in the new code resemble provisions of the Act of 1868 and of the Prevention of Electoral Abuses Act, 1923.  For instance, Section 33 provides that the expression &ldquo;corrupt practice&rdquo; means &ldquo;an offence which is a corrupt practice within the meaning of the Prevention of Electoral Abuses Act, 1923&rdquo;, so that bribery, personation, treating, and the use of undue influence will, each and all, be corrupt practices under the measure now before the House, as they are under that Act.</P>
    <P>Under Section 34, a petition may question a provisional referendum certificate either in relation to the voting in any one constituency or in relation to the aggregate voting at the referendum as a whole.  In the first case, the certificate may be challenged on the ground that corrupt practices prevailed extensively in that particular constituency, or on the ground of error or misconduct on the part of the local returning officer.  In this case, the petition may be presented by any person who voted in the constituency concerned in the referendum, or who claims that he was unlawfully prevented from so voting.  In the second case&mdash;where the petition challenges the figures for the aggregate voting&mdash;it must be grounded on an allegation of error on the part of the referendum returning officer.  In the case of an ordinary referendum&mdash;one relating to a measure which comes within the terms of Article 47 (2) of the Constitution, and for the rejection of which it is necessary not only that the majority of the votes shall be cast in favour of that course, but that the number of persons actually voting for it shall be not less than one-third of those on the register &mdash;the ground that the number of Dáil electors for the time being in the State as a whole has been incorrectly stated in the provisional certificate, may also be the basis of petition.  In the case of a petition in respect of the aggregate voting, it may be presented by any person <Col N="121" /> who voted at the referendum, irrespective of the constituency in which he or she voted.</P>
    <P>I have already emphasised how the process of a petition questioning the result of a referendum must differ from a petition questioning an election return, by reason of the fact that there is no individual upon whom the responsibility of resisting the petition naturally falls.  In so far as petitions presented are concerned, this is met by sub-section (1) of Section 35, which provides that the Attorney-General shall be named as respondent, so that there is cast upon that officer of the State the general duty of defending such provisional certificates as are questioned otherwise than by him. But the Attorney-General has, at the same time, the duty of challenging such provisional certificates as are in his opinion incorrect.  Accordingly, apart altogether from the action of individual voters, he may, under paragraph (c), sub-section (3) of Section 34 present a petition questioning the original certificate in any case in which the information before him seems to warrant such a step.  It will be remembered that under Section 30 a provisional certificate which has not been challenged in due time, and against which a petition has not been sustained, becomes final and conclusive evidence of the referendum.</P>
    <P>Section 34 (4) contains a complementary provision to the effect that a provisional referendum certificate shall not be capable of being questioned in any manner in any court save only by presentation in due form of a referendum petition.  I mentioned that sub-section (1) of Section 35 prescribes that the Attorney-General shall be named as respondent in all petitions presented otherwise than by him.  Sub-section (3) of the same section further provides that where a person is charged with corrupt practice by a petition, or where the High Court directs that a copy of the petition be served upon him, such person may, on his own application, be named or added as respondent to the petition. Furthermore, under sub-section (4) where in the case of a petition presented <Col N="122" /> by the Attorney-General a question of law arises in relation to the conduct of a returning officer, the High Court may name the returning officer as respondent in order to argue the question of law, but for no other purpose.</P>
    <P>Section 36 lays down the general condition with which petitioners must comply.  These follow existing procedure closely and amongst other things prescribe (a) that the petition signed by the petitioner or his counsel must be lodged within 21 days of the publication of the provisional certificate; (b) that in cases where the petition is not presented by the Attorney-General himself, a copy of it must be served upon him within five days after it has been presented;.  (c) that the petitioner must give security for the Attorney-General's costs to the amount of £1,000; (e) that the petition shall set out with reasonable particularity the grounds on which it is based.  Where corrupt practices are alleged, full and detailed particulars are to be lodged with the High Court, and a copy thereof served upon the Attorney-General within 14 days after the presentation of the petition.  If all the conditions in relation to the service of a copy of the petition upon the Attorney-General, the filing of an affidavit of such service, and giving security for costs, be not complied with, the petition becomes null and void, and the master of the High Court must notify the returning officer to that effect after, but not more than 21 days from the date of the first publication of the provisional referendum certificate. Similarly, if at the end of the 21st day, no petition questioning the original certificate has been presented to the High Court, the master shall inform the referendum returning officer of that fact.</P>
    <P>In either case the provisions of Section 30 will come into effect, and the provisional certificate will become final and conclusive.  Section 37 provides that the High Court may order a copy of the referendum petition be served on a particular person, if it appears to the court that he is so concerned in or affected by it that he <Col N="123" /> ought to have notice thereof, and be given an opportunity to have himself added or named as respondent to it. The need for such a provision will be clear if we consider, for example, a petition which alleges that during the taking of a referendum, corrupt practices prevailed extensively in a certain constituency, by reason of the fact that a person influenced voters either by bribery or in some other undue fashion, to vote in a particular way.  Clearly the person mentioned should be given the opportunity of defending not only the certificate but himself against the charges made, and in his own interest cross-examine witnesses thereon.</P>
    <P>The provisions of Section 37 will ensure that this opportunity will be afforded to him should the High Court, on his application, consider this necessary. Section 38 provides that a referendum petition shall be tried by the High Court before three judges thereof, and further provides that as a rule the trial shall take place in the City of Dublin.</P>
    <P>Where there are two or more petitions concerned on the same certificate they may be tried together or consolidated. Full power is given to the court at its discretion to compel persons to attend to give evidence.  It will be within the province of the court to examine any person whom it directs to be brought before it, with the exception that he cannot be required to state how he voted.  No person brought before the court may refuse to give evidence even if it incriminates him.  The justification of the last-mentioned provision arises from the fact that referendum petitions may involve issues of national importance, in regard to which it is essential to establish, even at the expense of the witnesses before the court, the true and lawful result of the referendum.  Section 39 empowers the court to require the returning officer to produce and deliver to it all or any of the documents in his possession relating to the referendum.  Where a referendum petition questions the validity of a provisional referendum certificate in respect of a particular <Col N="124" /> constituency, the High Court, under Section 40, may order that the referendum shall be taken again in the constituency and may appoint a polling day for the purpose.  The High Court, however, is not entitled to order the retaking of a referendum merely on account of non-compliance with the rules or a clerical mistake, where such non-compliance or mistake did not affect the result of the referendum in the constituency.</P>
    <P>Section 41 prescribes that the final order of the High Court on a petition shall be made either by confirming or amending the provisional certificate of the referendum returning officer.  The section further prescribes that the record of the action of the court in relation to the provisional certificate shall be endorsed on that document, making it final and conclusive evidence of the result of the referendum concerned.</P>
    <P>Where the polling in respect of two or more referenda takes place on the same day, as may be the case under Section 15, and where a petition is presented in respect of some only of such referenda, Section 42 inhibits the provisional certificate in respect of the other referenda which were held on that day but in respect of which no petition has been lodged, from becoming final and conclusive until the court has made its final order in respect of the referendum petition or petitions before it.  When the court has made its final orders on the petitions before it, the provisional certificates which have not been questioned become final and conclusive also.  The final orders of the court on all referenda petitions which relate to the same date are to be made on the same day.</P>
    <P>Where the provisional results of some only of the referenda held on the same day have been questioned by petition, paragraph (b) of Section 42 authorises the Attorney-General, with the leave of the court, to present at any time prior to the making of the final orders in respect of the prior petitions, a petition or petitions questioning any of the hitherto unquestioned provisional certificates. <Col N="125" /> These petitions of the Attorney-General shall, as in the case of the prior petitions, be held and determined by the same three judges as sat on the original petition and, at the discretion of the court, may be tried together or consolidated.  The need for this provision arises from the fact that, where more than one referendum is held on the same day, the conduct or procedure which invalidates one of the referenda may equally affect the result of the others.  If, for instance, intimidation were grave and serious in respect of one proposal on the ballot paper, there is reason to fear that it would likewise have affected the voters in regard to the other proposals.</P>
    <P>Section 43 provides for the position which would be created by the death of or delay by a petitioner.  Section 44 provides that the High Court, either on its own action or on the application of any party to the proceedings, may, if it so thinks proper, state a case for the opinion of the Supreme Court on any question of law which arises at the trial of the referendum petition.</P>
    <P>This completes the general body of the Bill and I now come to the Schedules, of which there are three. The rules for taking a poll at a referendum are set out in the First Schedule to the Bill.  They are in three parts, of which Part I relates to the functions of the local returning officers, Part II to the functions of the referendum returning officer, and Part III to general matters.  Local returning officers are governed by rules 1 to 30, inclusive, and, with the exception of rules 2, 4, 25 (2), 25 (3), 28 (1) and 30, their approximate counterparts will be found in the Electoral Act of 1923.  The new rules &mdash; that is to say, 2, 4, 25 (2), 25 (3), 28 (1) and 30 &mdash; are necessary to meet the special characteristics of the referendum and the special provisions of this Bill.  Rule 2, for instance, requires the referendum returning officer to send to every local returning officer a copy of the Minister's order appointing the polling day at a referendum and the copy of the proposal which is the subject of such referendum.</P>
    <P>Rule 4 obliges the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs to make available for <Col N="126" /> inspection and purchase for a sum not exceeding 6d. by members of the public at post offices throughout the State copies of the Bill containing the proposal which is the subject of the referendum.  This rule further provides that the public shall be entitled to inspect copies of the Bill, free of charge, at any post office at which it has been made available for inspection and purchase.  Rule 25 (2) and (3) lays down the procedure to be followed at the count, in cases where two or more referenda are being taken on the same day.  In such cases, all the papers will first be examined for validity and then each ballot paper will be examined as regards each referendum.  A paper will be wholly invalid if it has not been properly stamped or if it bears any writing or mark by which the voter could be identified.  A paper which has not been invalidated generally for either of these reasons may be declared invalid in respect of a particular referendum if in regard thereto it is unmarked or is void for uncertainty. Rule 28 (1) authorises each member of Dáil Eireann for the constituency in which the votes are being counted to nominate two persons to be present on his behalf at the opening of the ballot boxes and the counting of the votes. It gives him the right, as I have told the House already, to nominate himself as one of those persons.</P>
    <P>Rule 30 prescribes that, on completion of the count, the local returning officer shall send to the referendum returning officer the necessary report in writing as to the result of the referendum in his constituency, together with all the specified documents, including ballot papers and ballot paper accounts.  At a Dáil election these packets are sent to the Clerk of the Dáil.  The functions of the referendum returning officer are governed by rules 31 to 33 inclusive. These rules, with the exception of rule 31, follow similar rules of the Electoral Act of 1923.</P>
    <P>Rule 31 prescribes the procedure to be followed by the referendum returning officer in preparing the provisional referendum certificate.  This certificate is to be based on the reports of the local returning officer together with, in <Col N="127" /> the case of an ordinary referendum, the information supplied to the referendum returning officer under Section 7 of the Bill by the registration officers as to the number of electors on the register in their respective constituencies. After the provisional certificate has become final and conclusive, or has been confirmed or deemed to have been confirmed by the High Court, the returning officer must send a copy of it to the Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>Rules 34 and 35, in Part III of the Schedule, are similar to rules 44 and 47 in the Act of 1923.  The forms of ballot papers to be used for the taking of a referendum are shown in the Second Schedule to the Bill.  In general, the decision of the voter in regard to the proposals submitted to him in the referendum is to be signified by marking a cross in the appropriate column.  It is provided, however, in Section 16 of the Bill, that a ballot paper shall not be invalidated merely because the cross has not been used in marking it, provided that the paper is so marked as to indicate with reasonable certainty the will of the voter.</P>
    <P>The Third Schedule sets out the legislation to be repealed by this Bill. As regards Part V of the Second Schedule to the Act of 1923, the authority for this part of the Act was Article 47 of the Constitution of Saorstát Eireann.  These provisions are now obsolete.  In so far as they relate to the taking of the poll, they have been incorporated in the present measure.  Section 23 of the Prevention of Electoral Abuses Act of 1923, which is to be repealed by this Bill, is also obsolete.  It provided for the appointment of a sponsor and a challenger at a referendum, who would appoint personation agents.  The Bill seeks to confer this power on Deputies in the Dáil.</P>
    <P>Those are the general provisions of the Bill and the purpose of it is, as I have already stated, to give effect to the provision of the Constitution in relation to the taking of a referendum on certain legislative proposals.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>This is neither the <Col N="128" /> time nor the place to pass judgment upon a referendum, but I might mention that it has not been a success in any country in which it has been employed and most countries have rejected it.  It has a disturbing influence &mdash; that is nearly all that we may say about it.</P>
      <P>We have here 32 pages of a Bill, introduced in a time of emergency, and dealing with the procedure to be adopted at a referendum.  Presumably it is not a controversial measure and the steps to be taken to regulate how votes are to be cast, how they are to be counted and the provision for petitions against a measure ought not to be considered in any other manner than as an ordinary act of administration.</P>
      <P>There is one thing that has been rather a scandal at elections for some years past and this measure does not seem to have made any provision for dealing with it.  A ballot paper which does not bear the official mark is not counted.  There is no check under this Bill for ensuring that that ballot paper, which is not stamped, will not be handed to the voter.  Presumably it is thought that when you write down regulations for officials they are carried out immediately.  They are not, and anybody who has experience of elections knows quite well that at almost every count a number of papers are objected to because they have not the official mark.  It is assumed that these are not orthodox ballot papers.  That is not true, because there have been orthodox ballot papers not bearing the official mark and the voters in these cases have been disfranchised.  There is no provision in this measure for remedying that weakness.  One simple method of remedying it would be to have the ballot paper passed from the presiding officer to one or two of the personation agents who would see that the mark, whatever it was, was inserted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I now come to Section 17 (6), where it is indicated that any personation agent who leaves the polling station in contravention of the section shall not be permitted to return and shall be guilty of an offence.  It is some months <Col N="129" /> since I read this measure, and I may say it was not a very interesting measure to read.  I do not think there is any provision made for the illness of a personation agent or a member of his family.  There might be a special reason.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that point is covered by sub-section (5) of that section.  Sub-section (6) makes it an offence to leave in contravention of the provisions of the section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>But the presiding officer may be away at the time that thing happens&mdash;a message might come quickly for him.  The next section I want to draw attention to is Section 21. There does not appear to be any penalty attaching to a person who makes application for a ballot paper at a referendum, and who is not entitled to vote.  There is a penalty under the ordinary law, but there is no mention of a penalty under that section.  The next section is Section 24.  It points out that if, at the poll at a referendum any ballot boxes or ballot papers are taken out of the custody of the local returning officer or a presiding officer, or are in any way tampered with, certain things shall happen.  Let me point out that a ballot box might be maliciously injured, but none of the papers might be injured.  Perhaps the Minister will look into that point.</P>
      <P>Under Section 27 no person who has voted at a referendum shall be required in any legal proceeding to state the manner in which he has voted.  Does that prevent him from stating in what manner he voted?  He might have a wish to say how he voted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>He will not be compelled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The next section I wish to deal with is Section 34, which deals with referendum petitions.  The Minister made reference to those normal and, one might say, venial offences which are all described in the Corrupt Practices Act &mdash; bribery, treason and so on.  Is there not a major case that the Minister has forgotten? What worse instance of corruption could you have than to make a <Col N="130" /> case for or against a referendum on false premises?  There is no provision for that.  Should it not be within the competence of an ordinary citizen to bring a person into court and prohibit him from issuing a false statement either for or against a measure which is the subject of a referendum?  That would appear to me to be a far greater offence than bribery or treason.  I do not know anyone in this country sufficiently wealthy to bribe or influence electors in such a way as to endanger a measure or get it passed.</P>
      <P>The next section is Section 35.  There is permission given here to the Attorney-General to take action himself, and the Attorney-General is not at a penny loss, no matter in what way he may mismanage this whole business. Presumably, Attorneys-General never make a mistake, never commit anybody to any expense that could be properly avoided: no servant of the State ever does a thing of that sort.  That is what we are assuming.  I do not place so much confidence in that particular order of the community, if for no other reason than the fact that they seem to suspect everybody else.  Now, take sub-section (c) of Section 36.  An ordinary person who lodges a petition has to put down £1,000.  It is a fairly strong backing for your opinion, even if it be for the good of the State, that for the particular ideal you would have in mind you have got to back it with £1,000.  It may not even be enough money in a case of this sort.  A man may, in all good faith, think that he has got a good case for lodging a petition against a referendum, and the fact that it is going to cost him £1,000 may prevent him.  Is the £1,000 there intended to prevent petitions?  I wonder is there any member of the Ministry who would put himself to the expense of paying £1,000 to contest a referendum upon a matter which affects everybody in the State?  I do not think so.  I am not putting any limitation upon the wealth of the Ministry, but upon their discretion, and although I would not commend their discretion in other directions, I would certainly commend it in that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The next one is Section 38.  What is the issue to be decided on a petition? <Col N="131" /> If we are to take what the Minister has told us this evening it is principally bribery, corruption and, perhaps, intimidation. Is it necessary to have three judges in a case of that sort, or to fashion an expensive and very elaborate machinery to discover some small thing?  The Minister has in mind, perhaps, some enterprising individual who sees a prospect, perhaps, of making some money and who treats people and spends money in that way. Now, if that man were on trial for his life we would put only one judge to try him, but here, for bribery, corruption and all the rest of it, we have three judges.  Have we not confidence in the discretion of one?  What is the necessity for three?  The Minister may have a good case for it, but I should like to hear it.</P>
    <P>I think I already raised the point in connection with sub-section (h) later on in this section, which says that no person shall be asked or required to state how he voted at the referendum.  Take just one case.  A man has been treated, we will say, by A, with a view to getting him to vote for the referendum. We turn up his vote to see what way he has voted, and we find that he has voted against the referendum.  What is the Minister going to do in a case of that sort?  Will the three judges decide on it?  The man has been bought, but not sold; he has retained his independence although he has taken the money from the other side, or the liquor, as the case may be.</P>
    <P>Now, with regard to sub-section (i) of Section 38, assuming that the costs are against the Attorney-General in this case, what is going to happen?  He will not have to pay them, but the person who takes the petition will probably get his costs paid on this basis: that he will only be allowed, let us say, one senior counsel and a junior, or he might have two seniors or perhaps three and only be allowed one junior, and so on.  He may be at a loss, but the Attorney-General will not be at any loss.  There is nothing against the Attorney-General.  Of course, I am not referring to the present Attorney-General, but I am considering the <Col N="132" /> whole business with a view to the future.  Now, let us come to Section 40. There we are assuming that a certain number of cases of corruption and of intimidation have arisen, a limited number.  We will take what has happened some years ago in this country, where the court actually counted votes which were disputed; those persons were impugned or at least debarred from voting by law, but they voted. Those were deducted from the count, and there was no necessity to hold another election.  The holding of another election, in certain circumstances, would probably get 20 per cent. of the electorate turning up to vote at the second election in a constituency.  Why not eliminate the votes that are wrong, and simply give a check on that basis instead of having the expense of another election?  It would not cover all cases.  There are certain cases in which, if there was intimidation, perhaps you would require to have another election, but in any case it is obvious that once a petition has taken place and discreditable proceedings are exposed, there will not be any interest taken in that particular constituency, in my view, at any rate, when the next referendum or another election is taken.</P>
    <P>Now come to sub-section (2) of Section 40.  Where a mistake in the use of forms may have been made, it is not considered sufficient to disqualify the referendum in any constituency. There again we take to ourselves a sort of privilege for servants of the State. We are not so considerate when we are dealing with other people.  As I said already, as far as I can see &mdash; and I read this Bill when it was issued&mdash; there does not seem to be any provision for checking the count, or for having a recount, which is a strange thing.  At a general election it is open to a candidate to demand a recount.  There are cases in which, by reason of the peculiarities of proportional representation, a mistake might easily creep in, and a check or recount may be necessary in certain cases.  Apparently it is not necessary here.  The Minister may recollect an election which took place in this country in 1917, where the returning officer was on the point of <Col N="133" /> declaring a certain candidate elected, when 50 votes turned up for the other candidate, which gave exactly the opposite result.  The last point is this &mdash;I do not know whether it is in the Constitution or not &mdash; that the proposal submitted by referendum will be held to have been vetoed if the majority vote against it, subject to the provision that there is one-third of the electorate in the majority.  Is that right?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">

      <P>It is very rarely that 66? per cent. of the electorate votes at a general election.  I do not think they voted at the general election which dealt with the referendum.  Now we require half of that number to veto legislation. However, if it is in the Constitution, that settles the matter.  It is probably with a view to saving expense that all the questions are put on the one ballot paper.  In my view, there ought to be three ballot papers if there are three questions, or two ballot papers if there are two questions.  The people are not accustomed to referenda at all.  It appears to me that a mistake might very easily occur which might invalidate the whole ballot paper. Quite a number of people put their names on, or write &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;No&rdquo;. In fact, if the Minister looks it up, I think he will find that the Constitution did not pass at all.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>If he inquires he probably will find it did not.  The idea in this case is to get what is in the people's minds, not to regulate them as if they were sheep or cattle, or something of that sort.  That is the law, a sheep or cattle arrangement. Some returning officers exercise a very wide discretion with regard to those matters.  People are not accustomed <Col N="134" /> to voting by referendum, and if there are two questions it is quite possible that a number of them would think that they could not approve of one and disapprove of the other.  Quite a number of people will have that idea in their minds, that they must be all out for both.  If they got two ballot papers, they might realise that they could do whatever appeared to them to be best in both cases.</P>
      <P>Finally, I want to stress the point I made in the beginning.  To my mind, the most corrupt thing that could be done in connection with the referendum is to make a false case for its passing or for its rejection.  I think it is much more serious than any of those minor complaints which are embodied in what is called the Corrupt Practice Act.  They are, if I might say so, merely the imperfections; the other thing is a conspiracy, and it is much more serious on that account.  It is dangerous to allow a referendum to be made the sport of irresponsible and untrue propaganda, either for or against.  We ought to have reached the stage in public life in this country when every man would be honest enough to admit that a case should stand or fall on its merits, and that it should not be the sport of political manoeuvring of any sort.</P>

      <P>A number of the points which Deputy Cosgrave has raised might perhaps be better discussed in Committee.  As he himself said, this ought to be a noncontroversial measure.  I am perfectly certain that all anyone is concerned about in any section of the House is to secure machinery which will operate effectively and equitably.  I should say, however, something with regard to some of the matters which he has raised.  For instance, on the suggestion in relation to Section 21, that we have made no provision for a penalty for the making of a wrong declaration in regard to age, or any of those matters, if it can be proven that a person has made a wrong declaration, then I think it will be found that Section 29, which applies, in general, practically the whole of the Prevention of Electoral Abuses Act, 1923, to the taking of a <Col N="135" /> referendum, covers that point.  In relation to the point which he made in regard to sub-section (6) of Section 17, I pointed out, I think, to the Deputy when he was speaking that sub-section (5) permits a personation agent to leave the polling station when he has obtained the permission of the presiding officer and has deposited with that officer, for the duration of his absence, the registers, books and documents upon which he has made any note, writing or mark during the poll.  As the presiding officer, in fact, I think, has to be in his place for the whole of the day, it is very unlikely that he would not be available to give the necessary permission in a case of need.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Some special provision would have to be made to meet that case.  I will look into the point which the Deputy raised in regard to Section 24, that is to say that where a box has been tampered with, but not so tampered with as to leave the ballot papers in it open to the suspicion that they also have been tampered with, there should be no need to close the poll or no need to declare the polling void.  I have already dealt with the point which the Deputy made, that under Section 27 a person could not, even if he wished, disclose the manner in which he voted at a referendum, presumably for the purposes of court proceedings. I have already pointed out that the only thing Section 27 does is to protect a person against being compelled to make such a disclosure under improper coercion.  I did not quite get the point which the Deputy made in relation to the Attorney-General, under Section 34, but when I see the Parliamentary Debates I will look into whatever point he was making in that regard and give it consideration. I think the same applies to Section 35.  With regard to Section 36, I would like to say with reference to the point which the Deputy made, as to where a corrupt practice such as bribery was indulged in, in an isolated <Col N="136" /> case, that it would be quite wrong to upset the position in relation to it because it could not, in fact, upset the result of the referendum.  Paragraph (d) of Section 36 makes it clear that in order to question the provisional certificate a person must be in a position to allege that the corrupt practices prevailed extensively.  We all know that you cannot prevent that sort of thing happening in isolated cases, and that it would be a counsel of perfection or imperfection to upset an election result or the result of a referendum merely on the grounds that it happened in a few isolated instances here and there.  Paragraph (g) bears that in mind because it provides, in order that there should be ground for the petition, that the corrupt practices must have prevailed extensively.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>It might but I am afraid there are few people who would risk £1,000 on an isolated case.  It is one of the advantages of the provision regarding the £1,000 that it prevents vexatious petitions.  If we did not require a petitioner to make a reasonable deposit, there is no doubt we would be plagued with vexatious petitions. Anyone who has knowledge of general elections or elections of any sort, knows that one will always hear of the unfair tactics and the illegal practices that were indulged in by opponents including misstatements of the facts in regard to any proposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Paragraph (a) of sub-section (1), Section 48, has been questioned because it requires the petition to be tried before three judges.  Where a referendum is taken on a matter of such national importance that the petitioner is prepared to deposit £1,000 in order to have his grievance investigated by the court, I think the least we should do is to give him a fair tribunal.  I think any Deputy who has had experience of election petitions as I happen to have had in two cases, will know the bitterness, the enthusiasm and the zeal with which they <Col N="137" /> are fought and the general suspicion that haunts both sides in regard to those who have to determine them. Accordingly we must endeavour to give every assurance to those who are involved in proceedings of this sort that the petition will be considered and adjudicated upon, not merely impartially but that there will be at least a majority verdict and that there will be a concurrence of judicial minds in determining the result of the petition.</P>
    <P>With regard to the point made by the Deputy that whereas we propose to have three judges to try a petition, only one judge is required to try a man for his life, I might point out that it is not the judge who tries a man for his life.  He merely conducts the trial; the verdict, in fact, is arrived at by a jury of 12 persons. Another point raised by the Deputy had reference to the non-stamping of ballot papers.  That is a very difficult matter to decide.  I do not see how, where your machinery has to be operated by ordinary fallible human beings, you are going to safeguard a person against the consequences of a mistake of that kind.  Anyone who has knowledge of the conditions under which ballots are conducted, particularly in densely populated centres like some of the districts in Dublin, will know that it would be expecting a person to be endowed with superhuman caution and prudence, to avoid some mistakes in these matters.  While it is true that ballot papers are from time to time unstamped, nevertheless, taking into consideration the magnitude of the poll in some districts, the number of unstamped papers, by comparison with the number of people who vote, is infinitesimal.</P>
    <P>If you regard the stamping of ballot papers by the presiding officer as an absolute precaution to ensure the validity of the ballot papers, I do not see how you can do anything else except to reject those ballot papers which do not bear any mark to show that they have been validly issued by the presiding officer.  There is no way out of the difficulty.  Some voters would feel greatly aggrieved, no doubt, <Col N="138" /> if they knew that their particular ballot papers were the ones rejected but the number, as I say, is usually infinitesimal. There is no way in which you can dispense with that safeguard. I do not think you can give any further protection to the voter whose vote is lost because of an oversight on the part of the presiding officer.  Of course, if the oversight is traceable to any culpable negligence, under Section 31 of the Bill the officer becomes liable for his neglect.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Dr. Ward)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time. Under the Public Health Acts a sanitary authority may acquire any land covered with water, or a right to take <Col N="139" /> and convey water for the purpose of a public water supply.  If they cannot acquire either the land or the rights by agreement they may petition the Minister for compulsory powers.  If the petition is acceded to in whole or in part, the rights acquired by the sanitary authority are those described in the Provisional Order of the Minister, as confirmed.  No rights can be conferred by the order that are not sought in the petition.</P>
      <P>Where the source of a public water supply is a river or stream there may be several riparian interests affected. The rights of a lower riparian owner might be held to be injuriously affected if the supply of water in a stream is altered by the extraction of water for public purposes, even though there is no appreciable reduction in the flow of water.  To obtain the consent or rights of every riparian owner below the intake would be a formidable task and quite unnecessary.  Yet the sanitary authority may not be secure in its rights to take water from such a source unless the consent of every riparian owner throughout the entire flow from the intake is obtained, or failing such consent, unless riparian rights are acquired. The acquisition even under the authority of a provisional order, duly confirmed, of rights at the source of supply which did not include all riparian rights would not afford to the sanitary authority the full protection that is required.</P>
      <P>There is, therefore, some doubt whether the powers conferred by the Public Health Acts should continue to be relied upon in so far as the acquisition of water rights is concerned.  It is in the public interest that a sanitary authority, when it has provided a public water supply, should not be open to any possibility of injunction at a future date and it is hoped to achieve that object in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will briefly outline the procedure to be followed.  The first step is for the sanitary authority to make a proposal setting out the source of water, the place at which the supply is to be taken, the maximum flow of water and the maximum rate at which water is <Col N="140" /> to be taken.  The notice of the proposal will be given in the public Press, and the proposal and a book of reference setting out the names of persons to whom damage may be caused will be deposited for inspection locally. The persons whose names are in the book of reference will receive notice of the proposal, and of the time within which an objection to the proposal must be lodged, a month being the minimum time.  Any person, not included in the book of reference, who is aggrieved by the proposal may object to the local authority within the time specified in the public notice, a month's notice being the minimum.  An objection to a proposal must relate to a matter other than the amount of compensation; but a question whether an objection to a proposal is a valid objection shall be submitted to and decided by the Minister.</P>
    <P>If no objection is received the proposal will be an agreed proposal.  If a valid objection is duly made the sanitary authority may apply to the Minister for a provisional order declaring that the proposal may come into force.  On such application the Minister may refuse the application, make a provisional order in accordance with the application, or alter the proposal, but in altering the proposal he cannot increase any maximum rate for the taking of water.</P>
    <P>A local inquiry may be held into an application for a provisional order.  If a provisional order is made, a copy of the order will be given to every person who made a valid objection, and such person may, within five weeks, present a petition to the Circuit Court praying that the provisional order shall not become law without further inquiry.  If no petition is presented to the Circuit Court, the Minister may confirm the provisional order, or amend it.  If a petition is presented to the Circuit Court, the provisional order may be confirmed or disallowed.  Whenever a proposal has been agreed, or a provisional order has been confirmed, notice will be given of the date on which the proposal will come into force, and on that day the proposal will come into force.  It will then be lawful for the sanitary authority to take a supply <Col N="141" /> from the source to which the proposal relates; and their rights will be absolute.</P>
    <P>The damage caused to any person by the taking of a supply of water under a proposal is defined in the Bill to mean the reduction in the value of any estate, interest or right in land, or the damage caused to any trade, business or profession.  Any person to whom damage is caused will receive compensation, but no other person. Compensation will be determined in the usual way.  The amount may be either settled by agreement or in default of agreement by arbitration.  If a person applies for compensation, and either no compensation is awarded by the arbitrator or the amount awarded does not exceed the amount which may have been offered originally by the sanitary authority, the applicant will bear his own costs, and pay the costs of the sanitary authority.  Interest on compensation will be payable at 4 per cent. per annum from the date when the scheme came into force to the date on which the compensation is determined.</P>
    <P>The position of existing schemes is safeguarded by the provisions of Section 18 of the Bill.  No court may grant or issue an injunction or order restraining the sanitary authority from continuing to take a supply from an existing source, but if there has been wrongful interference by the sanitary authority with any person's rights the person concerned may seek damages. The expression &ldquo;source of water&rdquo; is defined to mean any lake, river, stream, well, or spring.  It is not intended that a sanitary authority should be empowered to take water so as to affect navigation rights.  The existing powers of sanitary authorities derived from the Public Health Acts do not authorise them to interfere with any river or canal so as to injuriously affect navigation thereon.  An amendment to the Bill may be necessary to safeguard navigation rights where a sanitary authority proceeds under the provisions of the Bill.  The position will be further considered before Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Nobody will deny the <Col N="142" /> right of a local authority to get water where it is required.  In the case of the taking of water which affects another person's property, convenience, health, or anything of that sort it is at least expected that the local authority will pay for it.  We approach all questions of public health on that basis.  On looking through this Bill one is left to wonder whether persons who have property or conveniences such as these are not now to be regarded as public enemies.  A man is offered a certain compensation by a local authority.  If he does not accept that offer he may be penalised.  He will have to pay his own expenses and the expenses of the local authority at the arbitration, if the compensation awarded does not exceed the amount originally offered.  I disagree with that provision.  At the most a person gets 10 per cent. over and above the value of whatever he gives to the local authority when the local authority acquire it compulsorily.  That is the most he gets.  He is entitled to put his own value upon it.  The arbitrator is there to see that there is fair play.  The local authority go before the arbitrator and say: &ldquo;We have offered this man so much.&rdquo;  If the arbitrator decides that he is not to get any more, then he is penalised by having to pay his own costs and the costs of the local authority.  Then in Section 18 we are taking away what is a legal right at the present time.  The courts, after all, have an independence greater than that which attaches to a Ministry or a local authority.  Why not allow the courts to decide that question?  It is a question of equity; a question of natural right.  There is a legal privilege there of some kind or another which is really a legal right and we take it away.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In another part of the measure it says that one objection that will not be considered will be on the question of compensation.  Assuming for the moment that the water is as essential to the man in his business as the site itself or the buildings.  The compensation question is the only question at issue&mdash;that he will not be compensated for the loss that he sustains.  He is not entitled to put that forward.  That is <Col N="143" /> the only basis on which he can really make a case.  I do not think that is right.  I think the Minister ought to consider first of all the riparian owners, and the taking of water at a level which would not leave them what they require.  It is not a question of money.  They ought to be supplied with water.  They ought not to be left high and dry.  If the Parliamentary Secretary has experience of some of the people who live in districts that are above the level of the local reservoir he will understand the terrible inconvenience it is to be without water in such a place.  If by reason of the local authority coming along and taking the water on such a level that they are left without any, it is a very nice question as to what compensation would pay them for the loss and inconvenience that they sustain.</P>
    <P>There is another point.  In a case where a person raises an objection on the grounds of compensation he ought not to be put out of the Minister's consideration for that alone.  The water is vital to him.  He could not do his business without it.  He must go elsewhere. Some alternative provision must be made for him.</P>
    <P>The third point is in regard to Section 18.  The Minister should exercise only a Ministerial responsibility, not a judicial one.  Under this section the Minister will assume a judicial character. He ought not, in his own interests. If he consults the Minister for Justice on that point he will advise him that there were very considerable difficulties in the last couple of years when, through some clause in an Act, he was called upon to exercise what amounted to a judicial function.  The question was raised in court and the result was not satisfactory.  There is no more suitable place than the courts of this country in which to have questions of that sort decided and the Minister should not take over that responsibility of the courts.</P>

      <P>I infer from what the Parliamentary Secretary said in connection with this Bill that it will short-circuit or make more simple the procedure which it is necessary to put into <Col N="144" /> operation in order to enable a local authority to proceed with a waterworks scheme.  I do not share the anxiety of Deputy Cosgrave in regard to the rights of riparian owners in connection with this matter.  I think this Bill will prevent vexatious claims which are made from time to time in connection with schemes of this kind and which are often responsible for a good deal of procrastination and prevent local authorities from proceeding with waterworks schemes.  I have had a good deal of experience in connection with schemes of this nature and my opinion is that anybody who has a genuine claim has always been justly and liberally dealt with.  There are certain vexatious claims by people who want to make easy money when a local authority embarks upon a scheme of this kind.  As I have said, they have been responsible for a certain amount of procrastination and have been instrumental in preventing local authorities from proceeding with their schemes.  I welcome the Bill.  I think it will simplify the procedure and will enable a good many local authorities who have been endeavouring to proceed with schemes of this kind for a long time to get ahead with the work.</P>

      <P>I do not know that I would agree with the interpretation put upon this Bill by Deputy Corish. At least, that case has not been advanced by the Parliamentary Secretary in moving the Bill.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>That may be, but I am afraid this Bill will not get them out of any difficulty whatever.  This Bill, according to the mover, is simply going to get over this difficulty, that there is some doubt as to the position of water supplies already in existence.  The Parliamentary Secretary has not told the House that there are any difficulties whatever with regard to certain local authorities at the present time in <Col N="145" /> acquiring water or that they are prevented by any reason, outside what is in the Bill, or that this Bill is going to get over the difficulties.  As far as riparian owners are concerned, the Parliamentary Secretary, apparently, is of the opinion that they might be able to assert their rights if they knew they had them.  Consequently, he wants to prevent anything of that kind happening by giving a right of injunction.</P>

    <P>One wonders why the Bill is introduced at all unless there is really a necessity for it.  The Parliamentary Secretary has not told us that there is a necessity for it.  The only apparent necessity that exists is covered in Section 18, and if, as Deputy Cosgrave has pointed out, we are trying to override the courts by bringing in such a section and preventing the courts from having jurisdiction over matters that are already dealt with as far as local authorities are concerned, then we are doing a definite wrong.  I do not think we have any right to do that and I do not think we ought to assume that we have that right.  If a local authority can take away completely a water supply from a man's farm or other business which he may be carrying on without adequate compensation, I think that is something we should not stand over.  Apparently, no local authority can take water from a stream or another water supply so as to injuriously affect navigation thereon.  The Parliamentary Secretary told us that. There we have certain rights that may not be infringed.  We cannot touch upon those.  If we interfere with navigation rights, even though it may be an old disused canal, we cannot go in there, but if it happens to be a man's sole water supply for his farm, apparently we can go and take the whole thing from him, and we have to be subject to some person appointed as an arbitrator.  We have not the right to go into court.  As Deputy Cosgrave pointed out, we are coming to the stage in this country when some person appointed on behalf of the Minister will have the right to say to people all over the country: &ldquo;You must do this and your compensation will be so and so; if not, we will take it off you.&rdquo;  That is not a very happy position in which <Col N="146" /> to find ourselves.  The right to go to court should be there.  Unless local authorities have been prevented in the past from taking water which they should have been allowed to take or that it was necessary for them to take, we ought to be very careful of the type of Bill we bring in, giving a local authority the right to override all the rights of the owners in and around places where water is required.</P>
    <P>As I have said already, I appreciate any effort that is made which would be helpful towards the acquisition of water for various towns.  I have been connected with local authorities for a great number of years and I do not think we have ever come up against a difficulty which the Bill will get us over.  I do not think it is going to do anything in that direction.  We have never been refused rights to take water.  I do not know of any local authority that has been refused. Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary has in mind some local authorities that have been refused.  If that is so, it will be found that there was very good reason for it.  If a farm of land is going to be rendered practically useless because the water would be completely taken off it, then I think the owner must have rights beyond the rights of an arbitrator's award.  I do not think that is good enough.  I wonder if in Section 3 the Minister is meeting exactly what might be the best interests of a local authority in putting down in the Bill that a local authority must state in the proposal the minimum amount of water at such a place and the maximum rate at which it is proposed to be taken.  I wonder what would be the position of a local authority if the maximum rate of water to be taken from a particular source increased as a result of increased users. Where would the local authority find itself then?  Would they then be liable to an injunction to restrain them from taking further water?  We might in fact be putting a halter or spancel on the local authority by putting something of that nature in this Bill.</P>

      <P>The main criticism, in so far as there has been criticism of the Bill, has centred around Section 18.  It <Col N="147" /> is stated that when this Bill is passed a person cannot seek an injunction against the local authority or secure an injunction in the court, but I think that, on full examination, most Deputies will agree that that is a desirable position.  The right of the community as a whole, or the community in the urban area, that is depending on the water supply must be held to be of more importance than the questionable right of the person perhaps miles away from the source.</P>
      <P>Deputy Brennan probably knows that in recent times those very far removed from the source of the water supply have taken it into their heads that something might be made out of seeking an injunction in the courts, and a form of litigation might become popular which might not have much real substance in it but which might create considerable embarrassment for local authorities.  So long as the principle is established and maintained in legislation that full compensation will be awarded to anybody who is, in fact, damaged&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>The person seeking the compensation will not be satisfied that it is as full as it ought to be, but the arbitrator will be a person of independent judgment and, in so far as he can estimate the degree of damage, he will give full compensation. Deputy Cosgrave made a point against ruling out as a basis of valid objection the question of compensation.  I should like to look into that further. It seems to me that 90 per cent. of the claims for compensation would go to court if Deputy Cosgrave's point were met.  The arbitration method of settling compensation is more simple and less expensive and, I think, more desirable.  However, I shall look into the point further.  Deputy Brennan drew a picture of the possibility of farmers or riparian owners along the source of supply being completely deprived of water supply.  I think that is highly improbable.  Where that is possible, the local authority would <Col N="148" /> endeavour to procure an alternative supply and the matter would be taken into consideration by the arbitrator.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>The proposal will set out a minimum and a maximum rate which will be determined as a result of gauging.  If, at a future time, it is found that the water supply provided for is not sufficient to meet the requirements of the local authority, the local authority would have to come along with an amending scheme.  They could not continue to take a larger quantity than set out in the original proposal and leave the riparian owners high and dry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  This Bill is one of a number of similar Bills which has come before the House from time <Col N="149" /> to time to confirm orders made under the Emergency Imposition of Duties Act, 1932.  An order made under that Act by the Government requires to be confirmed by legislation within eight months.  The orders being confirmed by this Bill are not of major importance. Three of them&mdash;Nos. 70, 155 and 214&mdash;were made solely for the purpose of giving the Government power to issue licences for the duty-free importation of the articles in question. Until these orders were made there was no power to permit duty-free importation of these articles in any circumstances. It was considered desirable that this power should be obtained and these orders were made.  The other two orders mentioned in the Schedule result from recommendations made by the Prices Commission following reviews conducted by the commission of the duties in operation under the terms of the trade agreement with Great Britain made in 1938. As Deputies will remember, that trade agreement required that certain duties should be submitted to review by the Prices Commission.</P>
      <P>We undertook to modify these duties if the commission so recommended, and to the extent that it so recommended. The commission, in accordance with the terms of the agreement, was asked to review the duties on certain clocks and on certain hollow-ware, and in due course its reports were presented, recommending certain modifications in the duties in each case.  In the case of the duty upon clocks, which was a flat rate duty, the commission recommended the institution of a preferential rate for goods originating in the United Kingdom, and in the case of the duty upon hollow-ware it recommended a reduction from 40 per cent. to 30 per cent. in the preferential rate applicable to goods of British origin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These orders have been made, and I am now asking for confirmation of them.  I should mention that the first order in the Schedule&mdash;Order 70&mdash; was made on 15th March, 1941, and must be confirmed before 14th November; otherwise it lapses.  It is undesirable that that order should lapse, and hence I am asking the Dáil to <Col N="150" /> facilitate me in getting the Bill through the Dáil and the Seanad before the 14th November, by adopting all stages of the Bill to-day if there is no opposition to the measure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said that the reason for passing the first three of these duties was in order to enable the licensing of duty free importation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not apparent to me how that works out, but I take the Minister's word for it.  I do not suppose these are very important duties. I want to take this opportunity of reminding the Minister that, while it is very important to have power to allow importations duty free&mdash;and I entirely agree with it&mdash;to do that suddenly can impose great hardship on individual traders.  One man may just have brought in a large consignment, and, although it may be to the interests of the country to do so, another person, a rival of his, may obtain his goods duty free.  I would ask the Minister how far he can keep the commercial community in touch with the policy of the Government in these duty-free importations. At the present time, it seems as if anybody who can obtain supplies from anywhere is doing a service to the country. I suggest to the Minister that that requires long-term preparation.  The person bringing in the goods would require to be able to give the supplier some idea as to how long the market was going to continue.  At the present time we are living in a sellers' market.  The seller can pick whom he is going to give his goods to, and is certainly going to be influenced by the good-will effect on his trading.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another point that, perhaps, I might mention in passing.  It would seem as if, in spite of all the efforts that this country has made to build up Irish manufactures, that at the present time a great deal of those efforts are going to be brought to little or nothing. I suggest to the Minister that one of the reasons for that, perhaps the major reason, is that, while the manufacturing capacity of the country has <Col N="151" /> been increased, due to the policy in other directions, the holding by stockists of goods has been enormously decreased.  The consequence is that, I think, this country, on balance, has probably faced this war with much less preparation than it faced the last war. I would urge on the Minister that, even during the present crisis, he ought to see how far he can put the trading arrangements of the country on such a basis as to leave the stock-holding capacity of the country equal in some measure to the figure at which it stood before the last war.  If he does that he will probably find that he will reap the benefit of Irish manufacturing and the stock-holding capacity of the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>With reference to the first of the matters that Deputy Dockrell mentioned, I want to say that importers generally are fully informed of the policy of the Department in the matter of issue of licences.  I think no difficulty has been experienced by any trade organisations or associations in approaching the Department of Industry and Commerce and in ascertaining precisely what it is intended to do. Generally speaking, licences for commodities which are in short supply are issued on application.  The difficulty is not in obtaining a licence to import, but to make the licence effective by procuring goods.  I do not think there is any risk that the powers conferred under these orders can be used in the manner in which the Deputy suggests: that is to say, giving a licence for duty free importation in respect of goods upon which another importer has paid duty.  I am quite certain that if any such case arose we would hear all about it very quickly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, I did not suggest that for a moment. What I am suggesting is that there is a period at which the duty is taken off&mdash;just before one man has paid it and after another will not have to pay it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That is true.  That situation may arise at any time when a duty is either taken off or reduced in <Col N="152" /> size.  It may be an argument against taking off duties or reducing them in size.  On the few occasions on which that situation did arise, where for one reason or another a duty was removed or reduced, my recollection is that we made special arrangements to permit of a refund of the duty in respect of goods held in stock by an importer on which duty had been paid.  I can certainly say that we did that in the case of motor car parts which at one time were liable for duty.  When the duty was removed, an assessment was made of the amount of duty paid on these parts held by importers, and, through a vote of the Dáil, a refund of the duty was given to them.  I think that action of that kind would probably be necessary in any case where considerable hardship might result from a sudden change in the duty position.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>What period would the Minister be prepared to go back over?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>In that particular case, we went back only as far as duty was paid on stocks held by persons who themselves paid duty.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know that the Deputy is quite correct in saying that the development of industry here and the imposition of tariffs to protect these industries had produced a position in which this country entered the war period less prepared than previously in the matter of stocks.  I should say that that contention was not merely contrary to facts, but almost contrary to common sense.  These duties were imposed for the purpose of protecting the industries established here, and it seems to me that the proprietors of these industries would have had a much greater inducement to secure their own position by laying in stocks of raw materials necessary to continue production than importers normally dependent on day to day importations of manufactured goods would have had.  Not merely was there a greater inducement to the individual <Col N="153" /> firm to acquire and maintain adequate stocks of materials for manufacture, but the capital cost of maintaining these stocks would be considerably less than the capital cost of maintaining an equivalent quantity of manufactured goods.  My information is that, over a great range of commodities, it is much more true to say that our stock position was much better at the beginning of the war than it was at any time previously, or would have been, if manufacturing enterprises in relation to these goods had not been started here.</P>
      <P>It is also a point to bear in mind at the present time that, even though there may be little point in maintaining duties which are at present ineffective, because the goods to which they relate cannot be imported anyhow, except under very exceptional circumstances and on very rare occasions, we have to rely to a very great extent upon the personal efforts of the individual manufacturers here to procure supplies of materials for themselves and, of course, the enthusiasm, willingness and enterprise of these manufacturers in doing that will perhaps be influenced by the security of their position here.  Consequently, even though I do propose temporarily to suspend a number of duties which are at the moment of no importance because the goods to which they relate cannot be imported, I would not at all urge the adoption as a general policy of the removal of all duties in present circumstances.  There are cases in which, I think, action along these lines might even have the opposite effect to that intended and might prevent us rather than facilitate us in obtaining additional supplies.</P>

      <P>The Bill has been before the House for a long time and Deputies knew it would be taken to-day. As I was saying, we are proposing to effect certain amendments in the Shops (Conditions of Employment) Act, 1938.  Deputies will remember that that Act defined the normal working hours of members of staffs of shops; restricted the working of overtime; and provided for suitable meal intervals, weekly half-holidays and holidays in lieu of Sundays worked and holidays with pay.  The meaning of the word &ldquo;shop&rdquo; in that Act was made wider than the ordinary meaning of the word.  For example, it was made to include hotels and to cover any place in which, or any vehicle from which, a retail trade or business was carried on.</P>
      <P>The Shops (Conditions of Employment) Act was experimental legislation. I stated to the House when introducing it that experience would probably show in relation to it, as it has shown in relation to a number of other Acts, that subsequent amendment of it would be necessary.  I am sure there is no Deputy who would disagree with me when I say that it is almost inevitable that in legislation of this kind defects appear in operation which involve subsequent legislation.  Our experience in relation to the Shops (Conditions of Employment) Act was, therefore, no different from our experience in relation to a number of other enactments.</P>

      <P>There are four principal amendments proposed in this Bill.  The first relates to the definition of <Col N="157" /> member of the staff of a shop. That amendment is necessary because it has been indicated that the definition in the Principal Act could be construed as bringing within the scope of the measure certain clerical or transport employees, other than the <i>bona fide</i> members of the staffs of shops, who may do for the proprietor of the shop, and within the precincts of the shop, any work coming within the definition, no matter for how short a time.  In the case of a garage it might happen occasionally that one of the clerks would serve a customer with petrol.  It could happen that the driver of a delivery van might be engaged for a short period in the shop during the luncheon hour.  Although it was clearly not intended that the Act should apply to clerical workers, or transport workers, nevertheless the fact that an individual clerical or transport worker might do shop work for that period of the day would bring him within the scope of the Act.  It is now proposed to clear that up by this Bill.  The amendment which is being made defines &ldquo;members of the staff&rdquo; of shops more precisely, by making it quite clear that they must be wholly or mainly employed in the shop or in the precincts on work coming within the definition, if they are to be within the scope of the measure.  I do not think there will be any serious contention about that amendment.  It is obviously impracticable to impose the same limitations in respect of hours of work and periods of rest upon van drivers and similar classes of workers, as can be imposed upon shop assistants in the ordinary sense, and it was not intended that a purely temporary change of occupation, such as might occur in the examples I gave, should bring clerical workers within the scope of the measure, or make them subject to the same legal restrictions in respect of hours of work as members of the staff of shops proper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second amendment is also designed to restore what was the original intention in enacting the Principal Act, by excluding from the scope of the definition of &ldquo;member of the staff&rdquo; such employees as bread-van <Col N="158" /> drivers, milk roundsmen or itinerant ice-cream vendors, whose work is carried out at a distance from the shop.  It was not intended that they should be included within the scope of the original Act, because by the very nature of their work they could not comply with the requirements of the Act.  When the legislation was being enacted it was believed that it did not cover such classes of workers as bread-van drivers, milk roundsmen and ice-cream vendors.  As a result of proceedings instituted in the Circuit Court it has been held that a number of these employees engaged in direct retail sale, in addition to deliveries, come under the definition of &ldquo;member of the staff&rdquo;, and are consequently brought within the scope of the Act.  There was an appeal from that decision by the Master Bakers' Association but, by consent, the appeal was postponed.  It is, I think, recognised by all parties that the work of bread-van drivers cannot be organised on the basis of a 48-hour week and a weekly half holiday.  The nature of their work is fundamentally different from that done by a member of the staff of a shop in the ordinary sense, and their hours of work cannot be regulated on the same basis as members of the staff of shops. It is now proposed specifically to exclude bread-van drivers, milk roundsmen and ice-cream vendors from the provisions of the Principal Act, and they will be deemed always to have been excluded.  I think it was not intended that these people should be brought within the provisions of the Principal Act, since the conditions of their work did not fit into the codes laid down for industrial workers and shop assistants, and that they should not be allowed to bring their employers to court and burden these employers with very heavy liability in respect of overtime payments.  An estimate has been made that if that amendment were not effected the liability in respect of bread-van drivers would amount to no less than £30,000 per annum, and the payment of arrears of overtime on that scale since May, 1938, would be a very serious burden on the bakery trade.</P>

      <P>Hotels and restaurants. When the Act was before the Dáil Deputies will remember that I had considerable doubts about the wisdom of applying it to hotels.  I expressed these doubts then.  I stated that if they had not been in the Bill originally I would not have brought them in, because it seemed to me then, and I am convinced now, that it was wrong to attempt to define and regulate the conditions of employment of hotel <Col N="160" /> workers in a Shops Act.  It is quite obvious that circumstances operating in relation to hotels do not operate in the case of shops.  Particularly, there is a lack of uniformity in the practice of running hotels which makes general legislation affecting the conditions of employment of staffs almost impracticable.</P>
      <P>The Dáil discussed at considerable length, on the Committee Stage of the Principal Act, the various sections relating to hotels and there was, I think, considerable doubt in the minds of many members as to the wisdom of attempting to deal with hotels in that Act, and many practical difficulties were experienced in devising what appeared to be satisfactory provisions for hotel workers.  In practice, these provisions have proved inapplicable and almost inoperative.  The principal difficulties are the limitation in the over-all hours of work, the five-and-a-half day week for each employee which follows on the granting of a weekly half-holiday and compensatory relief for Sunday work.  It has been found impossible by the great majority of hotel proprietors to comply with the Act and at the same time run their hotels on an economic basis.</P>
      <P>There are many different classes of hotels in this country&mdash;the metropolitan hotel which does business fairly uniformly all the year round, the hotel in the seaside or holiday resort which opens for three or four months in the summer and closes for the rest of the year and, in between, hotels with a purely seasonal trade and hotels with other conditions affecting their trade which make it impossible for them to maintain uniform conditions for their staffs all the year round.  It is that wide variety in the different types of business carried on by hotel proprietors that, I think, justifies my remark that it is impracticable to attempt to control conditions of employment in hotels by general legislation which applies to all hotels irrespective of the circumstances. We are proposing, therefore, to amend the original Act by making it inapplicable to hotels.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have said that I thought it was a mistake originally to attempt to deal with hotels in the Shops Act.  I am <Col N="161" /> still strongly of that opinion, but I realise that this particular provision of the Bill before the House may be mistaken as a retrograde step, an attempt to undo something we have done already.  That is not so.  I do not think we have succeeded, in fact, in regulating the conditions of employment in hotels throughout the country on the lines contemplated in that Act.</P>

      <P>It is not true to say that we did not try.  The obligation was not altogether on us to try.  By that legislation we gave rights to the workers which the workers could enforce, and the fact that the workers themselves did not attempt to enforce those rights in many cases is, I think, proof that they recognised that the provisions of the measure were not altogether suited to their conditions.</P>

      <P>There are restaurants in Dublin which do a normal type of business at recognised hours for every day of the week all the year round. There are no recognised hours for restaurants at the seaside that do practically no business except on Sundays and bank holidays and there are restaurants that do not even open except during the summer months.  Precisely the same difficulties arise in relation to the restaurant business as in the case of the hotel business.  I would say that these difficulties arise in all businesses catering for the public in that particular way, that is, in the provision of cooked meals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendment which has been put down upon the Order Paper on the Second Reading of the Bill urging that it should be postponed, until a commission has ascertained what difficulties were experienced in the application to the hotels of the Act, and <Col N="162" /> presents a report thereon to the Dáil, would not get us anywhere.  I do not know that a commission of the kind could give any more information than is available, not merely to me as Minister for Industry and Commerce or to the officers of my Department, but to members of the House.  I believe most members of the House know that difficulties arose in applying this measure to hotels and that in fact, over a great part of the country it is inoperative so far as hotels are concerned.</P>
    <P>I am prepared to admit that conditions in Dublin are different from conditions in the rest of the country.  It is possible to apply the provisions of the Act to hotels in Dublin.  In fact, the trade unions catering for hotel workers had succeeded in obtaining almost similar conditions by trade union action and agreement with the hotel proprietors, and I know that these unions are now somewhat apprehensive of the results of the change which this Bill will effect.  They claim &mdash; and perhaps justly claim &mdash; that since the original Act became law they have been relying more and more upon its provisions and not attempting to insert in the agreements which they made with employers conditions they considered to be embodied in the law in any event and consequently not necessary for them to obtain for their members through their own efforts. They felt that the members had these privileges in any event, and, consequently, that they need not pay particular attention to these matters in any of their agreements.</P>
    <P>Representations were made to my predecessor by unions catering for hotel workers in the matter, and he undertook to consider the practicability of inserting in the Bill in Committee the provision maintaining its application to hotel workers in the Borough of Dublin.  I am prepared to submit to the Dáil an amendment on those lines.  I think it is possible to regulate conditions of employment in hotels on the lines contemplated by the original Act in a place like Dublin, where there is considerable uniformity in the business done by all the hotels within the area and where no very great anomalies will arise.  We can <Col N="163" /> discuss that in Committee when I produce the amendment.</P>
    <P>To clear up one point which was mentioned, I should make it clear that the amending Bill does not exclude from the scope of the Principal Act restaurants as such.  It is only restaurants which are attached to hotels which are excluded.</P>
    <P>The fourth amendment relates to the tea interval in chemists' shops.  It is a minor change.  The Act provides that where the hours of work include the hours from 4 p.m. to 7.30 p.m. an interval of not less than half an hour should be allowed for tea between those hours.  In the great majority of chemists' shops there is a qualified proprietor and one, or perhaps two, qualified assistants.  Under the Pharmacy Act it is required that there should always be a qualified assistant present in the shop.  It is, therefore, obviously impossible for the working proprietor or one of the assistants to get a half-holiday if we maintained the original provision of the Shops (Conditions of Employment) Act, because the proprietor would have to come back for the half-hour while the qualified assistant was having tea, or else he would be breaking the Shops (Conditions of Employment) Act or alternatively breaking the Pharmacy Act.  We propose, therefore, to provide that in the case of chemists' shops in which two qualified assistants are employed the tea interval requirement may be dispensed with on the day on which one of the qualified assistants is allowed a half-holiday.  I think that is a reasonable amendment of the original Act to meet the difficulty to which I have referred.</P>
    <P>I should point out, generally, that employees who were formerly within the scope of the Shops (Conditions of Employment) Act and on that account were excluded from the provisions of the Holidays (Employees) Act of 1939, but who, consequent on the passage of this measure, will no longer be covered by the Shops (Conditions of Employment) Act, will automatically come within the scope of the Holidays (Employees) Act and will remain entitled <Col N="164" /> to annual and public holidays with pay.</P>
    <P>These are the four amendments of the Principal Act which experience shows are necessary.  There are only two which may cause any discussion here.  One relates to the exclusion of bread-van drivers, itinerant ice-cream vendors and milk roundsmen, and the other relates to hotels.  I think the reasonableness of the other two amendments will not be contested. There was no doubt as to what was necessary to enable the Act to be operative.  In the case of the bread-van drivers and itinerant shop assistants, we did not intend that the Principal Act should apply to them.  We are, therefore, merely bringing the law into conformity with what was the original idea when the 1938 Act was being framed.</P>
    <P>In the case of the hotels, while there can be no question of our intention to cover the hotels in the Act of 1938, it is beyond contention that outside Dublin we did not succeed in doing it, and it is felt that it is better to mend our hand at this stage rather than keep on the Statute Book legal provisions of that kind which cannot be made operative.</P>

      <P>Dáil Eáireann declines to give this Bill a Second Reading pending the setting up of a commission to ascertain what (if any) difficulties were experienced in the application to hotels of the Shops (Conditions of Employment) Act, 1938, and the presentation to Dáil Eireann of the report of such commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Listening to the Minister, it seemed to me that he made no case for the exclusion of hotels from the scope of the Shops (Conditions of Employment) Act. Not once in the course of his statement has he attempted to show that the Act <Col N="165" /> was unworkable from the point of view of the staff.  He did not adduce any evidence that the public complained that the Principal Act imposed on hotels any burden of a character which reflected itself in irksome conditions so far as patrons were concerned.  The only body pressing for an amendment of the Act is the hotel proprietors and they have apparently succeeded, through their organisation, in convincing the Minister to allow them to do what they like with their employees once the Act is amended.</P>
    <P>The main benefits of the parent Act were that it provided the workers with a controlled working week; it ensured a maximum working week of 56 hours. It provided them also with a weekly half-holiday and, in the areas in which the Act was allowed to operate, it definitely, had the effect of increasing employment in the hotel industry.  We are now having an amending Bill offered to us and one of the effects of it will be that it will repeal the 56 hour week and will permit employers to work their employees for an unlimited number of hours. In addition, the right to a weekly half-holiday will be taken away from the hotel workers because the Act of 1938 repeals the Shops Act of 1912 and it seems therefore that no half holiday provision is retained so far as the hotel workers are concerned.</P>
    <P>If employers are to be allowed to exploit workers for any number of hours per week and to deny them a weekly half-holiday and maintain the other types of exploitation which were controlled in some measure by the parent Act you will inevitably have a loss of the employment which the parent Act created in its application to the hotel industry.  The Minister will not attempt to deny that when this Bill is passed it will be possible for hotel proprietors to exploit workers to the extent of compelling them to work seven days a week, a piece of exploitation which was not permitted by the parent Act.  He will hardly deny that it will be possible for the hotel proprietors to go back to the condition of affairs with which the parent Act dealt, the condition of affairs to remedy which it was introduced and recommended to the House.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="166" /> As everybody with any experience of the hotel business knows, hotel work is extremely trying and very often is an exhausting type of work.  Hotel workers are expected to be alert from the time they come on duty until they go off.  They have to try to please citizens who are not always in the best of humour.  They have to work in heats and fumes and, so far as hotel kitchens are concerned, they have to work in a very unpleasant atmosphere.  Even where the workers' hours are confined to 48 per week, the long spread-over of the hours is such as to make the occupation extremely tiring and exhausting. You must remember that a very large number of young girls are employed at hotel work.  It is a very common thing on most nights in the week to find that hotel waitresses are required to work until ten, eleven and 12 o'clock, having commenced their day's work early in the morning.  Since the outbreak of the present war these hotel workers have not secured any increase in wages.  On the top of having, therefore, to adjust their pre-war wages to war-time conditions of living, they are now being compelled to tolerate a worsening of their conditions as envisaged by this amending Bill.</P>
    <P>The Bill which we are now being asked to pass, will, as I said, enable hotel employers to exercise a free hand in respect of their workers.  Control, from the point of view of hours, half-holidays and other conditions, simply goes by the board, and employers of an unscrupulous kind are being invited by this Bill to assail the conditions of employment of the workers where these conditions have been established.  At a time when Ministers are telling us of the desirability of establishing industrial peace and concord during this emergency period the Minister opens up the possibility that so far as the hotel industry is concerned it offers a very favourable ground, not for industrial peace but for industrial friction.</P>
    <P>The parent Act, of course, got no fair chance whatever.  The Department made no effort whatever to administer that Act in so far as the hotels were concerned outside Dublin, and even in <Col N="167" /> Dublin its administration was largely enforced by the union and through the vigilance of the union catering for hotel workers.  The Minister asked this House to pass that Act and to extend this protection to hotel workers, but once the Act was passed the Department did nothing whatever to administer its provisions.  It allowed the law to be set at naught and permitted every unscrupulous employer to disregard the law and to do what he liked in open defiance of our legislation and in open defiance of the Minister's inspectorial staff.  Provincial hotel workers, being unorganised, were helpless and utterly inarticulate.  They had to stand helplessly by and see the Department give apparent approbation to a denial to them of their rights under the parent Act.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Why were they helpless?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>They were helpless, firstly, because they were unorganised. They were faced on the one hand by well organised employers, and then they saw the Department of Industry and Commerce, which ought to administer the Act, being, if anything, on the side of the employers, doing nothing to administer the Act, but aiding and abetting the employers to set the law at defiance.  Provincial hotel employers, as everybody knows, have not ceased to moan since the Act was passed that it was an unfair burden on them.  Anything that would tend to improve the working conditions of their employees, or to reduce their hours below 72 per week was something that the employers could not tolerate.  Apparently, at long last, they were able to get a sympathetic ear from the Minister, and the result is the introduction of this Bill, only at the request of the hotel employers and not at the request of the staffs or of the public.  If this amending Bill is passed, all the protection which the hotel staffs have had, even though in some respects it was only nominal, is now gone.  The old conditions are re-enthroned and hotel proprietors will be able to do just what they like, as they are doing what they like, with <Col N="168" /> hotel employees in those areas where there is no trade union organisation to set up standards of wages and conditions.</P>
      <P>It is well known &mdash; and anybody who cares to investigate the position will establish the truth of what I assert &mdash; that hotel staffs in provincial centres are paid notoriously low wages and are compelled to work intolerably long hours.  Seventy-two hours a week is a common week for young waitresses in hotels, and in some instances not only do they not receive any wages but some hotel proprietors, who probably would not deny that they are bound to take some notice of Papal Encyclicals, even have the hardihood to ask their employees to pay for being allowed to work for nothing in a hotel. I think I reported to the Minister's own Department the case of a hotel in my constituency where a waiter is compelled to pay 7/6 a week for his job.  He gets no wages whatever from the proprietor and he is expected to work from early morning until late at night, first to get back his own 7/6, and then to earn a sufficient wage to enable him to keep his wife and four children as well.  In the face of conditions of that kind one would imagine that the Minister's whole bent would be towards the regulation of wages and conditions of employment in that industry, but instead of that we have him sitting back and acting as a mouthpiece or microphone for the employers who are responsible for conditions of that kind, and that is the type of employer who is responsible for the agitation to have the Act amended in the way the Minister proposes to amend it.</P>
      <P>That hotel to which I have referred regards itself and advertises itself as a first-class provincial hotel, and it is in hotels of that type that the workers are compelled to work 72 hours a week and all day on Sunday and, by reason of having to pay for their job, in some cases, are compelled to extend their hours voluntarily beyond that in order to get some remuneration from the customers, because they will get no remuneration whatever from the proprietor for whom they work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When conditions of that kind exist <Col N="169" /> in the hotel industry it is not to be wondered at that the employers want to escape from any type of regulation or control of the conditions and wages of their employees in the industry.  No reason has been given by the Minister to show that any difficulties of an insuperable kind were experienced, in so far as the application of the parent Act to the hotel workers was concerned. The Act, as I said, was never given a fair trial except, perhaps, in Dublin where the workers were organised in trade unions which ensured its recognition.  Throughout the country the Act has been set at defiance and employers simply did what they liked.  The Minister never tried to give the Act a trial or to make it work.  Whatever difficulties of a minor kind were experienced in the application of the Act even to small provincial hotels, some effort should have been made to secure the operation of the main provisions of the Act, and any amendment that might be necessary should be only directed towards the removal of these pieces of friction which, perhaps, creep into even the best contemplated type of legislation.</P>
    <P>I say that the House ought not to be asked to give a Second Reading to this Bill until such time as the House knows what precise difficulties were experienced in the operation of the main Act and until such time as it has had an opportunity of examining these difficulties and making regulations which would ensure that the main provisions, in respect of control and regulation, were continued for hotel workers even if at some later date it may be necessary to remove whatever friction has arisen by the application of the Act in insignificant directions.  If the Minister believes that there should be control and regulation of hours and half holidays and Sunday work for hotel workers, and if he feels that that cannot conveniently be done under the parent Act, then the least he should do is to set out for the information of the Dáil, in a seperate Bill, what he proposes to do to ensure the continuance of control in that direction, rather than come to the House and ask <Col N="170" /> the House to scrap the rights which the hotel workers have already secured and offer to put nothing in their place.  The Minister has made no case whatever for the application of this amending Bill in so far as hotel workers are concerned, whatever case he may be able to make in respect of pharmacists, and he ought to agree to maintain the present provisions for hotel workers until such time as he is able to give to hotel workers some comprehensive charter which would take cognisance of their special vocational difficulties, while at the same time recognising that the industry is one which is eminently suitable for control and regulation in respect of hours, wages, and conditions. The Minister is not doing that in this instance.  He is merely tearing up the charter which hotel workers have had, and putting nothing whatever in its place.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>In seconding the motion I hope the House will not give a Second Reading to this Bill.  It was rather disappointing to hear the Minister trying to justify this Bill by saying that the previous Act was an experimental one. He went on to say that in all this experimental legislation there were always defects appearing, but he has not yet told us what were the difficulties of working the previous Act.  I went into a certain hotel this summer for a week-end with some friends.  It was late when we arrived, and the girl who attended us at 11.30 was on duty at 7.30 the following morning.  On the following night we were also late in coming into the hotel and the same girl was on duty.  I said: &ldquo;Is it possible that you have been on duty since Saturday evening?&rdquo;  She said: &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; I asked: &ldquo;How many hours have you been on duty?&rdquo;  Her reply was: &ldquo;I could hardly tell you how many hours I have been working.&rdquo;  In the course of conversation she was afraid to express her opinions to me, but outside the restaurant she told me that she was paying 10/6 per week for the privilege of working in the hotel.  She also told me that the head waitress, whom I had looked on as the lady in charge, was paying 15/- for the privilege.  The man known as the &ldquo;boots&rdquo; was also paying <Col N="171" /> 10/- for the privilege of working in the hotel, and was not getting one penny wages.  Those are the workers whom the Minister is seeking to exclude from the Bill.  Those are the hotel proprietors to whose assistance the Minister is coming.  I have some experience of negotiating on behalf of hotel workers, and I have had continuous complaints from manageresses about the frequent illnesses of girls employed on restaurant and hotel work.  I am satisfied that those illnesses are due to their long hours on the class of work on which they are engaged.</P>
      <P>I think the Minister should be the last man to ask this House to give this amending Bill a Second Reading.  I hope it will not do so.  I remember seeing a statement in a paper from the director of one particular hotel in the country in which he mentioned that the working of this Act entailed over £1,000 expenditure in the previous year.  Notwithstanding that, he paid a very substantial dividend to the shareholders, and I am at a loss to understand how the Minister can say that the Act was such a disadvantage to the hotel proprietors.  I know that from the very day when the first Bill was introduced and going through this House there was a campaign by provincial hotel keepers and hotel keepers as a whole to try to defeat the Act, but the Minister seems to be influenced by them rather than by any other consideration. We have heard great talk about the Tourist Association, and public money is being spent on that association and its activities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is it contended that hotel workers, who have to work from early morning until late at night, are not entitled to some consideration?  It has been mentioned here that there was no uniformity in the working of hotels and restaurants.  What about seasonal hotels and seasonal restaurants?  The employees who work in those seasonal hotels and restaurants are employed only for a particular season.  Deputy Norton talked about their having to work 72 hours per week.  I can tell the Minister about girls who work 84 hours a week in hotels.  They will tell you <Col N="172" /> that they have three or four hours off in the afternoon, and all they can do is to go to bed and rest during that time because they have been on duty from 7 o'clock in the morning.  Notwithstanding that, we are asked to give this Bill a Second Reading to cut out hotel workers.  I hope the members of this House will not agree to that, and I must say it is a retrograde step that we should have the Minister coming in here and asking the House to give such a Bill a Second Reading.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I had hoped to hear from the Minister a much better case for this Bill than he has made. With one thing that he said, I am in entire agreement.  Towards the end of his speech he said, in effect, that we might as well scrap this in any case, because even though it was in the Act passed in 1938 it has never been administered. I interjected that if that was to be the test there are a great many Acts of Parliament and a far greater number of orders made by the Government which should be scrapped immediately, because the orders were made and the Acts were passed but no effort was ever made to enforce them. But I was more concerned with the Minister's attitude as to his responsibilities or, rather, the responsibilities of his Department, for the enforcing of an Act such as this when it becomes law.  I gathered from the Minister's attitude that he felt there was no responsibility whatever on his Department to see that an Act such as this, when it became law, should be operated.  I wonder, if the Department were to take the same attitude with regard to national health insurance or unemployment insurance, what would the position be in the country?  I do not think that position is a tenable one for the Minister or for his Department. I am not sufficiently acquainted with hotel conditions to take a hard-and-fast line on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There may be a good deal in the case for the amending of the Act, but, if there is, we have not heard it from the Minister.  What we did hear from the Minister was this: he has introduced this amending Bill.  He is going to amend the amending Bill on the Committee Stage to exclude from the <Col N="173" /> amending Bill the hotels in the City of Dublin.  He is going to do that notwithstanding the fact that he said earlier in his statement that this particular section in the Act dealing with hotels was impracticable and could not be worked.  He made no reservation in regard to Dublin or anywhere else when he made that statement.  I want to suggest to the Minister and to the House that the only reason why the Minister is going to bring in an amendment on the Committee Stage of this Bill to exclude hotels and restaurants in Dublin City from its operations is because he is afraid of the consequences in Dublin, knowing that the hotel workers in the City of Dublin are 100 per cent. organised.</P>
    <P>The amendment, I think, is a fair one.  The amendment simply asks the House not to take a decision on this Bill until such time as an inquiry has been held and a report furnished to the House.  The Minister may now be satisfied that he went too far, in the Act of 1938, in dealing with the conditions and hours of hotel employees, but I would suggest to him that he is now going to the other extreme, in simply wiping them out from under the protection of the Act altogether, and making no exceptions other than the particular one I mentioned, the City of Dublin.  Certain members of the House may regard as exaggerations the statements which have been made by Deputy Norton and Deputy Hickey regarding the conditions in certain provincial hotels, and so far as I know in certain of the city hotels, where people not only receive no wages but have to pay for the privilege of working there.  Those statements are quite true, and were not at all exaggerated. As a matter of fact, so far as a great number of hotels are concerned, they were understatements.  Those Deputies talked about employees working 72 hours or 84 hours a week.  Those of us who know anything at all about hotels are aware that in certain hotels &mdash; I do not at all want to be taken as branding anything like the majority of the hotels in this country&mdash;the employees are working from 7 o'clock in the morning until sometimes 2 or 3 or 4 o'clock on the following morning, <Col N="174" /> and are on duty again at 7 a.m.  That goes on over considerable periods, if not over the whole year.</P>
    <P>Deputies who have travelled around this country, and have stayed in hotels in various places from time to time, know that that is quite true.  What one really wonders at is that those people are physically able to stand up to those conditions and those amazingly long hours, when one remembers that during practically all that time, for 12, 14, 16 or sometimes 17 hours, they are continuously on their feet.  I do not say that that is general throughout the hotels in this country.  I do not believe it is, and I would be very sorry to think it is, but that is the sort of employment, if one can call it that, which puts a stain upon every hotel in the country. The Minister is not making any effort whatever to deal with conditions such as these.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the proprietors and owners of the majority of the hotels in this country would not be averse to any legislation passed by this House to ensure fair working conditions for their employees.  The original Act may undoubtedly have imposed a burden upon the proprietors of certain hotels but, where the Act was at all enforced, that burden was felt most heavily by those who had already been exploiting their workers. It was felt by those who were obliged to employ three persons where they formerly employed only two and by those who worked perhaps one employee for 16 or 17 hours and who had as a result of the Act to employ two persons to work over the same period. Whatever the merits of the hotel owners' case may be, the Minister certainly has not made that case to this House.  I think the amendment is a very fair one.  It asks that the House should not take a decision on the Bill pending an inquiry into the matter and a report to the House.  I think the Minister in his opening statement has made a much better case for the amendment than he made for the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with other speakers in appealing to the Minister not to force the passage of this <Col N="175" /> measure through the House.  I think I can congratulate him on making such a poor case for the Bill to the House. It is, I think, a tribute to his humanitarian instincts and better feelings that he appeared to be a man who had not got his heart in his job to-night and that he recognises that in sponsoring this measure he is performing a very undesirable piece of work.  He said, rather facetiously I think, that he hoped it would not be mistaken as a retrograde step.  There can be no mistake in the world that it is a retrograde step.  It means, if persisted in, that the Government or the framers of the measure have abandoned to their fate a very important section of the community who were working under slave conditions in these hotels, and that at a time when tourism is supposed to be one of our best industries and one calling for increased development.  Surely we are not going to develop tourism by imposing slave conditions on the workers engaged in it?</P>
      <P>This is a most reactionary proposal because it wipes out the benefits afforded by the 1938 Acts without proposing to put anything in their place. Both the Acts of 1938 repealed the 1912 Act so that we are actually reverting to the pre-1912 conditions by passing this measure.  Can anybody seriously contemplate at this period, when the whole trend of legislation is to improve social conditions for workers, that the Dáil should give its approval to a measure which puts the workers back to the conditions which prevailed before 1912?  If we could be assured that the good feelings and the humanitarian instincts of employers would always govern their relations with their workers in this industry, something could be said for it, but evidence has been adduced here to-night by several speakers, and I can support them, of the unconscionable conditions imposed on workers in this industry. That has been so even when the Act was in operation because of the definite and absolute failure of the Department to attempt to enforce it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has stated that he thought the trade unions were not as <Col N="176" /> active as they might be, and that they were inclined to rely on the Act. Really, it was only in Dublin that the Act was respected.  Down the country, some of the hotels which are doing a very big trade, and some of which charge a very high tariff, compel their workers to work as much as 100 hours a week.  I have particulars in my bag of the case of a maid working 100 hours a week in an hotel in which the charges to customers are fabulous.  When she does get any relief she has only time to snatch a few hours' rest in bed.  She is paid the princely salary of 10/6 a week.  If an inquiry were set up into this matter, I think the Minister would be astonished to find the conditions under which the employees in some hotels are working, and he would not attempt to do anything that is calculated to worsen these conditions.  I think it is rather a mean attitude that, because the workers in Dublin are organised, he will not alter the conditions there, because he knows that if the conditions were altered there would be industrial strife.  The unfortunate workers outside Dublin are going to be left to their fate because they are unorganised. Surely it is the responsibility of the Government to see that workers, whether organised or unorganised, are given something like human conditions?  The conditions of the 1938 Act were minutely discussed when the measure was passing through this House, and provisions were made in that Act to meet exceptional cases. There was nothing of a hard and fast character about it binding hotel keepers because the difficulty of operating the measure in their particular circumstances was then recognised.  We are convinced on this side of the House that in introducing this Bill the Minister was influenced from the hotel-keepers' side, but we have not heard the Minister give the reasons in black and white why he has not been able to enforce the Act through the whole country.  We say that he has not attempted to do it.  I have myself reported a number of cases to the Department. I got redress in one case. but within a month after the inspector had gone back, the conditions had fallen back into the old rut, so that we <Col N="177" /> can have no faith in some of the employers.</P>
    <P>I want to make it clear that, in common with other speakers, I am not putting all our hotel-keepers on the same plane, because the bulk of them are inclined to show reasonable consideration to their workers; but there are many big hotel-keepers in the country who are doing a big business and who have no scruple whatever in inflicting intolerable conditions on their staffs. The incidence of sickness in this industry has been stressed, and the Minister can have further information on that point if he desires it.  I say that this measure will definitely imperil the health and the happiness of a very considerable section of workers in this industry.  The health of girls in hotel employment, who are destined to be the mothers of families in future, surely deserves consideration.  The Minister should be very slow to introduce a Bill of this sort, at least without instituting some inquiry as to the conditions in the industry.  I suggest that it is the bounden duty of the Minister, before he makes any attempt to wipe out the legislation passed in 1938, to set up an inquiry such as is suggested in the amendment.  All aspects of the case have been fairly covered by previous speakers, and I do not want to delay the House unduly.  The Minister has told the House of the case of a man who stated that the Act cost him an additional £1,000.  Yet that particular man was able to pay his dividends, and very substantial ones.</P>
    <P>Again, it should be remembered that this Bill is going to result in a considerable increase in unemployment, and I suggest that the Minister has no right to do anything which is going to swell the ranks of the unemployed. From whatever aspect we consider the matter, either from the point of view of the health of the workers engaged in the industry, or from the point of view of the unemployment that is likely to be created as a result of the passage of the Bill, or even on general humanitarian grounds, I think the Minister will have to recognise that there is no case for the Bill.  I think, therefore, that he should accept the amendment, and hold an inquiry before proceeding <Col N="178" /> with it.  If he does, I am quite satisfied that he will be in a different frame of mind afterwards.  I am quite convinced that after an impartial inquiry into all the circumstances, the Minister would never attempt to pass this piece of legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Keyes mentioned the unemployment that is likely to be caused as a result of the passing of this measure.  I think on this ground alone, apart from any other, the case put to the Minister ought to appeal to him.  Here we have a section of hotel keepers who have had, you might say, two very good years when you compare their conditions with the conditions of other employers in the country.  They have got plenty of custom at increased prices.  I think that it is a very bad example for the Government to show to those other classes in the community to whom they have been appealing to keep their workers in employment.  Members of the Government have on very many occasions appealed to all classes to realise the conditions in the country and, even at a sacrifice to themselves, to keep their workers in employment. Apart altogether from those appeals, in many industries and in very many commercial concerns the employers are doing everything they possibly can, and are going to great lengths to keep their workers employed.  I know various firms who, on the merits of the case from the pure economics point of view, could and would dispense with a large number of employees at present, but for the fact that they realise there is nothing for the employees to get; that they have served them well in the past; and they are now, at a certain amount of sacrifice, keeping them employed although the work is not there for them.  In fact, many private persons are keeping servants employed at present when the conditions to which they are reduced as a result of present circumstances might dictate that they ought to dispense with them.  They are refraining from doing so, because they realise that if they let these servants go they would have no other place to go to, <Col N="179" /> and that the employment problem would be a very bitter one for the people they let go.  By introducing new conditions which would enable some hotels throughout the country, who have had two good years, to put an additional number of people into the position of being unemployed the Government are giving a very bad example, and I think the Minister would be very well advised, even on this ground alone, to hold his hand in regard to this measure and accept the suggestion made in the amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with those who have said that the Minister himself has made a better case, or at least as good a case, for the amendment as anybody from this side of the House.  I cannot remember any occasion on which a Bill was introduced in such an atmosphere. The Minister has admitted that, so far as the hotel situation is concerned, the law is not being carried into effect; that very little effort has been made by the hotel proprietors to accede to the rights of the workers which they obtained under the Act of 1938.  In view of this, and in view of the fact that the Minister was convinced at the time the Bill was going through the House that the hotel workers were entitled to whatever benefits the Bill would bestow on workers of this kind throughout the country, I think the Minister, ought to accede to the request made through the medium of this amendment to have an inquiry held into this whole situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has told the House that so far as Dublin is concerned the Act is being put into operation; that in consequence of the fact that agreements have been arrived at between the unions which cater for the hotel workers in the city he is going to insert an amendment which will make those prevail.  I think that that is very unfair to the other hotel workers throughout the country.  It is certainly a good advertisement for the trade unions catering for the hotel workers in the City of Dublin.  If the Minister is satisfied with the arrangements that prevail in Dublin, I cannot understand why he does not do something <Col N="180" /> to secure that the same arranagements should prevail in other parts of the country.</P>
    <P>It has been pointed out here that the conditions under which the hotel workers all over the country work are abominable.  I think that is known to everybody.  Every Deputy knows that in some of the provincial hotels the conditions which prevail for hotel workers are definitely very bad. Deputy Morrissey and others have mentioned that hotel workers work over 100 hours per week.  That is quite true.  We all know that in certain hotels the workers start work at 7 o'clock in the morning and sometimes they are working until 2 or 3 o'clock the next morning.  That applies especially to barmaids who, I presume, will also be affected by this legislation when passed.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mulcahy referred to the fact that certain arrangements have been made in some of the decent hotels in the country to put this Act into operation and, of necessity, they have had to take on more employees in order to fall in with the provisions of the Act. Now, if this amending Bill is passed, it means that those people will be thrown again into the ranks of the unemployed, and what the Minister is trying to avoid in other employments will come about in consequence of bringing this Bill before the House. Deputy Mulcahy has also stated that there are various employers throughout the country who could dispense with certain of their employees, but because of the fact that appeals have been made by responsible Ministers and responsible public men to keep on employees owing to the emergency, they have done so.  But if this Bill becomes law it will be responsible for putting out of employment a great many people.</P>
    <P>This Bill also deals with bread-van drivers.  Here again I suggest that an injustice will be done to this particular type of workers.  &ldquo;Van drivers,&rdquo; in my opinion, is not a proper description of these people.  In 90 per cent. of cases it will be found that they are not alone bread-van drivers but salesmen as well.  They are sent through the country with various articles to sell. <Col N="181" /> I suggest that they are in the same position as a person behind the counter in any retail shop in any part of the country.  I suggest to the Minister that in this case also there should be an inquiry into the number of hours they work and the particular kind of work they do.  There is nothing unreasonable in asking that an inquiry should be made into this whole position before the Minister insists on putting this Bill through the Dáil.  If he insists, of course he has a majority behind him and the injustice to these people will be carried.  I suggest that every member of the Fianna Fáil Party knows quite well the intolerable conditions under which hotel workers all over the country work and that they should, with us, ask the Minister to consent to an inquiry before he proceeds with any further stage of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are one or two points to which I should like to direct the Minister's attention.  From what the Minister has said in his opening remarks I gather that the recent judgment of the courts has not been very accurately studied by himself or the Department up to date.  I think that now that the time has come for some amendment of the law, the more he analyses that judgment the more likely he is to discover that certain flaws have been discovered by that judgment in what I think were the intentions of the Government in connection with the full conditions of employment.  As far as I understand, the difficulties that have arisen have occurred mainly on account of this: that the Bill as originally designed was to cover shops as we understand them, fixed structures, and that clause 3 was put in applying conditions that were drafted entirely in the light of fixed structures to travelling shops.  I understood that the aim there was to catch what is regarded in some parts of the country as an evil, the travelling shop.  By that I understood, when the measure was previously discussed, the type of vehicle that goes around peddling goods to people in the vicinity of urban localities and to people in the countryside.  There <Col N="182" /> appear to be two distinct types of travelling shop.  There is one where the trader arrives with his whole equipment, carried by some sort of horse-drawn vehicle, and sets up in the market square a booth.  As I understand the recent judgment of the courts, it would be quite easy to apply such terms as &ldquo;precincts of a premises&rdquo; to such booths.  As far as I understand the recent court judgment &mdash; I do not arrogate to myself complete understanding of it &mdash; it will be impossible to apply the phraseology of the Act which turns upon the use of this term &ldquo;precincts&rdquo; to the type of gentleman who goes around the country with a lot of goods in a van, which he then takes in his hands and brings to the doors of houses and tries to induce customers to buy them.  That type of gentleman, as I understand the recent judgment, is entirely outside the Act.  Whether he was intended to be in it or not, I do not know.  I thought it was understood that there was no intention to catch the bread-van server, and that position has now been regularised.  It appears that ice-cream vendors were nowhere inside the Act. It is now considered that they are not. I do not know if the Minister intended to catch the travelling shop of the second type &mdash; the man who goes around peddling goods from a vehicle, which he takes from his vehicle to the customer's door.  From the recent judgment I think that gentleman will not be caught.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other thing that emerged from the court judgment was this: There are certain overtime hours permitted.  It is made an offence for the proprietor of a shop to work people beyond the permitted overtime, but it emerges from the recent court judgment that if a man succeeds in getting an employee to work twice the number of hours of permitted overtime that employee cannot recover anything more than payment for the number of hours of permitted overtime.  Whether that is intended or not, I cannot say.  Whether that was the intention of the Government or not, that is the position that now exists.  This amending Bill does not amend that.  The Minister may reply that it is an offence for the <Col N="183" /> employer, that he can be brought into court and fined.  The fine in the main is a small fine.  I think it comes within the region of a few pounds, rising to £10 or £20.  There are cases current in the courts, of employees whose yearly permitted overtime is 2,600 hours, who have been worked 4,000 hours and they are now faced under the recent court judgment with this situation, that if they do go to court they can only recover payment in respect of the permitted overtime.  The overtime in excess of the permitted hours will be regarded as if they had not worked at all.  It is not a question of time and a half or time and a quarter.  They will not get any time.  That is a repercussion from the recent judgment that probably has not been adverted to.</P>
    <P>As far as bread-van servers are concerned, the attempt recently made to bring them inside the Act has failed. In accordance with the views of the people who promoted this measure, it only failed by a very narrow margin. It turns entirely upon the construction given by the courts to the phrase used in connection with the term &ldquo;member of a staff&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;a person who does work mainly inside the precincts of the shop.&rdquo;  There is amazing difficulty there.  The people who drafted these words and used simple language would be perturbed at the despair and confusion they cause when the court is brought up against the phrase used. It has a particular and concrete content or meaning in regard to a fixed structure and no content or meaning when applied to a travelling vehicle. The phrase is still going to be used, and the whole Act turns upon that&mdash; people who do work in or within the precincts of a shop.  The Minister may find that there are any number of people he wants to get in who will be ruled out.</P>
    <P>Again, anything I say in regard to this matter is to be taken with great reservation because where there are five separate judgments given it is not always easy to get what is the common view.  It is certainly not easy to express briefly what is the full meaning of the judgment.  It certainly would look like this, that the test that is <Col N="184" /> applied is, (1) does the trader go to the customer or do the customers come to the trader; and (2) if the customers do come to the trader has the transaction been carried out within the precincts?  Even if the customers do come to the trader, how far away from the van is the transaction carried out?  Is it beside the van; five yards away from the van or ten yards, or how far?  The phrase &ldquo;within the precincts&rdquo; is still the pivot of this measure and that is the phrase that has caused a great deal of trouble recently.  The Minister now seeks to clear up the situation with regard to the bread-van server.  There is a vehicle and from it there is carried on the retail trade of selling bread. Then there have to be two conditions &mdash; one is that the vehicle is the property of a baker and, secondly, that there is either wholly or mainly carried on the trade of selling bread by retail.  I am informed that the type of business has grown up with bakers that the man buys the van; the man becomes possessor of the van; but still only trades for the one person.  He sells one man's bread all the time.  When he is not selling bread he sometimes uses that van for other purposes of his own.  As far as selling bread is concerned he sells only the bread belonging to one person and does not buy that bread so as to become the proprietor of the shop.  I do not think by the definition of the Act he becomes the proprietor of the shop.  That particular individual is not removed from this Act by this amendment.  There is also the case where a man is hired by a baker, whether he owns a van himself or whether he takes the baker's van to deliver bread to people who buy wholesale or to people who buy retail.  There is a mixed trade there, and he may be classed as not merely carrying on the retail business of selling bread.  That van is not cut out from the Bill.  I wonder is it intended to exclude him. Apparently he is not going to be excluded. I do not think that particular case will arise very often, but associations I have had with people engaged in that trade lately have led me to believe that there is quite a number of cases in which the individual employee buys a van of his own, trades entirely <Col N="185" /> for one baker and that then the baker is not the owner of the van.</P>
    <P>I wonder what is the repercussion of that?  Supposing the bread-seller who owns a van of his own, and is not, therefore, excluded from this Act by the definition &mdash; he may be excluded by other circumstances &mdash; takes a helper. The baker whose bread he is selling never hears of the helper, but this man who owns the van works that boy beyond the conditions of the juvenile employment laid down, and even beyond the conditions of overtime permitted. The peculiarity of the situation is that the offence is committed by the baker who has never heard of the boy, unless the Minister is now getting the situation so rectified that the man who owns his own van is going to become the proprietor of the shop.  It is not clear that that is so. It is possibly intended to be the meaning.  It is not worked out by the definition clause.  There is quite a possibility, as I say, of that very odd situation that has never been in the contemplation of anybody that a man owning a van and hiring a boy as a helper and overworking that boy in the sense of non-permitted overtime in the Act might throw back the offence on to the baker who, by definition, is deemed to be the proprietor of the shop, and by whom the offence is deemed to be committed.  It throws back the offence entirely on to the baker although he never heard of the existence of the individual to whom the offence occurs.  I suggest these are matters that still can be looked into, and I suggest, if the Minister is inclined to have it the law that in case a man does work people beyond hours that are regarded as permitted overtime he should pay for them, then he ought to include another phrase allowing, in the most precise terms, the employee to recover at the overtime rates for all hours worked and not merely for such hours as are regarded as permitted by the Act.  The position apparently turns on this, that because the work beyond the permitted overtime was illegal, the whole contract was by way of being illegal and no compensation could be enforced for it.  That is a result <Col N="186" /> which I do not think was desired, but it is a result which is there.</P>
    <P>With regard to the main part, the part about which the controversy has arisen, that is, the application of the exclusion sections to the hotels, I propose to vote for the Labour amendment until I hear something further from the Minister.  As I understand Parliamentary procedure, as we have worked it here, it is that where a Minister brings forward a Bill, the onus is on him to suggest to the House the reasons why the measure should be accepted.  The Minister recently got the first Bill passed, having given reasons why it should be accepted by the House.  It was applied to hotels.  The Minister now comes forward with this Bill and I think the difficulties which have arisen, or which he adverted to, if he did not completely explain them, are sufficient to justify his excluding bread-van drivers and other itinerant people like roundsmen from the Bill. I have not heard from him yet, however, why it is proposed to exclude the hotels from this measure.  I did hear general phrases about the difficulty of application and so on.  I do not know whether it is necessary to have a whole inquiry set up to investigate the working of this in relation to hotels, but I do think the House is entitled to a reasonable explanation as to why exclusion is proposed for acceptance here.  In the absence of that explanation, I propose to vote for the amendment on the basis that I want, not to have an inquiry, but some statement as to why it has not been found practicable to give these benefits to hotel employees.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>To deal first with the points raised concerning bread-van drivers, I want to make it clear that, in my opinion, the specific exclusion of bread-van drivers from the scope of the 1938 Act is in no sense an injustice to them.  It was not intended that the Act should apply to them and it was made clear at the time that it was not so intended.  I think it is perfectly preposterous to claim that there is no difference between the conditions of work of a bread-van driver and a shop <Col N="187" /> assistant of the ordinary kind.  We can provide by law that the shop assistant will not work more than eight hours in the day or 48 hours in the week. We can give the shop assistant a legal right, if he has completed the maximum permitted number of hours of work, to leave the shop and go home, without risking the anger of his employer or dismissal on that account, but we cannot entitle the bread-van driver to do that.  If we say that the bread-van driver must work only eight hours in the day, what does he do when the clock strikes the hour?  Does he leave his horse and van on the side of the road and go home?</P>
      <P>That one fact will show that the conditions of employment are fundamentally different in each case, and, consequently, it is not possible to have regulations which apply in one case applying equally in the other case. That was recognised when we were legislating in respect of the conditions of employment of industrial workers as well as shop workers, that those who are engaged in transport operations of any kind, even as messenger boys, were in a different position from that of workers who carried out their work in one place and that they could not be made subject to the same regulations.  It was not intended that the Act should apply to bread-van drivers.  It is not clear that it does apply to them.  I am not going to discuss now the effect upon this Bill, or upon the original Act, of the judgment of the Supreme Court which was announced in the papers this morning.  I have seen only the newspaper reports of that judgment yet, and what the effect of it is going to be, I cannot say.  It is not quite clear from what I have seen that it removes the necessity for any amending legislation in respect of bread-van drivers. On the contrary, I think it is still necessary that we should proceed with this amendment of the original Act.</P>

    <P>One thing I should say, however, because this is a question of policy and not of legal interpretation, is that it is not intended that an employee should be entitled to overtime rates for <Col N="188" /> working illegal overtime.  Under this Conditions of Employment Act and the Industrial Conditions of Employment Act, workers could be employed for a certain number of hours per day or week, and in excess of these hours, subject to the payment of overtime rates.  Employment beyond the permitted hours of overtime was illegal.</P>

      <P>An employer who employs a worker beyond the permitted hours commits an offence and, clearly, if you create a situation in which a worker is entitled to get, and has a legal right to claim, an overtime rate of pay in respect of hours worked beyond the legal maximum, there is every reason to fear that in certain cases there will be collusion between employer and worker to evade that requirement of the Act, which is intended to be as much a restriction upon the worker as upon the employer.  Consequently, the legislation does not provide for the recovery of wages in respect of overtime worked beyond the permitted maximum number of hours.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am suggesting that there are workers who will work overtime beyond the permitted hours, if the opportunity is given them, and that, in the matter of restricting overtime, it is frequently as necessary to put restrictions on the workers as upon the employers.</P>

      <P>The legislation provides for normal hours of work and for permitted overtime &mdash; a certain number of hours per week, per month, or per year, which may be worked by way of overtime at overtime rates and without any permit or prior sanction from the Department of Industry and Commerce; but over and above these maximum hours of overtime, it is an offence for an employer to employ a worker, and it is not possible for a worker to recover overtime payment in respect of these excess hours.</P>
      <P>The points raised by Deputy McGilligan can more usefully be discussed in Committee.  I do not wish to discuss them now, because I should like to give them some examination before expressing an opinion on them.  The effect of the Supreme Court judgment, as I understand it, appears to be to exclude the itinerant shopkeeper of the type referred to by Deputy McGilligan. Whether it is desirable to leave him excluded, or whether it is practicable to include him, are matters that will require attention.  I think it will prove to be impracticable to include that type of shop in the scope of the measure.</P>
      <P>Now, in relation to hotels, I want to say this for the benefit of Deputy Norton: that he must not forget that it was the Government introduced this Shops (Conditions of Employment) Act in the first instance, and that in framing the Act we included in it provisions covering hotel workers.  I think the fact that the Government, on its own initiative, promoted that legislation and designed legislation to cover hotel workers is proof that there is no lack of desire to afford to hotel workers what legal protection it is possible to give them.  We desire it.  We set out in 1938, to give to hotel workers legal rights in relation to the conditions of their employment.  The fact that we must face is that we did not succeed.  Deputies cannot have it both ways.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>You did not try.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Norton, if he knows anything at all about this knows that that is not so.  It is not possible <Col N="190" /> for Deputies opposite logically to contend, first of all, that the Act is not in operation and that the Department is at fault because the Act is not in operation, and at the same time try to maintain that the repeal of the Act is going to make any change.  One or other argument will not stand.  Deputy Norton says that we did not try to enforce the Act.  We did try.  I want to point out to the House that the obligation to enforce the Act did not rest upon the Government alone.  The Act gave to the workers the right to take proceedings under it.  It gave to trade unions the right to take proceedings under it.  Any trade union could take proceedings against an employer for an offence under the Act.  The pressure for the amendment of the Act in its application to hotels or for the repeal of the Act in its application to hotels, came not so much from hotel proprietors as from the officers of the Department of Industry and Commerce who had responsibility for enforcing it. They found that not merely were they unable to enforce it, but that they could not, over a great part of the country, get the co-operation of the employees for the enforcement of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>What reason did they give?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am going to tell the House that.  Most of the employees did not want a situation created so that the Act would be completely enforced.  It is practicable to control the hours of work, on the lines contemplated by this Bill, in a large establishment.  Where a hotel employs a large staff with more than one cook, with more than one waiter and with more than one trained operative in any part of the establishment, it is possible to enforce the Act, but where a hotel is either unable to get an additional trained cook or trained waiter &mdash; and that is the problem of a number of these purely seasonal hotels which open for two or three months or so and close down for the rest of the year or is not big enough to afford to employ more than one &mdash; it has been found impossible to operate the Act at all.  Take the type of hotel situated in many parts of the <Col N="191" /> west of Ireland which opens at particular seasons and only at particular seasons, if that type of hotel is going to attract any trade at all it must have a good cook.  If it is going to operate this Act as it stands, it must have two good cooks because there will be a day and a half in every week in which the cook employed in the hotel will not be allowed to work under the Act, and during that day and a half no meals can be served in the hotel.  The same thing applies to other classes of hotel workers.  The hotels which cater for holiday-makers of one kind or another &mdash;fishermen, sportsmen and others in outlying districts &mdash; must provide not merely service but good service if they are going to attract the type of client that they were established to cater for, and they cannot do that under the Act, having regard to the difficulties they have experienced in getting competent workers to go to those hotels for the very limited season during which the hotels are open.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We discussed all this before.  I felt, when introducing the 1938 Act, that it was possible to devise regulations that could be made applicable to hotels.  I met with a lot of opposition in the Dáil.  A number of the Deputies on the benches opposite very strongly opposed the inclusion of hotel workers within the scope of the measure.  I said then, after a number of protracted debates on the Committee Stage of the 1938 Act, that if I were starting again I would not have attempted to deal with hotel workers in a Shops Act. The records of the Dáil are there.  On more than one occasion I indicated my regret that we had attempted to tackle the job of regulating the conditions of employment of hotel workers in a Shops Act because facts were continuously arising to show that the conditions of employment of hotel workers were fundamentally different from the conditions of employment of ordinary shop workers, and because the regulations applying to one could not be easily applied to the other.  Let me be quite clear about this.  The position of hotel workers is either going to be different in the future or not if this Bill becomes <Col N="192" /> an Act, and I think it is going to make no change.  Up to 1938, there was no law governing the conditions of employment of hotel workers.  Deputy Keyes said that we repealed the 1912 Act, and that by taking hotel workers out of the 1938 Act we are going to put them in a worse position than they were in before because the 1912 Act has since been repealed, but he is, I think, ignoring the fact that the 1912 Act did not apply to hotels.  Therefore, the position up to 1938 was that there was no law governing the conditions of employment of hotel workers. We attempted in 1938 to make such a law.  We know now that the law has been inoperative outside the City of Dublin.  Deputies have urged that we did not try to operate it.  I say that we tried and found that we could not operate it.  The trade unions and the workers found that they could not operate it although they were entitled to institute proceedings under the law for offences against the Act.  They could not do so because they found the Act did not apply.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>For the reason that they knew that the State was not going to enforce it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Whatever the reason, the fact is that the Act is not being operated outside the City of Dublin. Therefore the amendment proposed to the Act is not going to change the conditions now applying in hotels.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not correct. Then we had the difficulties which were mentioned by some of the Deputies opposite in 1938.  I remember Deputy Monagan&mdash;at that time I think he was President of the Hotel Proprietors' Association &mdash; setting them out very forcibly bilingually.  We felt that we should try it out, even though we recognised that many difficulties were <Col N="193" /> likely to emerge.  We found in practice that the difficulties were so great that the attempt we started in 1938 could not be continued, and what we are doing now is: we are putting the position back to that which would have existed in 1938 if we had proceeded in that year to legislate only for shop assistants and not for hotel workers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash; and they are as much entitled to claim the protection of legislation in their conditions of employment as any other class of worker.  Only two classes have been covered so far, industrial workers under the Industrial Conditions of Employment Act and shop workers under the 1938 Act.  I was in favour of applying the 1938 Act to hotel workers.  If we see now that the attempt failed, it is not because we did not desire it, but because the instrument we had was ineffective.  It was not in the interests of hotel workers that we should create an illusion of protection for them which did not exist.  I am prepared to amend the Act so as to provide that it will continue to apply to hotels in the Borough of Dublin.</P>

      <P>The Deputy was not here when I was speaking.  There are certain hotels which cannot make the Act operate because of their inability to obtain during the season when they are open the skilled workers required for their business.  That situation is not going to be affected in so far as the total number of workers employed is concerned.  In other hotels where there are larger staffs employed it is possible, and it has been possible, without any addition to the staffs to carry out the provisions of the Act.

      <P>I told the Deputy that I admit that the provisions of this measure could be applied to hotels like the Gresham where there is a staff of a certain size employed.  It could be applied in all such hotels.  Their position will not be affected in the least.  That is not the type of hotel that is the difficulty.  The difficulty arises with small hotels that are not large enough to maintain a large staff, or to provide for a rotation of staff, or in the case of an isolated hotel which only opens for a seasonal trade, and could not attract skilled workers during that season in sufficient numbers to enable them to operate the Bill.  I think there is no point in the contention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The intention which the Government had in 1938, when they enacted the <Col N="197" /> Conditions of Employment Act of 1938, to afford protection to shop workers and to hotel workers, remains.  We found, however, that the particular instrument that we forged then is ineffective in relation to the hotel industry &mdash; at least in relation to a large part of the hotel industry.  Consequently, we are going to remedy that situation by amending that Act of 1938.  If, after consideration, another method of applying legal regulations and control to conditions of employment in hotels can be devised, then new legislation specifically confined to the hotel industry can be enacted, just as we have promised &mdash; a promise which must be deferred until after the emergency &mdash; to complete a whole series of enactments for conditions of employment in relation to industrial workers until we have covered in a similar manner all classes of workers to which legislation of that kind could be made applicable.</P>

It is not necessary to have any inquiry into the matter.  The facts I have mentioned indicate that difficulties have arisen. There is, I think, nobody associated with the hotel industry of this country, either as a proprietor or as a trade union official, who does not know that this amendment is necessary, that the provisions of the 1938 Act in relation to hotels have not been applied and have not been operative.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked the Minister for Finance to-day if he would cause any inquiry to he made with a view to ascertaining the nature and extent of any speculative buying of (a) land, and (b) other property carried on by persons other than Irish-born persons since the beginning of the war emergency; and whether he proposes to take any measures to control or prevent speculation by such persons in land or other property.  The Minister replied that, following certain inquiries he had made, he did not get any evidence of any such speculative buying of land and other property by persons other than Irish born persons and he did not feel called upon to take any such measures of the kind suggested in my question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I raise the question now for the purpose of elucidating the matter a little and giving the Minister an opportunity of explaining the position a little more fully.  One hears very often of the buying of property by persons other than Irish nationals&mdash;the buying, for instance, of ground rents in towns and cities.  Recently one heard of the buying of house property and recently also one heard of speculative buying of land.  If there is nothing in these statements and these rumours which are spreading and causing a certain amount of feeling and uneasiness, then <Col N="203" /> I think any opportunity we can get of finding out the facts should be taken advantage of in order to stop those rumours and misrepresentations.  Very often these things spread and they tend to create movements that have very undesirable reactions; they often react on matters that are far away from the original seat of the complaint.</P>
    <P>So that, if only on the ground of stopping statements of this particular kind, it is essential that in some way or another we should get information about the matter.  On the other hand, there are elements in the financial situation here and outside which would tend to speculative buying of this particular kind.  If the Minister takes the amount of money that was in circulation in this country in 1920 after the last war &mdash; that is, in the whole of Ireland &mdash; and the total amount in circulation now, I think he will find that there is actually a reduction of 2 per cent.  The total amount in circulation at the moment is about £222,000,000. That is about 2 per cent. below the amount in circulation in 1920.  If, on the other hand, you take the position in Great Britain, the total amount of money in circulation in Great Britain at the present time is 82 per cent. more than the amount which was in circulation in 1920, or an increase of about £1,703,000,000.  Now, an analysis of the war situation in Great Britain for the last two years will show that at least £1,100,000,000 of absolutely newly-created money has been put into circulation, and that is going to increase. So that of the increase of £1,700,000,000, or an increase of 82 per cent. in the amount of money circulating in Great Britain in 1940, a very large part has been created during the last two years.  Accordingly, here we have a static situation with regard to our money volume, and a very extensive and growing money volume in Great Britain, and that at a time when the facilities for the utilisation of money in Great Britain are growing smaller and smaller.  At the present time I suppose that a lot of the money in Great Britain has no other exit except that of the 2½ per cent.  Defence Bonds: so that there is the great tendency <Col N="204" /> and danger that among people whose roots, domiciliary and otherwise, are rather slight, that money would find a better speculative ground for working in this country than it would in Great Britain itself.</P>
    <P>Now, I suggest that there is that kind of danger.  We have taken certain precautions to see that such dollars as we can control do not pass out of the possession of our people or from under the control of the Government. If half the rumours you hear, or half the dangers that you might fear from this great inequality of loose money knocking around, are justifiable in any way, I suggest to the Minister that there is a danger of speculative buying of land and properties of that particular kind and that some kind of check, at any rate, ought to be instituted because, if a movement of that kind did develop, it might give rise to very serious problems here: the problem of the speculation itself as well as the problem of movements that might arise out of the feeling that there was alien buying of some of our foundation property here.</P>
    <P>I directed the Minister's attention this morning to the fact that no person in Ireland can buy a lorry from another without getting a licence from, I think, the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  I suggest that one way, at any rate, of beginning to put this situation under review and getting at the facts would be that the Minister would issue an emergency order to the effect that no person who was not an Irish born national could buy land, houses, rentals, and so on, unless he got from the Minister for Finance a licence to do so similar to the licence that a person would have to get here if he wanted to buy a lorry.  That would be a small precaution, but I think it is very essential that we do get at the facts and clear our minds and that, in so far as it is a question of suspicion and rumour, we should protect our minds against the attacks that rumours and circulated false statements might give rise to, and that in so far as there is a danger of speculation in these matters, if that was actually going on, we should know about it and be in a position to take steps to prevent it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I might be permitted to add a word or two to what Deputy Mulcahy has said.  The Minister may not be at the moment apprehensive of there being any great development along the lines suggested by Deputy Mulcahy's question this morning and what he has said to-night, but whether there is that apprehension in his mind or not, or whether there is any great development in that direction taking place immediately, it is quite clear that the situation is serious, and that if this country follows the lines that other countries followed in the last war, such a development is quite likely to take place here in the future.  That danger undoubtedly exists.  I do not say that it has necessarily developed to a great extent at the moment, and I do not know whether the situation presents itself to the Minister as being so serious as to warrant the passing of an emergency order, but could he not do this?  If one does not take steps in the beginning to deal with what may appear to be small abuses, and waits until they have blossomed into big evils, the difficulty is that when one does intervene one hurts, not the original buyer, but possibly an innocent in-between buyer who has bought from the original purchaser.  Could the Minister not say that if hereafter he finds that there has been any great speculation of an undesirable type done by people not of our country in regard to leaseholds, rentals or other such properties in this country, and finds it necessary to act, he will be ruthless in the expropriation of these original non-national speculators if it should become necessary to do so?</P>

      <P>I do not think I would have any hesitation in giving a promise to the House that if I were satisfied that there was any case for dealing in a drastic way, or some way of the kind suggested by Deputy McGilligan, in connection with speculation in property by aliens in this country I would so deal with it.  I do not think I would have any hesitation in giving such a guarantee to the House.  But I have heard the rumours over the last year <Col N="206" /> or two, to which Deputy Mulcahy referred &mdash; and I am sure others have heard them also&mdash;rumours of all sorts of people, alien in type, purchasing real estate, property, houses, lands, ground rents, and the like, all over the country, and when I was asked this question before&mdash;I had already made some inquiries&mdash;I made the fullest inquiry into the matter and, as far as I can make out, there is no basis at all in fact for that statement, none whatsoever. If I were to give ear to all the rumours I hear I would be doing nothing else but listening to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am constantly hearing rumours of one kind or another and I would have no time for anything else if I were to give ear to them, and I suggest that the same applies to Deputy Mulcahy and other Deputies.  We have had rumours since the war started about all sorts of things, especially about the State and its affairs, the Army and our external relations, alien activities here, and so on.  There is not a day that I walk out of my door that I do not hear some extraordinary rumour bearing on matters of that kind.  But in so far as this type of rumour is concerned, I have had every Department that might have knowledge requested to make inquiries, and the answer to me in all cases has been that there is nothing to justify anxiety in the matter.  The Department of Industry and Commerce, the Department of Justice, and the Revenue Commissioners, have a variety of ways of getting information. I know that my own Department has ways of getting such information. Then there is the Department of Lands and the Land Commission, and they have many ways of testing whether there has been a transfer of land to aliens.  The Registry of Deeds also has a means of checking, and there is also the Stamping Department through which every deed of any kind that has to be stamped in this country has to pass. I have had all those cases examined, but nothing whatsoever to give rise to any anxiety has happened with regard to speculation in land by aliens in the last two years.  In those circumstances, I do not know that any <Col N="207" /> safeguards of the kind that the Deputy has suggested are necessary. If there were any grounds for it, I would certainly consider taking steps to see that the situation would be safeguarded.  I see no reason for doing that at present.  There is no analogy in the case of the lorries, suggested by Deputy Mulcahy.  Lorries have wheels under them, and can be taken out of the country very rapidly.  You cannot put wheels under a farm, or under a house &mdash; not in this country.  That kind of thing might be done in the United States, but not in Ireland.  You cannot put wheels under real estate; you can put them under lorries, and it has been done to the disadvantage of the country, and done to such an extent that <Col N="208" /> it was found necessary to have restrictions put upon the sale.  If there were any <i>prima facie</i> case made out for taking action of the kind to restrict attempts by aliens to do what the Deputy suggests here, I would certainly lose no time in taking such steps.</P>
