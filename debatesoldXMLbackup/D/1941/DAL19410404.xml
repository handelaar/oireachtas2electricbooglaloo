      <P>When the debate was adjourned last night I was referring to the responsibility of the Minister for the ever growing burden of rates on the unfortunate ratepayers, and pointing out that it should be the Minister's policy to encourage economy and a reduction of these charges to the paying capacity of the ratepayers.  The policy of the Government however appears to be to try to shift the responsibility for all the employment schemes on to local bodies.  That is quite unfair.  It is especially unfair to the farming community at a time when they are being asked to carry other burdens.  During the present crisis that section has to make extraordinary efforts to raise food for the nation. There are many difficulties to contend with, including a shortage of capital, a shortage of manure, a shortage of <Col N="1526" /> seeds and no guaranteed price to cover the cost of production.  Despite these obstacles the farming community is prepared to do its duty but the Minister should be sympathetic.  I suggest that employment schemes should be financed by the Government and not by local bodies.  That is only one aspect of Government policy which treats one section of the community, the farmers, with extreme severity.  Unless that policy is changed the flight from the land will continue.  County councils are prepared to finance these employment schemes because they have no alternative but that of losing the grant. As long as they have no other alternative, they will finance such schemes at the expense of the ratepayers, and even the farmers will not object in the circumstances.  But the Minister should change the position.  The farmers are prepared to stand in with the rest of the community to meet the present difficulties with which the country is confronted, but the feeling amongst them is that the best thing is to get away from the land.  The young people have made up their minds that there is nothing for them but injustice and slavery and so the flight from the land continues.  That leads to overcrowding in the cities and to the unemployment problems that result.  The Government should decide to finance employment schemes.  They are good schemes but the method of financing them is entirely wrong.  I urge the Minister to reconsider the position, and to bring it to the notice of other Ministers, so that the ratepayers would be encouraged to proceed with food production which is so urgent during the present crisis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to refer also to the condition of the roads which are unfit for use by horses.  The farmers in County Cavan have had this question under consideration for many years, and appeals have been made to the county council and to the Government with a view to having the present policy reconsidered. The problem is a difficult one but it might be easily overcome.  It has been suggested, and the experiment has been successfully tried in Cavan, that roads should be finished off with white sand instead of limestone.  If that were <Col N="1527" /> done, we would have motor roads just as good and roads which could be used by horses and cattle.  I think the farmers should be considered.  We know the position the country is in with regard to petrol, and, if there is to be no alternative method of transport, what is going to happen?  I have written to the county surveyor in Cavan and have put my proposal before him because he is a practical man and an excellent county surveyor. I asked him if there was any snag in the method of completing roads which I suggest and there was no snag.  I have since gathered&mdash;not from the county surveyor, but from somebody else &mdash; that it is the Minister who is responsible because he wants uniformity in the roads.  I quite agree that it is right to have uniformly good roads, but we can have uniformity and we can have good roads by adopting this plan, which will cost nothing more in the long run.  Indeed, I believe it will cost less, because in many places it is much easier to get white sand than limestone chippings for these roads.</P>
    <P>In view of the fact that we are voting money now for a number of engineers, some of whom, I am sure, are good road engineers, I ask the Minister to bring this matter, which is worthy of consideration, to their notice, and to inquire from them whether it is a practical scheme and what snags, if any, there are in it.  I am quite prepared to listen to any objections raised, but, if there are no objections, why should it not be considered?  The farmers are entitled to use these roads. They are paying heavily and out of all proportion to their means for the upkeep of these main roads, and they are as much entitled to use them as the motorists, and when they can be completed in a manner that will serve both the motorist and the man with the horse, they should be so completed.</P>
    <P>There is a season of the year when the tar on these roads becomes quite soft and sticks to one's boots.  If there was a certain amount of this sand thrown along these roads, it would help to provide employment for unemployed <Col N="1528" /> people.  The sand could be scattered along the road when it gets into this condition, and, instead of damaging the road, it would add many years to the life of the road and at a minimum cost.  The cost of upkeep of the roads would, I think, be reduced rather than increased and we would have good roads for the motorist and for the farmer who wants to use them for horses.  I hope the Minister will give this matter the attention I believe it deserves.</P>
    <P>There is another matter in connection with the making of roads.  I think the Minister should send to the county surveyors a direction to the effect that employment on roads should, so far as possible, be given in the winter season and the necessary stuff prepared through the winter months when unemployment is at its peak and when work on the land is almost at a standstill. That season of the year is suitable for the preparation of the stuff for roads. I have had complaints from many farmers this year that the very time the rush for men on the roads began was after the 1st March, at a time when the Minister for Agriculture was urging people to get in and produce all the crops they could and to prepare their land.  In the first spell of good weather since November, a great number of extra men was called out on the roads, and, in view of the food shortage, I think the Minister should send a direction to the county surveyors to get the bulk of the work done during the slack winter months, just as farm improvement schemes should be carried out at this slack period, and not to create difficulties for the farmer at a time when he wants extra help.  From every point of view, it would be an advantage to get the work done during the winter months, and it is for the Minister to give the necessary direction to county councils and their staffs, particularly in a time of crisis when there is danger of a food shortage and when the maximum production is necessary if the country is to come through the crisis.</P>
    <P>With regard to housing, like other Deputies, I regret that the Estimate has been reduced, but I suppose that <Col N="1529" /> cannot be helped.  There is, however, one matter in connection with housing which has struck me very forcibly, that is, the position in the slums in Dublin. I notice that a wonderful extension of the city has taken place and that many nice houses have been built outside the city, but, at the same time as this extensive building, financed by the Exchequer, is going on, we find, within a stone's throw of some of the best streets in the city, dilapidated and ruined houses which make one feel disheartened. If the Minister has responsibility in the matter, he should encourage a scheme of reconstruction, of clearing up and improvement of these buildings which are falling into decay and are an eyesore in the heart of the city.  I do not know whether they are rented houses but, if they are, some responsibility should be put on the landlords, and perhaps the Minister might, by some manipulation of the grants, encourage these people by giving some money towards reconstruction, or use a certain amount of compulsion, or both methods, to see that these places are put in decent and habitable order.  One can picture the conditions of the people living in these houses, which are excellent houses, better than any of the new houses being built, but in a terrible state of decay and showing neglect and squalor.  I think it is a matter for the Minister to consider in consultation with the City Manager, or whomever is responsible.  So long as public money is being voted for extensions of the city and for new buildings, it would be worth considering these old buildings which are falling into decay.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will pay particular attention to the matters I have brought to his notice and, in particular, to the question of financing these schemes of employment.  It is not fair that he should shift the responsibility from his own shoulders to those of the local bodies.  I hope he will also consider the matter of roads which cannot be used by the people who are paying the greater part of the money for their upkeep.  This is a matter to which I have called attention before and I hope the Minister will not pass it by on this occasion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>As there is a time limit to this debate, I shall be very brief. A matter that strikes one in connection with this Estimate is that while there is a very large reduction in the grant for housing, there is a very substantial increase in the loan charges in respect of housing grants already made.  It seems to me that, sooner or later, the Minister will have to face up to this problem.  The cost of housing is prohibitive, entirely as a result of the charges imposed in respect of the loans.  Until the Minister takes his courage in his hands and obtains money or credit free of interest for the housing of our working people, as he is entitled to do, there will be no real solution of the housing problem.  There is no reason whatever why the Government should not obtain from the Currency Commission or from any other source the currency necessary to finance housing.  That proposition has been put up to the Government again and again.  Notwithstanding that it is contained in the minority reports of the Banking Commission it has been turned down, simply because the Government lacked the courage to face up to the task.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Anybody can realise the extent of the burden imposed upon the community by the interest charges on housing loans.  Take a workman's house costing £500.  Interest on that at 5 per cent. amounts to £25.  That is a charge which the workman cannot pay.  He cannot pay even one-fourth of the interest charge.  The result is that the cost is turned over to the ratepayers and taxpayers. We have, then, a slowing down of our national activities in housing. In so far as we do endeavour to face up to the task of providing houses, we are imposing a tremendous burden on the taxpayers, ratepayers and tenants of these houses.  That is one of the first tasks to which the Minister should direct his attention and the attention of his Department.  Having come to a decision, he should secure that the Government will adopt it.  We know that a great deal has been done since the inception of this State for the provision of houses for the working classes but a great deal still remains to be done.  Not only are houses needed for the working classes, but, sooner or <Col N="1531" /> later, an effort will have to be made to provide assistance for farmers' sons to enable them to marry and settle down.</P>
    <P>We have a policy at the present time by the State for promoting the housing of the working classes so as to enable them to marry and have homes of their own.  At the same time, we have a position in which the farming community are unable to provide homes for themselves early in life and are unable to marry.  As a result, the farming population are rapidly dying out and, in the course of a short time, rural Ireland will be populated entirely by the wage-earning class.  That is true of nearly all the counties of Ireland.  It is a remarkable state of affairs to which the Minister should direct a certain amount of attention.</P>
    <P>A remarkable feature of this Department is that it seems to cover every sphere of the life of our people.  No Department's activities are more widespread and no Department controls, directly or indirectly, so large an amount of public expenditure.  Year by year, expenditure in the Minister's Department has been increasing, until to-day it has reached £1,229,000.  In addition, the expenditure of the local authorities is increasing year by year and, at present, amounts to £12,000,000 or £13,000,000.  That is an enormous amount of money and it is regrettable that, so far as anybody in this House or outside it can observe, very little return is being obtained for that money.  Take one item of the Estimate &mdash;expenditure in relation to the treatment of tuberculosis.  There is a substantial increase this year in the amount and there has been a substantial increase under this head every year.  Yet, we find that there is still a very heavy death-roll from this disease. There is also a regrettable failure on the part of the State to cope with the disease.  People suffering from infection are allowed to remain in their homes and spread the disease to other members of their families and to other people.  That is not as it should be, considering the amount of money we are spending on treatment of the disease.  If we are entitled, as we are, to impose drastic restrictions so as to <Col N="1532" /> prevent the spread of disease in animals, we are entitled to impose similar restrictions to prevent the spread of disease amongst human beings.  I think that our failure to take compulsory powers to ensure that people suffering from this disease will be removed at an early age to an institution has resulted in the expenditure of a large amount of public money, in the loss of human life and in untold suffering.</P>
    <P>We all realise that it is a harsh thing to compel persons suffering from this disease to leave their homes and their families.  But, if the matter were approached in an official manner, that is to say, if people suffering from the disease were compelled to enter institutions in the initial stages of the disease, they might come out in the course of a few months completely cured.  That would have the result of encouraging people to avail of institutional treatment and of making institutional treatment more popular than it is at present.  People do not avail of institutional treatment until it is too late for them to be cured, with the result that entering a sanatorium is regarded as being the first stage on the road to the cemetery.  People are very reluctant, therefore, to avail of institutional treatment. On the other hand, if the disease were taken in time, as it could be if doctors were given the necessary compulsory powers, institutional treatment would become as popular with the people as it is at present unpopular. I put that suggestion very strongly to the Minister.</P>
    <P>With regard to roads, I think that at present we are spending almost as much money on the maintenance of main roads as on the maintenance of county roads, although the mileage of county roads is more than double that of the main roads.  We have spent a great deal more money on main roads during the past 20 years than on county roads, with the result that main roads have been brought to a much higher standard than the county roads. Surely the time has come when the expenditure on county roads should at least be brought up to the level of the <Col N="1533" /> expenditure on main roads.  In other words, the grant provided out of the Road Fund should be extended to the county roads and should be directed mainly to improvement rather than to maintenance.  It can be safely said that during the last 20 years millions of pounds have been spent on the maintenance of county roads with very little result.  The maintenance of county roads by the old system of loose metalling is not efficient and the roads are not capable of standing up to modern traffic.  So far as possible we should direct our attention to the reconstruction of county roads.  If necessary, we should borrow money for that purpose, free of interest, as I said in regard to housing, because we would be establishing a permanent national asset.</P>
    <P>Then we have the position at present that county councils are being asked to undertake the work of turf production. I think that the duties imposed upon the Department of Local Government already, when we consider that they embrace such a wide field of activity, are such that the provision of fuel should not be added to the functions of the Department.  I do not think that this Department has given such evidence of high efficiency that it can be depended upon to provide the fuel necessary in this emergency.  I think the Minister for Local Government should protest to the Minister for Industry and Commerce against the burden that is being thrown on local authorities by asking them to undertake this work.  It is an urgent national work which should be undertaken by a separate body rather than by the county councils.</P>
    <P>One of the most serious and lamentable features of our national life is the amount of money we are compelled to spend year after year upon the relief of destitution.  Surely the time has arrived when some effort should be made to ensure that the expenditure on the relief of destitution should not be altogether unproductive.  Some effort should be made by the Minister for Local Government, and through him by the local authorities, to provide work in lieu of home assistance. The Minister for Industry and Commerce <Col N="1534" /> pointed out that the introduction of the Employment Period Order, which deprives people in rural areas of unemployment assistance, will increase the expenditure of the local authorities. Home assistance must be of an unproductive nature, because at present the local authorities have no definite schemes for the providing of work for those in receipt of it.</P>
    <P>The Minister should see about devising some scheme by which local authorities will be able to provide some work for those who apply for home assistance, and such a scheme is possible at present when we consider the urgent need there is for fuel and food.  It is not right or proper that the community should be compelled to bear the enormous burden of relieving destitution.  We all know that the amount of home assistance provided by local authorities is hopelessly inadequate. Nevertheless, as long as the people who are in receipt of home assistance are unable to undertake anything in the way of production, the amount must remain inadequate.  We must realise that as long as people are deprived of the opportunity of adding anything to the wealth of the country, there is a definite limit to the amount which the State or the community can provide for the relief of the poor. Therefore, that is a matter to which the Minister should direct his attention. He should see that, so far as possible, work is provided for anybody who is able to work and who is destitute.</P>
    <P>Provision for school meals is also included in this Estimate, but we know that in the districts where school meals are most urgently needed they are not provided.  Sooner or later the Minister must face up to the necessity for providing school meals in all rural areas, and in urban areas to a great extent also.  That should be done in all schools where children are unable to return to their homes for their meals. Some scheme should be introduced and partially financed by the State to enable a reasonably good meal to be provided in every school.  I do not think the cost would be great.  The meal might be composed mainly of home-grown vegetables and milk.  It <Col N="1535" /> would not cost a lot if teachers and children helped in its preparation.  If something of the kind were attempted, I believe it would give a much greater return than some of the other work of a charitable nature in which the Minister's Department is engaged.  The serving of a good nourishing meal to school children would help to improve their health and make them happy.  Its preparation might be made a useful part of the instruction given in the school.  I hope the Minister will direct his attention to this matter of making the provision of school meals universal throughout the State.</P>
    <P>A good deal has been done in regard to allotments both by the local authorities and the parish councils, but much more remains to be done.  In areas where the allotments have not yet been provided, steps should be taken at once to remedy the omission, so that both unemployed and employed may be able to avail of them.  The time to enable us to increase our food supplies is running out.  There is, however, enough time to increase the potato acreage.  By the provision of additional allotments, it could be increased.  The Minister should impress on local authorities the absolute necessity of securing every additional allotment that it is possible to get so that we may be able to increase the acreage under potatoes.</P>

      <P>I would remind Deputy Cogan that the Minister is to be called on at 11.40 a.m. to conclude. It is now a quarter past 11.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think there is any other matter that I have to deal with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to emphasise two points.  The first concerns the matter that was referred to by Deputy McGovern.  The Minister will remember that, when we were discussing the Vote on Account, we pointed out that in spite of the very large amount of additional unemployment there is in the country, and of its tendency to increase, £400,000 less was being provided for unemployment <Col N="1536" /> assistance and unemployment insurance payments: that is to say, £400,000 less was being provided in the Estimates, out of State funds, for works that would be regarded as relief or labour-employing. I asked at that particular time if we could be told whether it was a fact that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance had made representations to the City Manager of Dublin to the effect that he might expect that another 40,000 persons would be added to the unemployed list this year, and that he should take that into consideration when considering his Estimate.  We have got no indication as to what the Government's line on this matter is, or as to how they are going to provide either by work or by means of financial assistance for the increased unemployment that we are undoubtedly going to have in the country.</P>
      <P>We do know that there is going to be an increase in taxation.  I think the Minister for Local Government should tell us what he sees developing as a liability on local authorities to provide moneys to maintain the unemployed or to give employment.  That is particularly necessary in view of this fact, that if Deputies will take up the last report of the Department of Local Government and Public Health for 1938-39, at page 2, they will see there the actual amount of rates collected from the various local bodies in the years ending 1933 to 1938.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>By means of Parliamentary question we have brought that information up to date, to 1940.  The 1932 figures are available.  In the case of every single group of local bodies, the amount of rates which it is taking from the ratepayers has gone up by more than one-third since the present Government came into office.  We know what the total bill presented to the county council ratepayers for the current year is.  Up to March, 1940, the ratepayers in the counties were called upon to pay £947,000 more than they paid in the year ending March, 1932, an increase of 38.3 per cent.  The urban districts had to pay £222,000, an increase of 40 per cent. on the 1932 figures.  The increase in the towns was <Col N="1537" /> up by 58 per cent.  The county boroughs had to pay £639,000 more, or 38 per cent. of an increase.  The ratepayers as a whole had to pay £1,814,000 more in the year ending March, 1940, than they had to pay in March, 1932, an increase of 38.8 per cent.  When we come to the people Deputy McGovern spoke about and take the bill presented to them for the current year&mdash;up to the 31st December, 1940&mdash;there was taken from the county council ratepayers in the nine months of the financial year that then ended, £757,000 more than they paid in the nine months ending December, 1931. The bill staring them in the face for the three months ending the 31st March last was an additional £886,730 more than they paid in the corresponding quarter of 1932.  If there is taken from the county council ratepayers, in the year ended March of this year, the additional amount of the bill presented to them, then they will have paid, for every £100 they paid in the year ended March, 1932, £157.  The rating position of the country has been reduced to that, and the suggestion emanating from the Government policy is that the cost of the additional unemployment in the country, whether by way of public works&mdash;some fraction of it, at any rate&mdash;or by way of unemployment assistance or relief, is to be thrown on local bodies.  I suggest that it is a very serious responsibility of the Minister to let us have as clear a picture as possible of that to-day.</P>
    <P>I suggested on the Vote on Account here that it was absolutely essential that our people should get some kind of impression of the policy that is at the back of the Government's mind in dealing with the unemployment situation in this country, before they face the bill likely to be presented in the Budget.  I would particularly like to ask the Minister whether the Dublin Corporation, or other bodies throughout the country, have been approached by any Department of the Government, suggesting that their rates should be framed to meet the additional expenditure arising out of the unemployment position; and, if not&mdash;and if it is the intention of the Government to throw some of the responsibility on <Col N="1538" /> them financially&mdash;why they have not been advised to do so, that they may face the financial year with some chance of knowing what kind of policy they were to be asked to pursue?  The problem of dealing with unemployment and relief will have to be dealt with by somebody.</P>
    <P>The second point harks back to some of the remarks made by Deputy Keyes, in asking that the Vote be referred back.  Deputies have talked about the necessity to look after disease.  There is elaborate machinery and elaborate institutions for dealing with disease, but the disease likely to affect us at the present time and to be most serious is the one not touched on by the Department at all&mdash;that is, the disease of malnutrition, arising from and exaggerated enormously at the present time by the poverty of the people.</P>
    <P>When I was in the Department of Local Government and Public Health I decided that there was as much responsibility on that Department to pay attention to the nutrition aspect of public health as there was on the Department of Agriculture to decide what kind of mash should be fed to bonhams or what kind of feeding should be given to other stock.  I was not able to succeed in impressing on the Department all that I wished and there was so much to be done in the way of general education, of political and other kinds, that I did not like to start teaching mothers how to feed children.  I am glad to see that the broad aspects of the question of nutrition have been raised, and raised by those driven to raise them from their contact with the poor.</P>
    <P>I quite agree that the question of nutrition should be tackled in a thorough and scientific manner and that we will get the best results in that way.  However, I would like to present as a sample the budget of an unemployed man.  He gets £1 3s. 6d.  I suppose it comes from unemployment assistance.  He is assisted to some extent by his people and this is his weekly expenditure: Rent of room, 8/6; one bag of coal, 4/9; paraffin oil for lamp, 7d.; burial society, 6d.; 1½ lbs. <Col N="1539" /> margarine, 1/-; 7 small pans of bread, 1/10½; ¼ lb. tea, 8d.; 2½ lbs. sugar, 9d.; 3 tins of milk, 1/3; 1 stone potatoes, 1/2; meat, 2/6; making a total of £1 3s. 6d.  That is for a man and his wife and two children.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>If there were not such a shortage of time, and if I did not wish the Minister to tell us the general principles on this point, I could show how a man and his wife and six children are working on a budget of £2 13s. 2½d., paying 6/6 for rent and 4/9 for coal.  A couple of others eke out small wages in other ways.  I would like to quote this extract from the <i>Economist</i> of the 18th January, 1941, page 65 which is a summary of an investigation into the working class budgets in England:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The average number of people in a family is 3.77.  The average weekly expenditure is 86/3 of which rent is 10/10; food, 34/1; clothing, 9/4; fuel and light, 6/5 and other items 25/7&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The worst microbe that we are likely to have here in the City of Dublin, or that we have at the present time, is the poverty microbe.</P>

      <P>I would sincerely ask the Minister to take a serious and a scientific interest, on the one hand, in the suggestion now being made publicly that the Department of Local Government and Public Health has the responsibility to look systematically and thoroughly into the whole question of nutrition and to help to drive a strong pile into the ground to raise and steady the improvement in national health thereon, and while dealing with that matter scientifically, also on the other side of things to get some of the statistics and information lying at the Department's very doors at the Custom House, as to the position in which people are raising their <Col N="1540" /> families on the present amount of money available to them.  That is one of the most important and most urgent things at the present moment, and it will be a direction post to the Minister in deciding the policy the country will travel in the question of unemployment and relief.</P>

      <P>I feel that there is very little to be gained by comparing the Estimates to-day with those of ten years ago.  If time permitted, I could make a case for the additional expenditure.  The first point would be the housing question.  While we have done much, particularly in Dublin, to improve housing amenities, there is ever so much still needed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCann</NameTxt>
      <P>When we look at the item of some £500,000 repayment on loan charges, I ask the Minister to remember in future what I have said elsewhere and repeat now, that he should keep a close eye on the banks and builders.  I believe that matter would have been greatly improved if the banks and builders had not mulcted the Dublin Corporation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Mulcahy is quite right and we are all agreed that the microbe of poverty is the one that afflicts us most and the one which must be pursued by the Minister.  In that connection I would like to draw the attention of the Minister to the relief depot in Dublin in Balfe Street.  He, or one of his officials, should pay a visit there and see the conditions.  It is bad enough for a person to be reduced to the state of having to seek public relief but the conditions under which the officials labour there are very bad.  It is a most out-of-date building and the manner in which relief is distributed there savours very much of a chapter from Dickens.  I ask the Minister to pay <Col N="1541" /> special attention to that particular place.  The building is out of date and the manner in which the recipients get their relief there, as I say, is reminiscent of 100 years ago.  A person may be standing there in a crowd and the relieving officer calls out his name and he marches up to take the miserable pittance.  I think there are people on relief to-day who never had to seek relief before.  There are people who have been on relief for a number of years but if a man who is reduced to that state must go to that place, we should endeavour to safeguard any little bit of pride he still has left.</P>
    <P>So far as hospitalisation in Dublin is concerned, I was glad to hear from country Deputies that the local hospitals are empty, so to speak.  It bears out what I have been hearing from competent medical officers here, that the Dublin hospitals are over-crowded due to the fact that there are incompetent surgeons throughout the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCann</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not saying there are not competent surgeons throughout the country but the equipment in the county hospitals, it appears to me, is such that only minor operations can be performed there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcCann" hpid="Mr. McCann Mr. McCann">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCann</NameTxt>
      <P>That is my information. I have heard country Deputies say that here.  Whether that is true or not, this is true, that many of the beds in the Dublin hospitals are taken up by country patients who can pay to the exclusion of Dublin people who cannot pay.  The whole question of hospitalisation here needs to be gone into.  I, for one&mdash;I said it before and I repeat it now&mdash;would like to see a State hospitalisation scheme here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like the Minister at his earliest convenience to make some public pronouncement in relation to the building trade in connection with the housing programme in Dublin.  There is great discontent and unrest and many building trade operatives are leaving the city and going to England for work.  I would like the Minister <Col N="1542" /> to make a statement generally on the housing question.  I see the Housing Board still functions.  This question must be constantly under review and I do not think it would take very much trouble to let us know exactly how we stand and what prospects there are for the building trade workers here.</P>
    <P>There is only one other point, Sir, and that is the question of sending men on relief work.  Unless a man is in receipt of 23/- in the Dublin area, he is not sent on relief.  The point is that that man may get, say, six or eight weeks, or whatever the period of relief work is, and when the relief work comes round again he is sent out again, whereas the man with 19/- never gets out.  The Minister may say that is wrong, but that is what I have been told every day of the week.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. Ruttledge)</NameTxt>
      <P>In the short time that is available I am afraid I can only touch on a very few of the matters that have been raised here.  I think it is unfortunate in a matter of this kind, when I consider the number of very irresponsible and untrue statements that have been made, not only in this House but outside this House, with regard to delays and other matters affecting the Department, that one has not, perhaps, a longer time to deal with it.  I had hoped to have an opportunity to deal with the various charges that have been bandied about the country, not by Deputies, perhaps, but by other people outside, as to delays <Col N="1543" /> in my Department and I could refute them.  The first question was raised here by Deputy Brennan.  He said, in the past 14 years the Department's expenditure increased four-fold.  Taking out housing, he says, there is an increase of £300,000.  If the Deputy had made even a cursory examination of the Estimates for previous years he would find the public health services, as compared with 14 years ago, have increased by, I think, over £200,000. There is a sum of £90,000 provided with regard to free milk alone which did not exist then.</P>
      <P>Deputy Keyes raised the question of a number of people in County Limerick having to go without milk.  We have received complaints from, I think, two parish councils, in the Bruff and Cappamore area, about the difficulty of getting milk there and asking that some arrangement should be made with the creameries.  We have asked the county medical officer of health to have the matter looked into and to report to us.  Deputy Alderman Byrne also raised the question about the inadequacy of the free milk grant.  That matter is being examined both with regard to the difficulties of supply and with regard to the present arrangements.</P>
      <P>Deputy Keyes also raised the question of the welfare of the blind.  He said there was an increase of only £40 in that regard.  The Estimate here only deals with the provision of moneys for blind people treated in approved institutions. It has nothing whatever to do with the arrangements made for the blind by local authorities and that increase of £40 is based on the report we get from these approved institutions as to whether any greater sum is required or not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One matter I wish to take up with Deputy Brennan is the question he raised with regard to tuberculosis.  The reason I desire to go into this in any detail is that it is the only disease there has been a slight increase in the death rates that I had given the House in the last day or two.  Deputy Brennan says the system of treatment of tuberculosis is not good and that the provision <Col N="1544" /> of a three county sanatorium to remove infection was taken up enthusiastically by Offaly, Westmeath and Roscommon but the Department seemed to sit upon it.</P>
    <P>The position is this.  The Department has been for a number of years advocating and urging local authorities to set up a sanatorium to deal with advanced cases in their counties.  As far back as 1936, the chairman of the Roscommon County Council suggested to the board of health the establishment of a central sanatorium between three or four counties instead of a special one for this county.  On the 21st March, 1936, the board asked the county medical officer of health to report to the next meeting.  On the 16th May, 1936, the board of health approved of a recommendation from the county medical officer of health that a sanatorium for two or three counties would be more satisfactory, and he suggested the counties of Leitrim and Longford, as adjacent counties.  On the 19th December, 1936, a conference of representatives from Roscommon, Offaly, Longford and Westmeath Counties was held at Athlone and it was decided to approve of the proposal.  It was again pointed out to the secretary of the conference that with regard to sanatoria, there were outside places like Peamount and Newcastle where the early cases could be dealt with and that what they should keep in mind was to deal with the advanced cases in the area, whether it consisted of a county or a number of counties.  On the 19th January, 1937, the Longford Board of Health decided that the county medical officers of health of the counties concerned, including Roscommon, should be requested to confer on all aspects of the case and report to their respective boards of health.  No further action has been taken by that joint conference in regard to the matter, and that was away back in 1937.  Is Deputy Brennan aware of these facts and, if so, why does he state here in this House that the Department seems to sit upon it?</P>
    <P>Deputy Murphy referred to the inability of T.B. patients to go to <Col N="1545" /> Newcastle and other such institutions. With regard to Newcastle and such institutions our experience has been that in some districts, in the early stages of consumption, people do not want to be treated in their own areas. Their desire is to go outside their own areas or counties for treatment.  It may be an unfortunate thing that some people seem to want to hide the disease in some way or another, and do not want to be treated in their own areas, but that has been our experience. There are ample sanatoria in Cork to deal with advanced cases, and there is one at, I think, Doneraile, which deals with the early stages of the disease. The Deputy asked why there should be a charge on people for coming to other sanatoria, but it must be remembered that if patients were to be admitted there without such a charge, Newcastle and Peamount would be snowed under.</P>
    <P>There is a proposal to build a sanatorium at Ballyowen, I think, to provide for tuberculosis cases. I understand that there will be 300 beds available there, and when that hospital is ready it will deal with City and County of Dublin cases.  The Deputy has also suggested the taking over of the Rialto hospital.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Ballyowen hospital will be built there will be more beds available in Peamount for other areas.  Deputy Brennan came back again about the hospitals situation, and he says, to use his own words:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Department had not the `guts' to stand up to the architects&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Now, I only want to refer Deputy Brennan to a case in his own county where, as a result of the Department standing up to the architects, the hospital has not been built.  On the other hand, we may be accused of delay because the hospital has not been built.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was a hospital proposed to be built at Boyle.  The proposal was to build a small general hospital for 16 <Col N="1546" /> beds and a small fever hospital for 16 beds&mdash;a total of 32 beds.  Estimates were got for these two hospitals&mdash;or rather it was one hospital, but in two separate wings&mdash;and it was estimated that the cost should not exceed £27,000.  Now, in this connection, it must be remembered that a hospital was built in another part of the country, in the year 1927, under a previous Administration, for about £10,000, and that hospital had accommodation for 30 beds.  When the architect in this case, however, approached the matter, there was an estimate of £36,000.  The estimate was brought back to £28,700 and tenders were invited on that basis.  The lowest tender was for £36,977 but the contractors who submitted it were not willing to proceed, and the second lowest tender was for £42,000.  We again went back to the architect, told him that this thing could not be permitted, and asked him to amend his plans, and we also asked the local authority to see that he did amend his plans, with a view to getting a hospital built there at a reasonable cost.  We have not given way on that point, and it has been going on from that time to this.  The local authority seemed to be anxious to get a hospital built there no matter what it may cost, but on the basis of the second lowest tender, which amounted to £42,000, the actual cost of the hospital would reach £48,000 or £50,000, when architect's fees, quantity surveyor's fees, remuneration of clerk of works and cost of furnishing and equipment were added.  This would work out at between £1,600 and £1,700 per bed.  Needless to say, we have stood up to that and did not agree to the proposal on these figures, and we have got very little help because of the local authority.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1547" /> Now, Deputy Brennan has also accused us here of having built a hospital in Roscommon and not provided a sewerage scheme for it.  Deputy Brennan, I assume, is on the board of health, and he is certainly on the county council, and if he looks up the records of the Roscommon Board he will find that in the early estimate submitted by the architect a figure was included for sewage disposal.  The matter was the subject of correspondence between the Department and the board so far back as the year 1937.  On the 30th September, 1937, the Department wrote to the board saying that plans, specifications and estimate of the cost of providing for disposal of the sewage should be prepared and submitted.  The decision of the board, on the 9th July, 1938, was that the sewerage scheme should provide for both the new hospital and the county home.  The proposals for the disposal of the sewage were not received in the Department until the 31st August, 1939, and the Department approved of the scheme on the 18th November, 1939. Drawings and specifications were received in the Department on the 19th March, 1940.  The board then raised the question whether it would not be preferable to dispose of the sewage into the town sewerage system instead of having a separate disposal plant. Their technical advisers reported on this point on the 23rd May, 1940.  The board, on the 25th May, 1940, decided to proceed with the separate scheme. The scheme was approved by the Department on the 24th September, 1940.  Tenders were received by the board on the 23rd November, 1940, and approval was given to the acceptance of a tender at £6,774 on the 14th December, 1940.  Now, Deputy Brennan mentioned here that a hospital was built in Roscommon and that no sewerage plant or sewerage scheme was provided in connection with the hospital.  Naturally, the House laughed.  Well.  I hope the laugh is on the other side now.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to interrupt the Minister, but there seems to be quite a delay there between the <Col N="1548" /> time of the decision of the board and that of the approval by the Department. I think the scheme was approved by the Department in September, although the board decided to proceed with the scheme in May. That would seem to be a very long time to elapse.</P>

The proposals for the disposal of the sewage were not received in the Department until the 31st August, 1939.

      <P>Deputy Hickey has raised here on a number of occasions the question of hospitalisation in Cork.  The hospitalisation that was intended for Cork was a fever hospital, a maternity hospital and a regional hospital.</P>

      <P>Do not mind about that for the moment.  The site that was originally selected for the fever hospital in Cork was selected at a time when an architect had not been appointed.  That site was subsequently rejected.  It was rejected on the grounds that there was not available at that site space suitable for a pavilion type.  A new site was selected. Deputy Hickey says now that this new site has necessitated the building of a new reservoir.  Does the Deputy not know that he is incorrect in saying that?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>Very well.  The maternity hospital in Cork originated with the Erinville Lying-in Hospital. The committee of management applied for a grant, and they got something like £36,000.  They sought a site convenient to the Beamish and Crawford Brewery.  That site was considered unsuitable for the following reasons: (a) the undesirably low level of the land and the possibility of flooding; (b) the foul condition of the Mardyke stream and the necessity for covering it in at a cost of about £1,000; (c) the inadequate extent of the site for number and extent of buildings contemplated; (d) proximity to malting premises of Messrs.  Beamish and Crawford which might possibly be taken over at some time for a noisy or otherwise disagreeable trade or industry.  An alternative site was suggested at the terminus of the Cork and Muskerry Railway.  A provisional committee consisting of three representatives of the Erinville Hospital and three representatives from Deputy Hickey's Corporation was appointed. These six people unanimously approved of the site at the Cork and Muskerry Railway.</P>

      <P>The local authorities approved of it on the grounds (a) that the location of the institution would be convenient to the homes of the poor people availing themselves of the services of the hospital; (b) the medical staff would be within easy call of confinement cases requiring to be attended in their homes; (c) the hospital, which is to be an important teaching and training centre, would be more easily accessible to the students and teaching staff.  Before anything could be done <Col N="1552" /> legislation was necessary and such legislation was passed in 1939 enabling a joint board to be established.  The Deputy referred to the scheme for the planning competition.  In 1939 this Act was passed and the scheme for the planning competition was under way when the war broke out.  The scheme was then abandoned by the Erinville committee of management.</P>

      <P>You need not try to interrupt me; you have made statements here which are not facts.  Accusations have been made about delays. Some Deputies who will not put forward charges of definite cases of delay or obstruction have suggested in an oblique kind of way that there must be cases.  We see some irresponsible newspapers or some irresponsible correspondents of irresponsible newspapers, making those statements. The only definite case of delay that was suggested here was the one referred to by Deputy Keyes about the furnishing of the mental hospital in Limerick.  Grants amounting to £3,000 have been paid in respect of furniture for the new extensions, and, with the <Col N="1553" /> exception of the Admission Unit, all of the new buildings have already been fully furnished and occupied.  Quotations were received in July last for the supply of furniture for the new Admission Unit, and the committee approved of the purchase of articles amounting to £2,117.  Sanction was requested, and on 6th September a letter was issued from the Department to the effect that the Minister desired immediately a detailed list of all actual and prospective commitments in connection with structural works, equipment, furniture and so forth.  No reply was received to that letter.  Deputy Keyes might get in touch with the local body, rather than come in here and make attacks on the Department of Local Government.  No reply was received to that letter.  On the 14th ultimo a reminder was issued, stating that the Minister had been waiting a reply since 6th September last.  No reply has yet been received.  Of course it is quite easy to make attacks on the Department, but Deputies should try to get the facts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not a question of coming in here to attack the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not suggesting that there is anything personal in the attack; I am saying that Deputies should procure the facts before they make statements like that.  I could refer to a lot of big headings in the newspapers throughout the country dealing with schemes held up by the Department; there is a campaign on, I am quite well aware of it, and I can give the facts.  As it has not been referred to here in the House by name, I do not want to use the name of any particular public body, but it is in an area in which Deputy MacEoin or Deputy Childers or Deputy Victory might be interested.  In that area it was decided that the T.Ds. should be asked to chuck up their jobs if they could not get the Department of Local Government to speed up and remedy this position.  What is the position? It is in regard to the building of houses.  On 22nd January, 1941, a minute of the urban district council was received, stating that they had before them at their meeting on 7th <Col N="1554" /> January six tenders, and that they accepted the lowest, subject to sanction. On 31st January the Department asked to be supplied with all the tenders received by the council together with the town surveyor's report thereon, and to be informed of the reason for the delay in submitting the tenders.  By letter dated 29th January, 1941&mdash;received in the Department on 3rd February, 1941&mdash;the town clerk sent the tenders, and stated that the council had referred them to the town surveyor to check the bills of quantities.  He did not refer to the Department's letter of 31st January, 1941, which it is presumed he had, in fact, received before he wrote the letter dated 29th January, 1941.  On 10th February, 1941, the Department, not having received the town surveyor's report asked for in their letter of 31st January, 1941, again asked for it.  On 19th February, 1941, the town surveyor's report not having been received, a reminder was sent to the town clerk, and his attention drawn to the Department's letters of 31st January and 10th February.  On 28th February, 1941, the town surveyor's report on the tenders was received in the Department. On 15th March sanction was issued to the acceptance of a tender, and instructions as to a loan were also given.  That is one example; I could give a number of others.  I could give examples of cases where we are accused of delays which are responsible for big increases in price, but if Deputies would try to find out the facts locally, they would discover that the fault lies with the local bodies themselves.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>There are no architects in those matters at all.  Those general statements do not get us anywhere. Making attacks on the architects will not help either the work of the Department or the work of the local bodies.  We have had our troubles with the architects.  We have stood up against the architects, and because we stood up against them we are accused of undue delay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave raised the matter as to whether there should be endowment <Col N="1555" /> now for those voluntary hospitals. If there was endowment four or five years ago, perhaps that endowment could be worked out at say £3,000,000. If you are to endow them on the basis of the deficits now it would mean that it would be £6,000,000.  In a position like that, which seems to be fluctuating at the moment, and with the hospitals that we have in hand or that we hope to get built, I do not think that the present is an opportune time to do it.  This is a matter that is continually under examination, but the hospitals themselves have not asked for any definite endowment.  I do not think it is a matter that could be considered at the present time.</P>
    <P>The Deputy also raised a question about a serum.  In 1937 a research council of very eminent men was set up here.  It was the duty of that research council to issue grants for research work.  Grants amounting, I think, to something like £22,000 have been issued by them to various research workers since that time.  They report once a year to the Department of Local Government, but the Department of Local Government are not, as I understand it at any rate, supposed to judge on the work that is carried out under the guidance or under the direction or under the grants issued through the research council until they have the report of the research council on the matter.  That, I am quite sure, was understood by the people concerned with this particular serum, that is, the serum for diphtheria.  Dr. O'Meara has been working on that for two or three years.  Grants have been issued each year.  I am quite sure he recognised the position, that until he has reported to the research council, and until they have reported to us what the position is, we have no responsibility in the matter.  We are very glad, and everybody who takes an interest in public health is very pleased, to see the progress that is being made.  Nobody can take any exception whatever to the question being raised in this House, especially to the way in which Deputy Cosgrave raised it, but I do think that exception should be taken to having people who are engaged in that sort of work, <Col N="1556" /> silent work and very deserving work, bandied about in the newspapers.  I refrained from replying to the newspapers at that time, as I did not think it was going to help in any way; I did not think it was in the best interests of the work in which we were engaged. As far as we are concerned, we are aware of the work that has been done. We got reports from the doctors concerned, but we are awaiting the research council's final reports on those matters.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I am quite sure that the doctors themselves had nothing to do with that matter.  Dr. O'Meara came to see me in connection with it, and was very hurt about getting publicity of that sort.  He had nothing whatever to do with it.  I think it is unfortunate that somebody should have signed himself &ldquo;an M.D.&rdquo; in a letter to the Press on this matter, because if he was &ldquo;an M.D.&rdquo; he would have understood the position about the research council.</P>
      <P>There has been mention made about malnutrition.  On that question I have nothing more to guide me than the reports I get from the medical officers of health.  I am not trying to get away from the conditions that may exist in parts of the country, but we must bear in mind that very often malnutrition is due to an improper diet.  The subject is being continually examined in the Department and arrangements will be made to try to educate the people.</P>

      <P>In some places the doctors have done it and we are trying to centralise that&mdash;working out from a particular centre.  The county medical officers of health have done a good deal in many places.  In their annual reports they refer to those matters and they give an indication of the usefulness of particular diets or the mixture of a particular diet.  I am hoping that that will be centralised in some way <Col N="1557" /> and that we may be able to get a pooling of the opinions of all the county medical officers of health on these matters, and be in a position to issue useful leaflets or pamphlets which could be circulated generally.</P>
      <P>Deputy Mulcahy referred to the unemployment position and mentioned the burden that might be imposed on the rates.  Unemployment this year is not abnormal in comparison with last year.  The position is being examined, and, if it becomes abnormal, the matter will be submitted to the Government by the Minister for Industry and Commerce. The question may arise, what extra or extraordinary provisions would have to be made from the local government point of view?  If certain circumstances arise from an abnormal situation, such as a war period, abnormal arrangements would have to be made.  In an abnormal period I do not feel that the local bodies would have to bear the burden.</P>

In those cases where people are knocked off during the existence of the Employment Period Order, and where they are found to be in very poor circumstances and are in need of assistance, the Central Fund contributes 50 per cent. to the local bodies to meet cases that arise in that way.  If cases of hardship are found, Central Fund contributes 50 per cent. to the local bodies to meet the cost of relieving the distress.</P>

      <P>I shall.  Some Deputies referred to hospitals in various parts of the country and they said that in those hospitals they are not able to perform major operations. The reference was made to district hospitals.  I gather from some Deputies that they want that type of thing done, while there are others who do not want it.  The district hospitals were never intended for the performance of major operations.  The aim was to have county hospitals and also to have regional hospitals, but we could not be expected to equip small district hospitals&mdash;supply them with the best technical devices and experienced people.  There is no necessity to have a district hospital equipped for major operations or staffed with medical men capable of carrying out such work.  In practically every county hospital adequate arrangements are made and there is a good ambulance service.  Deputy Murphy seems to disagree with the conditions in Cork, but there you have a good ambulance service and in the City of Cork you have as good men as will be found in any part of the country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TimothyJMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that in a county health district which extends 100 miles from Cork City, at least one hospital ought to be equipped for the purpose to which I have referred?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that is necessary, considering the facilities that are available for transferring patients to the city hospital.  Deputy Murphy also mentioned that we refused to sanction a doctor's salary&mdash;I think it was an assistant medical officer of health he was talking about. The position is that there are three assistant medical officers of health in Cork.  The usual salary is £550, going up by various increments, but on account of three being in the County Cork their salaries were fixed at £500. One of the assistant medical officers of health resigned, or the position became vacant, and the local authorities tried to fix the salary at £350, although on previous occasions they fixed it at £500, and it had been approved of.  The Department refused to sanction that. It is quite obvious to Deputies that we could not have one medical officer working with two other medical officers and having a lower salary than them.  Deputies may think we may not have seen through that, or that the Department may not have seen through It, but the object, of course, was to get the position into such a way that it would be unattractive to anybody outside County Cork to apply for it, and then, of course, to come along after a year or two and say that the Department could not insist on not giving the £500.  If you want to attract people there is no use in attempting little tricks of that kind.  That is really the trick that was tried.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>We now find ourselves in the position of adjourning this House for a very considerable period, at a time when, if the statements made by the head of the Government are to be taken seriously, the people are facing something akin to starvation.  At a time when one of the Government Departments consider the position to be so grave that a tea ration on the severe scale of one ounce per person per week is considered necessary; at a time when, in so far as the mobile commercial life of the country is not completely paralysed for want of fuel, it is certainly seriously curtailed, and when the employment position is such that the gravity of it is not so much for the tens of thousands who are out of work, but rather for hundreds of thousands who can only look on their <Col N="1562" /> job as a type of livelihood which they have from hour to hour; at a time when our greatest industry&mdash;one that is bigger than all the other industries put together &mdash; is practically non-existent through the rampant and rather rapid spread of foot-and-mouth disease, this House is about to close down, without any reasonable opportunity being given to the representatives of the people to deal with these matters, and without any member of the Government utilising the time of the House to take the House and the public into its confidence. I want to impress on the Government, particularly, that, at the present time, there is in the mind of everyone a state of absolute confusion. No ordinary member of the public knows the why or the wherefore but, in the mind of many there is a kind of suppressed anger.  They feel that they are not being treated fairly; that they have been misled.  In moderation I put it to members of the Government that that state of mind is perfectly reasonable. Whatever the explanation, the public have got contradictory statements from one member of the Government and another, sometimes as frequently as twice in the same week, so they do not know where they are.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a Deputy, I am unable to give any satisfactory explanation of the present position.  Let us briefly take a glance at a food commodity, tea, that presses most acutely on the homes of the poor people.  It is only six or nine months since we had not one but probably all members of the Government going from one public platform to another, and in particular the Minister for Supplies, urging people to buy up and store commodities, including tea.  It was put up to these people as good citizens, and an appeal was made to their civic sense in the interests of the State to utilise their money in buying stores of flour, tea and other commodities.  The case made at that time was that there were ample supplies of tea, but that the question of transport might be difficult in the event of invasion.  Consequently, they wanted to get so much of these vast stores into the homes of the people in order to clear the decks, as it were, for more to come in at the centre.  Probably a very great number of people <Col N="1563" /> acted on the advice and listened to the appeals made by the Minister and bought up such commodities as tea.</P>
    <P>Some of us doubted, in respect of an article like tea, of which very great quantities in point of value can be stored in a very small space, the advisability of making appeals to wealthy people to buy up tea.  Many of us thought: &ldquo;This may result in leaving the poorer classes without tea&rdquo;; but we were assured, not once but many times, that there was no danger of that. The Minister for Supplies went out of his way to say to the people: &ldquo;Some decent, charitable people may think that by buying up such commodities now they are leaving their poorer neighbour without, or that, at some future date, they may leave their poorer neighbour without.  I want to say: Put that out of your mind; there is no danger of it.&rdquo;  The charitably-minded, unselfish person who read that statement immediately took it that it was his duty, in face of that statement, to buy, and he went into the merchant and bought.  Some of us moving around through the people, and particularly those of us whose duties bring us into the homes of the very poorest, were definitely aware of the fact two or three months ago that tea was running out, and, with other Deputies in this House, three months ago, I made that statement from this bench.  I was told in a vehement and emphatic manner that that was not so, that there were ample supplies of tea, that that form of malicious propaganda was going around the country, and that it was malicious, because there was no such shortage and there was no necessity to contemplate a rationing scheme for tea.</P>
    <P>In June, July and August, people buy, store and hoard tea&mdash;that was the instruction; in January of this year, no shortage of tea and no necessity for rationing; and five days after that statement was made by a member of the Government, we had the Taoiseach going on the air and painting to the people a picture of famine, and amongst the items mentioned by him was tea.  Can there be confidence in a Government when the members of the <Col N="1564" /> Government contradict one another on such a vital issue as a necessary of life within a week; when, on one day, the Minister in charge of food supplies says they are ample and, a week later, the head of the Government says there is scarcity to the point of famine?  Buy and hoard&mdash;the advice nine months ago; three months ago, the advice is that there are ample supplies and no necessity for rationing; ten days later the commodity has run out and famine is ahead.  Two months after we were told there were ample supplies and no necessity for rationing, we get the public announcement of a rationing scheme and, in my opinion, for what it is worth, a grave mistake was made in the public announcement of the rationing scheme.  I am in favour of rationing.  If there is going to be the slightest shortage, I am in favour of rationing everything; but what will happen if you, or I, or anybody else, announces to-day that cigarettes are going to be rationed, say, from 1st May?  The ration tickets will be only bits of paper on 1st May and there will not be a cigarette for sale in a shop.</P>
    <P>What did we do with tea?  We gave notice to everybody with a &ldquo;bob&rdquo; in his pocket a month ago that, from 5th April, tea was going to be rationed, and naturally the head of a house with money bought what he could.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;I take it that the Minister was doing his job and knew what tea was available.  When he made the announcement, he made an announcement to the effect that supplies would allow two ounces per person per week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Not supplies, but that the quantity sold to retailers would allow it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFrancisOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Two ounces per person per week, and, within three <Col N="1565" /> weeks, he found that he had just half as much tea, and the ration was cut down by 50 per cent.  I do not care whether the Minister speaks from the Front Bench here, with official knowledge, or outside as an individual citizen with a citizen's knowledge.  He knows this, and so does every Deputy, that the amount of tea purchased from merchants in the last month was greater than in any month since last June.  I do not live my life in Dáil Eireann.  I move around the country, and, in the course of my business and in the course of social contacts, I meet merchants, and many of them whom I have met for the last fortnight were rubbing their hands because they had sold out every ounce of tea in their stores.  Whether that is an official fact or not, it is a fact, and if the Minister sets his machinery going through the shops, he will find that what I say is true, and the people of this country would be lunatics if that statement were not true.  The Minister made an announcement some 18 months ago that he was going to ration petrol from a certain date in advance, and, prior to that date, every teapot in the country was filled with petrol because the signal in advance, in effect, said to everybody: &ldquo;You will be rationed from 1st of next month, but you can buy without rationing before that, and buy what you can.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Deputy devise a system by which we could introduce rationing without giving notice?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFrancisOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFrancisOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not patting myself on the back, and what I suggest may be completely wrong, but if I were in the Minister's position, knowing the public and knowing the tendency, and, as it were, the responsibility of people to look after themselves, I would have announced a month or six weeks ago that rationing of food commodities may become a necessity, and in order to prepare the machine for rationing, if it became necessary, I wanted a registration card filled up by every <Col N="1566" /> householder and that, if people neglected to do so, they might find their houses without important food commodities. I would get in the cards and I would then ration, without any notice, from a certain date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Deputy for a moment think that nobody would have guessed it was tea we were aiming at? We thought of that, but we knew that everybody would guess it was tea.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFrancisOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Better leave them guessing.  It is a trick of the Government's, which they might have tried on that occasion.  It might have been some other commodity.  There was no necessity, in getting the registration cards, to say that there was an early or immediate intention of rationing. However, if it could have been done in any way calculated to invite large purchaser of the commodity, that was the way selected.  Be that as it may, what is the position?  The position is that the average member of the public is allowed to purchase one ounce of tea per week&mdash;one-seventh of an ounce per day.  I, certainly, think there should be discrimination between the person living alone and the house in which there is more than one person.  I can see the possibility of one ounce in a day, properly stretched out, being sufficient to do for seven persons, but I cannot see the possibility of any person&mdash;say, an aged woman living alone &mdash;doing on one-seventh of an ounce for one day.  I do not believe it can be done.  I can see the ounce being stretched out to do for seven, but I cannot see one-seventh of an ounce being stretched out to do for one. There should be an increased scale for the very small household of one, or even for the household of two.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Further, I believe that, ever since the war started, the public, irrespective of class or creed or political division, have shown a remarkably sound sense of citizenship.  They were asked to do many disturbing things.  They were asked to subscribe in many ways to many phases of national life&mdash;sometimes financially, sometimes by giving up their time and, at other times, by giving up their labour.  Every appeal made to the people was responded to <Col N="1567" /> in a magnificent manner.  The people are now on a ration of one ounce of tea per week.  Many people, in response to the Government appeal of last summer, have stocks&mdash;perhaps very large stocks&mdash;of tea in their houses. There are hundreds and thousands of households where there is, at least, a chest of tea.  That did not look a huge purchase at the time.</P>
    <P>In view of this ration, what does a chest of tea mean?  It means 40 years' ration for an individual.  There are many households with far more stores than that which, I would say, was not an unreasonable reply to the Minister's appeal of last June&mdash;one chest of tea. It turns out now that the tea situation is so bad that that modest purchase of one chest of tea represents, approximately, 40 years' ration or a year's ration for 40 people.  Would not the Minister consider it advisable, even at this stage, seeing the response the Ministry has got from the public, to request people who did store a certain amount, in response to his appeal last year, to return those stores to the merchant or, alternatively, to disclose them to the Minister, so that they would not require to be on the ration list until those stores were considerably depleted.  I know that talking about a thing like food at present is like walking on egg-shells.  I am aware of that.  I am also aware that, if sensible people do not discuss these matters sensibly, irresponsible people will begin to discuss them recklessly.  I do urge that where it can be said of the Government: &ldquo;You asked people to board; the people did hoard and, because they hoarded, I am to go without now&rdquo;, it is a dangerous situation. I believe that, even though many people might not disclose what they had, very many others would.  The position would be healthier and safer if such an appeal were made and if we were in a position to say with certainty of the people who had laid in stocks of this particular article now running short: &ldquo;They made available the stocks which they previously laid in with the best intentions in the world.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There may be some explanation of <Col N="1568" /> this tea situation which I have never heard, but it wants an amount of explaining. We had statements as late as last January that we had ample supplies of tea, that there was no necessity for rationing, followed up by a statement, within a fortnight, that there was a shortage and another statement, within two months, that there was, certainly, necessity for rationing&mdash;necessity for the harshest scale of rationing this country has ever experienced.  These statements want some explanation&mdash;a big amount of explanation. You cannot expect to have confidence behind an Administration that is constantly contradicting itself. We asked the public to follow the Government.  To follow the Government in which direction?  If a Government on Monday is going one way and on Tuesday is going the other way, you are in danger of colliding with yourself in an endeavour to follow the Government in opposite directions. We have got very contradictory and misleading statements, and the mere getting around an awkward corner in a debate does not justify a statement by a Minister that is not correct or is not officially sound.</P>
    <P>If the statement made by the Minister on the 16th or 17th January was officially correct, what happened our stores of tea within the following ten days?  Was there any destruction of our stores?  Was there any extensive robbery?  Why did the whole situation change in those ten days?  After 18 months' experience of having a Department of Supplies, and after 18 months' study of the situation by the personnel of the Department of Supplies, it was the considered opinion as recently as the middle of January that the rationing of tea was unnecessary. What happened between January and March which made the Department change its mind?  There may be some reason for that remarkable change of mind, but the public has never heard the reason.</P>
    <P>Meantime, in the public mind this severe rationing of tea and threatened rationing of other articles of food is being linked up with speeches&mdash;indiscreet speeches&mdash;made by the head of <Col N="1569" /> the Government.  In the public mind, this ruthless scale of rationing is mixed up with the statement of the Taoiseach that we are being blockaded by both sides.  The ordinary man can put two and two together.  He listens to a speech by the head of the Government that we are being blockaded by both sides.  What does that mean to the ordinary man in this country?  No matter what his views on internal or external policy may be, what does it mean to any Deputy?  The head of the Government says that we are now being blockaded by both sides.  It means that we are now being blockaded by Great Britain.  If it is stated here that we are going to be short of tea, and that there is a famine ahead in regard to other things, what does he say but that that is the result of the blockade by Great Britain?</P>
    <P>Then the head of the Government comes in and is asked if he will explain those words.  He justifies them in the debating style of the big boy in an infant class by saying that these great Powers in blockading one another are indirectly blockading us.  We are supposed to be grown-up people, we are supposed to be the representatives of other grown-up people.  If the Taoiseach made an indiscreet speech, perhaps in a panic, perhaps in pique, perhaps based on incorrect information, then is it not his responsibility, rather than to continue the harm, to say: &ldquo;My impression on that particular date was that that was so,&rdquo; but not to come in here talking that childish twaddle? A blockade means a determined attempt to stop supplies reaching the blockaded area.  It is not true, and it never was true at any phase of this war, that we are being blockaded by both sides.</P>
    <P>I do not hold a position so responsible as that of the Taoiseach, but I am certain that, if we were not being blockaded by Germany, and I went out in the street, and, worse still, went on the air, to talk to the people of Ireland and the people of America and attempted to make the statement that we are being blockaded by Germany, all the emergency powers and the powers of censorship and everything else would be used to prohibit that <Col N="1570" /> statement.  Every Deputy would say: &ldquo;Such a statement in the midst of a war, a false statement against a mighty belligerent can only provoke the wrath of that belligerent, and it is quite right to prevent that reckless person from making such a statement.&rdquo;  It would be a serious statement made even by a person in my humble position, but the harm must be multiplied a hundred fold when such a statement is made by the head of the Government.</P>
    <P>I believe that whatever blockade we are suffering from at the moment is a blockade imposed either by the Irish Government or by the Irish merchants. That picture of famine is held up before the eyes of the people at a time when the bottle-neck of the port of Dublin is glutted with goods which merchants will not remove.  The fact that merchants will not clear these goods means that ships laden with supplies for Éire cannot get in to supply Éire because of our own negligence here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say this to the Deputy.  A report came to me from the Defence Conference that that statement had been made.  I immediately caused a conference to be summoned of the traffic managers of the shipping companies.  The statement was put before them and they said it was not correct.  They stated, on the contrary, that they were quite capable of carrying a much larger quantity of goods than was offered.  I sent a copy of that report to the Defence Conference.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>May I be allowed to say this?  I was not responsible for making the complaint in the first instance, but I do know that the statement was made with authority that the traffic manager of the most important cross-channel shipping company approached the Dublin Chamber of Commerce and the Federation of Irish Industries and asked both bodies to communicate with their members to collect the goods which were lying in the stores at the North Wall, and that, in consequence of that approach, a circular was sent by both bodies to their members asking them to clear goods which were there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not denying that merchants were asked to facilitate the companies by clearing goods lying in the stores.  But the statement that, in consequence of congestion at the North Wall, deliveries of supplies to this country were being held up was incorrect, and was stated to be incorrect by the traffic managers of the companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFrancisOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>With all due respect to the Minister, the Minister appears to be speaking truth according to the information he has.  I can assure the Minister that, in repeating my statement, I am speaking truth according to the information which I have.  Moreover, I believe that some couple of months ago the blockade position effected by blockading ourselves was accepted to such an extent by us that we worked the labour at the docks round the whole face of the clock in order to clear away that glut, in order to clear away the jamb, and that since that day labour has done its part but the merchants have not, and that the actual tonnage of goods at that port has trebled or quadrupled since the time the Minister refers to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In other words, whatever bottle-neck there was there three months ago is narrower by two-thirds than it was then.  That is a statement that may be contradicted here and may be reasserted here and that does not lead us anywhere.  It is a statement made because I believe it is true and because I believe it is a serious matter. If the statement is incorrect, I will be <Col N="1572" /> the first to withdraw it, but I certainly will not withdraw it as long as I believe it is correct.  I have been asked to visit the North Wall this afternoon and I am going there.  Does that look as if my information was incorrect?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is true that some merchants were slow in removing goods from the docks and that some congestion in the stores of one company resulted.  The suggestion was made, however, that in consequence of the congestion there, the companies were unable to ship goods awaiting shipment on the other side.  That statement was categorically denied by the traffic managers of the companies. They stated on the contrary that they were capable of shipping a much larger quantity of goods than was offered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFrancisOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not pursue the matter further because I can see, as there is a difference of opinion, that it could be more satisfactorily discussed elsewhere.  The Minister has certain information which may be correct; I have certain information which I believe to be reliable and which may be correct.  I am satisfied that at least we are agreed on this, that if there is a hold-up there, it has to be looked into, and if there is not a hold-up, the statement that there was a hold-up was made in good faith.  My belief is that there was and that there is.  If I am convinced of that by visual evidence, because as I say I am a person who doubted it and disputed it, the first person that will get the evidence is the Minister, and it can then be dealt with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I did refer to the rationing of tea. Whether there was a real necessity for it or not, I do not know.  I have not met any constituent or anybody else to say that there was.  I get the Minister's statement, that he made two months ago, slapped in my face, and I get pulled up and asked if we are going to reach the point of having to ration the very poor.  On that, why did we invite the rich to hoard?  I have gone over that ground already.  I believe the whole tea situation was <Col N="1573" /> badly handled.  The petrol situation was worse.  I had better draw a screen over it, because the petrol situation of the present and the future, as I see it, is appalling.  In the case of the petrol situation, we are again up against the question: who is blockading us?  The motor trade in Dublin say the Ministry of Supplies.  They say that a reasonable arrangement for a more or less adequate supply of petrol for this country, to keep workers in employment and cars on the road, could be effected but for the Department of Supplies.  Others say that it could be effected but for the Irish petrol companies. My information is that the hold-up is a fight between the Irish petrol companies and the Department of Supplies over the question of an oil refinery.  That information may, or may not, be correct.  I asked the Minister had an offer been made to supply this country with 50 per cent. of its pre-war petrol.  Deputy Belton had previously asked the same question.</P>

      <P>My information is that there was an arrangement between this country and Great Britain&mdash;say it was between either the Government or the oil companies here and the petrol board on the other side&mdash;entered into at the beginning of the war that we would be supplied with 80 per cent. of our pre-war petrol supply, but that about the end of last year notification was received that it could no longer be maintained on account of the sinkings. Communication was opened up between the two countries, resulting in a proposal that, instead of 80 per cent. of our pre-war petrol supply, we would be supplied with 50 per cent. of that supply.  Obviously, guarantees could not be given in a world-war situation to deliver a gallon of petrol, but backed up by good faith that proposal was made to replace the 80 per cent. arrangement by the 50 per cent. arrangement.  Apparently, final acceptance&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Minister informs me, in the answer he gave to my question, that during 1940 we received 34,000,000 gallons of petrol or, roughly, 2,800,000 gallons a month.  He says that since the 1st January we received 3,900,000 gallons of petrol&mdash;that is over a period of three months&mdash;or, roughly, 1,300,000 gallons of petrol per month. The latter figure is very nearly half of 2,800,000 gallons.  In other words, pending the operation of this new proposal, we have got for each month of this year approximately half of what we got for each month last year.  The distribution of that petrol by the Department of Supplies appears to be on the basis of having received only 25 per cent.  Does the Minister assert that motor owners, of all kinds, in this country are getting half as much now as they got in each month last year? The commercial people are cut down 60 per cent., the doctors 80 per cent., <Col N="1576" /> and the clergymen 50 per cent., while private owners are completely off the road.  Yet, according to the Minister, we are getting half as much petrol. What has become of the rest?</P>
      <P>By way of supplementary question and answer, the Minister made a state ment here to the effect that he was perfectly prepared to give over to the Medical Union or other representative bodies the distribution of petrol allocated to certain classes of people&mdash; nothing more&mdash;only the amount of petrol allocated.  Last year every doctor received a basic petrol ration of three times the horse-power of his car.  In addition to that, nine out of every ten of them got a supplementary allowance. The petrol is cut down by half in the basic allowance alone.</P>
      <P>The medical officer looking after the sick and injured is immediately cut down 70 per cent., without taking into account the supplementary allowance at all; taking that into account, he is cut down 80 to 90 per cent.  That is true: there is no denying it.  If the Minister cares to look it up&mdash;he can get it in five minutes&mdash;he will see from the coupon allowance of every doctor any month last year as compared with the present month, that they have been cut down by 70 per cent. and in most cases by 90 per cent. No organisation could undertake the distribution of a percentage of a pool which is grossly unjust.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we had half as much petrol per month this year as we had last year, and if it had been sensibly passed out through the coupon issue, the motor life of this country would not be disrupted to the extent it has been.  On the basis of receiving half as much, I do not think it would be necessary to disemploy a single man.  Although I have referred to doctors, the most serious side of the whole petrol coupon control is the complete cut-off of the private car.  From the points of view of unemployment, of trade, and of the ordinary life and business of a great number of people, it was very unwise. Even if an issue of two gallons per month could have been made to the private car owner, I believe many of them would have remained on the road and, by that means, garages would <Col N="1577" /> have kept their staffs.  In the last month we have all met pathetic cases of people who were qualified tradesmen and held big appointments in big firms here in Dublin, and who are now looking for any class of work in this country or in England.</P>
    <P>I have to apologise to the House, as the debate started late and I have taken up an undue share of the time available; but I would strongly urge on the Minister, before I sit down, the advisability of altering the ration of tea at least in its application to the poorer households.  In dealing with cases where he is perfectly satisfied, from the means of the household, that they could not have a reserve of even 1 lb. of tea, he should consider a special extra ration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the short time available, I shall be brief.  As the House is adjourning for a few weeks, and as the food situation is the most serious which confronts us, I should like to get some information from the Minister for Agriculture as to the probable position in respect of food supplies. We have heard very disturbing and contradictory statements as to the area under wheat, and the expectation that, by the sowing of wheat at the usual time, and by the late sowing of wheat, and the putting in of what spring wheat is available, we would be able to get the 700,000 acres we need. Anybody going through the country, and hearing the point of view of the farmers, will have no hesitation in realising clearly that we will not be able to get 700,000 acres under wheat this year, nor anything like that figure. That is due, firstly, to the fact that we woke up late to the necessity for increased tillage, and, secondly, to the accidental circumstance of particularly bad weather during the period when winter wheat could be sown with safety.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recently the Taoiseach went to Limerick and made a speech in which he indicated that, as far as bread was concerned, we might before next harvest have bread which contained not merely 95 or 100 per cent. wheat extraction, but which contained barley and, possibly, oats.  If that is the position, it ought to be on some definite basis, <Col N="1578" /> and not left to mere speculation.  We know now what quantity of wheat is in the country, and we can, apparently, assume that we will get no more in.  If we have to make a barley or oats admixture, we should start at this stage with a graduated admixture, rather than do it in July or August, and then have a loaf with an undue barley or oats content.  At all events, we should know definitely where we stand in regard to these supplies.  We should know what kind of loaf we will get until next harvest, and what the situation is likely to be from then onwards.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that the Government themselves and the Department of Agriculture do not appreciate the seriousness of the position.  The Taoiseach goes to Limerick and uses the word &ldquo;starvation&rdquo;&mdash;a very grave word in existing circumstances.  I am afraid he is right in suspecting that there will be starvation here in regard to the availability of certain cereals.  We may have a situation in which we cannot export cattle to Britain because they will not take them, and we may have live stock which we cannot feed and may have to kill.  Our population may not be able to get wheat supplies and the internal agricultural economy may break down through the inadequate area under wheat and other cereals.  I feel, therefore, that the Taoiseach was right in sounding the warning that there may be starvation if we fail to recognise the agricultural position.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>We have not recognised it, and we are too late.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>We started late, and went about it in a most ineffective manner, and in respect to food stuffs we seem to have adopted the Micawber-like policy of waiting for something to turn up.  I represent a constituency which has land that might well be the envy of any other country in Europe &mdash;Deputy Hughes knows that too&mdash;and the one thing which astonishes us is the small quantity of land under cultivation. The order provides that there should be a tillage of a minimum of 20 per cent.  It seems to me that there is considerable doubt as to whether that minimum of 20 per cent. is being <Col N="1579" /> tilled, but there is no doubt in the world that there is at least a minimum of 80 per cent. still under grass, and in some cases 90 and 100 per cent. under grass, with no effort being made to turn a sod.</P>
      <P>It is just nonsense to put an odd paragraph in the paper saying that 17 farms have been entered and taken and that people have been put to work on those farms.  Things will have to be done in a much more drastic way than that.  Things will have to be made move much more rapidly than that.  If you are going to acquire 12 or two farms every week or every month that is all right, if the time will wait for you, if you can stop the calendar until you can take up all these farms.  But you cannot.  The sowing season will be past.  Your land will be idle and your people will be looking for food at the end of this year and next year.  I appeal to the Government to use every power it possibly can to compel people to put their land under the plough; to give them reasonable prices for their produce, and, once there is an assurance of reasonable prices, to be drastic with these people in compelling them to till their land.  There could not be a greater offence against the nation to-day than the offence of not producing food from the finest land that is available in Europe for the production of food.</P>
      <P>With Deputy O'Higgins, I want to make a reference to the present tea rationing.  I am afraid the statement which the Minister has been compelled to issue in respect to tea has certainly had a most disturbing effect, not merely on the Government but even on the Minister's prestige as well.  One is beginning to wonder whether, in fact, the Minister is ever correct in his statements. We had panicky statements about petrol last year intimating that we were going to get no more supplies; then an intimation that probably the position would be better.  We had statements and assurances from the Minister on coal, followed by a collapse in respect of the importation of coal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We had an assurance by the Minister in January that tea supplies would be all right, that there was only one difficult <Col N="1580" /> wholesaler who was causing all the difficulty and once he was brought to heel we might expect everything to go right in future.  Then we had an instruction about rationing on the basis of two ounces per head for persons over 12 years of age and one ounce for persons under 12, and, a few days before rationing was to come into operation, an announcement was made that we could only get one ounce per head.  Will the Minister reflect for a moment on the effect contradictory statements of that kind have on public confidence?  One is quite entitled to say that the Department which is issuing these statements does not know what it is doing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

      <P>It will be very useful if we do get the figures, but I think I can produce to the Minister&mdash;not just at the moment&mdash;other figures, if I get the permission of the Minister's colleague to quote them, showing that the imports of tea in 1940 were greater than the imports of tea in 1939.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Over the who'e calendar year, that may be so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Over the whole calendar year, in 1940, we imported more tea than in the calendar year of 1939. There was no shortage in 1939, and very little shortage until the end of 1940 and yet, notwithstanding the fact that the imports are up quite considerably in 1940 over 1939, we are now faced with a situation that we can get only one ounce of tea per head per week.  The Minister must know that tea is a staple article of food in the working-class houses.  To think of a family in a city tenement or in a small <Col N="1581" /> town or rural area throughout the country trying to subsist on an ounce of tea per head per week is absurd. Take the case of the ordinary workman who goes out to work early in the morning.  He has a cup of tea before he leaves home.  He makes a cup of tea shortly after he has started on the job.  He takes a cup of tea at lunch time.  He will be getting an ounce of tea, which will have to make a cup of tea for him early in the morning, a cup of tea when he is on the job, a cup of tea with his lunch and a cup of tea for his meal every evening.  I suggest to the Minister that, if there must be this drastic rationing of tea there ought to be some special concern expressed by positive executive action for working class families who have to depend in a very large measure on tea.  It is not unreasonable for the Minister to ask the wealthy classes who have tea available in their own households not to present their ration card or, if they do, to make their ration available for poor people, because the present tea rationing is going to inflict very considerable hardship upon them.</P>
      <P>I just want to make a reference to the serious question of unemployment as we are now about to adjourn for a period of three weeks.  I think that an intensification of the present unemployment position is going to cause very serious difficulties as far as this country is concerned.  We are faced with a shortage of food.  There is no question but that shortage will arise. We are faced with an intensification of our unemployment problem.  We are faced too with constantly rising prices, when wages are pegged down to pre-war levels, where wages are obtainable at all.  Does not everybody who gives a moment's consideration to the position realise that there are very dangerous ingredients within circumstances of that kind?  Widespread unemployment, shortage of food, high prices: these are the factors that have caused revolutions in every country where revolution has broken out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We will be fools and we will deserve the punishment that an outraged population will give us if we fail at this stage to plan to mitigate these evils. Some of the factors may be completely <Col N="1582" /> outside our control.  Some are within our control.  We ought to make sure at all events that if there is a dislocation in our industry, food will be available. Dislocation in industry must be met in every possible way and by methods which we might reasonably reject in peace time but which we cannot afford to reject in existing circumstances. Above all, we must try to meet that new type of unemployment caused by the disemployment of the craftsman and the skilled worker who, in the past, have been able to get reasonably constant employment.</P>
    <P>I had a case the other day where 200 bricklayers and plasterers were recruited by an agent for a British firm to go to work in London.  A difficulty arose as to whether Dublin rates of wages would be paid to them in London or London rates.  The agent got in touch with his London office and was informed that Dublin rates would be paid to them in London, but the Ministry of Labour in London would not allow them to be employed in London at Dublin rates, because that would have reactions on London workers who would be getting lower rates of wages.  That hitch is the only thing preventing 200 trained operatives from earning a living in London, having to keep a home there and a home here, and having to withstand a blitzkrieg there because of our inability to plan here.  If we had all the houses we needed, one could understand but, with so many houses required, we are proceeding to export the most essential craftsmen, the plasterers and bricklayers.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to impress upon his colleagues the necessity for dealing with a situation of that kind. We can do it now while the reins are in the hands of the Government, but if they fail to face up to their responsibility in that connection the consequences, I fear, will be very serious for the whole country.</P>

      <P>I will take up as little time as I can.  Deputy O'Higgins commenced his speech by reiterating a number of our misfortunes.  I have no <Col N="1584" /> desire to dispute his list.  In fact I think I could add a few to it, but I would suggest to Deputies in this House that instead of merely counting our ills and expatiating on them, they should give us the benefit of their constructive suggestions as to how these ills might be met or mitigated.  We are all aware of the difficulties that confront the country.  The problem of this Dáil at the present time is not so much to draw attention to these troubles as to devise means of dealing with them.  I think Deputy O'Higgins was unfair in his suggestion that no reasonable opportunity was given to Deputies to discuss these matters.  If that is his alibi for not making constructive suggestions, then it is a poor alibi.  So far as I am aware, the Government has met every request from a responsible section of this House to provide time for the discussion of any matter they wanted to discuss. Government time was provided for the discussion of these matters and the Dáil met specially for their discussion when responsible Party leaders so requested.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Higgins also suggested that the public mind is confused&mdash;that people do not know why conditions are as they now exist.  If there is confusion in the public mind it cannot be held to be the fault of the Government.  For months past the Government&mdash;every member of it&mdash;has been utilising every possible occasion to impress upon the public the inevitability of the conditions that have now arisen, and while it is probably true that the disinclination of people to face facts, their unwillingness to accept, as inevitable, unpleasant developments, has led to some confusion of mind, that confusion of mind does not exist merely outside this House.  We have had evidence here this evening that it also exists within this House, and a large part of the speech made by Deputy O'Higgins was prompted by his lack of willingness to face the facts and his desire to believe that there is some way of evading the facts if the Government would only take some undefined and unsuggested course of action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, I want to deal with the question of tea particularly, because I have <Col N="1585" /> an unpleasant announcement to make concerning it, but before I make that announcement I want to deal in a brief manner with certain statements made by Deputy O'Higgins.  It is quite true that, last July, when this country was facing a danger of invasion and it was desired that stores of goods should be moved as rapidly as possible into isolated districts, I advised not only wholesalers and retailers, but also householders generally, to buy in more than they usually bought of specified classes of goods, among which were specified flour and sugar. There was no special reference, however, to tea.  I have looked up my remarks on that occasion, and what, in fact, I stated was, that there was not the same concern about tea as in regard to other commodities because the stock of tea held by traders was normally enough to supply the needs of country districts for a long period. There was no advice to people to buy and hoard tea in the same way as we advised them to buy and keep flour, and it is not true that the public responded wholeheartedly to that appeal. There was, in fact, a very small outward movement of these goods. Only about a week's supply of sugar went out, and about a fortnight's supply of flour.  There was some outward movement of tea, and as a matter of fact the first thing that people thought of was tea when we suggested the buying and storing of food beyond normal requirements, although no special reference had been made to tea. In spite of that fact, Deputy O'Higgins appears to think that if we had introduced our rationing system for tea by the process of sending out a rationing card with a blank space, where the name of the commodity would be entered, nobody would suspect that it was tea we were going to ration.  I do not believe that, and I am sure Deputy O'Higgins does not believe it either.</P>
    <P>When we advised the laying in of certain stocks, the first thing people thought of was tea, and if, in February this year, we sent out cards for the rationing of some unnamed commodity, the first thing the people would think of would be tea, and the reason was that before an announcement <Col N="1586" /> concerning tea was made an order had been signed by me requiring wholesalers of tea to register with my Department, make returns of their stocks in hand, and limit their deliveries of tea to their customers to 75 per cent. of their normal deliveries. That announcement could not have facilitated rich people in laying in large stocks because, simultaneously with the announcement, that restriction upon the outward movement of stocks from wholesalers was imposed by law.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Higgins also said that I have made what he alleged are contradictory statements concerning tea. Now, with regard to the statement I made here in January, that supplies of tea available then were sufficient to meet normal requirements, I have already given a full explanation to the House.  Up to that date&mdash;the date upon which I spoke&mdash;an arrangement was in operation with the British Tea Control under which we were entitled to get, and were getting, 100 per cent. of our normal purchases of tea.  On the 18th January I received notification from the British Tea Control that that arrangement was ended and that, instead of getting 100 per cent. of our normal purchases of tea, we would only get 75 per cent.  That change, under the circumstances, necessitated a change in policy.  It then became necessary to put restrictions on the sale of tea and make plans for the introduction of rationing.  Subsequently, we were notified by the British Tea Control that instead of giving us 75 per cent., they were only going to give 50 per cent.</P>
    <P>Now, with supplies equal to 75 per cent. of normal purchases it was possible to give a ration of tea to each household based upon an allowance of two ounces per week per adult and one ounce per juvenile, but with the reduction to 50 per cent. of supplies that ration, inevitably, had to be reduced. Deputy O'Higgins asked what happened between January and March that necessitated that change in our system of rationing.  I am not going to attempt to say what happened. What we know happened is that the British Government, for reasons which it considered adequate, decided to reduce <Col N="1587" /> the quantity of tea we were going to be allowed to receive.  I regret to have to inform the House that I received telephonic notification yesterday evening to the effect that a communication was being sent to me informing me that future allocations of tea to this country would be, not 50 per cent., but only 25 per cent. of our normal purchases&mdash;the allocation of tea now being made to this country and the next following allocation will be determined on the basis of our receiving only one-quarter of our normal purchases.  That further reduction in the quantity of tea which the British are going to allow us to have will necessitate a reduction in the ration from one ounce to a half ounce per head per week.</P>
    <P>These reductions in the quantity of tea allowed to us by the British Tea Control have been attributed by them to shipping difficulties and to the loss of supplies.  I am no longer able to accept that explanation as adequate. There is no doubt of course that there have been shipping losses and destruction of supplies, but my inability to accept them as an adequate explanation of the curtailment in the quantities of tea allowed to us is due to the fact that while our allocations have been reduced in successive stages to 75 per cent., 60 per cent., 50 per cent. and now, apparently, to 25 per cent., the allocations made by the British Tea Control to wholesalers in Great Britain have not been reduced.  Great Britain consumes normally more than 400,000,000 pounds of tea per year.</P>
    <P>The present allocation made by the Tea Control to British wholesalers is 85 per cent. of their normal purchases and, on that basis, Britain is now consuming approximately 350,000,000 pounds of tea per year.  The saving of tea effected by the British Tea Control by a reduction of 25 per cent. in our allocation amounts to less than 500,000 pounds per month.  That quantity of tea is so insignificant in relation to the total consumption of tea in Great Britain that some explanation other than that given to us must be advanced to justify the action taken.</P>
    <P>It is necessary to bear in mind in <Col N="1588" /> this connection that on the proposition of the British Government, a proposition put forward by them in their own interests, the Government of this country agreed to purchase all our teas through the British Tea Control, they on their side agreeing to give us 100 per cent. of our purchases.  The quantity of tea which we were entitled to receive under that arrangement was fixed in accordance with our purchases over an agreed period, the period between July, 1938, and June, 1939. While we recognise that circumstances might arise which might make it impossible for the United Kingdom to give us our full supplies, we cannot agree that the reduction of our allocation to 25 per cent., while their allocation remains at 85 per cent., is reasonable.  I do not propose to speculate here as to the possible real explanation of this rapid restriction in our tea supply, but it is clear that the explanation which has been given to us is inadequate.  The form and the manner in which representations must be made to the British Government in connection with this matter are to be determined by the Government.  I think it is desirable that the House and the public should know the circumstances which have arisen.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  Let me deal for a moment with the references that Deputy O'Higgins made to the stocks which may be held by individuals throughout the country.  I am very glad that Deputy O'Higgins referred to this matter, because it is desirable that the public should be fully informed concerning it.  It is particularly desirable that members of the House should be fully informed because there is a real danger, faced as we are with a situation in which there will be an absolute scarcity of tea, possibly a situation <Col N="1589" /> in which we shall have no tea, that there may be a number of unfounded rumours that certain individuals have large stocks of tea.  One can easily visualise how rumours of that kind would in the case of particular communities, become directed against individuals.  Stories as to the great quantities of tea held by individuals would go into circulation, and disturbances and breaches of the peace might result from them.  I think the faces show that there can be no substantial quantity of tea held by individuals generally throughout the country.  I am going to give the  and Deputies can come to their own conclusions on the facts. I am going to state my conclusions, and if Deputies think, as I do, that the facts justify the conclusion that there can be no great quantity of tea held by private individuals throughout the country, I would ask them to use their personal influence on every occasion to kill these rumours when they arise, as they inevitably will arise. Undoubtedly, a number of individuals purchased reserve stocks of tea last July.  Some individuals may have these stocks still.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The information available to me, the statistics which I have, and which I am going to give to the House, would appear to show conclusively that the quantity of tea now held by such individuals, as distinct from the quantities held by institutions&mdash; hospitals, county homes, and other bodies of that kind&mdash;cannot be very large.  The quantity of tea which was imported and sold last year was substantially less than the quantity which we were entitled to get from the British Tea Control under our arrangement with them&mdash;that is to say, the quantity imported in the datum period, July, 1938, to June, 1939.  The total quantity of tea which was distributed in the country in the 11 months to the 28th February was 21,366,000 lbs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMenamin Mr. McMenamin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>For what year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Up to February last. Our normal annual consumption of tea is 23,500,000 lbs.  The earlier figure was for 11 months.  If we add to that figure, one month's normal consumption of tea <Col N="1590" /> we get 23,210,000 lbs., so it is quite clear that in the 12 months up to February last the quantity of tea sold in this country was less than the quantity sold in a normal year.  We can reinforce the conclusion to which that figure leads us by reference to the time of the year in which the greater part of the tea was, in fact, sold. Supplies of tea coming to this country fell off rapidly during the latter part of the 12-months' period ending on the 28th February.  That would seem to suggest that people who had purchased exceptional reserves of tea in June and July of last year probably utilised some or all of these reserves in the intervening period.  The quantity of tea obtained in September, 1940, was only 37 per cent. of the quantity obtained in the corresponding month of 1939.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMenamin Mr. McMenamin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>That was obtained by the wholesalers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It was 46 per cent. in October, 85 per cent. in November, 60 per cent. in December, 73 per cent. in January and 53 per cent. in February. Those figures suggest that, while the total quantity sold over the whole period was less than the quantity which would be normally sold in that period, the greater part of that quantity which was sold was sold in the first half of the period.  Consequently, there is no evidence of any substantial hoarding of tea by anybody, by institutions or by individuals, during the last six-months' period.  The stocks held by wholesalers and by retailers are being furnished to the Department.  Those traders are required by law to make certified returns as to the stocks held by them, and having regard to the information which those returns show it seems clear that the quantity of tea held by individuals cannot be much; even if we could bring it all into a common pool it would not seriously alter the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree that it is desirable that everybody should be on a basis of equality.  The existence of inequalities is always a fruitful source of discontent. It is, however, I think, obviously impracticable to take measures which would bring into a common pool the stocks, however limited, which private individuals may <Col N="1591" /> have.  No doubt we could make an order requiring those people to declare their stocks, but does anybody here believe that we would get accurate declarations in any case?  We could not test the accuracy of the declarations except by domiciliary searches, and I am sure most Deputies will agree that the institution of domiciliary searches for such purposes is not desirable. I would like to support those Deputies who have spoken on this matter, and who have urged people who have any stocks of tea capable of keeping them going for a little while, not to avail of their rations.  I think that is a reasonable request to make to those people.  If they do not avail of their rations it will not permit of any increase in the existing ration, but it may enable us to maintain the existing ration for a week or so longer, and, when the ration is reduced, if it has to be reduced, to half an ounce per head, then to maintain that ration for a little while longer.  Perhaps some of those who have stocks of tea might decide to offer them to charitable organisations like the St. Vincent de Paul Society.  My sole purpose in referring to this matter at the moment is to convince Deputies that there can be no <i>bona fide</i> foundation for any widespread rumours as to the existence of abnormal stocks of tea in the hands of a large number of private individuals. Some private individuals have stocks, but the total stocks held by private individuals cannot, on the basis of the information which we have obtained, be very much.  Possibly some tea was smuggled across the Border; I do not think so.</P>

      <P>In the last year any movement was in the opposite direction, and to the extent to which there was a movement in the opposite direction it reinforces the conclusion which I have arrived at from those figures.  So much for tea.  If I am not unduly delaying the House, I should like to make some reference to the points concerning petrol that Deputy O'Higgins mentioned.  I know that there is a multitude of rumours in circulation concerning petrol, and the <Col N="1592" /> rumours, in the main, are originating from the one source.  I know the source.</P>
      <P>Those rumours are particularly virulent in their effect upon motor traders, and I received a list of them from the Association of Motor Traders some time ago.  A deputation from the Motor Traders' Association came to meet me. I gave them a point-blank contradiction of every rumour on their list, but I could see that they were not satisfied. The information which they had got from the source of the rumours appeared to be so specific, so circumstantial, that even my point-blank contradiction did not satisfy them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMenamin Mr. McMenamin">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>We brought those motor traders' representatives and the representatives of the oil companies together at one conference over which the Secretary of my Department presided, and we said to the Motor Traders' Association: &ldquo;Now repeat your rumours.&rdquo;  They repeated them, and got a specific and definite contradiction of every one of them from the representatives of the oil companies. Those are the rumours that are in the minds of Deputies like Deputy Belton, Deputy O'Higgins and others&mdash;that there is some difficulty between the Government and the oil companies which is preventing our getting petrol. I know of no such difficulty.  There has been no question of a bargain between the oil companies and the Government which the Government is refusing to make.  When the war started there were discussions between officers of my Department and officers of the British Government on the question of the conservation of petrol supplies, and an arrangement was made under which we were ensured, in so far as it was possible to ensure it, a quantity of petrol which would permit of our distributing the same proportion of the normal supplies to our people that the British Government were distributing to their people.  That arrangement persisted during the whole of last year. We received roughly 75 per cent.  I think, of our normal quantities, and that went out into circulation.  Some quantity was held in reserve, but it was <Col N="1593" /> not a substantial quantity.  When the petrol difficulties arose suddenly at Christmas, due to the sinking of ships carrying supplies to this country, and the British Government informed us that they could not replace those ships and the oil companies told us that they could not replace the oil, there were new consultations, both between the representatives of the Irish oil companies and their parent organisations, and between my Department and the British Government Department dealing with petroleum products.</P>
      <P>Arising out of those conferences we were informed that the utmost which we could expect to get this year was 50 per cent. of our normal supplies.  I made strong representations to the oil companies that that was not sufficient. I have been informed that the decision to limit us to 50 per cent. was a decision arising out of the commercial policy of those oil companies, but no representations which I made appeared to improve the prospect of our getting more.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasFrancisOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  That is how the matter stands.  The oil companies still say that, subject to the contingencies which are inevitably associated with the matter, we will get over the year 50 per cent. of our normal supplies.  In fact, the quantity delivered does not represent 50 per cent. of the normal quantity utilised in that period.  It represents only 34 per cent.  Deputy O'Higgins says we are distributing only 25 per cent.  The Deputy is entirely misinformed because, in fact, we have distributed in the first three months of this year more petrol than we got in the first three months of this year.</P>
      <P>There was a carry-over from last year; there was a certain reserve in the tanks of the country when, at the beginning of the year, this crisis arose. In the month of January, although only 1,000,000 gallons came in, 2,000,000 gallons were issued, and that lee-way has not been made up in the two months since.</P>

      <P>We have got this year half as much as we got last year. The Minister says we are distributing it all.  Then is it not clear, when the doctors are getting only 25 per cent., that they are picked out for victimisation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Oh, no.  It is quite true that doctors are getting less and certain other users are getting less. Other services must be maintained. The public transport companies cannot be cut by 50 per cent.  It is necessary that they get substantially more than 50 per cent.  They have been reduced; services have been eliminated and reduced, but the total quantity of petrol going to public transport is substantially more than 50 per cent.  Services like fire brigades, ambulances, and public health and cleansing services must get something more than 50 per cent.</P>
      <P>The police and the Army must get more than 50 per cent.  These users cannot be cut to the same extent as other users.  In fact, they use between them substantial quantities of petrol, and what is left is distributed amongst the other users in accordance with a system of distribution that I consider is equitable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No matter what system of distribution is introduced, someone will be dissatisfied and possibly that person will declare that his claim is as strong as the claim of some other person who is getting petrol.  I intimated to the Party opposite that I was not opposed to the idea of a Committee of the House consulting with me on the distribution of the quantity of petrol available, so that grounds for dissatisfaction might possibly be eliminated. I do not think all the dissatisfaction would be eliminated as a result of the introduction of such a system of consultation, but it might be reduced, and at least it would convince Deputies that there are good reasons for the present system of distribution, for giving petrol to every category of persons getting it, and good reasons for not giving it on a different basis to that which, it is sometimes suggested, involves <Col N="1595" /> individual discrimination on the part of officers of my Department.</P>
    <P>I hope I have made it clear to Deputies that there is nothing which the Government could do which would increase the quantity of petrol which the country will receive.  There has been no suggestion from the oil companies that they want to make a bargain with the Government and, arising out of such a bargain, that they will be prepared to increase supplies.  There is no suggestion of their even trying to secure a commitment from the Government on the lines suggested, which would involve the abandonment of the idea of establishing an oil refinery here.  If the companies have such an idea in mind, they have kept it to themselves.  The intimation that we are going to get 50 per cent. of our normal requirements was not associated with conditions of any kind whatever.</P>
    <P>Deputy Norton asked what the position was concerning food supplies generally.  It is quite true that the indications now are that we are not going to get from this year's harvest a sufficiency of wheat to meet our home requirements.  It may be that we are going to get no wheat from outside.</P>
    <P>We must base our plans on the assumption that we will not.  But we have a number of arrangements in operation, and plans are being tried out, for the purpose of bringing wheat into the country.  Some one or all of these may result in some wheat coming in, but we cannot hope to get enough in to relieve us from anxiety.  It seems clear that after the harvest there is going to be a shortage of wheat, which will have to be supplemented by the addition of other cereals.</P>
    <P>As regards the position up to the coming harvest, I informed the House yesterday that, based on our present consumption of flour, which has been restricted, we will be four weeks short of the quantity required to keep us going until the end of September.  We can easily make good the four-weeks' deficiency if we can get widespread public co-operation in economising bread.  But if, in the course of a week or so, it becomes clear that that economy is not going to be practicable, <Col N="1596" /> then we shall have to mix other cereals with the bread.  Deputies who think we should now start mixing other cereals have the impression that we can substantially reduce the quantity of other cereals that will have to be put into the loaf.  That is hardly correct. There is a minimum quantity which must be mixed with wheat and at no time will we exceed that minimum quantity.  The total supply of other cereals available is not so abundant that there is any danger that the proportion of other cereals in the grist will prove to be excessive.  Unfortunately, there is not enough.  All the plans necessary for the mixture of other cereals with wheat in the manufacture of flour have been made.  The order requiring it has been drafted and it will be signed as soon as the situation calls for it.</P>
    <P>It is with the situation that will exist after the next harvest that I ask Deputies to concern themselves.  We are not going to get from that harvest a sufficiency of wheat.  We must get more oats and barley if we are going to keep up an adequate supply of flour and bread to the public.  The rationing of bread must be avoided if at all possible, and it can only be avoided by adding other cereals to the wheat in the manufacture of the flour.  If we can get a sufficiency of these cereals, we will be able to maintain a sufficient quantity of flour to produce all the bread that our people require, even though the flour will not be all wheaten flour.</P>
    <P>It is better to keep up the full quantity than resort to rationing, because that would present administrative difficulties of a considerable kind. We are considering these administrative difficulties, so that plans for the rationing of bread may be ready if and when the necessity for such rationing should arise.</P>

He appealed to Deputies and to the people in the country to concern themselves with the food position after the next harvest.  Is it not extraordinary that the Dáil is going to adjourn for three weeks without planning what will be done so as to supplement <Col N="1597" /> the food supply at and after the next harvest?  The Minister said we will not have enough wheat.  Of course we will not; we cannot hope to have a better harvest than last year from the point of view of quality, considering the climatic conditions.  The Minister said we will have to supplement our wheat with other cereals.  Is he taking sufficient precautions to guarantee a sufficiency of other cereals?  I suggest he is not.  If we have to turn to barley and oats, what increased acreage will be required in respect to those cereals?</P>
      <P>Will the Minister consider that he has been forewarned by the British Minister of Agriculture that the British live-stock population must be cut down and that they will not purchase so many stores from Ireland?  Any sales of cattle that we can hope to have in the future must be sales of fat cattle and not stores.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>How will we get beef?  Only by hand-feeding outside the grass season in rich grazing land.  The Minister knows that in normal times half the feeding stuffs used here were imported.  He knows that by using all the wheat, without any extraction of offals, he is taking away valuable feeding stuffs in the shape of pollard and bran, representing 200,000 tons.  The problem before the Minister is this: that an unknown quantity of barley and oats will have to be put into flour because of the shortage of wheat.  That will come from food that would otherwise be available for feeding live stock.  As half the entire feeding stuffs which were imported are cut away it is necessary to double the area under barley and wheat, plus bran and pollard, to equal what was imported.  Then he must provide a sufficiency to make up for the bran and pollard used in flour, and in addition will have to grow as much as was taken away so as to supplement the wheat shortage.  I suggest that 1,000,000 extra acres of cereals would guarantee this country against hunger. We spent five or six hours this week talking about a Constitution that is suspended, a Constitution that will not work until after the war, if it ever works, but we could not give the time to consider plans to deal with food production. There has been a failure to deal with the wheat question because <Col N="1598" /> it was not gone about in the right way. If a person wants a suit of clothes and 3½ yards of cloth are required, there is no use trying to make it out of two yards.  It would take 5 per cent. of the arable land to grow the crops we require now.  There is no order in existence imposing on any farmer the necessity of growing one grain of wheat, so long as 20 per cent. of his land is turned up.  By law, farmers need not grow wheat.  I wish the Minister for Agriculture were present to deal with that question.  Argument is no use now because this is not the time to consider the position.  I wish to quote a statement that was made here by the Minister for Agriculture on March 20:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I regret to say that the outbreaks of foot-and-mouth disease continue to be very serious, notwithstanding the fact that every effort has been made to deal with them promptly....</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Unless the greatest possible care is taken, there is a grave danger that the disease may become widespread, and following that become endemic. Deputies will realise, without my emphasising it, the catastrophic loss that would mean to our flocks.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He might have added, to our agriculture and its existence.  Is not the position ten times graver to-day than when that statement was made?  Many Deputies said to me that there was no necessity for the motion I put down, as there were no fresh outbreaks.  But two fresh outbreaks occurred yesterday in the City of Dublin, and two more occurred to-day in County Dublin. While every precaution has been taken by the Minister to isolate the disease, I know a dairy yard in which disease was discovered last Saturday.  That was reported to the chief veterinary officer in County Dublin, but it was not until I raised the matter here that he was even consulted by the Minister or by the Department.  That chief veterinary officer got his staff on Saturday evening and had the place concerned disinfected.  A herd consisting of 85 cows was removed, but 19 affected animals were left there, and are there still.  Is that the way to deal with this disease?  Neighbours told me that the animals have been roaring <Col N="1599" /> with the hunger.  I have been informed that they are there still.  Why?  Is that the way to prevent the spread of this virulent disease?  Within a radius of five miles of this place there are five large dairy herds.  Is the problem being taken seriously?  The Chair very properly requests Deputies to accept statements made by Ministers as being correct.  I do so.  I am not going to say that a statement that was made was false, but I wish to read what I said here about foot-and-mouth disease on March 5th, page 162:&mdash;</P>
    <P>So seriously did we regard this matter at the meeting of the board of health yesterday that we requested the Minister for Agriculture and the Minister for Justice, acting on the advice of our chief veterinary officer that humans are potential carriers of this disease, to order that no human being should be allowed to walk on grass land, except those whose business brings them there, that it should be made a criminal offence and that the Guards should be directed to take action in any such case.</P>
    <P>Dr. Ryan: It is a criminal offence already.</P>
    <P>Mr. Belton: What is?</P>
    <P>Dr. Ryan: To walk on any person's land.</P>
    <P>Mr. Belton: Because of the prevalence of foot-and-mouth disease?</P>
    <P>Dr. Ryan: Yes.  The Deputy should read the orders made.</P>
    <P>That statement is not true.  The Minister has made no order making it a criminal offence for anyone to trespass on land, except in the borough of Dublin.  There are not many green fields in the borough of Dublin.  The question I was addressing myself to concerned pasture land in County Dublin.  At present we cannot move cows that are hungry from sheds in County Dublin to pasture.  The Minister said he is considering whether that must be done, that it was less dangerous than other alternatives.  He will not allow farmers to drive cows across the road, yet he will not make it an offence to trespass on their land. I can quote another Department to <Col N="1600" /> contradict the Minister's statement. Trespassers were found by the Guards on my land, notwithstanding the fact that I had notices up.  The Guards came and asked me if I was going to prosecute and I said that they should do so.  They informed me that they could not prosecute, as they had no power.  When I went to a lawyer I found that that was the position.  I now ask that the Minister should forthwith make an order preventing anybody except those who have business entering on any land or premises, so as to isolate the outbreak of this disease.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>The announcement of the Minister regarding tea is a very alarming one, particularly for the poor people.  I do not propose to deal with that position now in the few minutes at my disposal.  The Minister has asked Deputies to be constructive and helpful in their criticism of the work of his Department.  We are all anxious to do that and it is our responsibility to try to do so at present.  The question of supply is not only one of the immediate problems for the present and the remaining months of the year, but one of securing so far as lies in our power a replenishment of existing stocks for the remainder of the emergency. To my mind, that is the paramount consideration for the Government and the country.  The supply of raw material for the production of <Col N="1601" /> future supplies of food is, therefore, a matter of supreme importance, and while I appreciate the difficulty, the complexity and the impossibility involved in the problem of rationing petrol except on a class basis which will give any degree of satisfaction to the general public, and while I appreciate the necessity for keeping the cost of that rationing system within reasonable limits, I am strongly of opinion that a rigid adherence to a system of rationing on a class basis is not in the interests of the country. We all recognise the necessity for interfering as little as possible with those who have to rely on petrol for their livelihoods, and we recognise that any adjustment of the present regulations means taking it from one individual or firm and giving it to another, but one would expect that, facing the present very critical and dangerous food crisis, the conveyance of raw materials for the production of food would, without the slightest hesitation, be given first preference.</P>
      <P>The matter to which I wish to refer is already known to the Minister, that is, the conveyance of lime for agricultural purposes to Counties Offaly, Kildare, Wicklow, Carlow, Leix, and Wexford the most intensive tillage area in this country.  I have made representations to the Minister, as well as to the Minister for Agriculture, pointing out that the particular firm which supplies more lime under the lime scheme than any other firm in operation has been tied down to the ordinary ration given to the class in which they operate.  I do not think the Minister for Supplies appreciates the necessity for lime on certain types of land.  I do not expect him to do so, and I do not blame him in that respect.  I do, however, blame the Minister for Agriculture.  When he accepted the responsibility of arranging that the agricultural community would give of their best in the production of essential food for the coming year, he should have set down one condition: that raw material for the production of food would have first claim, that he should have first claim in respect of that raw material.  The people he represents here are not getting that first claim.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I spent the whole of Tuesday of last <Col N="1602" /> week making representations, with the manager of the particular firm, to the two Departments without any result.  I thought the matter of such importance that it was my responsibility to spend that time here, and I made every effort to impress on the two Departments the necessity for getting this lime out immediately. Deputies from agricultural areas will realise, in face of the present shortage of artificial manure, the advantage of getting lime on the land.  I am not suggesting that lime in itself is a manure, but on particular types of land, sour land and land suffering from acidity especially, an application of lime before the crop is sown will bring about an immediate chemical reaction in the soil and result in the production of a better crop.  Take this particular firm.  If they got a sufficient supply of petrol now&mdash;and they want it immediately, within the next fortnight or three weeks&mdash;and were able to get 2,000 tons of lime into that area, and if the farmers put that lime on 3,000 acres of land&mdash;on beet land, let us say&mdash;a fair estimate of the increase in the yield would be two tons per acre.  That means 6,000 tons of beet, of an average sugar content of 17½ per cent., which will give 1,000 tons of sugar.  In order to secure 1,000 tons of sugar from 3,000 acres of land, dressed with 2,000 tons of lime, the Minister hesitates to give the few gallons of petrol necessary within the next fortnight or three weeks, because he wants rigidly to adhere to the allowance for the particular class.</P>
    <P>I see his difficulty in making exceptions in such a matter, but this is a matter in respect of which there should not be the slightest hesitation.  It is a question of an essential raw material for the production of food.  I was told that we could perhaps get it later on and, in fact, the Minister told me that he was hopeful of making some petrol available later on, but does the Minister realise that it is required within the next fortnight?  As a matter of fact, if more petrol had been available in the past month, more land would have got an application of lime.  That is the sort of thing the agricultural community is up against at present.  They lack that co-operation and that assistance from the Government, and Government <Col N="1603" /> Departments, and particularly from the Minister, which is vital.  I am not inclined to blame the Minister because I do not think he appreciates the advantages that would accrue from the facilities I suggest, but I do definitely blame his colleague, who ought to know the advantages and ought to have impressed on him the necessity of granting these extra facilities.  It is only for a short period.  Yet when the position is put in the strongest possible terms, we are told that it cannot be done now, but perhaps it will be done later on.  Later on will be too late.  It may appear to be a small matter to the Minister, but, in the aggregate, it is going to react seriously on our food supply for next year.</P>
    <P>I am not putting this forward in any spirit of seeking to gain political advantage. I am sincerely asking the Minister to look into it immediately, and I put it to him that wherever a question of conveying raw material for the production of food arises, he should not hesitate to enable that raw material to be made available straight away.  It should get first claim over all others.  If that is not the attitude he or his Department takes up in relation to this problem, in what position are we going to find ourselves? What is the good of saying, in such a situation, that we have not got the response we expected from the agriculturists? Should not the various Government Departments concerned set a good example themselves?  To give an example of the lack of co-operation, let us take the Department of Agriculture which is at present forced to go in on various farms in order to carry out the cultivation which the owner has failed to carry out.  These farms are in the grass areas where the farmer lacks agricultural machinery and has no possible means of doing the cultivation himself.  He could not buy agricultural machinery, and there is no assistance to be got from his neighbours.  No matter how anxious he is, he could not hire a tractor.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>What help or co-operation did he get from the Government <Col N="1604" /> in the securing of a tractor?  During the last war, the Department of Agriculture transferred any number of men with horses and ploughs from the tillage to the non-tillage areas.  Did it not suggest itself to the Department, immediately they came up against the problem of people being unable to carry out tillage in grass areas, that they should have made a register of tractors and farm implements available in tillage areas whose owners were willing and prepared to go into the non-tillage districts and do tillage work, instead of the Department having to go into lands and take on the work itself?  That is what should have been done&mdash;and they had a precedent for it in the last war&mdash;to make a register of those prepared to go to the non-tillage areas at attractive prices. That is the type of work we want done, and that is the sort of co-operation we are looking for, and not getting.</P>
