    <Speaker pid="JohnKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether he is aware that the harbour at Bannow, County Wexford, is still in a dangerous condition, whether any decisions have been taken on the report of the Board of Works engineer who visited this harbour a year ago, and whether, in view of the special importance this year of the fishing industry to supplement food supplies, he will take immediate steps to have a wall erected and the harbour made safe for fishermen.</P>

      <P>The condition of this harbour is unsatisfactory <Col N="818" /> at certain stages of the tide for the shallow draught boats using it.  Two proposals for improving the harbour have been investigated and rejected as unsatisfactory.  A further proposal is at present receiving consideration.  The county surveyor is to consult with the local fishermen and examine the details of this latter proposal when a suitable spring tide offers, probably at the next low water of spring tide. When the county surveyor&rsquo;s report is received, it will be fully examined.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JeremiahHurley" hpid="Mr. Hurley Mr. Hurley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hurley</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will state whether he received representations from the Cobh Urban District Council and/or other bodies as to the taking over of Rushbrooke Docks in Cork Harbour for the docking and repair of ships to be acquired by Irish Shipping Co., Ltd.; also if he will state what action he proposes taking in regard to the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have received representations from the Cobh Urban Council as to the desirability of the reopening of Rushbrooke Docks for the repair of ships.  My Department has, over a long period, been exploring the possibility of having this dockyard reopened, but so far without success. The companies operating the dockyard in earlier years found it impossible to continue working without severe loss, and no company since that date has been prepared to undertake the responsibility of restarting work.  Since the war broke out, renewed efforts have <Col N="819" /> been made to have the dockyard reopened and are being continued by my Department, and I shall see that these efforts are continued.  At the moment, I can make no more definite statement as to the future possibilities.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will state if he has yet completed the inquiries which he proposed to make into the reasons for the recent increases in bus fares in Cork, and, if so, if he will state the result of those inquiries.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The investigation into the increased costs in materials, wages, maintenance, etc., which led to the recent increases by the Great Southern Railways Company in bus fares in Cork has not yet concluded, and I am not, therefore, in a position to state the result of the investigation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JeremiahHurley" hpid="Mr. Hurley Mr. Hurley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hurley</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he is aware that the receiver appointed over Irish Steel Limited, Haulbowline, now in liquidation, has offered the equipment of the concern to an English firm, and, if so, whether he will state what steps, if any, he proposes taking to prevent such action by the receiver and to preserve for this country the steel-producing plant at Haulbowline.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister please state whether he is in a position to reply to Questions Nos. 5 and 6?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="820" />
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, Sir.  I might preface my reply by saying that I did not ask that these questions should be starred.  I understand that Irish Steel, Limited, is not in liquidation, but that a receiver is in possession on behalf of the trustees for the debenture holders. I understand, further, that it is the present intention of the receiver to dispose of the business as a going concern to persons competent to carry it on successfully.  I am not aware, however, that the receiver has offered the equipment to an English firm, but in any event I am not empowered to interfere with him in the discharge of his duties, as his responsibility is to the debenture holders, by whom he was appointed.</P>
      <P>I have no reason to fear that any action which the receiver may contemplate in this matter will prejudice our chances of establishing upon a firm basis the steel-making industry in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JeremiahHurley" hpid="Mr. Hurley Mr. Hurley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hurley</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the steel works have been closed down since the 11th February?  He tells us now that he cannot interfere with the receiver.  Surely if the receiver takes the action suggested in the question, of offering the equipment to an English firm, will that not definitely interfere with acquiring that steel-works as a national asset?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The extent to which it might be a national asset is a matter for consideration.  I have already told the Deputy that, so far as I am aware, the receiver has not offered the equipment to an English firm.  He is endeavouring to dispose of the business as a going concern.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnONeill" hpid="Mr. O'Neill Mr. O'Neill">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Neill</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister say whether he is empowered by the Control of Manufactures Act to step in and interfere with the sale?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not empowered by the Control of Manufactures Act to step in in a matter of that sort.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that 70 men could be employed to do what work requires to be done there?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not so aware.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JeremiahHurley" hpid="Mr. Hurley Mr. Hurley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hurley</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister make representations to the receiver with a view to ensuring that work on hand which could be started immediately will be carried out?  There are 2,600 tons of rails down there which could be rolled.  Will the Minister use his influence with the receiver to get that work started, because the place is not a going concern, having been closed for the last three months?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>That may be, but the receiver has no resources to carry on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JeremiahHurley" hpid="Mr. Hurley Mr. Hurley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hurley</NameTxt>
      <P>The question I put to the Minister was: Will he make representations to the receiver to carry on the work?  I do not think there is any financial obstacle in the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>On the contrary, this is a business matter in which a great deal of money might be involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a matter of the banks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me that the banks have sunk a great deal of depositors&rsquo; money in this and they must look after the depositors&rsquo; interests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>That should not be allowed to stand in the way of necessary work for the country because the financial machine is so powerful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Deputy give back the amount of depositors&rsquo; money sunk in this concern?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a fact that the receiver can carry on work at the moment which would employ 70 men <Col N="822" /> for a period?  I am informed that there is no financial difficulty in this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JeremiahHurley" hpid="Mr. Hurley Mr. Hurley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hurley</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the probability is, if things are allowed to drift with regard to these steel mills, that neither the depositors nor the country will get any benefit from the plant and the work?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">

      <P>The Minister asks us to pass a Resolution to the effect that income-tax will be charged at the rate of 7/6 in the £, and that there shall be a surtax for the year beginning on the 6th day of April, 1941, &ldquo;in respect of the income of any individual the total of which from all sources exceeds £1,500, and shall be so charged at such rates as shall hereafter be appointed by the Oireachtas&rdquo;.  I ask the Minister to appreciate that it would be reasonable at this stage, when the House is being told of the taxes which are being imposed, that it should also be told what the present rates of surtax are, whether it is proposed to make any changes, and whether the fixing of £1,500 as a limit above which surtax will be charged is a change in the present position.</P>

      <P>There is no change proposed here in the surtax.  £1,500 remains as the income that will be subject to surtax.  Certainly there may be changes, but these will be set out in detail as usual in the Finance Bill of next year.  An increase in the total tax will naturally follow from the increase <Col N="825" /> in the rate of income-tax which affects surtax payers.  It is natural that changes that may arise from an increase in the income-tax will affect surtax payers.  Except for that, there is no new proposal to increase the rate of surtax.</P>

      <P>I ask the Minister to appreciate that we have several Resolutions here dealing with income-tax, surtax, excess surtax, corporation profits tax, excess corporation profits tax, etc.  In asking the House to consider these and the general effect of them, I think it is presenting the House with a difficult blind spot if the House is told that the rates of surtax are to be changed and the House is given no idea as to what the new figures are likely to be.  It is impossible to consider some of the other taxes in a proper perspective if we do not know what the surtax confronting individuals is likely to be.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister in a position to tell the Dáil what examination, if any, has taken place with regard to the effect upon unemployment of the increased income-tax last year? From information given by one Minister, it would appear as if the number of persons coming under National Health Insurance will be down by 11,000 this year.  For some years the figure had been increasing.  As there are one or two classes not included in what is called unemployment insurance, the question is whether the Government will take into consideration the desirability of extending the scope and including those classes who, by reason of those increased taxes, or other causes, have been thrown out of employment or are likely to be thrown out of employment in the immediate future?</P>

I know it is quite in order to ask questions of the kind.  I <Col N="826" /> would like, however, to tell Deputies that since I last met the House I have been doing nothing but receiving deputations.

      <P>The Minister used some words that rather puzzled me. Are we to understand from what he said that, on this stage, no explanation can be given with regard to the incidence, scope and ramifications of each Resolution?  It was our impression that this was the occasion on which explanations <Col N="828" /> of the kind were given because on Budget day those Resolutions are more or less taken <i>en bloc.</i> Occasionally, there is a division on one of the Resolutions.  My impression is that it was usual to have an explanation given of the Resolutions on this stage.  Suppose the surtax rate on an individual remains fixed at £1,500, what will be the effect of a later tax on an individual in connection with excess profits&mdash; on an individual whose income is not £1,500, but is in excess of his income for last year?  Take the case of a man whose business produced him an income of £1,000 last year.  If his profits for 1940-41 were £1,400, does the £400 in that figure come in under this particular Resolution as the amount on which he will be assessed?</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister considered the likely effect of these proposals on raising prices?  The taxation is retrospective inasmuch as it goes back to the 6th April, 1940.  It seems to me that section 4 of the Resolution will deprive certain classes of income receivers from certain advantages they were entitled to under the operation of Section 34 of the Income Tax Act, 1918, for losses sustained by them in other directions.  I would like to understand why, in dealing with profits, the Minister proposes that they be computed without regard to certain provisions in the Income Tax Act of 1918.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>I have here one or two examples that I may perhaps quote for the information of Deputies.  As Deputy Mulcahy has said, Deputies would like to have some knowledge of these matters before we reach the discussions on the Finance Bill.  The following example illustrates the circumstances in which liability to excess surtax arises.  A.B.&rsquo;s total income from all sources for surtax purposes for 1940-41 was £9,000.  His total income in each of the three previous years of assessment is as follows: 1937-38, <Col N="829" /> £5,000; 1938-39, £4,000; 1939-40, £7,000. He is entitled to the average of the best two of these three years as his standard total income.  That would make his standard, on those figures, £6,000.  His total income for 1940-41 accordingly exceeds his standard income by £3,000.  That is No. 1.  He is a trader, and the amount of profits included in the 1940-41 total income is £6,500.  His trading profits included in assessments were as follows: 1937-38, £3,500; 1938-39, £2,500; and 1939-40, £5,500.  His standard profits are the average of the best two of those three years, namely, 1937-38 and 1939-40, that is, £4,500.  The profits included in the 1940-41 assessment accordingly exceed his standard profits by £2,000.  That is No. 2. A.B. becomes chargeable to excess surtax on No. 1 or No. 2, that is, on the £3,000 total income excess or on the amount by which the profits included in the 1940-41 assessment, which exceeds his standard by £2,000.  No. 2, the profits, is the lesser, and the charge will be on the £2,000.  Excess surtax at 7/6 in the £ on the excess profits of £2,000 amounts to £750; less appropriate allowance in respect of ordinary surtax, £500; making the excess surtax payable £250.  The total tax payable on the £2,000 excess is as follows: Income-tax on £2,000 at 7/6 in the £, £750; ordinary surtax, £500; excess surtax, £250; making a total of £1,500. I will send the Deputy a copy of those figures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the illustrations which the Minister has given us, I thought that this excess profits duty or excess surtax had to be calculated on a year prior to September, 1939.  That would bring you to September, 1938, and the best two of the three years prior to September, 1938, would be selected.  Now, the Minister has given us illustrations for 1938-39 and 1939-40.  I was under the impression that under the Resolution, the calculation had to be made on an accounting period ending prior to September, 1939.  That would bring you back to September, 1938.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I think this is a Resolution which we will have to vote against.  The Minister said, having given us the figures, that the income-tax charge on £2,000 was £750; that the ordinary surtax was £500&mdash;I do not know what is meant by ordinary surtax &mdash;and that the excess surtax was £250. Altogether, that makes up £1,500, and the excess profits in this case amount to £2,000.  If those figures are correct, the individual is left with £500 in this case, in which there has been an excess profit of £2,000.  It may be&mdash;and our information is from more sources than one&mdash;that those profits have arisen out of the increased value of the stocks which were carried.  In some cases, it is alleged that they have arisen entirely from the enhanced value of the stock.  In that case, there is a perfectly legitimate plea in respect of the profits, assuming that we are going to reimburse the person at the end of the period should he find himself stocked with heavily priced goods saleable at a much lower price.  During the late war, in regard to the taxes that were imposed by the British Government, they made provision for repayment in those cases, and the Minister for Industry and Commerce, I think, mentioned last week that this 25 per cent. is being left with the trader so that he can pile up reserves to meet the difficulties which are likely to arise if and when the war ends.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second case is that in which, by reason of the changed circumstances of the times, the trader undergoes certain expenditure.  He may have started some new line or branch of his business. Finding that the times did not permit of his profits being derived from the old business which he was doing, he gets into some new line, in which he has had to incur certain expenditure, and, although his books may show that there is a profit of £2,000, if the war were to end <Col N="831" /> to-morrow that would depend very much on how far he had expended his reserves or had borrowed money in order to make this extra profit.  The third case is different from either of those two.  It may be an expanding business.  We have here in this City of Dublin examples of businesses which began in a small way and gradually expanded.  There are many more examples in Great Britain, and still more, I suppose, in the United States of America.  If, in the earlier stages, those business concerns had to face a tax such as is proposed here, it is more than likely that that expansion which took place would never have been achieved, with resultant loss of employment, and perhaps an equally great loss to the services they were performing for the multitude.</P>
    <P>Now, those are three separate cases.  For the trader who is what is described rather contemptuously as a profiteer, nobody has any particular sympathy or consideration.  For the man whose business is expanding, not only should there be consideration but some effort ought to be made to distinguish as between that type of person and the person who is, even if not a profiteer, benefiting by the circumstances of the times.  There is the other case in which, seeing the difficulties of the period, having invested money in order to start some new line in a business, something perhaps that was not done at all before in the business, the costs which have been incurred would more than wipe out the profits if the emergency were to subside rather suddenly.  I think that, at this stage, the Minister should indicate to the House whether there is any intention of discriminating as between those different classes; whether, in the case of persons who have invested moneys out of their reserves to inaugurate a type of business that they have not hitherto done, and whether there is to be any provision for expanding business.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I stand entirely for the proper and orderly carrying out of business here, but we have been prevented from carrying it out in an orderly way, because on the Committee Stage we could have had a formal statement, but did not have it.  I simply want to get at the facts, as far as possible.  The Minister has indicated how this tax will affect a person with part of his income coming from industry.  The tax is retrospective in that it will apply to an income up to 6th April, 1941.  During the year in which the income was being earned, there was no anticipation that it would be liable to that tax.  This deals with the case of a person whose income is derived from something else together with profits from industry.</P>
      <P>During the year that is now being retrospectively taxed, a very large Army, a huge Local Defence Force and other emergency services were being built up in the State, and large numbers of men had to be clothed and equipped.  The greatest possible energy and drive on the part of a large number of manufacturers was called for by the Government in order to have the equipment for the forces ready, so as to help their organisation, and in order to be prepared for any emergency. A very considerable amount of work was packed into a particular period.  The firms that got work to do and that were lackadaisical spread the work over two accounting years.  They are going to be hit less heavily than the industries that set out in a satisfactory way and, inside the first month or so of the emergency, which began about June of last year, got all their manufacturing work into that period, and, therefore, because of the increased employment during that period, got additional profits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="833" /> I think, from the retrospective point of view, that the tax is bad, especially when you consider the circumstances in respect of which that retrospective taxation is imposed.  It is bad from the industrial point of view and also from the point of view of a Government that may have to call on people in any emergencies that may arise.  It is bound to have a detrimental effect in that connection.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that there are two standards of profit which may be accepted, and the lower one is the one that will be subject to tax.  I should like him to give us some explanation in relation to paragraph 4 of the Financial Resolution.  For the purpose of documentation, I will read certain subsections from Section 34 of the Income Tax Act of 1918.  Sub-section (1) says:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Where any person sustains a loss in any trade, profession, employment or vocation, carried on by him either solely or in partnership, or in the occupation of lands for the purpose of husbandry only, or in the occupation of woodlands in respect of which he has elected to be charged to tax under Schedule D, he may upon giving notice in writing to the surveyor within six months after the year of assessment, apply to the general commissioners or to the special commissioners, for an adjustment of his liability by reference to the loss and to the aggregate amount of his income for that year estimated according to this Act.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Sub-section (2) says:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The commissioners shall, on proof to their satisfaction of the amount of the loss, and of the payment of tax upon the aggregate amount of income, give a certificate authorising repayment of so much of the sum paid for tax as would represent the tax upon income equal to the amount of loss, and the certificate may extend to give any exemption, abatement, or relief depending upon total income from all sources, authorised by this Act.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Upon the receipt of the certificate the Commissioners of Inland Revenue <Col N="834" /> shall cause repayment to be made in conformity therewith.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Paragraph 4 of the Financial Resolution deprives an excess taxpayer of any benefit which might be available to him under that section.  In the case given by the Minister he indicated it would be preferable if the taxpayer in this case would pay on the excess profit of industry rather than on his excess income, because it would be the smaller amount.  There is the possibility of depriving a person of the advantages of Section 34 of the Income Tax Act of 1918.  You might deprive him of any advantage in electing to pay on the excess profit of his total income rather than on his income from trade.  I should like to know from the Minister why the advantage, if any, of Section 34 is being withdrawn.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>Admittedly, there is hardship in retrospective taxation, but to a certain extent all income-tax is retrospective.  You pay on your ordinary income, not on your income of the current year but on the income of the preceding year, and you pay your surtax on the income of the year before that, so that already you have in existence in the income-tax and surtax codes the idea of retrospective taxation.  We may protest against it and condemn it as much as we like in principle, but we have all adopted it. We took it over from England and have adopted and practised it here.</P>

    <P>Unquestionably, this is going a step further.  It is increasing the tax.  The tax is a heavy one and it goes back partly for the benefit of those to be taxed to excess.  The same principle is carried through the corporation and excess corporation profits tax. It gives them the choice over a certain number of years, selecting an average two years.  Admittedly, that is carrying the principle further than was the practice heretofore, but it is partly to the advantage of the taxpayer.  There is some advantage to the Government in it, too.  We set out one definite year in our Resolution, one year before the period when it is proposed to put the tax into operation.  It might be to the <Col N="835" /> advantage of the taxpayers and, therefore, we are giving the choice of a certain number of years before the tax becomes operative so as to fix the standard year.  That may be bad in principle, but it is a principle that has been adopted and practised here since this State was set up.  So that, although we can object to it in principle, we have adopted it in practice.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>No, it is the same thing.  You earned your income last year, and it is upon that income that you are taxed.  That is the same principle we have adopted here.  You are not charged income-tax this year on what you earn this year.  It is based upon what you earned last year.  So <Col N="836" /> is the surtax, but you pay on this year not on last year but on what you earned the year before that.  There you have the retrospective principle also, and so far as the principle is concerned we have adopted it and put it into practice. Admittedly, this goes further and puts it back another year.  It is the same principle, but an extension of it.  The principle has been adopted by this Parliament here and it is the practice.  We may complain and protest about it as much as we like, but we have adopted both the practice and the principle.  It is heavy, admittedly, but the circumstances which we are undergoing, I think, make necessary the steps that I propose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In reply to Deputy Cosgrave&rsquo;s point about different types of cases, I cannot see, speaking purely as Minister for Finance, that in fixing a tax I can inquire into how these profits were made: whether they were made because of increased value in stocks or because of greater energy being put into the business, greater initiative and greater foresight on behalf of the company or individual concerned.  What, I think, I have to examine is whether excess profits have been made, bringing the person liable to surtax.  I have no doubt that there could be a good case made out for certain industries, perhaps, getting special consideration because of special circumstances, but on the whole if I have to tax profits I cannot see how I could ask the Revenue Commissioners to examine whether these profits were made because of a big increase in the value of stocks or because of greater energy, initiative and foresight being put into a business, or new types of businesses being started by industrialists or individuals of any kind.  It is probably true that during the period we are dealing with&mdash;the last two or three years&mdash;stocks of all kinds have increased in value.  An industrialist with foresight, who had stocked up before the war, was a lucky man because stocks of all kinds have gone up at a very rapid rate no matter what kind of stocks they are.  It is not possible in many cases to replenish these stocks now, and the longer they can be kept the greater their value. <Col N="837" /> I do not see, however, that in connection with this Resolution, or indeed any other Resolutions relating to the excess tax that will come in, I could lay down any conditions that would enable the Revenue Commissioners to differentiate between different companies as to how they made their profits.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnLymbrickEsmonde" hpid="Mr. Esmonde Mr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to put one question to the Minister.  Take the case of a one-man business with profits of £1,600&mdash;that would be the total income of that particular individual from all sources&mdash;and take the case of a professional man earning £1,600.  It is all very confusing, but is the effect of all this that both of these people will have to pay their ordinary income-tax and that, in addition, the one-man business will pay surtax on excess profits on £600, and the professional man on £100?  Is that the net result of it?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to submit to the Minister that, in his desire to raise revenue in connection with tobacco, I think he has gone further than will be effective.  It is common knowledge that there is an optimum rate of taxation, even on luxuries, and that if you go beyond it, instead of getting extra revenue, you will get less revenue.  I gather from the Minister that his exclusive purpose in the imposition of this tax was the raising of revenue and not the reduction of consumption or the imposition of a hair shirt on the community just because he thought it good for its soul.  I tell him from personal experience as a tobacco vendor that, in my judgment, the increase which this tax has made necessary in the price of tobacco will reduce the consumption of tobacco by 30 per cent. If we have to do that, we have to do it, and it might very well happen that difficulties of supply would make it incumbent upon us all to do with less than 70 per cent. of our normal tobacco consumption.  If we have tobacco or if we are able to get tobacco, I do not see the point of cutting down our consumption when times are so difficult as they are at present simply through ineptitude. By putting a tax on tobacco which is greater than the normal consumption will carry, we are simply imposing on our people hardships over and above what the circumstances require. I should be glad to hear from the Minister whether any consultations have taken place since the publication of the Resolution with the ordinary channels of trade for the purpose of getting advice as to what effect this level of taxation will have upon the sale of tobacco.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In that connection, I do not think it is any harm to say that in times like these we have all got to be ready to give up not only our luxuries, but in some cases things that we had come to look upon as necessities, if circumstances demand it.  But that should not set Ministers for Finance or anybody else rampaging around the country to find new methods of creating unnecessary hardships to the people simply for the fun of making them suffer. The people have enough to put up with without having any unnecessary burdens placed upon them.  So far as the average cigarette smoker is concerned, he can very well get along without his cigarettes.  But, take the average working man who buys one or two ounces of plug tobacco.  In his present straitened circumstances it is a very great hardship radically to cut down his consumption of that luxury, luxury though it is.  It may well be that it <Col N="841" /> is necessary to cut down his consumption, but we ought to do it with our eyes open.</P>
    <P>This Resolution, in addition to placing an increased tax on tobacco, places an increased tax on snuff.  The average old woman in this country gathers together 6½d. at infrequent intervals with which she purchases half an ounce of snuff.  I think this tax will raise the price of that half ounce of snuff to 8d. or 8½d.; I am not sure at the moment.  Would it be unreasonable to suggest that we should at least exclude snuff from this extra impost? Snuff is consumed in this country almost exclusively by old people.  If you take an old woman who is in the habit of getting half an ounce of snuff, it must be almost the only luxury she has.  In days past when I was a child old women took a blast of the pipe, but you very seldom find them doing that now.  Ninety-five per cent. of them, if they use tobacco at all, use it in the form of snuff.  I am selling it to them every week.  I know the old women who buy it, and it is a source of considerable distress to anybody in my position to see these old people denied that solitary luxury they are in the habit of getting.</P>
    <P>I emphasise again that I am very conscious it may be necessary to restrict the consumption of tobacco, in which event we will have to face it. But I ask the Minister, who on previous occasions proved himself sympathetic in regard to the inability of the humble citizen to get a bit of tobacco, to consider now a similar case in respect of a very restricted class of persons who may be unable to get their snuff as a result of this tax.</P>
    <P>There are two grounds on which I suggest this tax should be reconsidered. In regard to snuff, I ask for a return to the rate of duty which applied before the present Financial Resolution was adopted in Committee.  I do not think that would mean any loss in revenue.  I think it will mean a very marked mitigation of the hardships of the Resolution.  In regard to tobacco, I make no plea but this: satisfy yourself before you make this Resolution permanent that its effect will not be to reduce the revenue derived from <Col N="842" /> tobacco.  In my judgment, for what it is worth, and I sell a good deal of tobacco across my counter, the effect of the Resolution will be materially to reduce the consumption of tobacco, to reduce it so much that the revenue at the new high rate will in fact be less than the revenue at the old rate that obtained before this Resolution was adopted in the present financial proposals.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that a basic increase of 5/6 a lb. on unmanufactured tobacco is very heavy.  I realised from the first time I suggested it to my colleagues of the Government that it would mean a hardship for many people because, although we may call it a luxury, tobacco, as Deputy Dillon said, is probably a necessity for many people.  The same type of speech was made by Deputies last year when I proposed an increase in the tobacco tax.  It was suggested that the result would be a big reduction in consumption. That has not proved to be so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think I suggested that there would be a reduction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not saying that Deputy Dillon said that, but other Deputies said it.  The increase in the tax this year admittedly is considerably greater than it was last year. Therefore, there will probably be some reduction, and we allowed for at least a 20 per cent. reduction in consumption in estimating the revenue we will get from the tax.  I had to get the money and I had to consider where I would get it and what would be a reasonable subject to tax.  Different varieties of food were suggested.  Last year we put a tax on sugar and there was an uproar from the Opposition side about it.  If we increased the tax on sugar again, I think Deputy Dillon would not agree with that.</P>

      <P>I imagine it is.  I am sympathetic towards those poorer classes of the population, but I would rather put a tax on snuff than a tax on food at any time.  People can live without snuff, but they cannot live without food.  That is the difficulty I am in.</P>

I should like to make the same kind of gesture I made last year, if I can do it without impairing the revenue to any considerable extent.  I know it is a hardship, but it certainly is not for the purpose of making people suffer that we put on the tax.  I think one can defend this tax because, when all is said and done, it is a luxury, not a necessity.  It is a luxury, and we will have to make a choice of the commodities that we tax.  I think that tobacco is, generally speaking, a fair mark.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That the Dáil agree with the Committee in Resolution No. 4.</P>
      <P>This Resolution raises the customs duty charged on hydrocarbon oil&mdash;fuel oil&mdash;from 10d. to 1/3 per gallon.</P>

      <P>This, I take it, is a tax on industry and transport.  Therefore it is a tax calculated to raise the cost of living here, and it is being imposed at a time when the policy of the Government is not to raise the cost of living.  That being so, it is a tax for the purpose, really, of reducing the standard of living, as it is making the cost of transport dearer for the people, and in that way taking from them money which they could spend on other necessaries.  It is particularly hard on people in the large urban centres where the transport item cannot be eliminated by the great majority of the workers.  Being a tax on industry, this will undoubtedly raise the prices of commodities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to appeal to the Minister to reconsider this tax. I think we all appreciate the transport problems which have arisen as a result of the serious shortage of fuel, and of course this hydrocarbon oil comes under that heading.  It will seriously raise the cost of delivering and distributing goods, not only from the point of view of goods that are produced in the country, but imported goods as well.  To my mind, it will be particularly severe on agriculture, because in those days everything that is produced on the land as well as all the raw material necessary for agricultural production is delivered by lorry.  In recent years the farmer has altogether got out of the habit of delivering his produce or taking delivery of what he requires by horse-drawn vehicle, and to-day he is in the position that he has not the horses to do it.  As well as that, the roads are not made to carry that type of traffic.  Our modern roads are dangerous for horse-drawn transport, so the Minister will appreciate that all deliveries to and from the farm are made by motor transport.  I think this is a particularly severe tax at the present time, when so many transport problems already exist.  It is a very severe tax, not only on trade and industry generally, but on agriculture as well.  When he is replying, I should like the Minister to tell us whether the exemption of fuel for agricultural purposes will still be continued.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>He has a fair amount of it.  It is his outstanding <Col N="848" /> characteristic I should say&mdash;quite a useful characteristic at times, perhaps. Will he tell us exactly what is the amount he expects this year and in the normal year from this particular tax, as distinct from No. 5?  He has already given us, I understand, the two together, but as far as I know&mdash;I may be wrong&mdash;he has not given us the separate contribution that he expects from each of those taxes.  But it is to another aspect of the matter that I should like him to direct attention. There is in this Budget already quite a number of taxes which I fear will have the effect of damaging certain industries.  I think his excess profits tax, that knotty problem which he put to various business people and industrialists, will have that effect, and it may be a serious effect.  He is here putting a tax on one of the essentials&mdash;at the present moment particularly&mdash;for transport.  Whether it is crude oil, heavy crude oil, or heavy oil, that is what he is doing.  There is only one way in which that can be met.  It will not be met by the philanthropy of the people who are using this oil.  It will be passed on, if it can be passed on, to the consumer, or else it will interfere with the particular business.  One or other of those two things must follow, or possibly a combination of the two of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have here the extraordinary spectacle of a Government going out of its way, by a portion of its policy and at considerable expense to the consumer, to help industry, and then introducing a Budget which is bound to have the opposite effect on a number of those industries, industries which may find it difficult at the moment to carry on, and in some instances may find the incidence of this Budget too heavy for them to bear.  In the present state of the organisation of business in this country, if you do put a tax on transport then you are undoubtedly increasing the cost of all the articles which are transported. Whatever line you take up on the question of the cost of living, you are undoubtedly sending it up, and I think the Minister will acknowledge that, apart altogether from any effort on the <Col N="849" /> part of the Government, the tendency is for the cost of living to go upwards.</P>
    <P>Here is a case in which the private car is not affected.  I doubt if it is very much affected, even in the next Resolution, as a result of the whole oil and petrol supplies position.  The amount of petrol given to private owners is very limited and that is, therefore, a matter which can be left out of account.  You are therefore taxing nothing that is a luxury, but you are taxing what has, I think, in the last couple of years, become a necessity to a certain extent or, if it has not become a necessity, it has certain reactions on the ordinary necessaries of life.  You might as well put it on necessaries of life as to impose it on this particular trade.  It is indirectly a tax on the necessaries of life because, through it, you tax things more important than the oil itself, namely, the goods transported.</P>
    <P>As the Minister has shown a certain readiness to reconsider some of the taxes he imposes, perhaps he might do the same in this instance.  Is it really worth while to put on this particular tax, considering the damage it may do indirectly?  It is just an additional burden put on to the price of a number of things that are already soaring too highly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>Like some of the other taxes, this one has been objected to from many sources.  It will, of course, as Deputy O'Sullivan has said, <Col N="850" /> be paid by the consumer.  I think the same thing could be said of any tax that has been put on in recent years. Any tax, whether it be income-tax, surtax, or corporation profits tax, tends to increase the cost of living to some extent.  Some taxes, perhaps, do that more than others, but all of them are passed on to the consumer.  The consumer pays eventually.  Even in the case of income-tax it affects life and affects the cost of living in a variety of ways.  That is true of the particular tax we are discussing.</P>
      <P>As to the definition of it, I may inform the Deputy that the duty includes such oils as crude mineral oil, fuel oil, Diesel oil, gas oil, paraffin oil and turpentine.  In view of the provision for a rebate, the duty is chargeable in reality only on oil for propelling motor vehicles other than agricultural tractors.  The amount we expect to get out of this duty this year is £24,000, and in a full year £27,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to raise again with the Minister the point raised by Deputy O'Higgins when this Resolution was first put before the House, where he drew the attention of the Minister to the fact that during the last war certain classes of people who used petrol in connection with their livelihood were given a rebate.  Deputy O'Higgins put the case simply and plainly to the Minister on the last occasion, and the Minister seemed to think there was no case for it, but I should like the Minister again to take the House into his confidence as to why this cannot be done.  It seemed to me that the administrative side of the proposal was the one that seemed uppermost in his mind, but if it were possible, in the administration during the last war, to make allowances for this particular class of persons it should be possible to do it now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another type of person in addition to those mentioned by Deputy O'Higgins, who, I think, require to be particularly considered at the present time, and that is the men who ply the taxi car system in the cities, particularly here in Dublin.  These men have had a very hard time for many reasons. Now that the supply of petrol is reduced and that, to some extent, if you like, there is a bigger call on them, they have a possible chance of keeping going, but if this additional tax is put on them, then it becomes a burden that I do not think they will be able to bear. If the Minister is aware of the type of people running taxi cabs here in the city he will realise that very many of them have had to borrow money to put their cars on the road.  Very many of them have transferred over from the old cab.  They made themselves proficient in taxi-cab handling and maintenance, and they had to borrow a very large amount of the money.  They have not had much business recently, as the bus services cut in, to some extent, on their occupations, and while at present the position, by which private cars are not on the road so much as formerly, has brought these men back a certain amount of trade, that trade, while it helps them, is not sufficient to keep them going.  There is a very large number of families depending on these men, and I think there should be no administrative diffculty, at any rate in regard to a limited class like that, in allowing for some rebate.  On that one particular point I should like to get the Minister to reconsider this whole question. There are others who, I think, are better able to speak of the effect of the <Col N="853" /> increased tax as a whole on petrol.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to join with Deputy Mulcahy in appealing to the Minister to reconsider this tax. After all, we can only appreciate the hardship this tax is going to inflict on the community in general, and it is undoubtedly going to increase the cost of living when you take into account the fact that we have already a very serious fuel problem.  Even before this tax comes into existence, there is already a very serious transport problem in connection with various commodities. There is the increased production on the farm, in the way of grain and so on, that we are hoping to get this year, and the question of transport comes in very largely there. You have the same problem in connection with turf.  This tax is going to intensify that problem because a considerable charge will have to be made, and a considerable increase by the people operating lorries for hire will have to be made also, as a result of this tax.  There will be not only the increase of 5d., due to the tax itself, but there is also an increase put on by the petrol companies of, I think, 2d. a gallon, making a net increase of 7d. That 2d. is partly due to the fact that the petrol company have to collect 50 per cent. of the increased duty and the increased amount of money involved in the purchase of the fuel all over the country.</P>
      <P>There is definitely an increase on the community of sevenpence per gallon, and Deputy Mulcahy has pointed out that it is particularly severe on taxi men and hackney men throughout the country, because their activities are considerably restricted by the reduced amount of petrol they are getting, and in order to make ends meet, in order to get some sort of weekly income, and to try to make a living, they were forced to push up their charges.  Now, on top of that difficulty, these men find that a tax of sevenpence per unit is put on their fuel, which makes it practically impossible for them to run a car at a figure which they can collect from the travelling public to meet this increased charge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="854" /> I think this tax is one of the worst features of the Budget, because it hits industry generally and agriculture as well, as I said on the other Resolutions, because in recent years we have adopted a system under which everything is delivered.  The raw materials necessary for production on the farm are delivered by motor lorry, and everything produced on the farm is taken out by lorry, so that this tax is definitely a tax on agricultural production as well.  I think the Minister will have to agree that it is a most injudicious tax at present in view of the difficulties under which agriculture labours.  Deputy O'Sullivan has already pointed out that it is not a luxury tax, because the private car has practically been put off the road.  The allowance of four or six gallons for private cars this month is negligible and does not affect the tax to any extent.  The tax definitely strikes at industry and agriculture, and a few people who are earning livings as taximen and hackney-men, and I think the Minister should reconsider it because it imposes a very serious charge on the country and is bound to have an effect on agriculture.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I join in the appeals made for the repeal of this tax.  As other Deputies have pointed out, it affects very adversely practically the entire community inasmuch as it increases the cost of the necessaries of life, because food supplies are the commodities which will be most severely affected by increased transport charges.  I think that one section of petrol users could bear increased taxation. They are the people who use private cars for purposes other than those of earning a livelihood.  That section, of course, would be very small, and the amount of petrol used by it very insignificant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister should withdraw this Resolution, and if he accedes to the appeals made on behalf of lorry owners whose business has been very adversely affected, on behalf of taxi drivers in the city who are finding it very hard to carry on and of hackney owners throughout the country, and on behalf also of the professional classes <Col N="855" /> who use cars for the purpose of their livelihoods, he will have no alternative but to withdraw the tax completely.  I suggest that, if he finds that necessary and still thinks it would not be wise to let the remainder of the private car owners escape, he should impose a charge in connection with the issue of licences which would bring in whatever amount he is collecting from this type of user.  It is not right that the food of the people should have to bear increased taxation at present and this tax on transport will inevitably raise the cost of our food supplies.</P>
    <P>Frequently, when appeals are made to the Minister not to enforce increased taxes, he asks: &ldquo;What alternative have I?&rdquo;, and in this case he will be more inclined to ask that question than ever because the amount involved is very considerable; but whenever a Deputy is foolish enough to make a suggestion as to an alternative, the Minister immediately smiles and says: &ldquo;That is a good suggestion; I will adopt it later on&rdquo;, so that there is not much use in suggesting alternative means by which the Minister might raise this taxation.  There is, as I say, a considerable amount involved, but the Minister must know that most intelligent people anticipated a purchase tax in this Budget.  This anticipation was, I suppose, pleasantly disappointed, but I think the people who anticipated it were more intelligent than the Minister and had a more intelligent estimation as to an equitable distribution of the tax burden. The Minister, instead of taxing food as he is doing in this Resolution, should have considered other forms of luxury articles in the nature of clothing, furniture and other commodities, and might have imposed increased taxation under the purchase tax which people anticipated.</P>

      <P>Deputy Mulcahy asked about the rebate to which Deputy O'Higgins referred when we were last discussing this matter.  I have gone into the question of rebate since the matter was raised, and, while I would not put forward the administrative difficulties as the chief obstacle, <Col N="856" /> there would be considerable administrative difficulties in the working of a rebate.  Aside from that, there are objections, which I think are fairly obvious, against treating separate classes differently in the matter of the imposition of taxation.  It is not wise to differentiate between classes of the community.</P>
      <P>There has, generally speaking, to be some consideration given to the poor, and, in some directions, we have tried to meet the situation with regard to the poorer classes, but I would not find it possible to differentiate, so far as this tax is concerned, with regard to certain classes mentioned by Deputy Mulcahy and Deputy Hughes.  I am told also that, when the rebate was in operation during the British days, from 1910 to 1920, it was found that there was a good deal of fraud in connection with it.  There was a choice between making the administration of the tax very strict, making it difficult for the people entitled to the rebate to prove their claim to it, and having a looser kind of administration which meant that many persons who were not entitled to the rebate succeeded in obtaining it.  At any rate, there are grave abuses.  I cannot see my way to accept the suggestion that the rebate should be given to any of the classes mentioned.</P>
      <P>As I said on the last Resolution, anybody can make a case on a tax of this kind; it does not require one to have the high intelligence of Deputy Cogan; even one with less intelligence might make a case that this tax does increase the cost of living.  That applies to practically every item in these Resolutions that imposes a tax.  It impinges on the cost of living in some way or another.  Transport costs will be affected, and possibly food will be affected.  Deputy Allen, who was here a few minutes ago, made a calculation as to what the additional cost would be on a ton of foodstuffs brought from Dublin to Gorey.  He said that his calculation of the addition arising out of the tax imposed by Resolution No. 4 would be ¼d. per cwt.  That ought not to increase the cost of living very much. That is a distance of 60 miles.</P>

    <P>This amendment means a further addition of 1/- per gross in the tax on matches.  It arises out of the work of the Prices Commission.  Under the Resolution we proposed doubling the duty on matches.  Following an investigation by the Prices Commission, it was conveyed to us that the tax on matches per gross could be further increased by 1/- without increasing further the cost of the box of matches to the consumer.</P>

The only authority he gives for that is an undisclosed report, from a body whose reasons for this he does not understand and does not undertake to explain to the House.  I suggest that is an unreasonable procedure. I was thinking that this might be due to the fact that the Minister had found out that a number of ingenious people were, with the aid of a razor blade, splitting matches into two and some into four, as soon as the tax was put on.  No reasons have been disclosed to the House on which to base the assertion that this will mean no increase to the consumer.  It may or it may not be true, but, certainly, the Minister has refused to give any information to the House.</P>

      <P>We propose to double the tax on matches.  The manufacturer made an application to the Prices Commission to increase his price.  Probably fearing a tax on matches, or for other reasons, he made that application to the Prices Commission. The Prices Commission investigated the matter, and, owing to the increased cost of production, agreed that some increased price would be proper. They went into the matter with the officials of the company and the auditors of the company.  They got the facts&mdash;the figures of profits and the figures of costs.  Then they learned that we intended to double the tax. They came and showed us the figures on which they had based their decision that an increase was necessary to enable the company to carry on without a loss, but they showed that even the doubling of the duty on matches would in their view enable the manufacturer to get such an increased profit as the Prices Commission thought was not warranted.  Seeing the facts, we propose to put on an additional 1/-.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is to say the increased profit to the manufacturers would have come even from the original tax proposed?  Is that the suggestion?  The Government proposed, to put on a certain tax on those matches.  As a result of this tax a certain charge would be put on by the manufacturers?</P>

      <P>This seems to be a rather extraordinary suggestion.  The price of matches has now been increased by ½d. per box, and they can bear a tax of £24,000 now in addition to whatever the tax was before.  The tax is now doubled.  That means £48,000; it was about £24,000 before, I think.</P>

      <P>In addition to that, there is now an additional £24,000 going on.  I wonder what the Prices Commission were doing previously, and I should like to see their figures. Matches were previously sold at 1d.; then the tax was increased, and evidently the increased tax meant that they would have no profit unless they charged over 1d.  After raising their price to 1½d., the Minister can double the tax, and still they can have a profit.  I suggest that we should have some explanation some time from the Prices Commission or from the Department of Supplies in connection with that particular matter.  I think it would be very interesting.</P>

      <P>The Minister undertook on the last day to look into this, and into the following one, No. 10, which it is estimated would bring in £43,000 this year.  My impression regarding totalisators is that it is a non-profit-making company, that is to say the shareholders derive no benefit from it.  In the few years in which there is a profit made, the profits are devoted towards improving the stakes for races.  On the last occasion, the Minister undertook to look into those two matters, with a view to seeing if it were possible to avoid imposing those two taxes.  In this case, unless there is an alteration of the Act, my information is that the totalisator would be unable to meet this tax.  The other case I already dealt with on the previous day.</P>

      <P>I went into the figures that were supplied to me by the wholesale agents and distributors in Dublin, and I found that, arising probably out of transport difficulties to some extent and out of the tax already imposed on those imported daily newspapers, the trade had already gone down 60 per cent.  The case was made <Col N="866" /> to me, and I accepted it as a convincing one, that if I insisted on this tax it would probably wipe out the balance of the trade.  The figures, shown to me by reliable, trustworthy people, showed that 60 per cent. of the trade had gone, and I thought it was not wise that I should insist on this tax and wipe out the balance of the trade.</P>

The Deputy would also approve of that, I am sure.  The columns which carry our Government&rsquo;s advertisements also carry this proclamation, and, of course, the columns of the <i>Derry Journal</i> also carry advertisements issued by the Government of Northern Ireland.</P>

The columns of <Col N="868" /> the <i>Derry Journal</i> also carry statements quite out of keeping with the neutral position we occupy, such as asking the people to be on their toes, to be alert and vigilant in respect to all sorts of things that might happen in war time.  Apparently there is nothing incongruous about our Government giving advertisements to a paper which is printed outside this country and which carries advertisements that a paper in a neutral country would not be allowed to publish.  I do not know if the Deputy has taken that into consideration.  I should like to know if this discrimination is made deliberately in favour of the <i>Derry Journal</i> and against other papers known not to share the Government&rsquo;s views.  I suggest there is no reason for the discrimination except that.  The Minister knows that the <i>Derry Journal</i> was allowed to escape when taxes were imposed on papers published outside the State.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment will mean a tax on weekly or other newspapers in this country&mdash;that is the proposal&mdash;and from that tax the Minister expects to get £135,000.  Presumably this alternation of the date will reduce that amount, and the sum will probably be in the neighbourhood of £125,000.  Two questions arise on this. First, it is an increased tax on the people, assuming that they are in a position still to purchase those newspapers. The second point is that it may possibly interfere with or stop the circulation of those newspapers and thus mean a decrease in employment. It is likely that the tax will materially affect the balance sheets in practically all newspaper offices.</P>
      <P>It is for the Minister to say whether the advantage to be derived from the revenue he estimates will balance the disturbance that is likely to be caused. On its face it looks a very big sum of money, but is the Minister satisfied that the newspapers will be able to stand it?  In the opinion of several people, it might lead to putting many persons out of employment.  Take the daily newspapers that are circulating in this city.  Two of them are not in a very prosperous position.  One of them has paid no dividend since it started, and the other may not be paying even a preference dividend at the moment.  Those newspapers are giving considerable employment and if, by reason of the imposition of this tax, unemployment will be brought about, those papers will be in a much worse position than they are in at the moment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the point raised by Deputy McGilligan, there are certain newspapers printed outside this country and, if you consider the effect of some of these Resolutions, those papers get off much lighter than the papers that are actually printed in the country.  That is an extraordinary situation for a Government of this country to stand over.  I shall leave aside for the moment what I have no doubt the Minister will come back upon as a thing in which he is interested, namely, the getting of money.  Surely, even if you do give a preference, there is a principle involved as well as the getting of money. I am surprised to see a man who boasts of so many principles selling this principle for a mess of pottage, even though it amounts to £100,000.  There is, undoubtedly, a number of papers which, as a result of this tax, may go out of existence, while others, although they may be able to carry on, will undoubtedly be crippled.  The tax hits a large number of papers that are sold in the country.  There are still some papers that are sold for a penny, and now 1½d. will be the charge.  That, undoubtedly, in the country districts, will seriously affect the circulation of these papers.  It is idle to think that it will not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course, I am not in the secrets of the Government, and I do not know whether they want any circulation of opinion at all at the moment in this country.  They are certainly taking vigorous measures in other directions to see that there is no circulation of opinion through newspapers.  I do not think that is wise.  I think that it ultimately gives rise to all sorts of rumours, unfounded rumours, which have not even to go through the sieve of a newspaper examination, sorting out what is possible to publish and what is not.  I think it ought to be the business of the Government to help the extension of news even at the present moment; but by two ways now they are trying to prevent that: one&mdash;which I cannot discuss at the present moment&mdash; by a use of the censorship that was certainly never intended or never imagined by a number of people in this House when consent was given to its <Col N="871" /> establishment; secondly, by now trying to put&mdash;or possibly succeeding in putting&mdash;a number of these papers out of circulation.  Anybody who takes up a paper now can see that the papers are already hard hit owing to the shortage of newsprint.  So much so that a number of people are asking themselves quite seriously whether they are getting any value.  The result will be that you are going to have the people of this country thrown back for their news, not to newspapers published in this country but to the wireless coming in from other countries.  I must say that I do not see the wisdom of a policy of that kind.</P>
    <P>One thing about the amendment is that it does throw back this thing for a time.  It does give some time, although very inadequate time, for newspapers to adjust themselves to the state of affairs brought about for them by this new tax.  The Minister is undoubtedly lending his aid, by this particular tax, to the stifling of such opinion as is still allowed to circulate in this country. It is a serious thing, for instance, for a 1d. paper in country districts to have to charge 1½d.  It will mean unemployment. It will mean, in the case of some of them, cessation, and I gather, in the case of some others, as I have said already, it will mean a crippling of their position.  What is to be gained?  A sum of £100,000 or £120,000 is the answer of the Minister. As regards this preferential treatment for outside newspapers&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I should like to underline what I said before&mdash;even more so&mdash;because some facts have since come to light in connection with the position.  I should like to ask Deputies of this House to look back over the impression they got of daily newspapers and weekly papers during the period of office of the present Government and before.  If anything characterised the daily or weekly papers during the present regime it is the feeling that you always got an impression from some of the papers that there were a few big, flash Government advertisements staring you in the face, and that you would hardly recognise one of our newspapers as a native or Irish newspaper except that it had that characteristic.  You all remember when the turf scheme was started.  You had big advertisements telling you all about the ancient Irish elk that roamed the bogs centuries ago, and if you only used turf at home what stories of old Ireland would come back to you, when sitting around the fireside&mdash;and generally telling you that you would get great value for your money.  Then you had big advertisements for the wheat scheme, the beet scheme, and all the various schemes.  Now it is compulsory tillage, parish councils, and this, that and the other thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We had to complain in the past that daily and weekly newspapers that did not subscribe to Government policy or that criticised Government policy in their leading articles were refused Government advertisements.  Large sums of money have been spent and larger sums of money are being spent at the present moment.  I suggested, when this Resolution came before us on Committee Stage, that this was simply trying to take back a small amount of the money that was being squandered on advertising of that particular kind. It was squandered, no doubt, with a purpose.  It was squandered to get a certain type of newspaper assistance and support for a Government that loved the newspapers and made so <Col N="873" /> much use of them in that particular way, and it had, incidentally, the little handle that newspapers that did not support Government policy or that criticised the Government could get a little reminder from time to time that that kind of thing did not pay.</P>
    <P>One of the principal reasons why there is so much of the spendthrift in Government advertising is to try to cover over and make up for the futilities and the lack of preparation and lack of organisation in the present emergency.  The parish councils were called to arms to look after compulsory tillage and all that kind of thing, simply because the Government had insisted that the Minister for Agriculture was the one person to handle that particular scheme and did not want assistance from local bodies or anybody else, but when he fell down on his scheme it was found necessary to stir the imagination of the people and pay a compliment to them by means of the organisation of parish councils.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am saying that some of this money is being collected to pay for the profligacy in expenditure on advertisements in newspapers, arising out of Government incompetency, <Col N="874" /> Government lack of proper preparation and work.  I am emphasising one of the types of advertisements.  I should like to know how much money has been spent on advertisements in daily and weekly newspapers urging people to go and get the compulsory tillage done, whether through appeals to farmers, to parish councils, or anything else like that.  I say that there has been a big amount of expenditure in that particular way and it would not be necessary to tax newspapers if that expenditure was not gone ahead with.</P>
      <P>I object to this tax for the purpose of paying for that type of thing.  I object, firstly, because it is unnecessary. If there was the full freedom of expression of public opinion in our newspapers that we ought to have, public opinion would be quite alive to what the circumstances and what the dangers are, and these dangers, and the necessity for preparing against them, would be much more suitably pointed out, and the people would be much more stimulated to do the work necessary to meet them by the proper spread of ordinary public opinion than by the flapdoodle that goes into Government advertisements.  But when this tax is to be collected for the purpose of giving out advertisements in the discriminatory way to which Deputy McGilligan pointed in regard to one particular county, and in the discriminatory way employed in other counties, I object to it.  There are papers in other counties which have stood behind all the appeals for the building up of the Army and the Local Security Force, but, simply because they dared to criticise the administration of particular Ministers, they are refused advertisements for the Army and the Construction Corps which are given to other newspapers in their counties which have not a quarter of their circulation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I object to taxing newspapers for the purpose of spending money in that way, but there is another objection to this tax.  It has been pointed out that the shortage of paper and the censorship are hitting the circulation of newspapers. We have Ministers going to journalists&rsquo; dinners and telling the <Col N="875" /> journalists and everyone else how important it is for democracy to have a free and sound Press.  A very considerable blow has already been dealt against a free and sound Press by the censorship, and newspapers are really almost discredited in the public mind as conveyors of either the important information which people should get, or of reasonable and reasoned opinions on matters connected with those things which are important in our national economy, or the emergency in which we find ourselves.  On top of that, this tax is now imposed, and when one comes to think over the whole attitude of the Government with regard to public opinion, one must regard this tax as an endeavour on the part of the Government further to stamp out public discussion and public opinion.  I think they are going too far.  It was possible to have a public opinion in Ireland, and a unity of mind when newspapers were not so plentiful as they are to-day, and I think this very action of the Government, in further crippling the machinery for the spread in print of fact and public opinion, represents the last straw which will bring the people to a realisation that the ordinary spread of public opinion through the newspapers is being crushed out.</P>
    <P>There will inevitably be a reaction on employment.  It is very serious to have brought about, through taxation of this kind&mdash;unnecessary, as I said&mdash;a state of affairs by which people of a specialised trade, a specialised calling, who cannot easily, even in normal circumstances, fit themselves into any other occupation, will be put out of employment; but when you consider that in connection with the other objections to this tax, I do not know how anybody who thinks this is a democratic country, who thinks that these emergencies should be prepared for with full public knowledge of the facts and with sound opinions coming from the ordinary minds of the people, could support for a moment the imposition of such a tax.  If he does, then he is only continuing the futility and incompetency with which he has backed some of the things this country has suffered already.</P>

With regard to the other side of the picture, I have seen some very peculiar things happen in newspapers from time to time.  I saw, on one occasion, a half-page advertisement, asking the people to grow wheat, in a certain daily paper, and, in the same paper, an editorial of two columns on the lunacy of growing wheat.  In one case the Government was paying for an advertisement, and, in the other, the paper itself was doing its utmost to prevent the Government&rsquo;s advertisement having any effect.</P>

      <P>I object to this tax being put on periodicals that are published inside the State at weekly or lesser intervals.  It redounds to the financial credit and betterment of newspapers outside the State but which circulate here.  I object to it particularly as I find that some papers published outside the State will be benefited by the passing of the Resolution at the expense of their competitors here, papers which contain information that no paper in this State would be allowed to publish.  I have in front of me a paper which, in its issue for March 7th, on one page has an advertisement about fuel from this country, an advertisement with regard to fisheries from this country, an advertisement with regard to dog licences from Northern Ireland, an advertisement about local government from Northern Ireland, and, finally, an advertisement which asks the people to do all they can in a particular way as by doing so they are helping to smash Hitler and win the war, which, of course, no paper in this country would be allowed to publish. All that paper needs is to get some sort of an advertisement from whatever republican group there is in this country and derive revenue from the <Col N="879" /> people concerned, and it will be exempted from the taxation which is applied to home-produced newspapers.</P>
      <P>Deputy Corry&rsquo;s national heart will be wrung by hearing that this paper, which is preferentially treated, carries in its issue of April 11th an advertisement as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P Just="Center">&ldquo;CIVIL AUTHORITIES (SPECIAL POWERS) ACTS (NORTHERN IRELAND) 1922 AND 1933.</P>
      <P>Whereas there is reason to believe that assemblies of persons have been or about to be convened for the purpose of holding meetings or processions in Northern Ireland to commemorate the Rebellion of Easter Week, 1916, or for the promotion of the objects of the Irish Republican Army, or any other unlawful association:</P>
      <P>And whereas there is reason to apprehend that such assemblies of persons and the holding of such meetings or processions will give rise to grave disorder or conduce to a breach of the peace or promote disaffection and thereby cause undue demands to be made upon the police force:</P>
      <P>Now, therefore, I, the Right Honourable Sir Richard Dawson Bates, Bart., D.L., M.P., Minister of Home Affairs for Northern Ireland, being the civil authority under the said Acts, do hereby, in accordance with the provisions of Regulation 4 of the Regulations made under the authority of the above-mentioned Acts, prohibit the holding of any such assemblies, meetings or processions in Northern Ireland during the period from the 9th day of April, 1941, to the 16th day of April, 1941, both dates inclusive.</P>

    <P>If the Deputy wants anything in the nature of incongruity, that issue of the <i>Derry Journal</i> had laudatory <Col N="880" /> articles with regard to the rebellion of 1916.  It did not think it any disgrace to publish a laudation about the rebellion of 1916 and to receive payment for publishing a notice prohibiting meetings in Northern Ireland for that purpose.  I object to that type of discrimination. I object also to the further discrimination with regard to advertisements, but that is a matter that can be raised elsewhere. For the reasons I have given I object to this tax being imposed on the home-produced newspapers.</P>

      <P>Deputy McGilligan was making the case that papers outside the State are exempt from tax.  Of course, that is not so.  The <i>Derry Journal</i> and the other Northern papers which circulate in Donegal, Cavan, and Monaghan are paying two-thirds of a penny in tax.  One would imagine that none of the money spent by these newspapers reaches employees in Donegal or other Northern counties.  There is a group of newspapers published in Omagh which circulate in Donegal&mdash; the <i>Derry People, Fermanagh Herald,</i> etc.  Those newspapers expend about £1,000 a year in those areas.  The <i>Derry Journal</i> is also responsible for the expenditure <Col N="881" /> of a large sum of money in Donegal by way of payment to local correspondents, newsagents, etc.  In that way there is a considerable amount of money spent in Donegal. Deputy McGilligan, I presume, is interested in safeguarding the interests of another paper which may be said to be a rival of the <i>Derry Journal</i> in Donegal.  He has not produced a copy of that paper.  I challenge him to contradict the statement that that paper carries Government advertisements, and, alongside the Government advertisements, publishes the sort of thing that Deputy Corry was alluding to, namely, leading articles ridiculing the advertisements which it carries.</P>

I will not go into that further; we can develop it at another time, if the Deputy wishes.  The Deputy also <Col N="882" /> talked about this Government lavishing money on the newspapers.  After the war started, I received a deputation of newspaper managers, Dublin newspaper managers principally, and they complained that this Government had been mean and miserable with regard to advertisements in the newspapers as compared with the last Government. That was one of the statements they made to me, and I imagine they ought to know.  Deputy McGilligan is a resourceful man, possibly much more so than I am, and I would be very happy if he would assist me by suggesting how I could tax those papers that are printed across the border.  I would be very glad to get tax revenue out of them.</P>

      <P>I think the Deputy would agree with me in this if it were shown to him, that the tax on these imported newspapers&mdash;the tax plus the difficulties in transport since the war&mdash; had resulted in a loss of 60 per cent. of their trade.  The case made by the distributors of these newspapers here was that this further tax, plus the still continuing transport difficulties, would end the chances of any of these newspapers being imported in the ordinary way, and would kill their ordinary trade.  I am sure the Deputy would not wish to kill it.  That was the case that was put to me, and I agreed to forego the tax.</P>

      <P>Yes.  I agree with Deputy Cosgrave that it is possible this tax may mean some unemployment. That applies, I think, to every tax.  There is practically no tax that this Government, or any Government, imposes that does not affect the employment position in some way or another.  I do not know to what extent this will affect employment.  I believe it will affect it to some extent. <Col N="884" /> That is regrettable.  I would like to be able to get in some other way the £100,000 or the £120,000 that we may get this year.  Some may regard that as a small sum.  To my mind it is a considerable sum.  I would be particularly happy if I could get it in any other way that would not cause the unemployment of a single individual. In reply to Deputy O'Sullivan&rsquo;s question, the imported dailies are still subject to a duty of two-thirds of a penny.  The tax on the home papers will be one-third of a penny.</P>

      <P>The remission is welcome, but if you are going to increase the number of those vehicles to be used for agricultural purposes in order to facilitate the gathering of the harvest and the transference of turf from one place to another, it might be well for the Minister for Finance to realise that his concession will be of no avail unless he makes sure that the Minister for Supplies takes steps now to ensure that the additional quantities of coal fuel which may be made necessary by this remission are forthcoming; otherwise a great many persons may be induced by this concession to procure vehicles of that kind and have no coal to run them by.  That cannot be remedied in the harvest time, towards which this concession is no doubt directed, unless provision is made now, and, just as I had a word to say about petrol for tractors being attended to now, I say to the Minister for Finance that, if he is concerned to promote the use of those vehicles, he must ensure that the wherewithal to use them will be made available in time.  I urge him to take consultation with the Department of Supplies forthwith to that end.</P>

      <P>The purpose of the intended repeal is to eliminate certain anomalies and difficulties in administration. The following are examples of these anomalies: (1) Articles liable to customs duty falling within import prohibitions under the Agricultural Produce (Cereals) Acts administered by the Department of Agriculture and permitted to be imported under licence issued by that Department are not exempted from payment of customs duty.  (2) In the case of wheaten preparations liable to customs duty in respect of which an import licence is issued by the Minister for Industry and Commerce under Section 11 of the Agricultural Produce (Cereals) Acts, 1938, Section 15 of the Finance Act, 1933, provides only for exemption from customs duty where such articles are chargeable with a duty imposed by the Finance Act, 1933, or by an Act passed or order made prior to the passing of that Act.  Thus, articles containing a wheat product and falling within the categories of &ldquo;sugar confectionery&rdquo;&mdash; that is, sweetened cakes, etc.&mdash;&ldquo;cocoa preparations&rdquo;, for example chocolate biscuits, &ldquo;other sugar, etc., goods&rdquo;, for example, sweetened cereal foods; sausage meal&mdash;if made from bread-crumbs&mdash;and articles liable to package duty prior to the 20th July, 1933, are exempted from such duties if admitted under licence issued by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, while the exemption does not apply to articles containing a wheat product which have become liable to customs duty, including package duty, since 20th July, 1933, such as certain dried or powdered milk preparations, wheat germ oil&mdash;a vegetable, etc., oil&mdash;starch or dextrine, certain adhesive paste, and wheaten biscuits, unsweetened.  (3) Wheaten biscuits, sweetened, other than chocolate biscuits, are prohibited to be imported from countries other than the United Kingdom or Canada.  If manufactured in the United Kingdom or Canada such goods are chargeable with customs duty as &ldquo;sugar confectionery&rdquo; at the special rate of 3½d. per lb. <Col N="888" /> If permitted to be imported from countries other than the United Kingdom or Canada under licence issued by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, such goods are admitted free of the ordinary sugar confectionery duty of 1/6 per lb.  Therefore, prohibited goods which are licensed have an advantage from the duty point of view over similar goods which are not prohibited.  The repeal of Section 15 will remove many existing anomalies and will ease administration.</P>

      <P>That the Dáil agree with the Committee in Financial Resolution No. 18.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="889" /> Resolutions numbered 18, 19, 20, 21 and 22 are designed to prevent avoidance of estate duty by the adoption of certain devices.  Similar legislation has recently been passed in Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the passing of such legislation in those countries is likely to call attention here to the devices in question, with the result that if we do not legislate similarly there may be a somewhat widespread adoption of such devices by persons possessed of considerable estates in this country and, in consequence, a serious loss to our Exchequer.  Resolution No. 18 is directed against the avoidance of estate duty in certain cases in which a person who has a life interest in property joins with other persons in disposing of that interest within three years of his death, or within one year of his death in the case of dispositions for public or charitable purposes.  The Resolution has effect only in the case of persons dying after the 7th May, 1941.</P>
    <P>The purpose of Resolution No. 19 is to prevent evasion of estate duty where such evasion is carried out by means of schemes involving the transfer of property to a relative in consideration of an annuity.  The principle of prevention of evasion contained in the Resolution extends also to cases in which property is, for the like consideration, transferred to a private company, or similar concern wherever incorporated, in which a relative of the transferor is a shareholder.</P>
    <P>Resolution No. 20 is supplementary to Resolution No. 19 and is designed to prevent the evasion of estate duty in cases where, instead of transferring property to a relative, a person either (a) charges property of which he is the owner in favour of a relative in consideration of a life annuity, or (b) extinguishes a debt due to him by a relative in consideration of a life annuity. The Resolution, by providing that the charge or the extinction of the debt is to be deemed to be a &ldquo;disposition of property&rdquo;, makes the charge or debt liable to estate duty in the same way as the provisions of Resolution No. 19 make the property transferred so liable.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="890" /> Resolution No. 21 merely contains a definition of a life interest, or, more technically, &ldquo;an interest limited to cease on a death&rdquo;.  The definition is applicable to the existing enactments relating to estate duty as well as to the proposals relating to that duty which are now introduced.  The enactments proposed to be repealed by Resolution No. 22 will, by reason of the terms of Resolution No. 18, no longer be applicable to persons dying after the 7th May, 1941.  They will, however, continue to apply to persons dying on or before that date.</P>

      <P>It is very hard to discuss these technical points from a mere reading like that.  As regards Resolution No. 18, is there not some other method of coping with that particular device?  Is there not a device known as accelerated succession, and would that not apply?</P>

      <P>No, that is not the point.  There are definite cases where efforts were deliberately made to escape estate duty.  We believe that was the intention.  I have a couple of cases in mind where, through not carrying out the law to the full extent, they did not succeed.  They even went to the extent of bringing lawyers over from England to advise them, but they did not carry out to the extent of 100 per cent. the instructions of the English lawyers and they failed.  The effort was made to deprive the State of the estate duty to which normally, under the law as it stands, the State was entitled.  The effort was made, but fortunately it did not succeed. There were other cases.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Possibly, but they are acting selfishly from that angle. What is bred in the Revenue Commissioners, by their activities, is mainly suspicion.  I can understand a Revenue Commissioner saying: &ldquo;We have one or two of these cases and they will never occur again.&rdquo;  But, surely, there is a social aspect to be considered.  We have a person getting <Col N="892" /> on in years who has control of money. He has a family, a good, steady lot. He has big investments and business engagements.  If he remains in control of the money, we are aware that there have been tragic cases where people remained too long in control of the money, the businesses were brought to the ground and the families suffered. Let us suppose that a man is persuaded that his powers are declining and he says: &ldquo;I must provide for my own declining years and I must get an annuity.&rdquo;  Surely, in a <i>bona fide</i> case like that, there is no reason why that transaction should be regarded in a suspicious way?  It is a thing I suggest should be encouraged.</P>

      <P>Clearly, there is the type of case that you can hit at, and you can draw up regulations under which these cases, if not brought into court, could be brought before some special tribunal to deal with these matters.  But there can be cases of people who kept for themselves, through this device, some very meagre means which could only be regarded as bare subsistence means, taking the person&rsquo;s station in life into account, and who did give up the free handling of the money for business purposes, so that the business could be kept on for the benefit of the family.  Whatever may be the viewpoint of the Revenue Commissioners, I say that it is bad social justice to go back on that.  I do not know what the last two points mean at all.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is not this principle in direct conflict with the principle laid down by the Minister for Finance himself, when he was Minister for Local Government and Public Health, in connection with the administration of the old age pensions code?  He came in here at that time and said that he proposed to change the then existing practice by ignoring transfers of property to members of an old age pensioner&rsquo;s family during the remaining life of the old age pensioner, and <Col N="893" /> laying it down that where these transfers were carried out in pursuance of a reasonable and genuine family arrangement he had determined that these persons who had divested themselves of their property should be regarded, under the old age pensions code, as destitute people entitled to the maximum pension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>They were not entitled to the maximum pension.  Their means and their upkeep were taken into account.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>But the fundamental principle is that the Minister was anxious that old people should divest themselves of their property and put it under the complete dominion of the young people of the family, and in that case right of residence was not reckoned for the purposes of the Act. In fact, the Local Government Department was anxious to persuade the old people, in the common parlance of the country, to &ldquo;take to the room&rdquo; and leave the running of the farm or property to the young people.  Here, in a different stratum of society, the old people, instead of being encouraged to dispossess themselves of dominion over the family funds, are warned that if they do so the State will look upon that with an unfavourable eye, and, judging the transaction to be fraudulent, will disregard it for purposes of estate duty.  Perhaps the Minister would reconcile these two different attitudes which he has sponsored in this House?  I remember very well, and I think it worth recalling now, that in the Land League atmosphere in which I was brought up there was always a struggle going on with those who wanted to treat a man with a large homestead differently from the man with a small homestead, and I remember those who were through all that business saying: &ldquo;You have got to stand on a matter of principle. A man&rsquo;s homestead is his homestead, whether he is a rich man or a poor man, and if you once trespass on the rich man&rsquo;s homestead and depart from the principle it will only be a matter of time until you will be trespassing on the poor man&rsquo;s homestead also.&rdquo;  Here, it seems to me exactly the same error <Col N="894" /> is being fallen into.  We are establishing one line of conduct which we defend, and assert that it is not only permissible but praiseworthy in the one case, but we are also asserting that the pursuit of the same line of social conduct amongst the rich is a fraud against the State and must be pursued and prevented.  I think that it is a very unsound approach to the problem, unless the Minister has some other reason in the back of his mind which influences him to adopt a different attitude in regard to this proposal to that which he adopted in regard to the old age pensions code.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is perhaps not quite the same principle.  The principle in connection with the old age pensions device was, I think, with a view to raising the marriage rate in the country by getting the old people to resign control of the household at a certain period.  As I say, it is not exactly the same here, but there are similar points.  The people who did this thing, which the Minister wants to prevent, did it with a good social viewpoint, and I think it should be encouraged. I want to get some information about the amount derived from estates duties.  We have here, 1940-42, £1,320,000&mdash;does that take account of the £60,000 that is spoken of here?</P>

      <P>That the Dáil agree with the Committee in Financial Resolution No. 23.</P>
      <P>This Resolution prepares the way for Finance Bill provisions designed to give effect to proposals in the Budget speech in relation to amendments of the existing scheme of corporation profits tax.  Broadly speaking, the proposals are directed towards profits arising on or after the 1st September, 1939. The rates of charge are to be increased from 7½ per cent. and 10 per cent. to 10 per cent. and 12½ per cent., respectively, while the margin of exemption is to be reduced from £5,000 to £1,000. It is proposed to extend from three to six years the time limit for making assessments in respect of accounting periods ending on or after the 1st September, 1939.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The most evil thing in this is the retrospective effect.  We had a Budget in 1939, a Budget in 1940, and now it is not until the Budget of 1941 that we are going to go back over <Col N="896" /> the last 18 months in respect of this tax.  When the Minister said this evening that the same rule or principle applied to assessments for income-tax he was altogether wrong.  The law was changed in 1929 to allow the assessment of income-tax to be on the income of the previous year.  The alteration in the method of assessment and the reasons why that had to be adopted were that there were certain cases in which dividends were not declared until February and one would not know what income there would be until February in order to bring into conformity the same practice in the two countries, because there were some people paying income-tax in both countries and so on.</P>
      <P>It was arranged that we would take the assessment for the previous year to be regarded as a man&rsquo;s income for the current year.  It is not equitable in certain cases.  In the case of a falling income it is very inequitable but in the case of a rising income it is in favour of the taxpayer.  In times like these it is inequitable because incomes from investments are showing a disposition to fall rather than to rise, but the first evil thing about this is its retrospective character.  These accounts have been definitely closed, and we are opening them to assess them again, not only in respect of an increased impost raising the corporation profits tax, generally speaking, from 7½ per cent. to 10 per cent., but also extending the scale of the charge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Formerly a business escaped which earned profits up to £5,000 a year. Now that is scaled down to £1,000 a year, and a whole group of small businesses will be brought in which were not formerly liable, but which will now be taxed in respect of a period which is entirely closed.  The thing is most unjust.  There is neither principle nor morality in it.  It is, purely and simply, pilfering, and pilfering is all the more detestable when it is the small people who are most heavily hit.  It is a bad thing to go back in respect of taxation.  Retrospective taxation is indefensible.  The Minister is in financial difficulties.  That is his own business. He knew what he was doing and <Col N="897" /> saw what he was doing every day.  His means for improving the situation is to tax those who believed they had paid their way during a particular period.  Whatever can be said for the excess profits tax, for getting into the grip of the Revenue Commissioners people who have profiteered&mdash;and no great case has been made to show that there is a very big section of people liable to this tax at all&mdash;there is no case whatever for widening the scope of the charge in this instance retrospectively, and increasing the charge, in addition.  It is one of those impositions which bring discredit on the Ministry, on the Minister, on this House and on public representation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I also object to the retrospective aspect of this tax.  The Minister has sought to draw what I consider to be a most unfair parallel between the present position, in which income-tax and surtax are assessed in respect of the previous year, and the retrospective aspect of this tax.  I should like to remind the Minister that the reason for assessing income-tax on the income of the previous year is in order, firstly, that it may be ascertained and, secondly, that the taxpayer may know the bill he has to face, and be prepared for it.  In this case, a company knows, or thought it knew, its liability for corporation profits tax. Its dividends have been distributed and its allocations made.  Now, the Minister comes along and wants to rip all that up.  Has the Minister considered the possibilities for a company faced with paying this tax retrospectively? Firstly, they can go in on their reserves.  I suppose the Minister will say: &ldquo;Let them go in on their reserves,&rdquo; and I suppose companies which have reserves can do so, but is that fair, and are they to make provision in the future for meeting unknown taxation?  In other words, will a company be justified in delaying its allocations for 12 months because of fear of impending taxation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another alternative for a company would be to write to their shareholders and say: &ldquo;Dear Sirs: Before ascertaining the profits, we considered that we had made provision for corporation <Col N="898" /> profits tax, etc.  We now find that in order to pay corporation profits tax, only half the dividend we declared this year should have been paid.  Will you kindly refund us half the dividend?&rdquo; Would that be fair?  It would be just as fair as the Minister&rsquo;s proposal. What the Minister says, in effect, is: &ldquo;I must get the money somehow.&rdquo;  But if this procedure is to be followed, is there any reason why the Government should not go back to income-tax and other taxes for a year which is closed? This proposal will have a very adverse effect on the business community. They do not know where they are and they do not know what taxes they are faced with.  Those which are carrying on have faced up to the situation they have to meet and they have met it according to their resources, but now something is lumped in on them which they did not expect.</P>
    <P>Another point in this connection is that our income-tax rate is now 7/6 in the £.  Under this 10 per cent. proposal, there will be added another 10/- in the £, so that companies&rsquo; income-tax will now be assessed at a rate of 9/6 in the £.  I think the British rate of income-tax at present is 9/6 in the £, and if we have to face a 9/6 income-tax rate in peace time, God knows what would have happened to us if we had gone to war.  I urge again on the Minister that it is the retrospective aspect of this tax which is so unjust and so injurious, and the effects of which will, I am afraid, be felt in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Many people in this House get it into their heads, when one starts to talk about companies, that one is talking about great wealthy corporations and the feeling is: &ldquo;Oh, if Guinness have to pay 10 per cent. what matter?  They will be well able for it.&rdquo;  The vast majority of companies in this country are drapers&rsquo; shops in Ballywillan and bake houses in Carndonagh&mdash;comparatively small local enterprises which have incorporated themselves for convenience and thus render themselves liable to the impact of corporation profits tax.  I think the point made by Deputy Dockrell is very weighty, with regard <Col N="899" /> to the company which is not in a state of extravagant prosperity but is paying its way, which pays a reasonable, conservative dividend at the end of its financial year, but, knowing that its shareholders are small people, pays out as much of its profits as it properly can.  This enactment suddenly puts the directors of that company in the position of very improvident men, in that they have paid out a sum probably substantially more than they actually made.  That is, of course, conduct which may seriously embarrass any company, but come down to the small company in rural Ireland&mdash;and I am not thinking of large establishments in Dublin, Cork or such places.  Take the small bakery establishment.  It has been a long time considering whether or not it will put in machinery.  It has naturally accumulated a reserve from year to year, a fund designed to finance the installation of the machinery for going over from hand-baking to mechanical baking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Possibly they asked themselves one day: &ldquo;Will we get out of the bakery trade altogether and get rid of these bakers or lay out a substantial capital sum on mechanising the establishment and keep these men in employment?&rdquo; Perhaps the total expenditure on mechanising the bakehouse will come to £1,000.  Over a number of years perhaps they have saved up £600 and eventually they say: &ldquo;We will do it now.&rdquo;  Perhaps they take 1 per cent. off the dividend, take a slight risk, and put £400 to the £600 they have saved in order to mechanise the bakery. They feel that they are stretched out like the fellow on a barge with a barge pole which is stuck in the mud; they are stretched to the limit of their capacity, but trust that all will go right until they get to sound ground again.  Probably the bank has lent them the last penny it is prepared to give.  Given a chance, they will come through all right.  But, into the middle of these difficulties is injected an announcement, not that they have been profiteering, not that they have been doing anything unfair or wrong or unreasonable, but that the Minister for Finance made a slight slip 12 months <Col N="900" /> ago and, instead of making them liable for the corporation profits tax then, is doing it now.  They are suddenly confronted with a bill for corporation profits tax in respect of a year for which they have closed their accounts and in respect of a year in which they have gone to the limit without any added burdens at all.</P>
    <P>Of course it is never reasonable to ask a Minister to legislate for the exceptional case.  I suppose any tax that is put on in this House will hit some individuals harder than the Minister intended to hit anybody.  No reasonable man could complain about that. There are two grounds on which one may legitimately criticise a tax.  One is that the tax is too heavy, and in the circumstances in which we find ourselves at present, speaking for myself, I would find very few taxes deserving of criticism on that ground.  But the other ground on which one might legitimately criticise a tax is that it is unfair. That is the ground on which I criticise this tax.  We are throwing on people a burden which they have not braced themselves to bear and which they have been led to believe they would never be asked to brace themselves to bear.</P>
    <P>We have a duty to the people, just as much as the people have a duty to the State.  We have a duty to tell the people the measure of the burden they have to carry.  But it is our job to see that that burden is laid upon them in a way which will make it physically possible for them to bear.  But, if in addition to piling on burdens which we consider necessary for the safety of the State, we pile them up in such a way as to add materially to the difficulties of those who have to bear them, then we are open to very grave reproach.</P>
    <P>I am not thinking in connection with this tax of the Jacobs, the Guinnesses, the Dublin Transport Co., and the larger corporations in this country.  I am thinking of the companies it will really hit, and they are scattered all over the country.  Valuable and significant as is the contribution to employment made by the great corporations in our cities, if you were to put the employment given by the hundreds of <Col N="901" /> small companies all over the country against the employment given by individual big corporations, you would find that it was the small companies who were employing the vast bulk of the industrial and commercial employees. There is this interesting difference, that the impact of one year&rsquo;s misfortune on a large company that talks in terms of 10, 15 and 20 per cent. dividends can be absorbed without any great hardship.  But the small company may have very radically to amend its whole set-up in order to recover from the blow which may fall upon it under this Resolution, and one of the absolutely essential adjustments that it would have to make would probably be the disemployment of certain individuals which it no longer could afford to pay.</P>
    <P>That is an argument which is put up in respect of every tax: that if you raise a tax above a certain level, one of the economies the taxpayer will have to make is to let employees go. I believe that in the present situation most of the individual citizens of this State would sooner give up some of their ordinary luxuries in order to carry a man on in employment for the time being.  But, if you are a director of a company, if you are a trustee for shareholders, you cannot indulge your own personal charitable inclinations at the expense of the shareholders.  If you are the director of a small company, your primary obligation is to maintain the solvency of that company, whether you think it is harsh or otherwise to dismiss a man.  If the alternative is to turn up with a loss at the end of the 12 months, you will have to dismiss him, because you are not dealing with your own property, you are a trustee.</P>
    <P>For that reason I object to the retrospective character of this tax.  As I say, there are others who are more deeply versed in the financial and economic situation of the country than I am.  I will not concern myself greatly in these times to remonstrate against additional taxation.  I think there is force in the Minister&rsquo;s plea this year: &ldquo;I have to get money and I must get it somewhere.&rdquo;  But I most strenuously object to getting money in a way that is calculated to cripple citizens who <Col N="902" /> are showing nothing but the best of goodwill.  I think that to screw money out of them and kick them in the pants at the same time is more than human nature ought to be asked to bear.  I think the Minister ought to drop the retrospective character of the proposal.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Then drop the whole proposal. What you will get out of this is not worth it.  Drop the precedent in respect of the corporation profits tax. When we come to discuss the excess profits tax I would make the same case I am making now in regard to the retrospective provisions, but with qualifications.  But here is a normal tax.  It is simply tax on incomes with no penal element involved at all. Whatever you will get out of it, if you have to depend on its retrospective character to get it, then drop the whole proposal, because it is thoroughly bad. It is bad now and it is a bad precedent. It will be built on by successors of the Minister in time to come.</P>
      <P>So far as I am aware, every Dáil has condemned the principle of retrospective taxation, not on account of its weight, but on account of its injustice. Whether a man in this country is a millionaire or a pauper, he is entitled to justice.  We have no more right to treat a man whose annual income is £150,000 unjustly than we have to treat unjustly the poorest person in the country who is living on outdoor relief. If we set up for the rich a different standard of justice from that which we insist on observing in respect to the poor, it will be only a matter of time until the rich and the poor are steam-rolled by the House to get what we want out of them without any regard to their just claims in equity and justice before the country.</P>

    <P>I agree with the other Deputies who have spoken on this, and who have clearly indicated that a retrospective <Col N="903" /> tax is an objectionable tax.  In this case it is particularly objectionable in that it brings down the limit from £5,000 to £1,000.  It is going to strike the very small man.  In addition, there are very few companies that can expect to do anything like a normal trade this year.  They will, therefore, have to find two years of this retrospective taxation out of extremely problematical profits.  That was clearly indicated, I think, by the interjection of the Minister during Deputy Dillon&rsquo;s speech, when he said that if he did not make this retrospective he would get no money.  That shows that, in his view anyway, there will be very little profits made by companies this year.  Therefore, he is now asking them to pay, in respect of the two back years, out of the year in which he himself does not expect they are going to make any profit at all.</P>

      <P>And that it is particularly bad in this case&mdash;in getting after profits which may not have increased since the war started.  The Minister is going to take a bigger amount of possibly decreased profits after the period since the war started. The Minister&rsquo;s only justification for this is that he must get the money.  I suggest to him that, before he does that, he ought to be in a better position to justify himself in regard to economies.  He made no justification on that.  He did say that he had approached various people, and made a misleading statement with regard to people which, however, he afterwards corrected.  It seems to me amazing that this country is supposed to be able to bear the expense of an Army costing £25,000 a day at a time when the Minister presents himself to the House as a person who is unable to effect economies to any extent in the other State services.  I should have thought that the Minister would, first of all, have gone to the spending Departments and said: &ldquo;Very good, this year we have to find £9? millions for the Army, some to be raised by borrowing and more of it by taxation. It is a very heavy burden, and before I start to impose taxation of that type, particularly retrospective taxation, I want to know that every penny has been skinned off the Estimates.&rdquo;  Instead <Col N="905" /> of doing that, the Minister comes in here and says he tried to get the Defence Estimate cut down and could not get any support for himself on that.</P>
      <P>What about the other Estimates? Does the Minister present himself to the House in this way, that, no matter what happens in the country, he is going to get this extra load of £9? millions slapped on the people, and that he cannot save, say £100,000, on any of the ordinary Estimates?  If that is so, it is incredible.  The Minister is expecting to get £1,700,000 under this tax.  If business begins to collapse, and that next year the Minister has to make the same demand for £9? millions for the Army, part of it to be raised out of taxation and part by borrowing, and that by reason of businesses failing his revenue also begins to fade out, surely in those circumstances he is not going to come here and say that there is not a penny to be lopped off anywhere.  In doing that, the Minister would be presenting himself to the House in a ludicrous position. No one is going to credit that.</P>
      <P>During late years we have heard of some efforts at economies, but they have not resulted in any good.  One year we were told about the committee that had inquired into the expenditure of the various Departments.  Later, there was the lamentation that it did not achieve much.  A big effort should have been made this year to cut down expenditure.  The spending Departments should have been told that they were on a ration: that they could spend up to a certain amount and no more, and that all excrescences should be lopped off.  A deaf ear should have been turned to all fancy spending.  In fact, all fancy spending should have been hacked down to the roots.  The expenditure on all the ordinary services, leaving out the Army, should have been cut down when we think of this extra burden of £9? millions on an already over-taxed community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Defence Estimate itself requires close examination.  It was presented to the House in bulk, and for various reasons it was not discussed here in detail.  No one engaged in professional, business or commercial life believes <Col N="906" /> that the proposed expenditure of £9? millions on the Army this year is money that is well spent, and particularly when they get a hint as to the proportion of it that is to be spent on equipment.  I suggest to the Minister that before he says he must get the money, he should tell the House, in an exhaustive way which would convince the public, of the various steps he has taken to effect economies in all State services, other than the Army; how far he scrutinised the spending Departments, whether he put up any suggestions for economies and, if so, why he was rebuffed.  This tax has definitely been introduced by the Minister in a setting which was, I think, deliberately intended to get him popular acclaim. He has caught Deputy Hickey with it because he has said that he was going to give to the Exchequer a very substantial proportion of the increased profits which have accrued as a result of the war.  In the Budget statement we get this:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Corporation profits tax at present is not charged on the first £5,000 of profit.  I propose to reduce this exemption limit to £1,000.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Deputy Hickey may be interested to know that if firms failed to make a profit of £5,000, if they only made £3,000 or £4,000, they are going to be taxed on all they made over £1,000, and that certainly cannot be caught by the phrase, &ldquo;Excess profits which have accrued as a result of the war.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There are other matters that will arise on the amalgamation of these Resolutions.  There are certain figures that will require some explanation.  I want to stress a point that was made by Deputy Dillon, already revealed to us in one of the reports of the Census of 1936, the report that was produced at the time the industrial volume made its appearance.  We get a note on page 8 of the report to the effect that a feature of the table with regard to industrial production was the decline in the number of small firms engaging in industry.  We get that at a time when the report was referring to increased industrial activity.</P>
    <P>The peculiarity was that although there was an increase in industrial <Col N="907" /> activity, of course entirely balanced by a bigger decrease in agricultural activity, still inside the sphere of manufacturing industry there was a decline in the number of small producers. There is a small paragraph further on which sums up the matter. It says that it seems generally to be true that the considerable development in productive industry in the past decade has been accompanied by a decline in the number of small-scale producers. Deputy Dillon expressed the view that this will have the effect of preventing some of the smaller people from developing, so you are following the bad social tendency which had been observed in the Census of Production.</P>
    <P>I think Deputies are prone to lend too ready and willing an ear to the suggestion that the businesses in this country which will be hit by this tax will be big businesses, and, as the big business people are more notoriously the enemies of the poor than the smaller business people, well then, let them have it, and have no great sorrow for them.  Of course, those people who are in industry, those people who are in business, those people who are going to be hit by this tax, are people who are giving considerable employment, and I do suggest to the Minister that there is a point of principle involved. I think the Minister is following in the footsteps of his predecessor, who imposed a certain retrospective tax on the banks, but nobody bothered about it because the banks were among the bigger people.  Here again we have the tendency developing, and it cannot even be excused on the grounds of &ldquo;excess profits which have accrued as a result of the war&rdquo;.  Apparently, either the Minister is reckless as to the harm he will do, or he has duped himself into the belief that he has to be indifferent to it because he has no other way of getting the money.  I should like the Minister, before the debate ends, to let us know what would be the result, say, over a period of three years, if he put on this corporation profits tax at the lower limit and at this higher rate which he proposes now, and carried it on as from this moment? How would he fare if he did that, say, over the three years&rsquo; period ahead? <Col N="908" /> How would that compare with what he hopes to get under this part of his Budget proposals, retrospective as they are?  I should like to have that particular matter explained.</P>
    <P>In connection with this tax, and also in connection with the next one&mdash;possibly the Minister has certain figures which he can give me&mdash;as I read the table of receipts and expenses I find that the Estimates for 1941-42 of all taxation show that between corporation profits tax and excess profits duty the sum of £673,000 was expected; we will call it £700,000.  He expects to get in an additional £1,400,000 in this year, that is double what he used to get from the combination of those two taxes.  I am merely emphasising that to show the shattering blow which this is likely to be in certain industries; in other words, they have to find in this year the amount which ordinarily under the old taxation, and it was heavy enough, they would find in three years. They are going to find all that in one year.  In addition, Deputy Dockrell and Deputy Benson have referred to the fact that a lot of them had possibly distributed in dividends the money that came into their hands.</P>
    <P>They have no way of getting that back unless the Minister is going to amend the law to compel people to pay back the profits distributed to them by way of dividends.  If not, does he contemplate with an easy mind the fact that business people hit by this tax will have to go to the banks to borrow money in order to pay the Minister, and how does he hope that they will be able to pay that money back in a period when trade is on the decline, and when the Minister&rsquo;s colleague is actively engaged in calling in employers of all types and telling them that, as far as he can see from the amount of stocks in the country, business will be seriously on the decline before the autumn has gone? I have been wondering for some time past whether the Minister for Finance, in putting up those proposals, consulted his colleague in Government, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, and got from him&mdash;or credited when he got from him&mdash;the story which the Minister for Industry and <Col N="909" /> Commerce told employers recently with regard to the possibility of business being very seriously brought low inside a very limited period.  I suggest to the Minister that before this taxation is imposed he should certainly go back and search hard to see whether the amount to be derived from it could not be saved out of the masses of money which we are voting for other services.</P>

      <P>Deputy McGilligan has pointed out that Deputy Hickey has been misled by the complexion put on the taxation of industries by the Minister in his Budget speech.  As Deputy McGilligan has pointed out, the Minister said: &ldquo;I, therefore, propose to make certain changes in the corporation profits tax, and these changes include a modification designed to give the Exchequer a very substantial proportion of the increased profits which have accrued as a result of the war.&rdquo;  I think that is really a most misleading statement.  In our present circumstances, in discussing what we are doing with our finances, I do not think the Minister should leave that statement in the form in which it is.  He must know how misleading it has been to the House, and to people outside.  In whatever conversations he has had with groups representing industry, or other people, since he made his Budget speech, he must realise how misleading it is.  On the question of profits, Deputy Hickey seems to feel that the word &ldquo;profits&rdquo; is one which should be cut completely out of our dictionary.</P>

      <P>It is only because of the Minister&rsquo;s misleading statement here that anybody has mentioned the words &ldquo;excess profits&rdquo; in connection with the Resolution we are discussing. I would ask Deputies, when considering <Col N="910" /> this matter, to remember that&mdash;just as some people work for wages and some people work for salaries, while the professions work for fees&mdash;in the case of the shopkeeper or manufacturer who is running an industry, and employing other people to do his work, the only word you can apply to what he gets in what is analogous to wages or fees or salaries is the word &ldquo;profits&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>You cannot call it &ldquo;profit&rdquo; until all wages and salaries are paid.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>What we are talking about here is that which the shopkeeper or manufacturer has left after he has honoured all his debts, after he has paid all his wages, rents and overheads. In the discussion of this Resolution at any rate, Resolution No. 23, let us regard the word &ldquo;profits&rdquo; as nothing more malicious or objectionable than &ldquo;wages&rdquo; as describing what the workers get, or &ldquo;salaries&rdquo; as describing what the officials get. Let us say that, in the City of Cork, there is a person with a salary of £2,000 a year, and that there is a shopkeeper carrying on a business, or a man carrying on a little industry and giving employment, with profits of £2,000 a year.  You have there three people, one with a salary coming in for work done, employing nobody, except giving such employment as he gives in his home, and then you have the shopkeeper and the manufacturer.  Why should the man who gets an income of £2,000 a year out of employing people to run a shop, or a man who gets £2,000 a year out of getting people to run an industry, have to pay £100 more in taxation than the man who gets £2,000 simply because he goes in and does his job?  This resolution proposes <Col N="911" /> that on the second thousand of receipts the manufacturer or the shopkeeper, if they are limited companies, will pay £100 more.  If you have a shopkeeper running the shop simply for himself, and who has not made use of the limited company machinery, or if you have a person running an industry who has not made use of the limited company machinery, that person is going to pay £100 less in taxation than the person who runs a limited company. That is utterly absurd and unfair discrimination, and this resolution proposes that there shall be that particular type of discrimination.</P>
      <P>If we take a commercial establishment that is a limited company and that has been having profits of £4,000 a year for the last three or four years, before the emergency arose and when the income-tax was 5/6 in the £, they paid income-tax on the gross profits of £4,000, which brought that amount down to £2,900.  There was no additional taxation to be paid by way of corporation profits and therefore their net income, less the tax at 5/6, was £2,900.  The income-tax was raised to 6/6 at the beginning of the emergency period.  With the same gross profits, that commercial establishment was left with £2,700.  A firm in that position, because of the retrospective effect of the Resolution, is finding itself charged with a corporation profits tax. That firm was carrying on under the stress of the emergency and the business was so well managed that, in spite of difficulties, they still managed to maintain the gross profit and continued to employ the full staff.  That firm is going to be charged retrospectively £203 and, instead of having a net income of £2,700, that amount will be reduced by £203 in a normal year. If the firm maintains the level of profits of past years it will have to pay an additional £203.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is being done at a time when the Minister for Industry and Commerce gathers together the representatives of labour and industry and says to them: &ldquo;We are going to have a serious shortage of material.  We are going to have a very considerable amount of unemployment.  I want you <Col N="912" /> to do your best on your side to see that employment will be as widespread as it can be and, in order to help you to do that, I am prepared to change the regulations in regard to unemployment insurance and unemployment assistance so that, while you run your business in the most economical way you possibly can, spreading out employment, I will assist you, if necessary, with a loosening of the regulations that will enable additional Government money to be paid to these people under the unemployment insurance scheme so as to keep things going.&rdquo;  It is while the position of industry and employment is driving the Minister for Industry and Commerce to take these steps, that the Minister for Finance is not only telling industry: &ldquo;You will have to carry on by yourselves during the present year so as to bear an increasing burden of taxation&rdquo;; but also: &ldquo;I am going to go back and take out of the profits you made last year&mdash;although you may not have made as big profits last year as you made before&mdash;a certain amount of taxation.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We asked the Government a month before the Budget was introduced to review the general situation in the country so that various aspects of things that are now being dealt with piecemeal by different Ministers in different ways would all be reviewed and, when we were discussing what money we wanted to spend and how we were going to get the money, we would have before us a situation that we had been reviewing thoroughly and we would not have the situation that we now have, where the money is being taken from the very foundations of our industry. Many of these industries are small struggling ones and many of them are big ones, where men have worked and slaved night and day to get through the difficulties the emergency has brought upon them.</P>
    <P>I do not think the retrospective aspect of this tax can stand.  I do not think that some of the discrimination that is in it as between limited companies and concerns carried on by private individuals or professional people can stand, because if industry is the thing we are depending on to <Col N="913" /> maintain our town and city population, why is it that it is from the well of capital that is supporting industry that this money is to be taken?  It is like feeding somebody suffering from some kind of wasting disease with a bit of his own limbs.  We ought to be clear in our minds, when discussing this particular Resolution, that we are dealing only with ordinary income.  It is called profit because it cannot be called wages or salaries or anything else, but it is as innocuous and simple and unaggressive a thing as wages and salaries.</P>
    <P>We have a discriminatory tax put on here, and we have had it put on a limited class of people, these being the class of people upon whom the towns depend mostly to keep family life in operation, to keep men working and to take young people in and train them and employ them.  These are the people upon whom this particular tax is put.  They are not only being told, as I say, in fairness, they ought to be told: &ldquo;You will have to bear this tax in future&rdquo;, but they are being told: &ldquo;You will have to pay out of the bit of reserves, with which you thought you were going to be able to carry on for a while, additional taxation.&rdquo;  There is not only unfair discrimination there, not only an injustice in going into the past, but I believe it is absolutely unsound to take this tax and put it on the limited class of people on which it is put.  I do not think there can be anything but very serious results from it.</P>

I should like Deputy Hickey to remember that this Government had to put a tax of 4d. an ounce on the tobacco of the poor fellow who gets one day&rsquo;s work in the week on the docks, or the poor fellow who works on the farm down in the country.</P>

I think that Deputy Hickey and I will understand one another after a while.  Take the case of an individual who buys a factory for £47,000, for a kick-off, and who waters it down or over-capitalises it and turns it into a company, named &ldquo;Rackets Limited&rdquo;, with a capital of £163,000 and who, having done that, so that he would not show more than 6 per cent. dividend on the shares, starts business.  Now, I would ask Deputy Hickey whether that man should be taxed more, as an individual with £47,000 or on the £163,000 to which he had blown up the industry.</P>

In plain language, if he was not able to clear about £50,000 of loot out of the farmers&rsquo; pockets here, he would complain.

We shall deal with the excess profits in the next round, but I am dealing with a particular class of individuals and the limited companies, and I am telling this House what, in my opinion, they are.  On a previous occasion I had the support of Deputy McGilligan, who was shouting &ldquo;shame&rdquo; when I was giving out the history of that thing, and we had Deputy Mulcahy shouting out &ldquo;outrageous&rdquo;.  Now, however, what do they want?  What do they want to save that man from now &mdash;the limited merchant company down the country that bought my oats at 8/- a cwt. and sold it back to a neighbour, three months afterwards, at 25/-?  According to them, we are not to have retrospective legislation at all in that case; we are not to go back on that man because, although he made a profit, he might have distributed it to his chums in order to try to cloak the income-tax returns.  We are not to go back on those fellows.  That is the argument that is put up now by the friends of the poor on the opposite bench.  Let us be clear about this matter, and let us get down to it.</P>

I am not talking about excess profits at all.  We may come to that in a few minutes, but we will deal with the corporations and the limited company&mdash; the individual who comes along and buys a little factory for £20,000 or £30,000, then brings in his wife, his son, his mother-in-law, his son-in-law, and so on, makes it into a limited company, a family job, and then floats it for £163,000 in order to keep within 6 per cent. dividend.</P>

      <P>There is only one way to deal with this thing.  Let us get all we can off that kind of person.  I have very little sympathy with the Minister in this, when these fellows were allowed to get away with it, but I want to warn the Minister solemnly not to be looking for too much profits out of these fellows for the future, because the farmers of this country are going to take damn good care that these fellows will not have any profits to divide.  The farmers are going to take care that they will not be robbed this year as they were last year.  Therefore, let the Minister take what he can from these fellows, now that they have it.  They have the &ldquo;dough&rdquo; collected, so let the Minister get what he can out of them, because I promise him that when we <Col N="917" /> are watching legislation here next year, and when legislation is being brought in fixing the price of the farmer&rsquo;s oats, we shall also be fixing the price at which it will be sold back to the farmer for seeds.  We shall be fixing the whole line of it all along, and if the Minister has any chance of getting the money, now is the time for him to do it, and let him make it as retrospective as he can, because whatever chance he has now he will have very little in the future, because there will be no profits there.  We are going to see to that side of it, and there will be a lot of merchants who bought at 8/- and sold at 25/- who will have to shut up shop.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The discussion on this corporation profits tax has been fairly exhaustive, but I should like to appeal to the Minister with regard to one aspect of it.  I should like to ask him whether he does not think it possible to collect the money which he is going to collect through this source from some other type of taxation, having regard to the future position of industries and trades in this country which are affected by a shortage of supplies. I do not stand for excess profits in any form.  I do not stand for people deliberately speculating on a rising market, selling at excessive prices to people who are unable to protect themselves, but I ask the Minister to bear in mind the serious situation I am going to describe. An industry commenced operations under a tariff somewhere about 1935 with inexperienced labour and inexperienced directors, making a product to which they were quite unaccustomed, and, for the first three years of their existence, in spite of a very high tariff, they are unable to overcome the difficulties of production and difficulties of sale.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In certain cases the tariff may have been insufficient; in other cases they may have faced all sorts of difficulties, caused by the fact that their labour is working only at 50 per cent. of the normal rate of output to which the industry is accustomed; but just about the period at which the war commences they are in a position to make greater profits.  During the period they have ploughed back the greater <Col N="918" /> portion of their profits into new machinery, into paying off initial expenses, expenses which occasionally were the result of their low initial production, and, as the war starts, and as a result of the natural rise in prices, the marrying of old stocks with new stocks and the production of goods from them, and a general increase in their productive abilities, they make a fairly large profit.  In many cases those firms may actually have spent the whole of their profits in purchasing reserves of raw materials.</P>
    <P>It is not for me to say how many firms there are like that.  It would not be possible for me to say what proportion of the whole production of the country they represent, or how many firms could be described as being in that position, but the taxation proposed by the Minister on firms which had that experience&mdash;and I should venture to say that there is a good number of them&mdash;is, virtually speaking, a capital levy, and not really a tax.  It is a levy on capital, capital either in the form of working capital or reserves.  It certainly cannot be called current taxation, and I trust that the Minister will reconsider this whole question in the light of that type of trade.  It is not easy in this country for any firm in a small way of business to obtain a sufficient margin of working capital.  I know a great number of instances of firms having to resort to every possible expedient in order to raise sufficient working capital for their businesses.  This is not a country in which the small industry making a profit which is now affected by this taxation is able very easily to find sufficient working capital.  The margin is not large enough at any time, and many of these firms did their utmost to create a reserve during the last five years, and I put it to the Minister that in their case the situation is going to be serious.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect of the matter.  Supplies are getting shorter in many cases and fuel has suddenly become almost impossible to obtain. There are at present, I venture to say, hundreds of firms in this country employing people solely for the purpose of maintaining them in employment, and unable in many cases to justify their <Col N="919" /> employment on strictly financial grounds.  Take, for example, a firm which lacks a supply of a certain type of yarn, and for about a period of three weeks, only about 25 per cent. of the normal quantity is coming into the factory.  That firm has a choice of doing what would be entirely an economic act from the point of view of strict business, that is, of throwing men out, of disemploying them, or maintaining half, or even quarter of them.  I should say that, generally speaking, the atmosphere of industry at present is a very satisfactory atmosphere so far as the efforts made by the directors and managers of businesses which are small to keep people in employment, to keep the wheels turning somehow or other, are concerned.  When a small ration of supplies arrives, the industry goes on producing normally for a few weeks, and then supplies fall off again.  I know firms which actually had only two days&rsquo; supply in their factory and who were forced to close one part of the factory.  Even so, the men came in, though paid for only three days in the week.</P>
    <P>A good deal of this war-time, emergency production is being carried on with the aid of financial reserves accumulated during this period.  It has been carried on because the ordinary concept of profit, the ordinary concepts of carrying on business, have been modified, and I only hope that taxation of this type is not going to prove damaging to that effort, because it is going to be far more expensive for the State to have to pay unemployment benefit and unemployment assistance to the employees of firms who are going to be placed at a disadvantage as a result of having to dig deeply into their pockets and pay what amounts to a capital tax, than it would be to allow these firms to carry on so far as they can, straining to the limit their resources in giving and maintaining employment.  I am not accusing the Minister for one moment of trying to prevent that very excellent social work being continued.  I am merely asking him whether he has considered the full implications of the proposal, and <Col N="920" /> whether he can think of any way out of the difficulty, because I am quite certain it is going to affect considerable classes of business in this State.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not come to the decision to impose a retrospective tax of this character with any great measure of pleasure.  I realise that it is a difficult thing for the companies concerned, in some cases, at any rate, to have to realise resources, perhaps, to meet an unexpected demand, but I come back to the point I made earlier in the debate, that the principle of retrospective taxation exists.  The principle is there.  It may be a wrong principle, but it has existed for a good many years.  This is bringing it a step further.  In the view of some Deputies it is bringing it much too far, but it is, nevertheless, merely an extension of an existing principle.  Any company which makes up its balance sheet and accounts to 30th April in any financial year&mdash;our custom is to introduce the Budget early in May&mdash;cannot know, cannot be certain, what its liability for income-tax is going to be until the Budget of the following year has been introduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There have been changes in income-tax since the State was set up.  Companies which made up their accounts to the 30th April took it, I suppose, that the tax would be what it was in the preceding year.  Later on, perhaps, they found, in some years at any rate, that they had to provide for an additional payment.  That was retrospective taxation to a limited extent; I admit that it was not to the same extent as I am proposing to operate by means of this Resolution.  This retrospective tax is heavy.  Deputy McGilligan suggested that, before asking the House to impose this tax, I should have made every effort to secure economies.  I did make very considerable efforts to secure economies, and secured some, but not as much as I should have liked to secure. Deputy McGilligan is a much more forceful person than I am, and I doubt, if he were in my position, that he could get sufficient economies to make this or a similar tax unnecessary; to make it unnecessary to look for the sum of money in additional taxation <Col N="921" /> for which I am looking.  At any rate, nobody would be able to do that without causing very considerable unemployment. That is the difficulty.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave and Deputy Mulcahy stressed that this tax would cause unemployment.  If I could succeed in getting economies to the amount that this tax is estimated to bring in by way of revenue, I could not, and nobody could, cut down Government expenditure to that extent without, I believe, causing much more unemployment than will be caused by the imposition of this tax.  I had to get staff for the emergency services, and I took a considerable number from the Land Commission, to give one instance.  The taking away of that staff has meant considerable unemployment in different parts of the country.</P>
    <P>While there is a demand made for economy by Deputy McGilligan and other Deputies opposite, at the same time there is a clamorous demand by some of these Deputies&rsquo; colleagues for further expenditure.  Last night we had a scene here of an ugly kind because the Minister for Education would not announce that he would adopt a certain reform&mdash;a good reform, but a reform that would cost the Minister for Finance from £30,000 to £32,000 a year; not for one year, but for all time, so far as we can see.  That was a good and proper reform that I could stand over, and that the Minister for Education, I know, would stand over. There was a unanimous vote in the Seanad by those belonging to the Party of the Deputies opposite, demanding that the Government should provide money for that very proper reform, but it would mean the expenditure of £30,000 in these times.  When that amendment was carried in the Seanad, I met the Government and said: &ldquo;I am looking for economies. This is a most excellent thing in itself. This would be an excellent expenditure for the improvement of educational services and the improvement of salaries.&rdquo; But what are we to do in these days of emergency when we are looking for additional taxation?  We are taxing individuals, and we are taxing companies. We are proposing penal taxes of various kinds.  But that does not <Col N="922" /> stop the demand made from the benches opposite.  Sometimes the very people who are most clamorous in demanding economies in some directions are insisting that we should introduce those desirable reforms which cost a considerable amount of money.  In the Dáil here you will hear them speaking with two voices.</P>
    <P>I listened with interest and sympathy to Deputy Dillon last week, and on several occasions previously, making a most urgent demand that we should bring in another social reform, namely, family allowances, and that we should bring it in this year, while at the same time the same Deputy will say that this is a time for economies.  They cannot have it both ways.  I do not think that this Resolution and Resolution No. 24 taken together will have the disastrous effects on industry that some Deputies imagine.  The small industries that Deputy Dillon spoke about are safeguarded, at any rate, to some extent.  If they are small industries whose profits can be counted in hundreds of pounds, there is a safety margin of £1,000 for them.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mulcahy suggested that private individuals who own and control businesses that make profits will escape, while corporations are mulcted in heavy taxes.  Under these proposals they will not escape.  Private individuals who make a profit in trade or business will not escape any more than corporations.</P>

      <P>We are doing what the Deputy has so often appealed to us to do, in particular instances, I admit. This is a general principle we are applying.  It will hit some industries. There is, however, a safety margin for small companies that some Deputies think might be put out of existence.  I do not believe the harm will be so great or that, as some Deputies would seem to suggest, irreparable injury will be done to industry. I do not think that is so.  As I have said, I would much prefer to see economies effected in the present emergency rather than have heavy taxation imposed.  In some of the cases for economy that I have examined, and examined closely, I was forced to the conclusion that the unemployment position would be very much worsened if the suggested economies were enforced. I was, therefore, obliged to drop them.  I do not think this taxation will cause the amount of unemployment that wholesale economies would.  The ruthless hacking of expenditure that Deputy McGilligan spoke of would, I believe, cause widespread unemployment.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;The effect of all the changes in the normal case will be that taking into account the 10 per cent. ordinary corporation profits tax charge on the excess profit, the excess corporation profits tax charge of 50 per cent. and the income-tax of 7/6 in the £ which will be charged on the balance of the excess after deducting the corporation profits tax charge, a company which is liable to be assessed to excess corporation profits tax will pay altogether 75 per cent. of the excess in taxation.&rdquo;</P>

There is a slight complication in this and the purpose of my question was to endeavour to restrict the length of the debate.

      <P>I am taking a purely notional case in order to show how, in certain instances, the tax will be paid by a company.  Let us assume in the case of this notional company that the excess profits are £4,000.  Corporation profits tax is payable at 10 per cent., and that amounts to £400.  Excess corporation profits tax is payable at 50 per cent., and that represents £2,000. Income-tax is then payable on £4,000, less £2,400.  That represents £1,600 at 7/6 in the £, or £600.  The total corporation profits tax, excess corporation profits tax and income-tax amount to £3,000 in all, which is the same as a tax of 15/- in the £ on £4,000.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The 75 per cent. is got in the way the Minister indicated. We are assuming that a company has made, over the standard years, £4,000. Taking corporation profits tax at 10 per cent. that gives £400, which leaves the company with £3,600.  The £400 has gone to the Exchequer.  Then the 50 per cent. is charged, not on the £3,600, but on the £4,000.  Later, £2,400 is subtracted from the £4,000 and the income-tax is levied on £1,600.  We start off with taking £400 from the man who makes £4,000.  Then we take £2,000 off a notional £4,000, although at that time he has only £3,600.  The way it now seems to be done is by hitting a man twice with regard to one item of profit.  That is supposed to be what will run down through the scale. You take 10 per cent. off the gross sum and then you go back to that sum, overlooking the fact that you have already subtracted 10 per cent., and you take half of what was there originally.  It seems to be an odd type of tax.  We now know what is being suggested.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have the Minister for Supplies here and, that being so, I should like to point out that the whole case made for this is that people like Ranks were allowed by the Minister for Supplies to get away with an enormous amount of loot.  That is the only case the Minister for Finance was able to make on the last Resolution and, because the Minister for Supplies allowed Ranks to rook the people of this country in such a manner, we are now going to get back, not what they have taken from the people of the country but, if they have made something over what the Minister allowed them to make, then we will take 75 per cent. off that excess&mdash;not off what they fleeced from our population, but 75 per cent. off what they made over a limited period. That is a very small amount compared with what should be taken from them if there were proper precautions taken. They should be paying not 75 per cent., but all.  As it is, they will be asked to <Col N="931" /> pay on a small excess over the inflated profit which they were allowed to make through the inefficiency and incompetence of the Minister.</P>
    <P>The other persons were the bacon curers.  The Minister suggested that I was somewhat anxious about retrospective taxation.  In the case of the bacon curers, I pleaded that they should have been treated as one report said they should have been, and that was that they were people who betrayed a public trust, that they were people guilty of a criminal offence, and they should have been fined the full amount they took from the till.  There were two commissions set up here at different times and one had to enquire into the results of either the complete incompetence of the Minister for Supplies&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am only referring to it in an incidental way to show the results of the comparison made and the level that good traders are being put at.  The rogues the Minister for Supplies allowed to make enormous profits at the expense of the people are put forward as the two sets of people we ought to be glad to get after.  The two sets of people are the Rank milling concern and the bacon curers.  It is very little use to ask us to compare good traders who, possibly, have made even more profits than they would have made, or would have been allowed to make, if a prices control had not been established over them by the Minister; it is difficult to ask us to compare the case of the good type of trader and the profiteer who has been allowed to make huge profits since the war started despite the Minister&rsquo;s so-called prices control.  The situation here is not represented by those phenomenal folk who did not endeavour to take advantage of the position, and who were content with ordinary profits, but it is represented by these people who had been making enormous profits.  The warning that was given to them that their prices were going to <Col N="932" /> be controlled was regarded by them as so much sheer nonsense.  Their attitude was that the present Minister for Supplies did not know where he was going, or what he was going to do.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have often been here and the Minister has shown no desire to seek or to face criticism.  One sign of that is that he will not even face his back-bencher, Deputy Corry. He clears out when Deputy Corry starts, and sometimes I sympathise with him, but there are other times when I know the reason why he clears out.  What is the position that we have here?  One thing is that the enforcing of this tax in the way it is proposed to enforce it will do damage to good firms.  It is a matter of indifference to the people opposite what happens to these firms&mdash;let them crash, let anything happen to them, the Minister for Finance has to get his money.  The contrast has been drawn here, however, and by more than his Party, with the situation that has developed under the successor to the Minister for Supplies in his previous job, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, who has gathered in all the employers in the country, telling them that supplies are petering out, and asking them to carry on.  It is notable that he did not invite the Minister for Supplies to that conference.  He asked these people to carry on, to give as much employment as possible, and to keep their men <Col N="933" /> going, as best they could, whether on rotational schemes, short time, week in and week out, and so on&mdash;any scheme that would help to keep things going. On the other hand, the Minister for Finance says, in effect, to these employers: &ldquo;I want so many hundred thousand pounds, and I must get it whether your businesses go to the wall or not.&rdquo;  Of course, when supplies give out and when the crash takes place that, according to the Minister for Industry and Commerce, is awaited in the autumn, there is one figure that ought to be there, if only in a white sheet, and that is the Minister for Supplies.</P>
      <P>The businessmen in this country did make demands from January, 1939, to get into the office of the Minister for Supplies in order to know what he was doing in his new Department.  He was not even engaged in the activities in which he is now engaged, of announcing shortages.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>In the situation as I see it, business has been brought to a very low ebb by the incompetency of the Minister for Supplies in regard to supplies.  Businessmen are being asked to carry on by the Minister&rsquo;s successor <Col N="934" /> in his former position, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, but the Minister for Finance says to the businessmen and industrialists: &ldquo;We do not care how you carry on, or whether you carry on or not; we want this money.&rdquo; This Resolution is objected to on two grounds: one, that it is going to do more harm than good, that it will put industries out of business and add to the numbers of unemployed; it will still more seriously increase the numbers that the Minister left behind him. Secondly, it is putting all these people, whether they have good or bad records, on the same level from the point of view of business dealing. Certain people, undoubtedly, have made profits, and gross profits, and have been allowed to make them as a result of the incompetency of the Minister, but no matter how these profits accrued&mdash;whether as a result of the war or through better and expanding business, and notwithstanding the difference between those who made profits as a result of profiteering and those who made ordinary legitimate profits through better and expanding business&mdash;they are all to be treated on the same level, and this money is to be taken from them.  In addition to these, there is a third argument against this Resolution, and that is that there is no account taken in the Resolution of what people have done with the moneys they have made.  Even if moneys were made wrongfully and in excess, they still may have been put back into the business.  Some of these people, undoubtedly, made money in excess, and sneered at the prices control; but even though they are rogues from the point of view of making money that they should not have made, is there to be no discrimination between those who involved that money back in the business, in equipment, or in getting in stocks that are seriously needed at the moment, and those who did not put their money back into the business?  Will the Minister make no discrimination between the people who involved their capital back again in their business and those who merely spent it wishfully or on themselves? The Resolution as it is framed is likely to do enormous harm; there is no discrimination <Col N="935" /> between the good and the bad trader, no discrimination between the trader who puts his money back in the business and the one who spends it badly, and for all these reasons we are against the Resolution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister on this Resolution&mdash;I am afraid we have not got the exact details&mdash;how far surpluses or excess profits will be allowed to be set against deficiencies in other years.  I should like to point out to the Minister that in the former excess profits tax there was such a provision.  Undoubtedly, this year, certain firms have made excess profits, but it is quite open to them to feel that, as in some cases, they have done 18 months&rsquo; business with 12 months&rsquo; expenses, and that now they are faced with doing three months&rsquo; business with 12 months&rsquo; expenses, if they are going to maintain their existing staffs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another matter that I should like to bring to the Minister&rsquo;s attention is that under present circumstances the average firm are probably unable to get materials to have their ordinary repairs for upkeep carried out.  They are probably unable or unwilling, owing to the present shortage of petrol and new motors, to obtain new motor parts.  They cannot obtain parts of machinery.  Will a company, under this tax, be allowed an allowance as against those items?  If they are not allowed to make provision for expenses which they would have incurred in a normal year, it merely means that their profits have been artificially inflated by expenses which they could not incur and which they ought to have incurred. I take it that the Minister does not want to see the commercial community come out of this period of crisis with their machinery worn out, their buildings falling down, and with no transport. That is not the way to face a period of reconstruction in the postwar time.  I should like to appeal to the Minister to see that under this Resolution surpluses would be set against deficiencies; in other words, that it is only when a trader has made excess profits over a period that he <Col N="936" /> should really be called on to contribute to the Exchequer the excess profits. I do not mean that he should be allowed to retain excess profits on the chance of his showing a deficiency, but I certainly think that, if, in one year, a trader shows a surplus, and, the next year, a deficiency, he should be allowed to set one against the other.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I am more at home on this Resolution than on the last.  Deputy McGilligan has gone a bit each way in this matter.  He is anxious, on the one hand, that certain uncertain friends of his should be punished and, on the other hand, that others should be protected.  He is anxious, as he says, that Ranks and the bacon curers should be made to stump up, but he is not at all anxious that the people who fleeced the agricultural community during the past 12 months should be made to stump up.  I am against this excess profits tax altogether.  I do not think the excess profits should have been allowed to be made, but, still, they are there.  We have this gent up in Drogheda, with his haul of £66,000 out of the wheat ramp, and my only regret is that he is going to be allowed to keep 5/- in the £ out of it.  I do not think he should be allowed to keep that much.  For every £4,000 he made, the Minister is going to leave him £1,000, and I do not think he should.  I think that £1,000 should be taken also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Practically 99 per cent. of those people in this country who call themselves businessmen settled themselves down at the start of this war, rubbed their hands and said: &ldquo;Our time has come,&rdquo; completely ignoring the warnings given repeatedly here by the Taoiseach and by Ministers that they would not be allowed to get away with profits.  The Government has taken very good care that the agricultural community as a community are not going to get away with profits.  The price of everything we have for sale is to be fixed, and, if it is fixed in conformity with the other fixtures we saw here in respect of beet and wheat, we are not going to have much fat out of it.  I appeal to Deputy Bennett and Deputy Hughes not to be led by the nose by Deputy Mulcahy and Deputy <Col N="937" /> McGilligan in this matter.  I appeal to every farmer on the opposite benches, and I put it to them that now is their time.  There must be equality of sacrifice, and if they vote with Deputy McGilligan and Deputy Mulcahy to allow the looters to get away with the loot, in plain language, I am sure the farmers of the country will be thankful to them.  I am sure that the poor farmer who gathered together a few &ldquo;bob&rdquo; to pay his annuities and rates, and who went in for seeds and found that the oats he sold to the merchant at 8/- a cwt. was resold to him at 25/-, will be very thankful to Deputy Hughes and Deputy Bennett if they walk into the Lobby and vote to allow that merchant to get away with his 25/-.</P>
    <P>Let us get down to brass tacks and see where we are in this matter.  Are those people to be allowed to get away with it?  Is Deputy Bennett&rsquo;s or Deputy Hughes&rsquo; farm labourer to have to pay 4d. extra on his ounce of tobacco out of his few shillings in the week and, on the other hand, are those gents, who made hay while the sun shone, to be allowed to get away with their pockets filled with loot?  I know it will be damned little benefit to the farmers, except that they are going to be relieved of some share of taxation in the future, to know that if these people succeeded in collaring £1 a cwt. on our seed oats, the Minister is now going to take 15/- a cwt. from them. That is not going to be much good to us, except that it may relieve us of some taxation in the future, but it is still some satisfaction to know that these people did not get away with all of it.  And it is in that connection that I appeal to Deputies opposite who are not tied to the plutocrats.  Do they agree that the merchant who bought their seed wheat at the fixed price of 37/6 and sold it back to them at prices ranging up to 75/&mdash;he, of course, is one of the people who should be protected now&mdash;can better afford to lose 15/- in the £ on that profit than their farm labourers can afford to pay an extra 4d. on their ounce of tobacco?  But in order that the necessities of this country may be met, their farm labourers have to pay the 4d. an ounce on tobacco anyway, and it is for them <Col N="938" /> to say now whether that gent is to be allowed to get away with what he has taken from their pockets.</P>
    <P>I want them, as agriculturists and farmers, to consider that aspect of it, and to consider also that whatever the Minister makes this year out of excess profits, if we do our duty here by our people, there will be no excess profits to be got next year.  I hope we shall stick together in that regard.  If the price of our agricultural produce is to be fixed for this year, we are going to follow it into the miller, and from the miller back to the consumer, and no retailer is going to get 25/- a ton on it, either, not to mind the £25 a ton that some of them got this year. We are going to follow it this year from the moment it leaves our haggards until it is delivered back again to the farmers who want it for seed, or to the consumer who wants it to eat.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;all that was taken away from us by following that road. I appeal to Deputies opposite not to be led away by people whose only interest apparently is to protect this class of people.  I do not think they should be protected.  It is all very well for Deputies to talk about the post-war period and the necessity of having everything A1 for people in that period.  I wonder what will be our position in the post-war period?  This little war is going to last for three or four years yet, and, afterwards, we are going to start work on these farms after pulling the guts out of them by growing wheat and beet, without any artificial manures.  What is going to be the condition of our machinery for carrying on?  We have no excess profits to draw upon.  We have no good-natured bank manager to go to. Bank managers, when a farmer looks for credit, in addition to the deeds of his farm, will require his insurance <Col N="939" /> policies and other securities as well. When one of the so-called industrialists comes into a bank the manager says: &ldquo;How many thousands do you want?&rdquo; and the money is thrown out to him. There are not any bank managers who will treat farmers in that way.</P>
      <P>Opposition Deputies talk about the worn-out machinery and the need for industrialists having a bank balance amounting to thousands after the war. What will be our position as farmers when the war is over after taking three or four crops of wheat out of every field in order to feed the people and without any artificial manure to put into the land?  We will have to start the reconstruction job with run-out farms.  What will be our position compared with those industrialists who are to be allowed to get away with the loot they have collected out of our labours and the money which should have gone to pay annuities and rates which they have dragged out of us for seeds and manures this year?  They are to be allowed to get away with that loot in order to have their machinery in tiptop condition for the reconstruction period.  There are the two pictures. The farmers on the Opposition Benches can do what they like in connection with this, but if they do anything wrong to-night I will take very good care that their constituents will know about it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to draw the attention of the House to one picture which Deputy Corry painted.  Deputy Corry has made a prophecy as to the way some of us will vote on this.  He appealed to us as farmers to give the same consideration to this matter when voting on it as we did to the tax on tobacco.  Deputy Corry who declares that he has so much sympathy with the class he referred to voted for the tax on tobacco.  We voted against it and when it comes up again we will do so again.  We think it is a pernicious tax, but Deputy Corry voted for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to see that Deputy Corry has run away from the <Col N="940" /> policy of his Ministers for years past and has deserted the bolstered-up industries.  I have always held that many industries in this country were too much sheltered, and I agree with Deputy Corry that the agriculturists have been the victims to a great extent.  I am sorry that Deputy Corry was not always of that opinion.</P>
      <P>I intend to vote against this Resolution, just as I voted against the tobacco duty, but for a different reason.  So far as I can see from these two Resolutions we have mixed up the rogues and the vagabonds and the sheltered industries with certain respectable industrialists.  Certain industrialists in this country carried on a decent and honest business, some of them for 20 or 50 years.  They have maintained their industries in a respectable manner in ordinary times without making undue profits.  Owing to the war they made certain extra profits.  They are to be taxed on these extra profits in the same way as some of the bolstered-up industries that enjoyed a monopoly and whose standard for 1937 and 1938 is much beyond the standard of the decent, honest industrialists with whom, perhaps, they were competing.  These industrialists will have the standard above which they will pay excess profits tax fixed at much too high a figure.  In justice, their standard should be a different one altogether from the honest, decent industrialist.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I agree to a certain extent with Deputy Corry, if I had my way I would take the bulk of the excess profits from all industrialists and distribute it amongst the agriculturists.  That might not be a judicious policy in some ways, but I would do it.  I have perhaps greater sympathy for the agriculturist and the labourer than Deputy Corry has.  I have had the courage sometimes to vote against my own Party on matters concerning them.  I do not think Deputy Corry has ever done that.  On this occasion I would have no hesitation in voting against my own Party if it were not for the indefensible way in which decent, honest industrialists have been treated in comparison with some of the industrialists whom Deputy Corry referred <Col N="941" /> to in terms which, I am sure, the Minister for Supplies agrees with to a great extent, although he may not have the courage to say what Deputy Corry said.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not opposed to the principle of the excess profits tax when it is administered with justice and fair play, but I do not think it is possible on the proposals set out by the Minister in his Budget speech to deal with the problem that is there. There is no discrimination made between those who have exploited, robbed and plundered the people of the country during the standard years and who were permitted to get away with it at that time, and the people who were starting an industry at that time and perhaps struggling for an existence and who are now to be put on the same basis.  In other words, a man who made an excess profit during the standard year, provided his profit in the meantime has not increased, will not be liable to excess profits tax.  An industrial company which started in 1935 and had an uphill fight for a few years and which, in the last two or three years, has shown a fair profit, is liable for excess profits tax to the extent of 50 per cent. on the difference between the profit it is making now and what it made during the standard year.  Notwithstanding Deputy Corry&rsquo;s attempt at justification, I think no man can stand over that.</P>
      <P>While I agree that no one should be permitted to make excess profits, this system by which it is attempted to collect tax on excess profits is not a system which will appeal to commonsense and that is why we oppose it. Deputy Corry talked a lot about the people who have plundered the farmers.  Whose fault was that?  Is not that an attack on the incompetence of his own Minister for not preventing that and an admission that there was no proper prices control?  This is not the way to collect the money.  It will be of little use to the farmer who, Deputy Corry admits, is being robbed, if it is collected now and goes into the revenue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proper procedure in that case <Col N="942" /> would be to fix prices.  We have already discussed the ways and means of doing that.  It has been pointed out from this side, and by the Deputy himself, how it should have been done, but the Minister ignored the advice.  I know a couple of companies who started business in 1934 and 1935 and they had a great struggle to exist.  They were on the point of going down, but somehow they pulled through.  Now they are showing an improvement, possibly an artificial one, since they are able to carry on with a rising market.  The value of their stocks has increased, and they are showing a profit as a result of that.  Are they to be asked to pay a tax on what we are calling excess profits?</P>
    <P>The other aspects of the question ought not to be overlooked, that if there is a period of depression in the post-war period, and if those people are carrying big stocks, they are likely to depreciate in value.  What is going to happen then?  I think that any industry, company or corporation is entitled to provide against that sort of thing.  On another Resolution, Deputy Childers referred to the action of the Minister for Industry and Commerce in inviting industrialists to come to this country to try at all costs to keep men in industry, even on short time. We are up against the position that we are suffering from an acute shortage of raw materials for industry.  Problems of that kind are upsetting industry at the present time.  Facing a critical situation of that sort, we object to any decent industrialist being called upon to meet a tax like this.  This proposal is not going to get my support.  I want to make it clear to Deputy Corry that there is no merit in the case he put up.  In a case where excess profit has been made it should be tackled in a different way altogether.  The proposal here, to turn some of the fruits of profiteering into the Exchequer, is going to bestow no benefit whatever on the people the Deputy says he is worrying about, the agriculturists. That will be of very little use to the farmer.  He will not be able to put his fingers on much of it, and will not be helped by this Resolution.  What we <Col N="943" /> strongly object to is that no action is being taken against the man who has been plundering over a long period of years.  In fact, this proposal is absolutely into the barrow of the man who plundered in 1937, 1938 and 1939&mdash; during the standard years.  I say that because the basis upon which the Government are going to calculate his excess profits is a wrong basis.  There is no justice in it.  They cannot assume that everything was lovely in the garden in those years, and that no one was profiteering.  Firms were profiteering in those years.  That was exposed on many occasions from these benches. The Government, in fact, set up a commission to investigate the profits that were being made by certain industries in this country.  It reported back that there had been exploitation and profiteering, but the Government paid no heed to its report.  In view of the whole situation we could not be expected to support this proposal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>I find it rather hard to follow Deputy Hughes.  He admits that there was exploitation and profiteering in industry previous to the war. In view of the fact that a man will not have to pay the excess profits tax unless his profits during 1939, 1940 and 1941 exceeded those of the best two years he had previous to 1939, I am at a loss to follow Deputy Hughes and other Deputies who have expressed their sympathies for people who have been making excess profits during the period in question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>But suppose a man made no profits in those years?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>Then he will not be taxed at all.  If a firm made no profits previous to 1939, it will be permitted by the Government to pay a dividend of 6 per cent. to its shareholders.  There is another class.  Even though a man made profits in excess of the profits he made during two of his best years prior to 1939, the Government are only demanding 50 per cent. of the excess <Col N="944" /> from him.  I think that is wrong.  They should have demanded 100 per cent.  I have been listening to this debate for the last three or four hours.  Deputies have been talking about the man with a salary of £2,000 a year, the man with an income of £2,000 a year, and the man making £2,000 a year out of his business.  Whether a man has wages, salary, or an allowance, that is his income. I think we would be far better employed if we took our minds off the people who are earning thousands of pounds a year, and paid more attention to the thousands of people who are trying to exist on 14/- a week or 23/- a week, men with wives and families, some with six, seven and nine children. If we did that we would be getting nearer to the reality of the position, and people outside this House would have more respect for us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know how anybody can stand behind people who have been exploiting the community.  I have had considerable experience of dealing with employers over a long period of years, and especially since the war started.  Workers made demands for increased wages.  The whole cry was that wages could not be increased because no profits were being made.  Now we find, as a result of the investigations carried out by the Prices Commission, that a number of individuals have been making profits during 1939, 1940 and 1941, that were in excess of what they made during their two best years previous to 1939.  As I have said, I believe that 100 per cent. of those excess profits should be taken off them in the interests of the community, since we have thousands of people who are not living, but simply existing, in the country to-day.  Deputy Hughes said that Deputies on his side could not be expected to vote for this tax because in his opinion it is bad and wrong.  If the Government have failed to take profits off the people who have been exploiting the community for a number of years, including the combines&mdash; reference was made to them by Deputy Mulcahy&mdash;then I say the Government are to blame for that.  I am sure that everyone with a sense of responsibility in the country blames them for it. <Col N="945" /> There is no use in the Minister for Finance saying that he is going to get some of those profits back now.  They should have been recovered long ago. There was no control whatever over the profits that some people, combines and others, were able to make over a period of years, including 1936, 1937 and 1938.  I am quite satisfied that during that period excess profits were made by those people, and that the Government closed their eyes to it.</P>
    <P>I have seen companies starting in a small way and getting monopolies.  I have in mind one company that started with a capital of £10,000.  After they got a monopoly for producing a certain article, they had a revaluation carried out to enable them to raise the value of the place to £60,000.  They carried on for about three years, and afterwards sold their interest to another combine for £90,000, and they still have an interest in the concern for which they got £90,000.  I think those are the matters on which we should concentrate our minds, and that we should tell the Minister that he ought to take 100 per cent. of the profits made in the three years previous to 1939, and give them to the people who are struggling to exist.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It may be useful if I intervene at this stage, before any other Deputy contributes to the discussion. There has been an appalling amount of nonsense talked about the question of profits and prices.  Do Deputies believe that profits are always made by charging excessive prices, or that all profits represent excessive prices?  The records of the Bankruptey Courts show that those who try to make profits by charging big profits usually fail. Most of the big profits in this country, most of the big profits throughout the world, were obtained by firms who were able to sell a little bit lower than their competitors.  I could mention the names of firms engaged in business in this city who have made very big profits because, through their efficiency or organisation or methods of purchase or some other advantage which they enjoy, they were able to undersell their competitors.  The consumers got the <Col N="946" /> benefit of those lower prices, and the firm got the benefit of big profits. Surely Deputies will understand that the amount of profit which a firm makes is no indication of profiteering. There is a distinct difference between profiteering and the making of profits. I could engage in business, and, if I were able to find some method of production or distribution or some substitute material which enabled me to get an advantage over my competitors, undersell my competitors and drive them out of the market.  I could give the people the benefit of my goods at a lower price than that at which they could otherwise get them, and make very big profits in the process.</P>
      <P>It does not follow that the consumers are going to suffer.  Clearly, the consumers are going to benefit by my enterprise.  It is a fact that the making of profits is very often an indication of enterprise, of ability, of business capacity.  There are many firms in this city, in this country, which might be described as only partially efficient.  One of the problems of prices control, at any rate in the form which existed before the war, was how to handle the position of firms which, because they were less efficient than the others, had to charge higher prices than the others.  I remember attending many conferences of people engaged in one industry or another, where I suggested that a particular price level should be adopted, and I found that some of the firms engaged in the business would make no profit at all at that price.  They had to charge a higher price, and even at the higher price they made no profit.  But the firms that were more competent, more efficient, could charge the lower prices and make big profits.</P>

      <P>If that is commonsense, I want Deputies to recognise it, if they are capable of recognising it, and, in discussing this Resolution, to bear in mind that the existence of profits&mdash; even of excess profits&mdash;is not a proof <Col N="947" /> of profiteering.  Deputy Hickey is very much concerned about manufacturers making profits.  He thinks, like Deputy McGilligan, that any Irish manufacturer who makes a profit is a rogue, and that the State should step in and take the whole of his profits from him. Deputy Hickey is a representative of the workers, and claims to be interested in the welfare of the workers.  Does he realise the possible reaction of his policy on employment?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Within the last few days the director of an Irish company engaged in business in this country came to me and informed me that his company had been on the mat before the Prices Branch of my Department, and that the Prices Branch of my Department had insisted that his company should so regulate its prices that the total profit it would make in a 12-months&rsquo; period would not exceed a certain figure.  The following day, the same director, representing the same company, attended a conference in the Department of Industry and Commerce where he met the representatives of the traders who were handling the class of goods that he was manufacturing. Those traders said to him that they had reason to believe that no goods of that class would be imported into this country this year.  Consequently, they wanted to discuss the prospects of this manufacturer increasing his output, doubling his output in fact, in order to ensure that there would be a sufficiency of the goods available in the country, and that no shortage would arise from the cutting-off of supplies.  That manufacturer said to me:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;I can do that.  I can double my output.  I have the raw materials, I have the machinery and the workers. But I am limited to £10,000 profit. Why should I double my output, take the risk of putting more capital into stocks, putting in additional machinery, building perhaps an extension to my plant, if the total <Col N="948" /> amount I am going to get out of it is to be no greater than if I carry on as I am at present with the same output and the same employment?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Has Deputy Hickey, who wants 100 per cent. excess profits tax, taken that into account?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>On the basis of this Resolution those are profits made in excess of the profits in the standard year.  That manufacturer, or any manufacturer who increases his output in order to try to meet the deficiency in supplies due to the cutting off of imports, is going to be made liable to excess profits tax because he has increased his business.  There is, therefore, an inducement to him not to take the risk of extending his enterprise in that way.  That may be an argument against excess profits tax.  The argument for it is that the money must be got somewhere.</P>

      <P>The manufacturer said to me: &ldquo;I am prepared to do it.  I do not think it is fair that I should be asked to do it in that way, but I can do it and I am prepared to do it.&rdquo;  That was his attitude&mdash;it is the attitude of most manufacturers in the country&mdash; but I could have understood him if he took a different attitude.  Surely Deputy Hickey, who wants 100 per cent. excess profits tax, must realise that what he is proposing to do is to destroy any prospect of increasing employment in the few industries in the country where expansion is possible under present circumstances.</P>

Deputy McGilligan wanted to get an opportunity of talking about the incompetence and inefficiency of the Minister for Supplies, and of every other Minister. Deputy McGilligan is so certain that everybody in the world is less competent than himself, and speaks so frequently about incompetence, that it is obviously an obsession with him. He cannot get over the idea that nobody but himself can do anything. He did not do so much when he had the chance.</P>

The powers which my Department exercise to control prices were given to the Government as a war emergency measure.  We control prices under the Emergency Powers Act.  These powers are drastic.  Is it the considered opinion of the Party opposite that we should have these powers in normal circumstances, that that right to examine the accounts of every concern, to direct their methods of operation, to control their profits and turnover upon invested capital, to fix the price they will pay for the raw materials and what they will realise for their finished products should be exercised by a Government Department?  There are various countries in Europe which regard that as the best method of organisation, even in times of peace, but I am surprised to learn that that is the view of the Fine Gael Party.</P>

      <P>I am not going to express my view.  If the Government are going to be criticised for circumstances that existed prior to 1939, that criticism must be based upon the powers available to the Government prior to 1939.  Our present powers exist under the Emergency Powers Act and they will expire when the war ends.  If we are at that stage to introduce permanent legislation to confer these powers permanently upon some Department of the Government, we should have the opinion of the Fine Gael Party on that now.  Deputy McGilligan says that every Irish industrialist who makes a profit is a rogue.  It has been the characteristic of all people who have experienced years of slavery that the slave mind becomes predominant, and the outstanding feature of the slave mind is that it objects to the advancement of the neighbour&rsquo;s child.  Deputy McGilligan is a case in point.</P>

      <P>With one hand tied behind your back and standing on one leg, I suppose.  As I was saying, there is that characteristic of the slave mind &mdash;it objects to the advancement of the neighbour&rsquo;s child.  If anybody in this country promotes a new enterprise and makes good, then all the slave-minded people rise at once to tear him down.  It is a condemnation of a man to say that he has made a profit.  The head of a big English industrial concern who came over here commented on that after attending some Dáil debates.  He said: &ldquo;If my company in England makes an additional profit, we boast about it and put advertisements in the paper about it.  Everybody applauds us and points to us as a great English industrial enterprise which is a success; but over <Col N="952" /> here, if someone makes a profit of 5 or 6 per cent. he is immediately denounced as a rogue, a thief and an exploiter of the people.&rdquo;  The Deputy was the curse of the country, simply because he had that slave mind, and the country got rid of him.  Deputy McGilligan had no objection to Messrs. Ranks making big profits selling flour in this country when they were making the flour in Liverpool.  On the contrary, he so approved of the profits they were making that he even asked them for a subscription to his Party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>He did not.  That was denied.  But we know where the subscriptions are going now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It was only when, as a result of the imposition of tariffs, that the milling of flour was transferred from Liverpool to Limerick, and employment was given there, that Deputy McGilligan got annoyed.  I had no power to control the profits of the flour millers until 1939.  They are fully controlled now in every aspect of their operations.  I control the price they pay for wheat and for every other material they use, and I control the price they sell their product at, and in no part of the industry is there the slightest excess profit being made, because it is under control.  We can have that control in peace time if you want it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think it is logical to exercise powers of control of that kind and, at the same time, hope to make industrial progress though private enterprise. If you want that measure of Government supervision and control of activity, you have to have Government enterprise.  Private enterprise cannot foster and progress under such circumstances. Deputies who believe in private enterprise must believe in private profits because they are the mainspring of private enterprise. People do not put money into business out of altruism, or merely to employ workers and relieve unemployment. They do it to make a profit and, if you take away the motive of profit, you take away all private enterprise and you kill progress <Col N="953" /> and development, unless you wish to substitute the machinery of the State.</P>
    <P>Deputies should make up their minds on that point, because they cannot have it both ways.  At the moment Deputies talk with divers tongues and the result is merely confusion.  Let them tell us definitely which course they stand for. Are they against private enterprise?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, I did not say anything of the sort.  So far as every manufacturer is concerned, he is controlled at the moment in the profit he can make and the prices he can charge. There are great numbers of commodities manufactured here which cannot be dealt with by the system of fixed prices.  You cannot fix a price for a suit of clothes or a pair of socks, because there is such a wide variety of designs and quality.  For manufacturers of commodities of that kind the only system of control relates to the total profit they make.  But where you deal with things such as flour, cement and bacon, you can deal with the situation and control it by means of fixed prices, and that is being done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">

      <P>Notwithstanding the control, there was at least one instance of £29,000 net profit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether that could be regarded as excess profit or not&mdash;that would depend on circumstances. Deputies must understand that the circumstances of one industry are not the circumstances of another. <Col N="954" /> Some people announced some time ago that they were going to make a petrol substitute out of some home products. These people are putting money into the manufacture of a product which will be saleable here only so long as the war lasts.  When the war ends, their whole enterprise will be finished.  Once petrol again becomes available in large quantities, these people cannot hope to sell their product.  They will not put any money into the venture unless they can hope to get it back.  It is a speculative enterprise, and they may lose everything.  The 6 per cent. profit that other persons might be content with would scarcely induce people to put money into an enterprise of that nature.</P>
      <P>The same applies even in times of peace.  One type of enterprise is speculative.  There may be the risk of a complete loss, and people will not take the risk of a complete loss unless there is also the chance of a big profit. There is another type of enterprise which is of a different character.  Flour milling, for instance, has gone on for the last 2,000 years and it probably will go on for the next 2,000 years.  In such an industry there may be some revolutionary change in the type of machinery used, or some other internal development in the industry itself which may involve the loss of capital to the people engaged in it, but the risk there is very slight and, consequently, people will engage in an industry of that type for a moderate return.  In the case of an industry arising out of, let us say a new invention, however, which may turn out to be a complete flop, people will not take the risk unless there is a chance of making a big profit.  These things are well known to everybody, and surely they are known to the people opposite who claim to be experts in these matters, although it is not easy to see how they justify their claim to be experts.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The sole reason why this tax is put on is because the State <Col N="955" /> must be financed in order to carry on the services of the State.  Deputies opposite are in favour of the principle of taxation in general, but when it comes to any particular tax they oppose it with all the force they can. Taxes have to be imposed in order to carry on the State and somebody must take responsibility for the raising of these taxes in order to finance State services and to make possible the achievement of measures for which the Party opposite voted and which they very frequently demand.  Somebody must take the responsibility, and if you will not face the unpleasant task of putting burdens on the people, in order to carry on the essential services, we have got to do it.  When, however, it comes to a particular tax, you want to be in the position, in order to maintain your spurious popularity in the country, of being able to tell Tom, Dick and Harry throughout the country that you did not vote for this or the other particular tax and that, although you were in favour of taxation in general, you were certainly against that particular tax.</P>
      <P>That is simply moral cowardice, and it is a good job that there are people here to take the responsibility of imposing this heavy burden of taxation which is necessary in present circumstances. The sole reason for this tax is that it is the aim of the Government to put the burden on the shoulders of the people who are best able to bear it, on the shoulders of these corporations who are making profits, some of them in excess of those which they made in pre-war years.  It is on the shoulders of those who are more able to bear the weight that we are putting it.  We recognise, however, that it is a weight, and that it may reduce employment and seriously impair the finances of some firms, but we have got to impair somebody&rsquo;s finances, and it is better that we should take money from these people than to take it from the worker by taxation on his tea, sugar, or some other commodity which he must consume and which he can barely afford to pay for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one other thing to which I should like to refer before I finish. <Col N="956" /> This corporation profits tax has been spoken of as if it applied only to industrialists. The number of these firms that are engaged in industry is only a minority.  The majority of these firms are engaged in distribution, transportation, amusements or some other non-productive service, and many of these corporations are in the position that they will have to pay excess profits not because they engaged in profiteering but because of an appreciation in the value of stocks that they purchased before the war.  These stocks have appreciated in value, and because of that increase these corporations are able to earn higher profits now than they were earning before the war. Deputy Dillon pleaded here that such corporations should be allowed, not merely to earn these profits but to retain them so that, when the reverse process started and when, after the war, stock values began to fall and the stock held by these companies began to depreciate in value, they would have a little reserve to tide them over that period.  Deputy Dillon pleaded here for a modification of the methods of price control, which I had said I was bringing into force, so as to enable these companies to retain these profits. I refused to do it.</P>
    <P>We have limited the profits of these companies and of all other concerns where stocks were involved, taking into account the price at which the stocks were purchased, not the value which they represented at the time that the investigation of their affairs took place.  Deputies who want to use the occasion of the debate on this Resolution to attack Irish industrialists should bear in mind that this tax applies to many others apart from industrialists, whether they are the new industrialists whom Deputies Hughes, Bennett and Dillon declare to be all rogues and thieves, or the old respectable industrialists of whom Deputy Bennett approves, or whoever they may be.  Deputies should approach this matter seriously.  They should try to approach the economic problems out of which this Resolution arises, or which it will cause, in a serious manner, and not in the cheap-jack manner in which they have approached it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Some time might have been saved in this House if the Minister who has just advised us to take this tax seriously had made as serious a study of it as he has recommended us to do.  When he came in here to-day it was evident that he did not understand it himself, and he had to get information about it.  Yet this is the Minister who is supposed to take his work seriously and who advises us to do the same.  The very example that has been given is symptomatic of this whole business.  We are invited to consider an excess profit of £4,000. I must say that for the best part of a week it has puzzled me to know how the Minister got 75 per cent. of the excess profits in this case.  Of the £4,000 we, first of all, take off 10 per cent., which gives us £400.  We then take 50 per cent. of the £4,000, ignoring the fact that £400 has disappeared. We get then, on paper, £2,000.  It is obvious that there are only £1,600 left, and that, taxed at 7/6 in the £, gives £600&mdash;making up the £400, the £2,000 and the £600: that is, £3,000 out of £4,000 excess profits.  Now, you have £1,000 left in that case.  Let us take the example of a firm whose profits amount to £16,000 this year, and an average of £16,000 for the two previous years.  May we ask whether this £1,000 left is added to the £16,000 profit and that that £17,000 then stands for treatment, in the first place, as corporation profits?  If so, having deducted £1,000 excess profits, we have £16,000 left on which the 10 per cent. amounts to £1,600.</P>
      <P>Deducting the £1,600 from £16,000, we have £14,400, and taking 7/6 in the £ on that we get £5,400 which, along with the £1,600, leaves us £7,000 for the Minister off the £17,000, which leaves £10,000 net profit after payment of income-tax, corporation profits tax, and excess profits duty&mdash;£10,000.  I cannot stand over those figures because we have got no example except one in which there is a given figure of £4,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Taking again the £16,000 profit which last year was entitled to a reduction of £5,000 before excess profits were taken off, leaving £11,000 excessive: that, at <Col N="958" /> 7½ per cent. amounted to £825, and assessing then, £15,175 at 6/6 in the £ we get £4,981 17s. 6d., or a total charge in respect of corporation profits tax and income-tax last year of £5,806 17s. 6d.  The balance left in that case from the £16,000 was £10,193 2s. 6d. compared with the £10,000 to which I have just referred.</P>
    <P>I want to know where is the 25 per cent. which we were told was earmarked for a fall in the price of goods for the period after the war and so on. But we cannot leave that £10,193 2s. 6d. or the £10,000 quite alone because a new tax has come in providing for an extra charge on the £16,000.  In the first place, a deduction of only £1,000 is allowed, instead of £5,000, before we proceed to collect income-tax and we find that, in order to pay the extra corporation profits tax imposed in the previous Resolution, a sum of £405 12s. 6d. falls to be paid.  Whether it can be regarded as a liability in respect of the year in which the £16,000 was made or whether it must come off the £10,000, I do not know.  We have not been told that.  I will not answer exactly for an accountant&rsquo;s report on these figures, but so far as the House is concerned that is the information put to us.</P>
    <P>I am prepared to accept in its fullest implication a good deal of what the Minister for Supplies has just said with regard to the needs of industry, and the claim which industrialists have in respect of expanding business, to which reference has already been made, and to which Deputy McGilligan made reference last week.  No business could expand on that basis.  It could not be expected that any industrialist, however much he might be interested in his business or in his own profit, could see any hope of a development of industry on the basis of that form of taxation. Are we to regard this Budget as putting an end to the expansion of business? If industrialists are to go in for expansion, from now on they are faced with the fact that they must do it earning no more profits than they have earned up to this.  If we are to take as interpreting the Government&rsquo;s mind <Col N="959" /> the speech to which we have just listened, it is evident that industrialists must have profits, according to the interpretation of the Minister for Supplies, but how can they have profits under this form of taxation? Where are they to come from?</P>
    <P>In whatever way a business expands, one sees in this whole proposal a continuous and continuing taxation charge in respect of every penny made. Surely in the form in which it has been presented to us, with not a single example put to us by the Minister, who has just left, surely there is not sufficient explanation and defence put before the House for this proposal.</P>
    <P>I have covered, I suppose, a dozen sheets of paper trying to find out what this 75 per cent. charge represents. Does anybody in his senses claim that when you have taken 10 per cent. of £4,000, you are entitled to go on and take 50 per cent. off the £4,000?  It is not there.  We go through this huggermugger of a whole series of rules, regulations and postulations, the interpretation of which will keep accountants busy, and in respect of which they possibly can come to any interpretation they wish.  Is it desired that there should go before the courts for elucidation what we, in our laziness or stupidity, are unable to regulate here? Why not say simply and plainly, without any unnecessary verbiage, that 75 per cent. of any sum in excess of a statutory amount in a standard year, or series of standard years, will be taken as taxation, and leave it at that? What is the necessity for saying that 10 per cent. of it will be taken, that 50 per cent. of it will be taken, and that then we come down to 7/6 in the £ on it?</P>
    <P>Apart altogether from the question of the unfairness, the inequity of this tax on expanding business&mdash;presumably the greatest exponent in our time of expanding business is Mr. Henry Ford, and what hope was there of his giving employment to ten, 20 or 1,000 times the numbers he employed in his first year if he were faced with such a <Col N="960" /> proposals as this?&mdash;there is the case of those who, in the stress of the circumstances in which we are living, and faced with this emergency, considered the desirability of spending their reserves on setting up some other line of business, and of exporting and selling outside this country the goods they manufactured.  They are put in the same position as the people described as profiteers, as people charged with having taken too much money out of the pockets of the consumers.  Take the case of those people who spent their reserves in order to give employment, who kept people in employment who otherwise would have had to go on the road, and who not only did that but actually employed still more people.  There is a stop put to any possibility of their getting a fair return on the money they have invested in their business.  This Resolution says to them: &ldquo;You can go on with that species of industrial activity; you can give employment to a greater number of people; but, remember, the statutes of this State are going to ensure that you will not earn a sixpence in respect of it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Take the case of a firm which has, perhaps, been singularly fortunate in having laid in stocks and made an excess profit in the first year.  The following year instead of earning £16,000, the balance sheet shows a profit of only £8,000.  They will have the satisfaction of knowing that, in a time of stress in this State, when extravagance distinguishes every service in the State, the excess profits they made in a particular year are employed to bolster up that extravagance and that wanton waste, but that not a single 6d. is to go back from the coffers of the State to reimburse their shareholders. Possibly we shall be faced, by reason of that position, with more unemployment. The Minister&rsquo;s explanation of the possibility of further unemployment is: &ldquo;There must be industrial casualties&rdquo;; &ldquo;We have to hit certain people&rdquo; and so on.  That is not the frame of mind in which a responsible Minister should enter upon the consideration of a problem which is so important to such a large section of <Col N="961" /> the community as in this country is dependent upon industry.  This Resolution ought to be withdrawn.  There is nobody I know in this country who is unwilling to get for the State 75 per cent., or even more, of the profiteers&rsquo; gains.  It is another question as to the date from which that should be done.</P>
    <P>There is a natural and just objection to retrospective taxation.  Take the firm that in these times of difficulty has distributed all its profits to its shareholders and is now called upon to pay an extra £400.  Perhaps the £16,000 earned in those two years was far less than was earned in 1933-1934 and 1935, and it thought it was unfair when a time of difficulty came that the shareholders&rsquo; dividend should be reduced. Why not take a six years&rsquo; period as a basis and allow them the best two years out of the six?  Is there anything sacrosanct about the three-year period? If the impression is to go out, from the speeches made from the Government Benches and by Deputy Hickey, that there is no sympathy for industrialists or businessmen in this House, what possible enthusiasm can they have in connection with their business? That would not be a true interpretation of the feelings of this House.  It is not a line that the Dáil ought to take in connection with business; it is not a sound line or a business-like line.  It is a line which could not be defended in any place except in an assembly that is reeking with politics.</P>
    <P>The Minister who has just spoken said that we on this side are always endeavouring to do popular things.  If we had done popular things, the Minister would never have been on the Government Front Bench and nobody knows that better than himself.  We have no objection to taking any line, no matter how unpopular, if it is for the good of the country.  We are not satisfied that we are justified in asking the people for the sum of money involved in this Budget at the present time.  Apart from the businesses which benefited by reason of the increased value of their stock or the other firms which have managed to get an export business, is it conceivable that there has been an improvement in business since the war started?  Does not everybody <Col N="962" /> know that there is no truth in a statement of that sort?  Nevertheless, at this time, after the lean period which agriculture had from 1932 to 1938 and when we are just staggering out of the difficulties of that time, a Budget is now brought in under which it is proposed to take almost £35,000,000 from the people of the country.</P>
    <P>If we are to have regard to the Ministerial pronouncements, this is regarded as almost a pet tax.  In all decency it ought to be withdrawn, and put upon a more just basis.  Instead of the uneasiness which has been aroused by the effect of this tax on business and industry, greater confidence should be instilled into the minds of the public and into the minds of industrialists and business men.  In its present form, this tax is practically as heavy as the heaviest tax put on during the last war by the British Government. I think the excess profits tax at that time amounted to about 80 per cent.  But, if it did, provision was made, in the event of a reduction in profits, for a repayment out of the sums collected during the more prosperous period.  There is no prosperous period here, and the extraction of this huge sum, amounting almost to £1,500,000, from industry must press particularly heavy on certain businesses. They will be called upon, in the first place, to find the back money in respect of corporation profits tax and then, having either distributed their dividends or made other provision in connection with the moneys, we now come along to take this other sum of money.  There is no suggestion even that the payment of the tax might be spread over a certain period.</P>
    <P>It is significant that, in the case of the two big countries which are locked in a deadly conflict, those who are in charge of the affairs of those countries are most meticulous in seeing that the impositions upon industry and the taxation imposed are so distributed as to cause no disturbance to their industrial and business life.  I suggest that we should take a leaf out of their book in connection with this tax.  If we do not want to follow their example in regard to hostilities, we ought to learn from the almost paternal solicitude <Col N="963" /> they have shown for business and industry. The Minister would be very well advised to withdraw this Resolution and reconsider it; to do what is done in other countries before a tax such as this is imposed.  They should consult some of the persons concerned, to see what possible safeguards can be inserted so as to allow business and industry to go on their way unimpeded by this enormous and unjust taxation. They should make provision for giving consideration to those cases in which there is an expanding business and more employment given.  They should make provision for those cases in which new lines of business have been opened up and more employment given. That is not an unreasonable request. If the Minister would consider that, he might expect to get much more cooperation in dealing with the difficult time facing the country.</P>

      <P>I have not very much to say, but I should like to underline and emphasise what struck me when listening to the last speaker. Unfortunately, I did not hear the earlier speeches on the Resolution, but I should like to underline the hypocrisy and humbug of many speeches made from the front bench opposite on previous occasions during past years by Deputy McGilligan, Deputy Dillon, Deputy Mulcahy and others, who made the House ring with all kinds of charges against the Government and individual members of it, of pampering the profiteers and allowing them to loot the pockets of the poor.  These were the kind of phrases that were used over and over again.  The changes were rung on that day in and day out, night after night for years. Deputy Cosgrave, perhaps, was not so insistent as some of his colleagues, but occasionally he was equally emphatic that this Government allowed the country to be robbed by flour millers, bacon curers, and others.  Now, when we make an attempt to get some of these profits, the ill-gotten gains which they spoke of, we have a howl raised that we are hurting industry, that industry is not to be allowed to expand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave says that the industrialist <Col N="964" /> has no future in this country.  We have some Deputies howling with indignation because we are taking a portion of the excess profits, so called, while we have other Deputies who think that we are not going far enough in that direction.  That is Deputy Cosgrave&rsquo;s <i>forte.</i>  He is always indignant and always lecturing the other fellow.  The attitude he adopts is: &ldquo;Take example by me, remember what I did.  I set you a good headline. Be careful now, and don&rsquo;t do anything but what I tell you.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It should be agreed by the public in general, if it is not agreed by the Deputies opposite&mdash;I take it they do not agree&mdash;that if there is justice in taxation at any time, there is a measure of justice in taxing excess profits.  That is the basis of this tax. The Government does not want to injure industry.  During the nine years that this Government has been in office, it has done twice or three times more to build up industry and to create industrial development in the country than was done by the last Government in the same period.  We have given evidence of our paternal care for industrial development in the country.  That fact speaks for itself. On that basis, I think it must be evident to everybody that we are not going to condemn to death, if we can avoid it, the children of our own adoption. We have not mouthed sympathy for those people and then knifed them in the back.  We do not intend to do it.  Excess profits have been made&mdash; I admit, of course, on a certain basis, but you have to take some standard&mdash;and they are now going to be taxed.</P>
