      <P>Following are the terms: The fair wages clause now inserted in Government contracts reads as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The contractor shall pay rates of wages and observe hours of labour not less favourable than those commonly recognised by employers and trade societies (or, in the absence of such recognised wages and hours, those which in practice prevail amongst good employers) in the trade in the district where the work is carried out.  Where there are no such wages and hours recognised or prevailing in the district, <Col N="1415" /> those recognised or prevailing in the nearest district in which the general industrial circumstances are similar shall be adopted.  Further, the conditions of employment generally accepted in the district in the trade concerned shall be taken into account in considering how far the terms of this clause are being observed, and for this purpose regard shall also be had to the conditions of employment generally in the contracting firm.  The contractor shall be prohibited from transferring or assigning, directly or indirectly, to any person or persons whatever any portion of this contract without the written permission of the Department.  Sub-letting, other than that which may be customary in the trade concerned, shall be prohibited.  The contractor shall be responsible for the observance of this clause by the sub-contractor.</P>
    <P>No alterations have been made in the clause since 1927.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Supplies if he will state whether he <Col N="1418" /> has fixed a maximum price for white flour sold by retail and the price so fixed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy has already been informed, a standard price has been fixed by order for all flour produced in the country.  The manufacture of white flour is, however, prohibited.</P>
      <P>If the Deputy&rsquo;s question relates to flour which may be imported from outside, the reply is that I have not and do not propose to fix a maximum retail price for such flour.  My Department will, however, investigate complaints received regarding prices charged by retailers.  To date, investigations which have been completed have disclosed no undue profit to retailers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister contend that the price at which white flour is being sold does not disclose unreasonable profiteering on the part of somebody?  The flour is bought outside this country at a very low price, and is sold here at from £6 10s. to £7 10s. per sack of 240 lbs.  On what ground does the Minister contend there is no profiteering?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know what motive the Deputy had in raising this question.  As he has raised it, I propose to deal with it.  White flour imported here is coming at present solely from Northern Ireland.  Those who sell, those who buy, and those who import that flour are breaking the law that obtains in that area.  I do not know what cash value would be placed on the risk they take, but it seems clear that the fixing of a price which would prevent any profit accruing to the parties would merely prevent flour being imported.  The State has taken action which secures for every citizen a supply of flour at a fixed price.  If, as a result of the efforts of individuals, the supply of flour is increased, nobody suffers from that.  White flour must, in our circumstances, be regarded as a luxury, and the fact that white flour is imported for sale here at a price higher than that fixed for home-produced flour is doing nobody any harm.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hurley</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it there were a number of these men struck off unemployment assistance and unemployment benefit for not joining the Construction Corps.  Is the Minister aware that simultaneously with that 1,300 of these men were employed for turf-cutting at Donoughmore about 22 miles from Cork at 35/- a week, less 2/6 for transport?  Surely it cannot be contended that these men were shirking employment when they were so anxious to go out there to cut turf.</P>

      <P>FAIR WAGES: The contractor shall pay rates of wages and observe hours of labour not less favourable than those commonly recognised by employers and trade societies (or, in the absence of such recognised wages and hours, those which in practice prevail amongst good employers) in the trade in the district where the work is carried out.  Where there are no such wages and hours recognised or prevailing in the district, those recognised or prevailing in the nearest district in which the general industrial circumstances are similar shall be adopted.  Further, the conditions of employment generally accepted in the district in the trade concerned shall be taken into account in considering how far the terms of this clause are being observed, and for this purpose regard shall also be had to the conditions of employment generally in the contracting firm.  The contractor shall be prohibited from transferring or assigning, directly or indirectly, to any person or persons whatever, any portion of this contract, without the written permission of the Minister for Defence.  Sub-letting, other than that which may be customary in the trade concerned, shall be prohibited.  The contractor shall be responsible for the observance of this clause by the sub-contractor.</P>

    <P>That a sum, not exceeding £29,382, be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending the 31st day of March, 1942, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for Justice.  &mdash;(Minister for Justice).</P>

      <P>Deputy Moran, when dealing with this Estimate on the last day it was under consideration, referred to the case of a court messenger employed in the County Mayo to execute warrants, and said that, by reason of the distance he had to travel to execute a warrant, his travelling fees amounted to £5 on the execution of a warrant for £2.  The Deputy also mentioned quite casually that the court messenger collected a fee, or rather a bribe, of 5/- from the person upon whom the warrant was to be executed on condition that he made a return of <i>mulla bona</i> to the court.  If that is an ordinary or a usual happening in the County Mayo, or any other county, it represents a very serious state of affairs, and ought to bring to the notice of the Minister and of the Government the urgent need there is <Col N="1430" /> for a drastic reform in the manner in which these officers are appointed. Reference has been made to the fact that, as far as the ordinary citizens of this country are concerned, particularly those in the rural areas, law and order, the Government and the Constitution of this country are represented by the Gárda Síochána, but, in many rural areas, law and order, the Government, the Constitution, and this House are represented by the court messenger, and if he is an unjust, a dishonest or an unworthy official, then the entire State is thereby discredited. For that reason, I think it is the duty of the Minister to insist upon proper persons being appointed to execute the warrants and orders of our courts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last week I addressed a question to the Minister for Justice in connection with the appointment of a court messenger in the County Wicklow.  I asked by whom he had been appointed, and was informed by the Minister that this person, John Breheny, was appointed by the sub-sheriff or the under-sheriff with the approval of the Minister for Justice.  The facts of the matter are that the sub-sheriff has been in failing health for a considerable time, and that the entire business which this court messenger had to execute was taken completely out of his hands.  Therefore, the statement that the man&rsquo;s appointment was by the under-sheriff does not appear to be correct, particularly in view of the fact that he was in the service of the State in a number of other counties for the same purpose&mdash;namely, the collection of arrears of land annuities.  As appeared from the evidence given at his trial he had been employed in Cork, and, I think, in Waterford.  It would seem clear, therefore, that this man was appointed by the Minister.  That is the position as far as the people in the County Wicklow have been informed. Furthermore, the Minister stated that this man offered no sureties for the due and proper discharge of the duties of the position.  It seems an extraordinary thing that a man should be appointed to collect large sums of money and to fill such a responsible position, without being asked <Col N="1431" /> to offer sureties of some kind or another. If a decent, respectable citizen offers himself for employment as a breadvan driver, before he is even allowed to take out a load of bread, he has to put down a deposit and provide adequate security to safeguard his employer against fraud.  In this connection we are appointing a man under the authority of the State with power to collect sums of money running into thousands of pounds, and we do not ask or expect him to offer even 1/- by way of security.  That seems to me to be a reckless and altogether absurd method of employing an official to carry out such important duties.  As a result of the reckless manner in which this appointment was made, we had the position in which this man was brought to justice on the charge of defrauding the State to the extent of £240.  He was convicted, and sentenced to three years&rsquo; penal servitude.  That, in itself, is a very serious reflection upon the Minister&rsquo;s Department.</P>
    <P>The judge, in giving his decision in the case, stressed the fact that this man was appointed to administer justice, that he was collecting sums of money from very poor people who were unable to meet their demands, and for that reason it was a very serious crime to defraud such people.</P>
    <P>The gravity of this man&rsquo;s offence is not, in my view, as great as that of the Minister and his Department in making such an appointment in so reckless and irresponsible a manner. We all wish the State and the administration of the law to be held in the highest possible esteem and I am stressing this point in order to bring home to the Minister that it is absolutely necessary, in the future, to ensure that proper care will be taken in the making of those appointments. I have no wish to add anything to the blame which has been showered upon the head of this unfortunate individual. So far as the people of Wicklow are concerned, they cherish no ill-feelings towards him and they would entertain no resentment if the Minister were to mitigate his sentence in any way.  There is no ill-feeling against <Col N="1432" /> him but there is a strong feeling that the people should be protected against this type of lawless official.  I hope that, not only in this case but that in all cases where it is necessary to employ men, either in the Gárda or in any other branch of the Minister&rsquo;s Department, to discharge unpleasant duties, the appointments will be made by competitive examination and that the applicants will be subjected to all the tests to which the ordinary civil servant has to submit.  I hope that, in addition, he will be required to offer the necessary security to guard against his defrauding the State.</P>
    <P>The civil servants in this country, generally, have a high reputation. Whatever may be said about their efficiency or otherwise, they have, certainly, the reputation of being honest, fair and sincere in carrying out their duties.  It is altogether wrong that the regular civil servants should be discredited by the drafting into the employment of the State of irregular officials in a temporary capacity&mdash; persons who are employed mainly because of their want of principle or on account of their toughness, their lack of scruple or their lack of a sense of responsibility.  This has happened in connection with other persons incorporated in the Gárda in a temporary capacity.  These men discredited the force and had to be fired out in due course.  The Minister has been warned and the people expect him to accept the warning and to see that the standard of rectitude, honesty and responsibility in his whole Department is raised.</P>
    <P>So far as the regular members of the Gárda are concerned, they have reflected credit upon this State.  They were recruited at a time when it was rather difficult to recruit such a Force from a comparatively small population. Notwithstanding that, they have given great satisfaction and have been, to a great extent, responsible for the preservation of order and for the respect given by the people to the State and the institutions of the State.  In view of those facts, the Minister would be well advised to look carefully into the <Col N="1433" /> reasonable demands and requirements of the Gárda.  From many counties and towns, we hear serious complaints from members of the Gárda in regard to the housing accommodation with which they are provided.  It is true that a fairly generous rent-allowance is made to Gárdai but, unfortunately, in most provincial towns&mdash;I think this is true also of the city&mdash;the rents charged to members of the Gárda are so high that even this generous allowance of £30 a year is not sufficient to enable them to obtain decent accommodation.</P>
    <P>I think that it is time the Minister considered the inauguration of a housing scheme in the principal towns for the members of the Gárda.  He should consider the building of suitable houses for Gárdai who are married and living out of barracks.  He could, I think, provide housing accommodation for the Gárdai at a much cheaper rate than that represented by the amount provided in this Estimate and, in that way, he would save money to the State.  There is no doubt that members of the Gárda are being imposed upon by the owners of houses in our towns.  In addition, a proper housing scheme for Gárdai would make for efficiency inasmuch as the Minister could ensure that the houses were provided in whatever quarter of the town was most suitable for the discharge of official duty.  It would be desirable that all members of the force should be housed at a convenient distance from the Gárda station so that they would thereby be available if called upon for emergency or urgent duty. That, I think, is a reasonable suggestion which the Minister should consider. By so doing, he would save quite a considerable amount of money. I do not think that provision of suitable houses for the Gárdai would exceed in cost £500 per house.  Unless the State were to borrow that money from private financiers and pay a high rate of interest, repayment in respect of that house should not exceed £5 a year if the house were to last for 100 years.  Surely, that would be a very great saving of public money?</P>
    <P>Deputy Mulcahy suggested that some <Col N="1434" /> senior officers were unworthy to be members of the force.  I have no knowledge of these officers but I do know that senior officers are permitted to remain in the same division for too long a period.  In some cases, senior officers have been in charge of the same division since, practically, the inception of the force.  That is completely wrong, particularly having regard to the number of changes and transfers made in the case of ordinary members of the force.  I do not think that senior officers should be specially privileged by being allowed to remain in the same town, district or division for a prolonged period.  It does not make for efficiency.  There is another matter in regard to which I know there is considerable dissatisfaction. That is the length of time which elapses before subsistence allowances are paid to members of the force. Officers and men of the Gárda Síochána engaged in duty on behalf of the State, and incurring expenditure in the course of that duty, are men who have very limited means.  It is not right or proper that a period of two months, in some cases, should elapse before a subsistence allowance claimed is paid.  That is a matter to which the Minister should give his attention.</P>
    <P>Some time ago I asked a question in regard to a very widespread nuisance in this country, that is, the number of gipsies and vagrants of various kinds who are allowed to camp upon our roads, and particularly upon the byroads in our rural areas.  These people are inflicting a very serious hardship upon small holders and rural dwellers generally.  The Minister replied that he would obtain a report from the Gárdaí in connection with this type of nuisance.  I do not know whether he has completed his inquiries or not.  This is a matter in which the farming community generally and the rural population, and also the people in our small towns, are gravely concerned. It has been referred to on various occasions in connection with the spread of foot-and-mouth disease. No matter what action may be taken by the Gárda Síochána or by individuals or by officials of the Department <Col N="1435" /> of Agriculture, this type of people travelling from district to district with live stock of all kinds represents a serious danger.  That aspect has been stressed in other debates.</P>
    <P>There is also the fact that there has been serious trespass upon farmers&rsquo; land, including land under crops, and upon gardens.  There has also been a considerable number of petty larcencies of firewood and fences between fields, and other property.  The people concerned have to suffer this without any hope of redress.  For small offences the Gardaí are almost powerless to deal with this type of person.  They may summon them, and succeed in duly serving the summons, but usually when the court is held the defendants cannot be found, and hardly ever can be properly located.  Any person of this type who wishes to move from place to place and wishes to camp in one district one day and another the next day, should be compelled to take out a licence and be duly registered.  This does not imply any reflection whatever on this class of people.  Any citizens of this country who wish to camp out, or have no fixed residence&mdash;whether they call themselves tourists or tinkers&mdash;should be compelled to take out a licence. That is only proper and reasonable. The person who is residing on the roadside in one Gárda district to-day and in another to-morrow, cannot easily be brought to justice if he commits an offence.</P>
    <P>In such cases also the School Attendance Act is ignored.  Then they cannot be brought to justice either.  There is also considerable cruelty to animals, particularly to aged horses, and there is no proper means of redress.  I do not pretend to be a faddist or an enthusiast in connection with the protection of animals.  I would have sympathy with an ordinary working man or a farm labourer who might possibly lose his temper with an animal, or with a man who, through some temporary neglect on his part, may overlook an animal suffering pain.  However, there should be no sympathy whatever with the person who deliberately inflicts cruelty on aged animals. It is well known that if an old horse <Col N="1436" /> comes into the possession of these people he becomes a young horse within two or three days.  The animal may be bowed down by the weight of years, and hardly able to drag his legs along, but within two or three days the same animal will appear in a fair stepping along like a candidate for the Grand National.  How is that brought about? I can tell the Minister that it is brought about by cruelty.  The animals are terrified, and, for the moment, they lose a certain amount of the appearance of age.  That state of affairs should not be permitted, tolerated or winked at in this country.  For all these reasons I am suggesting that those people who enjoy this freedom from rates and rent&mdash;and, to a great extent, from detection when guilty of minor offences&mdash;should be registered or licensed, as the Minister may think fit.</P>
    <P>I have heard frequently that the salaries paid to members of the Gárda Síochána are not sufficient.  Although I have heard complaints, I think that, as far as the ordinary Gárda is concerned, there is not very much ground for complaint.  There is no doubt whatever that a member of the force who is blessed with a very large family finds it extremely difficult to make ends meet at the present time, particularly in view of the high rents and the general high cost of living, especially in our larger towns and cities.  In this connection I would like the Minister to consider the question of family allowances. The question has been before the public to a great extent, and as members of the police force are generally singled out for experiments, it might be no harm if the Minister would speak to the Minister for Finance in regard to this matter, and suggest that the experiment of family allowances should be tried on a small scale in connection with members of the force who have large families.</P>
    <P>There is another matter in regard to which I have also heard some complaints, that is, that the number of Civic Guards on night duty in our cities is not sufficient for the proper patrolling of those places.  I do not know how far that is true, but I do know that at present the system of patrolling towns and cities at night is <Col N="1437" /> absurd.  Anybody knows that to send men out in full uniform and on foot to patrol a certain confined beat in a town or city is not the best possible means of preventing or detecting crime. Two men in civilian clothes, equipped with ordinary push bicycles and given a large part of the city to patrol would be far more effective in the detection of crime.  A potential criminal, a housebreaker or other offender, would know exactly where uniformed members of the police are to be found.  If members of the police force were disguised as ordinary civilians the task of the potential criminal or law-breaker would be much more dangerous and difficult.  I know that in every town and city there is probably a number of men on duty in plain clothes, but I think that the number should be greatly increased.  As far as night duty is concerned, there is very little reason for having uniformed men on duty. What is required are men who will be really dangerous to the law-breaker. The same applies to a limited extent in regard to ordinary day duty.  I think a larger percentage of the force should be disguised as ordinary civilians when on duty.  The man who goes out to break the law does not dress himself in a showy uniform so that everybody, and particularly members of the Civic Guard, may know what his intentions are.  In the same way, there is no reason why members of our police force should make themselves obvious to the criminal.  I think also that there is too much foot work, too much walking up and down beats. It does not serve any useful purpose. A man who can cover a considerable amount of ground on a bicycle is usually much more efficient.  In connection with night duty, I think if any member of this House were to walk up and down one or two streets for eight hours he would find that by the fifth or sixth hour his efficiency would have declined very much.  He would be weary, fatigued, and foot sore.  Such conditions do not make for efficient police work.  If men were sent out in plain clothes, on cycling patrols and returned, say, once in two hours or once every hour for a smoke and refreshment, they would be much more efficient <Col N="1438" /> in the discharge of their duties and would be more dangerous to the offender or potential offender.</P>
    <P>I make these suggestions to the Minister in good faith and I wish to underline my original suggestion that in connection with the whole system of the appointment of court messengers he will look into the matter and see that the men appointed are of the highest possible character and give adequate surety for their good conduct.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I intervene to support the plea that Deputy Cogan has made in regard to some housing policy for members of the Gárda force.  This matter has been before the House on several occasions and I am sure the Minister is familiar with the need for doing something in that direction.  I am, therefore, relieved of the necessity for making a long statement in support of it.  Any of us living in certain parts of the country knows that this is not a question of rents so much as a question of getting any kind of suitable house.  Very often unsuitable houses have had to be rented or taken. This is responsible for a good deal of discontent and a considerable amount of ill health.  I think the Minister would do a very good service generally if he could give some indication that this matter was having more earnest and more favourable consideration at present, or that it will have in the near future, than it has received up to the present.</P>

      <P>I do not propose to keep the House as long as Deputy Cogan kept it.  In fact I would describe Deputy Cogan&rsquo;s speech as an epic, for the way in which he blew hot and cold at the same time.  Apart from some miscellaneous things to which he referred, he took up much of the time of the House with his observations on a certain act of embezzlement that took place in County Wicklow on the part of a court messenger. It would have been much better if he had left it as it was because I understand this man has been already convicted. Deputy Cogan advanced the extraordinary philosophy that because <Col N="1439" /> this court messenger was proved to be dishonest, his employers were also dishonest. That is as much as to say that if a farmer employed a labourer who turned out to be dishonest, the farmer would also be dishonest.  I do not know the exact method of appointing court messengers but I do not think it is the Minister who appoints.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kissane</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure if it were the Minister who made these appointments they would be made with scrupulous care.  I think it was very unjust to attribute anything like that to the Minister, especially when the Minister was not responsible.</P>
      <P>I should like to draw the attention of the Minister to the question of the use of the Irish language in the courts. I am very much afraid that adequate machinery has not been provided for the conduct of cases in the courts through the medium of the Irish language. After all, we must look upon the courts in this country as very important tribunals, and each one of us who is interested in the Irish language would like to see it getting more prominence in the courts than it is getting at present.  In fact, I was present in court myself not long ago when certain litigants came along and wanted to have their case conducted through the medium of Irish.  It happened there was no interpreter in the court.  I was called upon to act as interpreter, which I did, but I must say that, even though I spent the whole day there, I got no payment for it.  Of course, it might be regarded as a labour of love on my part, but I find that in many of these cases the love is all on my own side. In any case, I would suggest that this whole question of the use of the Irish language in our courts should be looked into, and that we should make sure in all cases where people are anxious to have their cases conducted through the medium of the Irish language that an interpreter would be provided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like also to refer to the position of Gárdaí in the Gaeltacht. <Col N="1440" /> It has been said that because certain members of the Gárda are proficient in the use of the Irish language, they are delegated to isolated and backward places in the country where they are deprived of, or lose touch with, a good many of the amenities of life.  That is a matter of opinion or a matter of taste but, in any case, if there is any disparity between the treatment of ordinary members of the Gárda and those who have to spend their time in the Gaeltacht, a good way out would be to give some concessions to those who are obliged to stay in the Gaeltacht. After all, people in many walks of life get concessions because of their knowledge of the Irish language.  The district justices, for instance, have been given a concession.  In the Courts of Justice Act, 1936, there is provision for the extension of the time of service of district justices who happen to be officiating in an Irish-speaking district. That is as it should be, and I look upon that as a very good provision.  I would suggest at the same time that Gárdaí who are serving in the Gaeltacht should also be given some concessions. I could not define exactly what these concessions might be, and perhaps they are already getting some concessions.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to the housing of members of the Gárda Síochána.  In my travels I have not heard of many complaints in that regard. The only complaint I have heard &mdash;and I have heard one recently&mdash;is that sometimes married Guards are transferred from one town to another, in which latter town there is no house at all to be found for such Guards.  If there is one thing more than another on which it is necessary to satisfy members of the Gárda Síochána, it should be to satisfy married members of the forces as regards housing accommodation. No proposal should be put forward for the transfer of a member of the Gárda from one town to another unless an assurance is forthcoming that the Gárda transferred will be able to get housing accommodation in the town to which he is going.</P>
    <P>I should like if steps were taken to prevent children playing in the streets of our cities and towns because I regard such children as a positive menace <Col N="1441" /> not alone to themselves, but to the travelling public.  I do not think that the Gárda have any definite power to interfere with those children or, if they have that power, it does not seem to be availed of.  In saying that, I do not want to cast any reflections on members of the Gárda Síochána because I know very well that they are performing their duties very faithfully and efficiently.  I mention the matter merely because like many others who have had to drive motor cars through public thoroughfares, I have noticed the great menace these children are, principally to themselves, and also, as I have said, to the travelling community.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to the School Attendance Act, and, if I do not mistake, I think it was Deputy Cogan who said that the Act has not been enforced sufficiently rigidly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>In connection with vagrants&mdash;tinkers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonKissane" hpid="Mr. Kissane Mr. Kissane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kissane</NameTxt>
      <P>My experience of the School Attendance Act is that it has been enforced too rigidly in many cases.  I came across a case recently where a child was kept at home for three days.  That was necessitated by certain family circumstances, but still the School Attendance Act was resorted to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally, I should like to say that it seems to be a great omission that stenographers are not provided for District Courts.  Anyone who has had experience of long-drawn out cases in which there are a great many pieces of evidence to be taken into consideration knows that it is very hard to rely upon people&rsquo;s memories for the facts in these cases.  It behoves the district justice to sit down himself to take a note of all the evidence.  The district justice may not be a stenographer himself, or there may not be anybody in court who would be able to take a note of the evidence in that way.  That results in a great prolongation of the sittings of the courts.  Of course, I realise that the employment of stenographers would necessitate some extra <Col N="1442" /> expenditure, but, perhaps, such expenditure would be justified.</P>
    <P>I should like to say in conclusion that those of us who had experience of the formation of the Local Security Force should not let this Estimate pass without paying tribute to members of the Gárda Síochána who lent their services in that connection.  I have never seen more fidelity to duty than has been displayed by the members of the Gárda Síochána who went out to organise that force.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Much has been said about the Guards, and I wish to join in the compliments that have been paid to them.  In Dublin they certainly have won the confidence of the people, and are now looked upon as friends.  The Minister no doubt feels, or should feel, very proud of that achievement&mdash;that the Guards are now looked upon as friends of the people. I wish to support the request to the Minister that something further should be done in connection with their housing or their rent allowance.  I am aware that the allowance is most inadequate to pay the rent of a house in the City of Dublin.  In one or two places of which I am aware the allowance pays only for a couple of rooms. Something ought to be done in that direction, either by increasing their rent allowance or providing them with houses at a fixed rent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will not detain the House much further, except to ask the Minister if he would investigate a case which has come under my notice, where the person concerned appears to feel that he has suffered a very grave injustice. I refer to the case of Michael Joseph Clifford, formerly Guard 65A, now living at 9 Donore Road, South Circular Road, who was called upon to resign from the Guards on 7th December, 1938.  He writes very long statements to Members of the House.  On reading through those statements and interviewing the man, one certainly gets the impression that Guard Clifford is entitled to another hearing.  I understand he had long service.  He arrested some person for drunken and disorderly conduct, and that person <Col N="1443" /> was convicted.  He said that from that moment onwards there was ill-feeling, and that an injustice was done to him. I have hundreds of papers at home concerning the case.  I am not suggesting that the Minister or this man&rsquo;s superior officers have not gone into the case already, but I should like to have the matter further investigated. This man has been unable to get employment of any kind, and I think the Minister should go into the matter again to see whether anything can be done to remove the impression that something has been done to him which should not have been done.  I do not wish the Minister to give me a reply now, as his decision might prejudice the further hearing of the man&rsquo;s case. Again, I wish to join in the compliments which have been paid to the Guards.  I should also like to refer to the condition of some of the courthouses in various parts of the country. The Dublin newspapers tell us that some of our courthouses are unheated, badly lighted, and have damaged roofs. In one case the Justice had to change the bench from one part of the court to another.</P>

      <P>I hold as high an opinion of the Gárda Síochána as any previous speaker, and I appreciate the work which they have done in connection with the organisation of the Local Defence Force and Local Security Force.  Were we living in normal times I might be inclined to support the appeal made by some previous speakers for increased housing allowances. I think it was Deputy Cogan who mentioned the matter first.  That strikes me as extraordinary, coming from Deputy Cogan, who poses as an economist in this House&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Meaney</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and who knows the conditions which prevail in the <Col N="1444" /> country.  At the present time, no decent house could be built at a cost of less than £600.  I think that, viewed from the standpoint of the rest of the community, the Gárda are being fairly treated as regards housing, and housing allowances.  I say that while realising that it is probably imprudent, if you wish, because I like to say what I think is right.  To my mind, it would be far more to the point if the Minister considered making some provision for the members of the Local Security Force who are assisting the Gárda at present, and some of whom, perhaps, live in very poor houses, but who are not in receipt of any housing allowance from the State or anywhere else.  They have to go out doing night duty, and when incidents happen here and there through the country they are very often called on to strengthen the Gárda force in the carrying out of certain essential duties.  If we are to consider the question of increased allowances in any shape or form, I think those unpaid men should get first consideration.  Speaking on behalf of those men, I think they do not expect anything from the State.  What is good enough for them surely ought to be good enough for the ordinarily paid men, at least until this emergency passes.  I say that while at the same time having the fullest appreciation of the efficiency of the Gárda force.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a few other points to which I am anxious to direct the Minister&rsquo;s attention.  The first is in connection with breaches of orders made by the Minister for Agriculture in regard to outbreaks of foot-and-mouth disease. The detection of breaches of those orders is left, of course, to the Gárda Síochána and the Local Security Force. It is fairly common knowledge through the country that a certain type of gentleman has time and again evaded those regulations by various means.  I am not alluding now to the decent cattle trader, but to a certain type of trader who has grazing on the 11 months&rsquo; system in different districts throughout the country, and who, by the use of unfrequented by-ways and pathways at the dead of night, has committed breaches of those orders <Col N="1445" /> without being detected by the Gárda Síochána or the Local Security Force. I would advise the Minister to request the Gárda Síochána to keep a close eye on those individuals, and to run no risks.  I advise the Minister to think seriously of applying to persons of this type the full effect of some of the Emergency Powers Orders, and interning them until this wave of foot-and-mouth disease has passed away.  I need not remind you, Sir, of the serious repercussions which this dreaded disease has in our midst.  Thousands of cattle have already been slaughtered, and thousands of pounds worth of damage done.</P>

      <P>I do not propose to criticise them in any way other than in respect of the reason they give for not holding court fortnightly, that is, the shortage of petrol or the small allowance of petrol allowed them.  To my mind, as an ordinary citizen, that is giving a pretty bad example.  Every citizen has to put up with certain inconveniences during this time of emergency, and I think these inconveniences should be cheerfully borne by all sections, and more particularly by those engaged in the public service, either as legislators or administrators.</P>
      <P>There has also been much public comment on what appeared to be the rather light punishments of people convicted of breaches of the Compulsory Tillage Order in certain areas. That comment, of course, is due to the fact that the people realise that we now have to depend on our own resources, if we are to exist until this crisis passes.  I do not know whether or not the Minister can do anything to rectify these matters, or whether I am treading on dangerous ground or not&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like also to refer to the position in regard to housing accommodation for the Gárda. Repeatedly, year after year, on the debate on this Estimate, I have raised this question of housing accommodation for the Gárda.  We all know that the Gárda are housed under disgraceful conditions in the various towns, and that some indeed have not houses at all.  They are paying ridiculous amounts, and, in some cases, fabulous amounts, for two or three rooms, and I think that the Minister will agree that that is bad from the point of view of administration, and bad also because the people generally cannot have the desired respect for the Gárda when they are housed under the conditions under which they are housed at present. Were it not for the fact that local authorities have placed numbers of their houses through the country at the disposal of the Gárda, the Gárda would be in a very bad way.  Deputy Meaney seems to labour under a misapprehension in regard to this whole matter.  I have been in the House during the whole of the debate, and nobody suggested that there should be any increase in the rent allowance.  So far as I know, the rent allowance is pretty adequate to meet the situation if houses were available.  I have suggested to the Minister, to his predecessor and to that Minister&rsquo;s immediate predecessor that the Government should build the houses in each of the large towns, so that accommodation would be available for members of the Gárda, <Col N="1448" /> and especially married Gárdaí, transferred from one town to another. I remember putting before the Minister a detailed scheme for the building of houses in certain areas, and I think it could be shown then that the amount of money given by the authorities as rent allowance would be sufficient to pay interest and sinking fund on a scheme of decent houses.  In any part of Ireland you will get a house sufficient to accommodate a Guard and his family for about £400 or £500.  As far as I know, the allowance is about £30 a year, which would represent an amount sufficient to meet the interest and sinking fund needed for the building of such a house.  The only way to give contentment to the mind of a Gárda in such a case is to assure him that he will have proper housing facilities in the place to which he is being transferred.  The first thing that he has to find out, when he is being transferred from one place to another, is what housing facilities are going to be afforded to him.  He has been sufficiently lucky to find a house in the town in which he now is, and naturally he is resentful at being transferred to a town in which there is no housing at all provided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Cogan referred to the delay in the payment of subsistence allowances, and I have also heard complaints in that connection.  I have heard of some cases where Guards were sent out of certain districts to other districts during the last election, and where subsistence allowances, which should have been paid, to my mind, immediately after the election, were not paid until six months later. I think that is very unfair, because, apart from the mere subsistence allowance, the Guard in such a case has certain out-of-pocket expenses to meet. I cannot understand why there should be any delay in the payment of allowances of that kind.  Deputy Meaney said that, in his opinion, the Guards were very well off.  I do not agree with that at all.  Some years ago the Guards had a cut in their wages, and that was never restored, notwithstanding the fact that the cost of living has risen enormously.  The Guards are expected to keep up a certain standard of living, and I do not know how they can be <Col N="1449" /> expected to do so under present circumstances. Other people in Government services had an increase in their salaries, based on the increase in the cost of living.  I know that that has now been standardised, but there was some increase, whereas the Guards have not got any increase.  I know, and I am sure every Deputy and every member of the Government knows, that a Guard is put to the pin of his collar to live at the present moment on the salary that he is in receipt of, and I suppose that the standstill order, which the Government are endeavouring to put into operation, will now operate against the Guards even further.  I think that that is very unfair, because almost every other, if not every other, public servant has got the benefit of the war bonus.  Before concluding, I should like to refer again to the question of housing for the Guards, with a view to urging the Minister to go into this matter.  When the present Minister for Local Government was Minister for Justice, he promised me that he would go into the matter.  A detailed scheme was submitted to him which, he said, he would examine.  He also said that he thought the scheme was feasible, but nothing has been done since, and the Guards all over the country are in a wretched state so far as housing is concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. Everett Mr. Everett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Cogan addressed a question last week to the Minister in reference to the appointment of a court messenger in County Wicklow.  The reply of the Minister was that the appointment was made by the under-sheriff for the county.  I think the facts are that the names are submitted to the Minister&rsquo;s Department and that the sheriff or under-sheriff has no authority other than to sign for the appointment.  However, that was an unfortunate thing that happened, and I agree that the less said about it the better at the present time.  I think we can congratulate ourselves that that kind of thing is a very rare occurrence in connection with any official appointed by the State, and being such a rare occurrence we cannot view it with undue alarm.  It is just one of these unfortunate things that may happen <Col N="1450" /> during any period, and that may be done by any individual.</P>
      <P>I want to say, in connection with the housing problem, that it is more serious in the rural areas than in the urban areas, so far as the Guards are concerned.  I am not advocating an increased housing allowance or an increase in salary for the Guards, but I have a suggestion to make in that connection. Public bodies are engaged at the present time on large-scale building schemes in villages and towns, and in many of these villages we find that, where building schemes are in operation, the Guards cannot be provided with housing accommodation until the local people have been provided for. I am certain that the board of health or the engineers of the board of health could provide housing for the accommodation of the Guards at less cost, where these other schemes are being undertaken.  At the present moment you cannot provide a Guard with a house in most of these villages because there would be so much trouble from the local people.  I know of many cases where it would not be necessary to wait for any large building scheme and where, with the co-operation of the engineers of the Board of Works, a solution would be found in a very short time, in the way of providing say, four-roomed houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to delay the House. I only wish to say that I am delighted to see Deputies congratulating the Guards now.  It is good to see congratulations coming from all sides of the House.  At one time, the Guards were not very popular, but times have changed.  The only thing that I would like to criticise is that the time of the Guards is very much occupied now in connection with office work.  They have work in connection with the Local Security Force, the Local Defence Force, school attendance, and all kinds of rules and regulations in relation to agriculture, and so on, with the result that a great deal of their time is spent in office work in barracks, and not in the ordinary patrol work that one would expect of a Guard.  I think it is necessary to bring that matter to the attention of the Minister, because it is essential that the <Col N="1451" /> Guards should be on duty in the streets, in the ordinary course of their duty, instead of having all their time taken up by office work for which they were never intended.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesVictory" hpid="Mr. Victory Mr. Victory">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Victory</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a few remarks which I should like to make, and one is that, like other Deputies, I should like to pay a tribute to the Guards in general.  While paying that tribute I should also like to take the opportunity of paying a tribute to the Local Defence Force and the Local Security Force for the work they have been doing in helping the Guards. From the national point of view, too much praise could not be given to them.  There is one matter to which I should like to direct some criticism. I want to know whether the Legislature is to be dictated to by the judiciary, or whether the Legislature should not tell the judiciary what their duties are.  Some of the justices have refused to hold court, and where a position of that kind arises I think we should meet any challenge of that kind. Some of the justices have said that unless the courts in which they sit are put into a certain amount of repair they will refuse to hold court in future.  Are these justices entitled to sit down and say: &ldquo;We will not hold court,&rdquo; or that they will not enforce the Acts passed by this House?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another thing about which people in the country are grumbling&mdash;and rightly so, I think&mdash;is in connection with the scale of costs of court procedure, and it is thought that the Legislature should take steps to deal with that matter.  As things are at the moment, it means that, very often, a poor person cannot get justice because the scale of costs in connection with court procedure is prohibitive.  The sooner the House considers that matter and deals with it, the more interest the people of this country will take in it.  It is a matter that is long overdue.  As I have said already, we should not take dictation from these people, such as the district justices, who are there to enforce the laws passed by this House, and the sooner these people are forced to do their duty the better it will be for this <Col N="1452" /> House and for the country as a whole.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinMNally" hpid="Mr. Nally Mr. Nally">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nally</NameTxt>
      <P>A matter to which I should like to refer is the question of the payment of jurors.  We all know the disabilities that they have to suffer from at the present time.  Some of them have to travel 50 or 60 miles to the Circuit Court or the High Court, and I understand that even a person whose valuation is under £10 may have to serve as a juror if called upon to do so.  I do not know the position so far as the sheriff is concerned, but I know that he sends out a notice to people to serve on a jury on a certain day, and &ldquo;fail not at their peril,&rdquo; and so on. I am aware of cases in County Mayo where people have to travel 50 or 60 miles in order to attend the court. Those people should be allowed travelling expenses and a subsistence allowance. All the officials connected with the courts are very highly paid.  The judges are highly paid; the State solicitors get £1,500 or £1,600 a year; the registrars are highly paid, and so far as solicitors and counsel are concerned we know they are also well paid.</P>
      <P>I do not see why an unfortunate juror should be obliged to travel 50 or 60 miles and remain in the town where the court is held for two or three days without being made some allowance. Many of them probably have not a penny to spare, and some of them may have had to go round amongst their neighbours in order to get enough to cover the travelling expenses.  We are aware of what happened in Cork when a juryman was brought before the judge for being late.  He informed the judge that it was impossible for him to attend earlier, as he had spent the night in the workhouse, and the authorities there would not permit him to leave until he had broken a heap of stones in order to pay for his night&rsquo;s lodging.  I suggest that the Minister should give serious consideration to this matter, because the opinion is fairly widespread that jurors should be given travelling expenses and subsistence allowances, more especially when they have to travel long distances to the court.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to impress upon the Minister the advisability <Col N="1453" /> of taking practical steps to put into operation the suggestions submitted by Deputy Corish with regard to housing accommodation for the Guards over the country generally.  I do not know if the Minister is aware of the shocking conditions that exist, more especially in rural districts, in connection with housing accommodation for married members of the Force.  Perhaps the conditions are not quite so bad in the towns, but, speaking of towns, I should like to remind the Minister that there is such a place as the town of Roscommon, where the people still find his name on the ballot paper.  In spite of anything I can do, they still vote for the Minister for Justice.</P>
      <P>I think I can say, without much fear of contradiction, that the worst barracks to be found in Ireland is in the town of Roscommon.  As a matter of fact, if it were proposed to set the building for the purpose of accommodating people, I believe the County Medical Officer of Health and the County Engineer would immediately raise an objection, and the building would definitely be condemned as unfit for human habitation.  I think the Minister is aware of that, because I have drawn his attention to this matter for several years.  The Guards there were of the opinion, as soon as one of the elected representatives for the county was made Minister for Justice, that they were all right, and that proper accommodation would be given to them in a very short time.  Years have passed, and nothing has been done.  There have been investigations carried out by the Board of Works, but I expect it will mean the passage of umpteen years before anything practical is done.  Last year there was a further investigation. The premises were inspected, but nothing happened.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One would actually have to see the place to get a proper realisation of its structural condition.  It was an old jail of sorts, and you have to go down three steps to reach the ground floor.  I spent some nights in a cell there in the British days, and I can quite truthfully say that it is a shocking place.  Yet that is where the Guards in Roscommon <Col N="1454" /> are housed.  I hope the Minister will use his influence to stir up the Board of Works and get them to provide suitable accommodation for the Guards in Roscommon, where the people think so much of him.</P>

      <P>Perhaps it would be better for me to deal first of all with what has been mentioned by Deputy Brennan.  I knew quite well that Deputy Brennan was going to raise this question.  I have been making strong representations to have an improvement made in the accommodation there for the Guards.  Perhaps I should not press any more for Roscommon than for any other part of the country, but the fact of the matter is that I have given the whole thing very earnest consideration. I am perfectly well aware of the conditions that exist.  I am sorry the alternative accommodation that was inspected was not considered suitable, even from the point of view of reconstruction.  I am aware that a considerable sum is going to be expended in order to make the present barracks habitable.</P>

It must also be remembered that there are other officials in the country who need to be housed as well as the Guards.  If I take up the question of housing accommodation, the heads of other Departments will say that they, too, have officials down the country who need houses.</P>

      <P>We could do so, if it were considered necessary, but I do not think that this is the time to discuss such a matter.  So far as I understand the procedure on an Estimate, we may not discuss any change in the legislation. Deputy Meaney spoke about certain breaches of the regulations made by the Minister for Agriculture with regard to the movement of cattle.  It is really hard to watch people who carry on such activities during the <Col N="1456" /> night hours.  I am aware that some of those people have been caught moving cattle along unfrequented routes, but it is really impossible to watch everybody. No doubt there are some cases that cannot be detected, but I think that, with the aid of the Local Security Force, there has been pretty good supervision.  Every effort is being made to stop such movements of cattle and I know that the Guards are doing their very best in that direction.</P>
      <P>I do not think that many courts have been held up because of the restriction of petrol supplies.  I know that some justices did complain&mdash;most unwisely for themselves.  In times like these we all must put up with some little inconveniences. Several justices said that they would not hold courts if they could not get supplies of petrol to run their cars.  They did not do much good by remarks of that kind.  I think they should be prepared to carry on like other people and not say that they will not do this or that.  I hope the references that have been made in the course of the debate here will bring some of them to their senses.</P>

      <P>As to the delay in paying subsistence allowance, we are going into that question.  Such delay should not occur.  There was a complaint that adequate machinery was not provided to deal with the Irish language in some courts.  In most courts where Irish is expected to be used there are official interpreters.  I understand that a fee was not asked for when the Deputy acted as interpreter.  Perhaps if he applied he would have got a fee.  If he did not look for it nobody was going to offer it.  When it is expected that cases will be heard in Irish adequate provision is made.  I do not think anything further can be done.  Regarding the position of the Gárdaí in the Gaeltacht, there is an allowance of 7½ per cent. extra salary for any Guard who lives in the Gaeltacht.  I think that is pretty generous.  Deputy Kissane referred to the position created by children playing on the streets.  I do not know what would become of the children in Dublin if they could not play in the streets.  Even where there are parks they will not go to play in them.  Perhaps the reason is that the mothers like to keep an eye on them. I hope the police will not be any stricter than they have been.  So far as I am concerned I like to see the children playing but I would not like to have them hurt.  It is a pity we could not get some streets closed for playing purposes during certain hours of the day.  That would be a good thing if it could be managed.  It may have to be done yet.  Deputy Cogan and Deputy Everett referred to the case of a court messenger who got into trouble and who was nominally appointed by a county registrar.  I was not trying to evade responsibility in that case.  The man had a good record and was in the service for years.  Unfortunately the appointment was not a good one.  It must be said, however, that in many ways he handled large sums of money and it was too bad that he fell.  Other people have done the same thing.  No matter what salaries are paid people will get into that position.</P>

      <P>That is never done.  The <Col N="1458" /> State has to bear the loss.  It is as well not to ask the sureties to do so. There is no question of people who paid not getting the benefits of their payments.  Deputy Mulcahy raised a matter of considerable importance to the Guards generally.  With other Deputies he paid a tribute to the good work the Guards are doing.  The Deputy mentioned one thing which is, unfortunately, true&mdash;that there are amongst the senior officers some who are unfit for their position.  There is no doubt about that.  When that is so the position is a very serious one for the Guards under them, for the general public, and, as Deputy Mulcahy said, for the L.S.F. and the L.D.F. The Deputy discussed the matter with me before he raised it, and I want to assure him that it is being attended to.  It will be necessary to bring in two Orders, one of which must be passed by both Houses, and the other will be laid on the Table so that there will be adequate opportunity for discussion. I assure the House that the matter, which is a very serious one, will be attended to immediately.  In raising it I consider that Deputy Mulcahy made a very useful contribution concerning the safety and security of the State generally, because if I had to do it from this side of the House and did not get co-operation it might be said that motives other than the position of the Guards were operating. When the Deputy was good enough to mention it to me, it was apparent that that view had general application in the House and would do a great deal of good to the Guards.  I hope that many will not have to be dealt with, and that when a few are dealt with it will bring home to the rest that they must realise their responsibilities to the full and do what is expected from them in their office.  Deputy Moran advocated new legislation on some matters that I could not deal with now.  There may be other ways of doing so.  I dare say there is room for improvement in the Courts of Justice Act, but that could scarcely be dealt with on this Estimate.</P>

      <P>A question was raised on several occasions concerning the attendance of Guards when dealing with cases arising out of motor car collisions. I wish to stress the importance of the evidence of Guards in these cases.  It appears that there has been some new rule made by the Gárda authorities under which Guards will not attend or bring statements that they had taken from witnesses when investigating collisions, unless an order of the court is obtained.  I wonder if the Minister would look into it to see if the rule could not be relaxed so as to permit Guards to attend, without the direction of the court, with statements made by witnesses.  In the next place, the actual statements will not now be produced in court unless an order has been previously obtained from the judge or the court.  This latter order merely adds additional expense to the parties.  They have to apply <i>ex parte</i> to the judge to issue a subpoena <i>duces tecum</i> and to produce the statements. While that is for the benefit of junior members of my profession, to which I have no objection, I think it might be dispensed with if the Guards attended and brought these statements without the direction of the court, and produced them in evidence, if directed by the judge.  There is something to be said for these statements not being produced when criminal proceedings are pending, but accident cases generally are heard after the criminal proceedings have been disposed of.  There can be no objection to both parties seeing the statement.  It might often cause trouble, or might, possibly, lead to a miscarriage of justice, unless both parties to a suit were in possession of the statements.  Parties in an action very often make statements entirely different from those they make to the Guards.  Statements made to the Guards are always relied upon, because they are made after the occurrence, and it would be a useful check on parties who change their stories if both <Col N="1460" /> sides had access to the statements before the hearing.  If the Minister could see his way to dispense with the necessity for the issue of a subpoena <i>duces tecum</i> it would be an advantage.</P>
      <P>The Minister may remember that there was a prosecution about six weeks or two months ago arising out of the salvage of the s.s. Cetverti.  Senior Counsel was brought down from Dublin for that case, but owing to some misunderstanding the case was adjourned.  The acting Circuit Court judge recommended that the costs of that day should be paid by the State.  The parties were subsequently, on transfer to the Circuit Criminal Court, discharged&mdash;they were found not guilty of the charge preferred against them&mdash; and I think it would be rather an injustice that these men, who belonged to the State service, should have to bear the expense of that day.  The expense is very small, because, in the circumstances, the particular Counsel, who is one of the most eminent at the Bar, was acting for a comparatively small fee, and I ask the Minister to give the matter sympathetic consideration in the circumstances.</P>

      <P>The net Post Office expenditure for the year 1941-42 is estimated at £2,515,143.  This sum, which includes £41,964 in respect of staff loaned to other Government Departments, mainly for emergency services, and of balance of civil pay of officers absent on military service, represents a net increase of £27,708 on the provision for 1940-41.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The gross increase is approximately £53,300.  This is mainly made up of £12,000 increased cost of substitution of officers on loan or on military service and of additional staff, mostly for telephone operation; £14,000 in respect of increased wages and travelling expenses for engineering maintenance and of reduced relief from Telephone Capital; £8,000 in respect of increased prices of non-engineering stores; £9,000 increased provision for superannuation; £6,100 for additional equipment at civil aviation stations; £1,450 in respect <Col N="1466" /> of conveyance of mails by road; and £1,400 in respect of miscellaneous engineering expenses, etc.  There are offsetting reductions totalling £29,000, made up of £17,000 due to anticipated decreased purchases of engineering materials as a result of difficulties in obtaining supplies and the proposed use of reserve stocks; £1,000 reduction in engineering contract work; £3,300 reduced cost of conveyance of external mails; £2,700 reduced operating force at civil aviation stations.  There are also reductions in agency service and superannuation costs, etc.  These reductions, taken in conjunction with a lower credit of £3,300 for Appropriations-in-Aid, make the estimated net increase in expenditure £27,708.</P>
    <P>Before presenting the customary information regarding the Department&rsquo;s financial position as ascertained from the commercial accounts, I wish to refer briefly to the effects on Post Office revenue of the conditions which have developed as a result of the disturbed international situation.  In presenting the Estimates for 1940-41, in April of last year, I mentioned that, up to the end of the financial year 1939-40, which included seven months of the European War, so far from there having been any adverse effects, Post Office revenue had, as a whole, actually improved.  Although postal and telegraph earnings had decreased (by £16,300 and £4,500 respectively), the reductions were more than counterbalanced by improved receipts from telephones (approximately £42,000), leaving a net increase of revenue of £21,000 in 1939-40 as compared with 1938-39.  I expressed the hope at the time that this very satisfactory revenue position might be maintained during 1940-41, but it was not, of course, then possible to foresee the very marked change in the situation which has since developed, with its serious reactions upon trade and industry and resulting repercussions upon Post Office services. Actually, there has been quite a substantial drop in revenue during the past 12 months.  Complete figures are not yet available, but it is estimated that, as compared with 1939-40, the decrease will amount to about £82,000.  Postal earnings are down by about £124,000, <Col N="1467" /> the main causes being the cessation of the major activities of Irish Hospitals&rsquo; Trust; the falling off in cross-Channel correspondence by reason of business restrictions arising from supply and transport difficulties; the serious curtailment of the foreign mail services, etc.  As against the decline in postal earnings there was an increase of about £40,000 in telephone and of £2,000 in telegraph receipts, leaving a net decrease in revenue on the three services of, approximately, £82,000 for 1940-41.</P>
    <P>As to probable revenue in the current financial year, the position will, of course, be materially affected by the increases in postal and telephone charges recently announced by the Minister for Finance in his Budget statement.  Particulars of the increased charges are as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>1.  Inland Letters.&mdash;The rate for letters not exceeding 3 ounces will be increased from 2d. to 2½d., with ½d. for each additional ounce.</P>
    <P>2.  Inland Postcards.&mdash;Rate increased from 1d. to 1½d. (single), and from 2d. to 3d. (reply).</P>
    <P>3.  Foreign Letters.&mdash;Commowealth countries and United States of America: Minimum letter rate increased from 2d. to 2½d. for the first ounce, with 1½d. for each additional ounce.</P>
    <P>4.  Printed Papers.&mdash;Inland: Rate increased from ½d. per 2 ounces throughout to ½d. per ounce for the first 2 ounces, and ½d. for each 2 ounces beyond. Foreign: Rate increased from ½d. to 1d. per 2 ounces throughout.</P>
    <P>5.  Parcels (for delivery in Éire).&mdash;The new rates will be:&mdash;Not exceeding 2 lbs., 6d.; not exceeding 3 lbs., 8d.; not exceeding 5 lbs., 9d.; not exceeding 6 lbs., 11d.; not exceeding 8 lbs., 1/-; not exceeding 11 lbs., 1/1.  This means an increase of 1d. at each point on the scale except at the 2 lbs., 5 lbs. and 8 lbs. points.</P>
    <P>6.  Telephones.&mdash;An addition of 5 per cent. will be made to subscribers&rsquo; telephone accounts.  There will also be some slight increase in the charges for trunk calls made from call offices and <Col N="1468" /> from coin boxes on subscribers&rsquo; premises.</P>
    <P>The increased postal charges came into operation on the 1st June, 1941; the increases in charges for trunk calls from call offices and subscribers&rsquo; coin boxes will come into operation on 1st July, 1941; the percentage addition to telephone accounts from 1st October, 1941.</P>
    <P>The increased charges will, it is estimated, bring in additional revenue of approximately £238,000 in a full year.  In the current year the additional receipts are estimated at £190,000 making the total estimated revenue for 1941-42 £2,170,000.</P>
    <P>I may here explain that the revenue figures I have given represent actual cash receipts.  They are not to be confused with, nor are they comparable with, the revenue totals as shown in the commercial accounts.  The latter take into consideration various services rendered by the Post Office to other Government Departments which are not paid for in cash.</P>
    <P>The position of the three main services, postal, telegraphs and telephone, as indicated by the commercial accounts for the financial year 1939-40, the latest period for which these accounts are available, is as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Postal Services. &mdash; Revenue, £1,711,628; expenditure, £1,663,034; surplus, £48,594.</P>
    <P>Telegraph services. &mdash; Revenue, £179,975; expenditure, £321,537; deficit, £141,562.</P>
    <P>Telephone services. &mdash; Revenue, £597,422; expenditure, £516,903; surplus, £80,519.</P>
    <P>These figures indicate that the Postal and Telephone services taken together showed at the end of the year 1939-40 a surplus of £129,113, but that, counteracting this, there was a loss on the Telegraphs of £141,562.  Although the revenue from the three services had improved by approximately £13,700 as compared with 1938-39, expenditure had risen by approximately £77,500, due principally to the operation of a higher cost of living figure, to additional staff to meet growth of services, to the building up <Col N="1469" /> at increased prices of reserve stocks of general stores, watermarked paper and uniform clothing, etc.  The net result was that the surplus on the three services of £51,321 which existed at the end of 1938-39 had been converted at the end of 1939-40 into a deficit of £12,449.  Regrettable as this is, I am afraid that when the accounts for 1940-41 are available the deficit will be found to have increased, because, combined with the drop in revenue already referred to, there has been growing expenditure on all services.</P>
    <P>So far as the operation of the internal postal services during the past year is concerned, there is nothing of importance to report.  The services functioned as in normal times, apart from the decline in the quantity of traffic already referred to.  In the case of the external services, however, further material disimprovement has taken place.  The working schedules on the Dun Laoghaire-Holyhead service, the frequency of which had been reduced by half at an early stage of the hostilities, have been drastically altered, and the one service daily in each direction that now operates leaves Dun Laoghaire in the morning with outgoing mails and returns in the evening with incoming mails&mdash;the arrival being too late, however, to connect with the general night mails to the provinces.</P>
    <P>As a result of the change the second delivery in Dublin has been suspended, as its continuance would serve no useful purpose.  The Rosslare-Fishguard service works on only three nights a week and is now used for mail purposes only to a very limited extent.  These restrictions on the cross-Channel services have involved a further slowing down in the transmission of correspondence between the two countries, but they are, of course, the outcome of war exigencies in Great Britain and the situation is one which it is not within the power of my Department, in present circumstances, either to control or remedy.</P>
    <P>The enlargement of the scale of international hostilities has resulted in further disorganisation of the foreign mail services.  No direct sailing from Eire to foreign countries are now <Col N="1470" /> operative and mails for all places abroad must, in consequence, necessarily circulate via Great Britain for onward transmission by such routes as are available.  The times occupied in transit are, naturally, now very much in excess of those taken under normal conditions.  In ward foreign mails are also very seriously delayed, and there has been a marked reduction in the quantity of correspondence conveyed, both outwards and inwards.  Air mail outlets to the Near East, Egypt, India, Australia, etc., have been considerably curtailed, and there has also been further restriction of the foreign money order services due to exchange and communication difficulties.  The money order arrangements with the United States, Canada, Newfoundland, Cuba, South Africa, India, Australia and New Zealand are, however, still operative.</P>
    <P>The financial condition of the telegraph service is, unfortunately, becoming steadily worse.  The deficit of £129,737, which existed at the end of the year 1938-39, had grown at the end of 1939-40 to £141,562, an increase of £11,825, and there has since been no improvement in the position.  Although there was a small increase of about £2,000 in receipts in 1940-41, this was due to the rentals of additional private wires provided during the year.  Traffic continued to decline, the number of originating messages having dropped by about 60,000.  The decline in traffic was the result, in part, of disturbed business conditions, but mainly of the growing popularity of the telephone.  In relation to the increasing unprofitableness of the telegraphs, I think it well to say here that reduction of rates, which is frequently suggested, would prove no remedy.  There is ample proof of this in what happened in 1937, when the minimum charge for internal messages was reduced from 1/6 for 12 words to 1/- for nine words.  The revenue from the additional traffic which did, for a time, manifest itself was insufficient to cover the loss arising from the reduction of charge and the concession was responsible for a drop in telegraph earnings of, approximately, £9,500 a year.</P>
    <P>Telegraph communication by cable <Col N="1471" /> was provided during the year to the islands of Dursey and Whiddy, County Cork, and Inishfree, County Donegal. Post offices were, at the same time, opened on the islands.  The provision of wireless telegraphy service to 11 other islands has been delayed by difficulties in procuring certain important items of equipment.  The outstanding apparatus has, however, just come to hand and the work will now be proceeded with as expeditiously as possible.</P>
    <P>I am glad to be able to report a substantial development in the telephone service during the past year.  As already mentioned, revenue has grown by about £40,000.  While the growth has been mainly due to increased use by the Defence services, expansion has also taken place in ordinary public traffic.  Emergency conditions and the difficulties for industry and trade arising therefrom, which have adversely affected the other Departmental services, have tended to bring grist to the telephone mill.  The number of local calls in 1940 was 34,200,000&mdash;an increase of 878,000 over the number for the previous year.  The number of trunk calls was 4,247,000, an increase of 334,000.</P>
    <P>The total number of subscribers&rsquo; lines at the end of 1940 was 29,243, an increase of 446 on the figures at the end of the previous year.  The total number of telephones in use was 45,382, an increase of 1,120.  The number of automatic telephones in the Dublin and Dún Laoghaire areas is now 24,843, an increase of 1,795.  The growth in subscribers would have been even greater were it not for difficulties in providing service, a considerable amount of the time of the engineering staff having to be devoted during the year to communication needs arising out of emergency conditions.  Some very extensive construction work has been carried out throughout the country for the Department of Defence and the Gárda Síochána and, in the Dublin district, for the Air Raid Precautions services.  This diversion of engineering activities had, in many cases, the effect of materially delaying the provision of new lines for ordinary subscribers.  While the position in this <Col N="1472" /> connection has improved, it will be some time before the arrears of subscribers&rsquo; installations can be overtaken and, in the meantime, new applications may suffer some unavoidable delay. Every effort will, however, be made to keep the delay to a minimum.</P>
    <P>Thirty-six new exchanges and 17 new public call offices&mdash;including four street kiosks&mdash;were opened last year.  There are now 836 exchanges and 1,510 call offices, including 152 street kiosks.  The number of additional trunk and junction circuits provided was 118.  The number of high efficiency &ldquo;carrier&rdquo; circuits on the main trunk routes is now 62&mdash;an increase of ten during the year.  Telephone service was extended to the Belmullet Peninsula in July last and exchanges and call offices were opened at Belmullet, Blacksod and Bangor Erris.  There is now no extensive area of the country without telephone service.</P>
    <P>Work is in progress on the installation of a new central trunk exchange in Exchequer Street, Dublin, with equipment of the most up-to-date type. It is hoped that the new exchange will be completed and in service during the current year unless emergency conditions cause unavoidable delay.  It is the intention later to provide an additional exchange in St. Andrew Street, linked with Exchequer Street, and that, ultimately, the trunks shall be wholly removed from the Crown Alley Exchange, which will then function solely as an automatic exchange for local services.</P>
    <P>An extensive re-arrangement of circuits in the Dublin area between the various automatic exchanges was carried out during the year.  This re-arrangement provides an improved margin of safety for the Dublin service should a major disaster occur at any one of the automatic exchanges.  Subscribers connected to the Ballasbridge exchange are being transferred to the automatic system and the transfer is nearing completion.  The total number of subscribers affected is about 1,300. The extension of the experimental semi-automatic system in rural districts, which was contemplated, has had to be abandoned for the time <Col N="1473" /> being.  As the apparatus has to be obtained from outside the country, mainly from the U.S.A., it will not be possible to make further progress in the matter while the emergency lasts.</P>
    <P>In regard to the standard of telephone service now generally afforded to the public, the position is that while the internal service is, on the whole, reasonably good, there are times when it is unavoidably affected by conditions arising out of the emergency. I have already referred to the large increase in trunk traffic which has taken place and which, of course, tends to block up circuits, especially at the busy periods.  In addition, due to increasing business difficulties, the duration of calls has tended to become longer.  Further, urgent calls on Army, Gárda Síochána, and other emergency services must necessarily be given priority over ordinary public traffic.  All these factors from time to time involve the holding up of public calls in greater or lesser degree, and unfortunately the provision of additional circuits for relief purposes has in many cases had to be postponed by reason of the necessity for attention to the more urgent needs of the Defence services. I can assure the House that every effort is made by the Department to keep delay to a minimum, but it will be recognised that in present circumstances the situation is one which it is not possible wholly to rectify.  In Dublin the increasing local traffic occasionally causes congestion in the Crown Alley Exchange; any difficulties in this connection, particularly as regards calls to &ldquo;0,&rdquo;&ldquo;30&rdquo; and &ldquo;31,&rdquo; will however disappear when the new exchange in Exchequer Street is in operation.  The service in Dublin and in a large area to the north of Dublin was also materially affected for some weeks by a severe storm which occurred in January last, causing considerable damage to trunk and local plant.</P>
    <P>Telephone service between Éire and Great Britain has been very detrimentally affected by war conditions. The matter is one which is not, of course, within the control of this Administration.  The continental and overseas telephone services have been <Col N="1474" /> suspended since the outbreak of hostilities.</P>
    <P>Capital expenditure on telephones in 1940-41 amounted to £170,000 approximately. The programme for the coming year, if it proves possible to carry it out in full, will cost about £144,000, of which approximately £54,000 will be for automatics, mainly for the provision of the new automatic exchange at Exchequer Street, Dublin; £51,000 for additional subscribers&rsquo; and renters&rsquo; lines; £9,000 for additional high efficiency &ldquo;carrier&rdquo; circuits; £6,000 for new overhead trunks; and £7,000 on underground development, etc.  The extent to which this programme can be carried out in practice will, however, depend upon the scope of any further demands in connection with Defence communications that may be received, as well as upon the position in regard to supplies of engineering stores and materials.</P>
    <P>In regard to the problem of supplies, I may say that the greater part of the plant and apparatus used for engineering purposes is made outside Éire and that the reserves which had been accumulated during recent years have been seriously eaten into by the exceptional demands for Defence purposes during the past 12 months.</P>
    <P>The problem of replenishment has of late been proving more and more difficult and as, in addition, prices are seriously increasing, I have been compelled to decide upon a policy of rigid economy in regard to engineering stores consumption so as to ensure, as far as practicable, that materials necessary for the maintenance of essential services may at all times be available. Accordingly, until the position eases, new construction works which involve any substantial quantity of stores will, unless where essential services are concerned, be rigidly curtailed.  Every effort will, however, be made to meet the demands from new subscribers as far as circumstances admit, but the difficulties in the way of providing circuits involving long pole routes are considerable and, even when it is possible to erect such circuits, very long delay will be inevitable.  I feel sure that, in the circumstances indicated, <Col N="1475" /> Deputies will recognise that the conservative policy which I am now forced to adopt in the matter of further telephone expansion is absolutely unavoidable.</P>
    <P>In addition to the new trunk exchange in Exchequer Street, Dublin, on which work is now in progress, and the contemplated new exchange and post office in St. Andrew Street, plans for which are almost ready, the Department has under consideration schemes for the enlargement of the district office at James&rsquo;s Street, Dublin; for the erection of a new district office on a site adjacent to the Gárda barracks at Whitehall, Drumcondra; for an extension of office accommodation at Thurles; and for structural alterations at the head post office at Cork to enable a new telephone exchange to be installed and the public office to be improved.</P>
    <P>It is hoped that it may be possible to make substantial progress with these works during the coming financial year. In relation to the proposed new post office in St. Andrew Street, Dublin, I may say here, in connection with questions on the point which have previously been raised, that it is not the Department&rsquo;s intention to have sorting work performed in this office.  No mail vans will be detained or delayed in St. Andrew Street, as they will merely call there for the purpose of collecting posted correspondence and conveying it to the chief office in Pearse Street.  So far as the post office is concerned, therefore, there will be no danger of interference with general public traffic passing through St. Andrew Street.</P>
    <P>Savings bank business continues to expand.  The deposits during the 12 months ended 31st December last amounted to a total of £3,226,700, an increase of £309,170 on the figures for the previous year.  Withdrawals amounted to £2,312,050, an increase of £221,362.  The increase in the balance held on behalf of ordinary depositors, including interest of £277,570 earned during the year, amounted to £1,192,220.  In accordance with the provisions of the Finance Act, 1940, moneys of the Trustee Savings Bank, <Col N="1476" /> which were formerly transferred to the National Debt Commissioners, London, have, since 21st November, 1940, been paid into a special account of the Minister for Finance at the Bank of Ireland and invested by way of deposit in the Post Office Savings Bank.  A sum of £190,100 was so invested during the period ended 31st March, 1941.</P>
    <P>The pressure on the Stores Branch, which arose in 1939 as the result of emergency conditions, was intensified during 1940, mainly in connection with the provision of uniform and other supplies for the expanding Defence Forces, the newly constituted Local Security Force, and the A.R.P. services. Considerable difficulties were experienced in the early part of the year in regard to woollen supplies and, in June last, the Minister for Supplies found it necessary to make an order which secured practically the whole output of the Irish woollen mills for Army requirements.  Orders for approximately 700,000 yards of Army serges and cloths were placed and for 1,250,000 yards of cotton, almost the whole of which went to mills in Éire. Upon the stores branch fell the responsibility for the arranging of contracts, both for manufacture and tailoring, for inspection of contractors&rsquo; premises and for ensuring that supplies were expeditiously delivered and were up to standard.  The value of contracts placed by the stores branch in 1940 reached the huge total of £2,052,947, more than double the total for 1939 and almost five times the total for normal times.  Expenditure on articles manufactured or assembled in Éire amounted to £1,797,051, as against £716,943 in the previous year.</P>
    <P>Difficulties in procuring supplies also arose from the shortage of raw materials, both at home and in Great Britain, as well as from restrictions on the export of certain classes of commodities from Great Britain and the consequent inability of British contractors to carry out contracts already entered into.  In some cases it has been necessary to place alternative contracts in the U.S.A. at seriously increased cost and, of course, with considerable delays in delivery.</P>
    <P>I may mention that supplies of pine <Col N="1477" /> poles from foreign countries for telephone and telegraph purposes were completely cut off in September last. Home-grown larch poles have since been substituted, contracts for approximately 12,700 such poles, being placed last year.  These home-grown poles are, however, only suitable for light construction.</P>
    <P>The provision under sub-head Q in respect of Civil Aviation and Meteorological Wireless services, which are provided and operated by the Post Office on behalf of the Department of Industry and Commerce, amounts to £43,020, an increase of £3,475 on the total provision for last year.  There are decreases of £2,240 and £430 under Q (1) and Q (3)&mdash;Salaries, Wages, etc., and Travelling respectively.  The provision under sub-head Q (2)&mdash;Equipment Charges, etc &mdash;represents, on the other hand, an increase of £6,145, of which £4,820 is for customs duty on imported apparatus; £538 for new equipment at Rynanna and for electrical heating at Ballygirreen and £787 for increased cost of maintenance, due to extended hours of operation of transmitters.  In regard to the customs duty item, I may explain that this has reference to apparatus already imported which, it was at first understood, would be admitted duty free. The Revenue Commissioners have, however, since intimated that duty will be payable.</P>
    <P>In concluding this statement I would like to express my appreciation of the very satisfactory manner in which the officers generally of the Department have carried out their duties during a very strenuous year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister, of course, is probably aware of the fact that his predecessor on one occasion told the House that the new premises in Pearse Street would be erected and ready for occupation in 1941.  We are now in the year 1941 and the foundation stone of the new premises has not yet been laid. I wonder if the present Minister would like to hazard some guess this evening as to when the work of constructing the premises will be undertaken and when the building is likely to be made available for postal traffic.  The annexe there is a most unsatisfactory <Col N="1478" /> building.  It is inadequate for staff requirements; it is an unsuitable place to work in and, in addition, it suffers from the fact that at Christmas time or periods of exceptional pressure it is not adequate for the requirements of postal traffic.  Something should be done.  The Department should make up its mind in the matter.  The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance, when replying to the debate on the Estimate for Public Works during the year, told us that the Post Office Department had not yet satisfied itself as to the nature of the work to be done there or as to the plans and that, therefore, the work could not be carried out.  This is the position, in 1941, though the Minister&rsquo;s predecessor told us the building would be ready and available for occupation this very year.  The Parliamentary Secretary says the Post Office has not even yet made up its mind on the matter, cannot decide, apparently, on the plans and does not yet know what kind of work it wants done in the building.  I would suggest to the Minister that nobody is being unduly fussy or petulant in asking the Post Office, in 1941, to make up its mind, once and for all, what work it wants done in Pearse Street.  The Minister&rsquo;s predecessor&rsquo;s forecast that the building would be ready in 1941 would appear to be very wide of the mark. Some real effort should be made to provide the capital of the State with an office adequate for requirements and tolerable from the point of view of the staff who work in the building.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the past year I had occasion to address a question to the Minister as to the method by which he fills vacancies of the doorkeeper class in the Post Office at Dublin.  The Minister then contended that he had the right to take in persons to fill these vacancies but I protested then, and I want to protest now, at the method adopted by the Minister on that occasion and I think the House will be interested in the facts of the case.  Certain persons who had been employed in the Post Office for upwards of 15 years were employed temporarily against vacancies on the doorkeeper class. They were allowed to remain on these <Col N="1479" /> duties for, in many cases, upwards of two years, acting in a temporary capacity. Then it was decided to fill the vacancies and, instead of the persons with 15 years&rsquo; service and actual experience of the duties being appointed to the vacancies, the Minister proceeded to bring in some political friends from outside who had never performed the duty before, and appointed these people to these posts of doorkeeper.  If the Minister has some boys outside to reward for political services I do not mind his rewarding them but they ought to be rewarded out of Party funds.  The Post Office does not yet belong to the Fianna Fáil Party or to any Party.  It belongs to the whole nation.  The idea of bringing in a few friends from outside and planking them in jobs, simply as reward for past political services, is, I think, doing something that a Minister, at all events, ought not to descend to. The people who were filling the vacancies were employed in the Post Office for upwards of 15 years.  There was no question of their ability to do the duty, no question about the faithful character of their service.  In normal course they should have got these appointments were it not for the fact that the Minister had some friends who had to be provided for.  I think that is a thoroughly disreputable method of filling posts in the Civil Service.  I hope we have heard the last of it and that some effort will be made in future to aim at a higher standard of cleanliness and purity in the matter of making appointments, without getting down to that type of &ldquo;spoils&rdquo; system, which is unfair to people who are employed in the Post Office and which does not at all enhance the reputation of anybody associated with that type of nepotism.</P>
    <P>Another matter to which I would like to call the Minister&rsquo;s attention is the fact that a very large number of vacancies of the postman class exist in the country at present, and they are not being filled due to the fact that there is, apparently, an insufficiency of certified boy messengers to fill these vacancies.  The result is that these vacancies are being filled merely in a <Col N="1480" /> temporary capacity during the emergency situation.  The Post Office Department held an examination about two years ago for a certain number of vacancies.  About 40 candidates were then called for established appointments, but there is still a substantial number of qualified candidates available from that list.  Seeing that the Post Office cannot get certified boy messengers to fill all the vacancies that exist, I would like to ask the Minister if he would be agreeable to draw on the candidates from the last examination who are available, so that these vacancies may be filled and, at the same time, persons who have demonstrated their educational suitability for employment in established positions may have an opportunity of securing appointments to these posts.  I do not think any real difficulty would be experienced if the Minister would undertake to approach the Department of Finance for authority to call the remaining candidates from that examination. If he does so, he will be satisfying the claims of persons who have considerable service in the Post Office and, at the same time, filling vacancies which cannot otherwise be filled in the normal course because of the insufficiency of qualified candidates.</P>
    <P>While on the subject of the filling of vacancies, I may call the Minister&rsquo;s attention to a matter with which perhaps he may be familiar.  There are at present approximately 40 persons performing duties as full-time postmen who, in normal circumstances, would have been appointed as unestablished postmen.  The Post Office have apparently developed a complex that nothing can be done in a progressive way during the emergency situation. It may be done otherwise, but when it comes to giving the staff anything during the emergency situation, the Post Office say &ldquo;No.&rdquo;  Their interpretation is that the emergency situation is to be utilised for the purpose, at least, of keeping things as they are, if they cannot make them worse.</P>
    <P>These 40 people are employed in a temporary capacity.  If they were appointed as unestablished officers they would be allowed increments.  Now they are not permitted to get the increase <Col N="1481" /> in the cost of living bonus under the Stabilisation of Bonus Order, No. (1), and they are denied annual increments because of the fact that the Post Office will not, apparently, take steps to have them appointed as unestablished postmen.  I think that is most unfair.  Normally these people would be treated, as other colleagues of theirs were treated, by appointing them as unestablished postmen.  By not appointing them as unestablished postmen, the Post Office is getting the work done very cheaply, because it is depriving the officers of increments, and of course it is depriving the officers also of the sick leave privileges which are associated with unestablished status.  There again I do not think any insuperable difficulty would arise in the matter of having these officers appointed in an unestablished capacity once the Post Office showed goodwill in the matter.  I hope to enlist the sympathy of the Minister for a proposal to have these officers appointed in an unestablished capacity.</P>
    <P>Another matter to which I should like to make reference is the effect of the application of earlier summer time on the Post Office services.  Summer time started this year much earlier than usual, I think in February.  Next year it is likely to start in February too, if in fact it does not start much earlier.  Everybody is in favour of summer time during what are regarded as the normal summer months of the year; but when you introduce summer time so as to make it operative, say, in the month of February, you impose a very real hardship on people who are due for duty at 6 o&rsquo;clock in the morning. They find themselves attending for duty at 4.30 by the natural time, which means they have to be out of bed at 3 a.m. natural time.  I think Deputies from rural areas will be familiar with the fact that persons in such areas do not rise very early in the morning, and that in many cases they ignore the new summer time altogether; but the Post Office observe it, with the result that postmen have not only to be out abnormally early, but they have to be on duty at a time well in advance of the time which the local people are observing.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1482" /> In addition, the postman finds considerable difficulty in effecting delivery of letters and parcels in these circumstances. He finds it extremely difficult to effect delivery of a parcel because he cannot get it into the letter box or under the door.  If he is not able to effect delivery, he has to carry the parcel, probably of five or six pounds weight, several miles on his round and then take it back to the post office only to find that he is faced with the same difficulty in effecting delivery the next day.</P>
    <P>I do not think that any serious dislocation would be caused if the Post Office were to adjust the hours of attendance, preferably in all areas but particularly in rural areas, in respect to the extended period of summer-time so as to enable deliveries to be effected when persons are available to receive correspondence and parcels and so as to relieve postmen of the obligation of attending for duty at such unnaturally early hours.  It has been possible during the emergency situation to revise various deliveries and collections because of the circumstances and we ought to be no less elastic in altering the hours of attendance when, for reasons of national welfare, we find it necessary to adopt summer-time.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister also to investigate the possibility of granting pensions to auxiliary postmen.  From time to time I have come across cases of auxiliary postmen who have served the State for 40 or 45 years.  Normally they are permitted to serve until they reach the age of 65 and, in exceptional cases, they are allowed to serve until they reach the age of 70.  Notwithstanding the fact that they have served the State faithfully for 40 or 50 years, they are allowed to retire without a penny by way of pension from the State.  During the period of their employment their wages are small and they are never able to make provision for the rainy day or for old age, with the result that when they leave the service at 70 they find that the only sustenance they have is the fragment of sustenance provided by the old age pension.  I think it is most unfair that persons who serve an employer, particularly <Col N="1483" /> persons who serve the State, should be compelled to retire after such a long service without any pension. I think the Minister ought to realise that if he does pay these people bad wages during their period of service, he ought at least to be able to put his hand on his heart and say: &ldquo;Well, I did make some provision for them in their old age.&rdquo;  The cost of providing pensions, having regard to the wages of the officers concerned, would not be considerable.  I trust the Minister will be able to see his way to have the question examined sympathetically with a view to making some provision for officers of that description when they retire.</P>
    <P>One other matter in which I am interested is the question of supplies for the Engineering Department.  Everybody knows the difficulties which that branch of the Department is experiencing in present circumstances, having regard to the fact that the bulk of the materials required is manufactured outside the country.  I could quite understand that there should be some inevitable curtailment of work because of these circumstances, but I should like the Minister to give the House an assurance that, while possibly there may have to be a curtailment of services here and there because of the shortage of materials, employment will be maintained in the Engineering Department for persons already employed there.  In other words, I should like the Minister to say that it is not intended that there will be any paying-off of further members of the engineering staff and that he will be able to find regular employment for the existing staff by the best utilisation of the supplies of materials at the disposal of the branch.</P>

      <P>There are a few matters to which I would like to draw the Minister&rsquo;s attention.  One is the provision of telephone kiosks in the built-up areas, what I might call the suburban areas, around Cork City.  I think I put this matter to the Minister on a previous occasion, but I want to emphasise it again because it has been brought very urgently to my notice <Col N="1484" /> within recent months.  The Minister in his statement said that there was no extensive area without a telephone service.  That statement does not fit in with the facts I wish to put before the Minister and the House.  There is a very substantial population in the district immediately outside Cork City known as Spangle Hill.  No telephone facilities are available there.  It has been brought to my notice that in urgent cases, such as the provision of medical or spiritual aid for people who are ill, especially at night, relatives have to travel a considerable distance to get a telephone service.  The same state of affairs obtains on the south side.  At present there is a big housing scheme on the Greenmount side and there again no telephone service is provided. Yet in the flat of the city, there are telephone kiosks in every street, although the population is not anything like as dense as in the area I mention. The flat of the city&mdash;the South Mall, Grand Parade and Patrick Street&mdash; is principally composed of business premises.</P>
      <P>Probably some people live over these premises but the area is not nearly so densely populated as the areas I have already mentioned to which hundreds of people have been brought to corporation dwellings from the flat of the city.  I think it is the Minister&rsquo;s duty to provide telephone kiosks in such areas irrespective of expense or other difficulties which he may consider are in the way.  These people have a right to such services and they have demanded that right from me.  I am putting the matter to the Minister now and I should like him when he is making his concluding statement to give us some definite guarantee that this very serious grievance will be remedied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another matter that has been brought to my notice is the employment of casual labour by the telephone section of the Minister&rsquo;s Department. I had a case recently in the rural part of my constituency, where a telephone extension was being put in.  The regular staff of the telephone department were not able to deal with the work, so they had to call in some of the local unemployed men.  The Post <Col N="1485" /> Office Department inquired as to what were the rates of wages to be paid to those men, in spite of the fact that, I take it, the Department has a fixed rate of wages for unskilled labour of that type, and I should have assumed that they would put into operation that fixed scale of wages which is applicable to their regular employees. Those casual men will have only a very short period of employment, and the wages which they earn will not be in any way commensurate with the work which they give to the Department.  I do not think it makes for harmony to have two groups of men working side by side on different standards of wages.  When such work goes on in the rural areas, I think the Minister would be well advised to put into operation the scale of wages which obtains in the Department.  I am afraid there is a growing tendency to take the lower rate of wages which obtains in the rural area as the standard for those casual men employed by the Post Office Department.  I am sure the Minister will give sympathetic consideration to that point, because, as I say, the necessary work is being done by men who have been unemployed for some time, and the wages paid to them for this work will probably be the only remuneration they will receive for their services for a long period.</P>
    <P>The regular men have a standard wage, and it is only right that that rate should be applied to the casual men also.  I do not see where the justification for differentiation comes in, and that differentiation does cause a certain amount of discontent.  In one particular case, where six or seven men were called in for this work in the telephone section of the Department, they had a very real grievance when they found they were to receive a lesser wage than the ordinary regular staff. In fact, they were rather inclined not to go on the job, but I advised them to take the work and that the matter would probably be rectified afterwards. I think there is justice on the side of those men, and that they have a very definite grievance.</P>
    <P>I was very pleased to note that the Post Office Savings Bank is still keeping up its reputation, and that the income <Col N="1486" /> for the year exceeded the withdrawals by a very substantial amount. I think that is a very creditable side of the post office work, and I should like to see it extended.  In fact, I think the Minister would be well advised to stress the importance of that side of the Post Office work.  It probably does entail a good deal of accountancy and so on, but at the same time it is a very constructive social side of the work of the Department.  Despite the fact that 1940 was a particularly difficult year, it is very creditable to note that such a substantial increase in the amount of savings&mdash;which would, of course, be lodged in very small sums&mdash;has been recorded for the year.  Those are the matters which I want to bring to the Minister&rsquo;s attention for the sympathetic consideration which I know he will give them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFlynn" hpid="Mr. J. Flynn Mr. J. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>There is just one matter which I should like to mention, and that is the proposed telephone service from Killorglin to Cromane. There have already been references to the matter, and difficulties have been raised on the question of expense, but in view of the important industry which is now in operation in that district, that is the export of mussels from Cromane, and the importance of the telephone to the future of that industry, I would make another urgent appeal to the Minister and his Department again to examine the possibility of making a telephone service available for the people down there.  The necessity for that service has existed for some years.  Previously, in regard to salmon fishing, the people down there found it impossible to make arrangements in regard to price. Wires came through to buyers from the various centres, and unless the local fishermen could send somebody to Killorglin, a distance of six miles, the wires would be held there for hours, and no information would be available for the people concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That was the position previously, and now the necessity for the establishment of that service has become more acute in view of the establishment of the export trade in the mussel industry.  Even though the cost may be greater than the amount available. <Col N="1487" /> I think that service should be established by the Department, seeing that there is an industry at stake, if I might put it that way, and that the livelihood of over 100 families may depend on it. I should like the Minister to look into the matter and give it sympathetic consideration.</P>

      <P>I should like to mention one point in connection with telephones. So far as my experience goes, and so far as any information which I can pick up with regard to telephones generally is concerned, the service is run efficiently.  The only fault I have to find is with the emergency repair service.  I think there is altogether too much delay from the time a telephone is reported out of order until the necessary repairs are effected.  That delay was particularly noticeable during the last winter storm, when there was widespread dislocation of the telephone service in Dublin.  I had various complaints from users of telephones&mdash;I am sure other Deputies in the House had a similar experience&mdash;about the long delay involved in the carrying out of the necessary repairs.  My experience of the matter was that, while the complaints were received in a very courteous manner by the officials of the Department, and promises were made to carry out the repairs as expeditiously as possible, the work was not promptly done.  The usual reply given to complaints as to a particular telephone being out of order&mdash;in one particular instance, the complaint was made not less than six times&mdash;was that priority was given to certain classes of users, such as clergymen and doctors. I think there must be room for improvement in that branch of the service, and I suggest, furthermore, that if such an improvement cannot be brought about, if there is any special reason why it cannot be brought about, such as lack of people with the necessary technical skill to carry out the repairs, a refund of portion of the rent should be made to subscribers who find <Col N="1488" /> themselves without the telephone service for a long period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to deal with the booking of calls, and particularly trunk calls, in some of the rural areas. Very considerable delay is involved in getting these calls.  The Minister referred to the matter, but it is not to that particular aspect that I wish to allude, but to the position which arises when a person books a call and fails to specify an optional call.  Whether through ignorance of the facilities or not, it has happened that although a conversation has not been completed by the end of three minutes, the caller is informed that his time is up and he is cut off.  If he wants to complete his conversation, he has no option but to book a further call.  If he asks for an extension, he will not get it; and he has to walk out of the booth, book a further call and wait for another 20 minutes or half an hour.  I think that is shameful treatment.  It is not the right procedure at all.  Whether it is the fault of certain officials or the general practice of the Department, I do not know, but I should like to hear the Minister&rsquo;s view on it.  I should like to know whether it is a general rule. The Minister may say that the caller may make his call an optional call, but many people are not aware that that can be done.  They do not know what an optional call means, and if this procedure is to continue, I suggest that the attention of the public should be drawn to the fact that if they want a call longer than three minutes, they must book an optional call.</P>

      <P>Deputy Norton raised the hardy annual of the Pearse Street Post Office, and, as I expected he might do so, I went to the trouble of visiting the place.  I must say I was greatly impressed by the premises.  There is an excellent structure there which is bone-dry and admirably situated from the point of view of the station.  There is a wooden structure there and the Deputy may not be aware that a wooden structure, from the point of view of temperature, is very often better than a stone structure.  We have ambitions to build a fine building <Col N="1489" /> when the time comes, but a lack of steel and material prevents us going in for anything like an elaborate structure at the moment.  I do not know if the Deputy has been through the premises since they were rebuilt in wood, but I cannot imagine the facilities, even when a stone structure is built, for the officials being much better than they are at the present.</P>

      <P>Naturally, Deputy Norton will press for the very best conditions possible, but I think that the present conditions, although I do not deny they could be improved, are very excellent.  In any case, the common sense of the situation is that so long as the emergency lasts and so long as there is a lack of steel for structural work, it is not possible for us to proceed any further with the building of a stone structure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>I am perfectly certain there were good reasons for it.  The question of pensions for part-time officers was also raised.  In regard to the suggestion that services rendered by Post Office officials in a part-time capacity should be recognised for pension purposes, I have to point out to the Deputy that this is a question of general Civil Service application, and not one peculiar to the Post Office. The matter is governed by the various Superannuation Acts and the regulations made thereunder, and any question of modifying the statutory enactments or the relevant regulations is one entirely for the Minister for Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to give sympathetic consideration to it, but I <Col N="1490" /> do not think we shall make very much headway while the present financial strain continues.</P>
      <P>Deputy Hurley raised the question of the casual engineering labourers and their rates of pay.  Labourers casually engaged for engineering work are paid the standard local labourers&rsquo; rate as ascertained from the Department of Industry and Commerce.  In Dublin, this rate is usually higher than the rate paid to quasi-permanent labourers of the engineering branch.  In other parts of the country it is, however, frequently lower.  The matter is one over which the Post Office has no control. The question of calling further candidates from the 1938 limited examination for postmen, Grade B, vacancies was also raised.  The suggestion that further candidates should be called from the limited competition held in January, 1938, to fill existing vacancies in the postmen class has been under Departmental consideration, on representations which Deputy Norton has already made.  While it is the case that a substantial number of vacancies at present exist, for which boy messengers are not available, I am sorry that the suggestion is one which could not be agreed to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Although it was the intention to fill only 15 posts from the examination in question, 44 of the qualified candidates have already been called and it would be quite contrary to practice to draw further from the qualifying list in view of the lengthy period that has elapsed since the examination was held.  Apart from this, however, unsuccessful candidates at the examination, even if qualified, have no more claim to special consideration at the present stage than the many officers who, by reason of inadequate service at the time, were debarred from sitting for the examination. The proper way of meeting the situation would be to hold another competition and, if conditions were normal, I would take steps accordingly.  In present circumstances, however, such a course would be manifestly unfair to eligible officers who are at present engaged on military service and who, by reason of their military duties, would have little opportunity either of preparing for or sitting for an examination. <Col N="1491" /> The position will receive further consideration on the termination of the emergency and in the meantime the posts must continue to be filled on a temporary basis.</P>
    <P>A question was also raised with regard to trunk calls.  It was raised by Deputy Hughes, I think.  As the Deputy knows, persons making trunk calls from call offices are warned, when a call is booked, that conversation will be terminated at the end of three minutes unless they secure an option in advance for an extended period and make a suitable deposit.  If a caller does not book an option in advance, conversation beyond three minutes can only be obtained by booking a fresh call.  If there is any way of bringing that to the notice of the public, we shall certainly look into the matter and do it.</P>
    <P>Another question that was raised was in regard to the Engineering branch workman staff.  The figures for skilled workmen Class II, acting unestablished skilled workmen, youths in training and labour staff in the Estimates for 1941-42 show a decrease of 121 on those for the previous year. The reduction is, however, only apparent, as it is not anticipated that it will be necessary&mdash;unless, of course, some major crisis occurs&mdash;to pay off in the current year, on account of shortage of work, any of the workmen and labour force at present employed. The figures 580 (skilled workmen Class II and unestablished skilled workmen), 39 (youths in training), and 160 (labour) shown for last year were those which appeared in the 1940-41 Estimates.  It was not found practicable, however, to employ this number.  What happened was that, in connection with the national emergency, work of urgent importance arose in the early part of last summer and had to be carried out without avoidable delay, necessitating the staffs working long hours and even on Sundays.  The money in the Estimates for 1940-41 was thus spent on fewer men than would have been the case had normal hours been worked throughout.  The importance of spreading work over as many men as possible is fully appreciated, but in the abnormal circumstances the special emergency <Col N="1492" /> works could not have been carried through as expeditiously as they were if additional men had been taken on and overtime avoided.  Further, with the very uncertain prospect generally, especially in the matter of stores supplies, some reduction in engineering full-time staff was unavoidable. This was effected last year by not making good normal wastage due to retirements, etc., and by ceasing to take on new youths for training purposes.</P>
    <P>Deputy Norton raised a question of the claim of temporary postmen for promotion to vacancies as doorkeepers. While I have given, and shall continue to give, full consideration to temporary postmen for any of these vacancies, I cannot admit the claim that these men should have exclusive right of appointment to posts not in their grade.  General qualifications have to be taken into consideration, and I can only say that the temporary postmen have got a very reasonable proportion of the vacancies.  I think the Deputy is unfairly representing the situation when he suggests that these other appointments were made exclusively on political grounds.  I think that if he examines the matter he will find that the appointments were made on national rather than on political grounds and were given mostly to I.R.A. men.  On the whole, I think these representations have been fairly well received, and I should say that the fifty-fifty arrangement has not been unsatisfactory.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  There was no harm done to the I.R.A. men concerned&mdash; their emoluments are approximately as good as if they were doorkeepers&mdash;and other I.R.A. men may have been put into these positions</P>

      <P>I think the Deputy pressed a little too hard on these cases, and he is too good an advocate, sometimes, of his own cases.  With regard to the filling of posts by unestablished postmen, the Department has had difficulty in recommending the advancement of temporary full-time postmen to full-time unestablished rank by reason of doubts as to the continued need for the maintenance of the duties owing to emergency conditions.  The general question, however, is being reconsidered and I hope to be able to advise the Deputy of the outcome at an early date.  I do not quite follow the Deputy in his remarks about Summer Time, because I was under the impression that no change had been made this year with reference to Summer Time.</P>

      <P>Last year the Minister promised that he would undertake to examine the question of establishing kiosks at post offices that have extensions to Civic Guard barrakcs&mdash;at least in villages of a fairly substantial kind. Nothing has been done in regard to that matter.  Since then Civic Guard regulations prohibit the use of the telephone in the barracks for any public business.  For instance, people are not allowed to make what are known as <Col N="1495" /> originating calls, and this is causing very great inconvenience in many districts. I should like the Minister to deal with that matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall have it attended to.  Perhaps it may be due to the strain on the telephone service in the barracks. There was a time when, in country places, it was not a forbidden thing to telephone from the police barracks. We shall investigate the matter and see what can be done.  Call offices exist in all post offices at which there are telephone exchanges, with very few exceptions.  Where there are no telephone exchanges, call offices can only be opened if they are likely to be self-supporting, otherwise they may only be provided under guarantee from the local board of health or board of public assistance.</P>
      <P>Applications for the opening of call offices in rural districts are numerous but, unfortunately, local optimism regarding the extent to which they will be used is rarely justified.  Many existing rural call offices are being maintained although they are being operated at a loss because, once opened, it is not the Department&rsquo;s policy to close them down.  The Department cannot provide telephone services for emergency purposes in rural areas. Nearly all Civic Guard stations have continuous telephone service, and these meet the purely emergency needs.</P>

      <P>I shall have a discussion with the Department of Justice on that point.  There is the possibility that under present conditions such a practice might lend itself to abuse, but I will investigate the matter.  It is really more a matter for the Department of Justice.  Deputy Flinn talked about a telephone service at Cromane&mdash;an extension from Killorglin.  I can only promise to give his representations careful consideration.  Telephone service in remote districts is very costly and the Post Office can only provide it where the revenue from the traffic will cover the annual expenditure.</P>
      <P>Deputy Hannigan talked about the delay at the time of the great storm. I do not think the Deputy realises the extraordinary amount of damage done at that time.  When reports came in to me about the damage, I was surprised that the staff got through the repair work so quickly.  The storm in January was very severe and 1,800 lines were put out of order.  Every available man was working overtime on the repair work.  The staff worked very hard under extremely bad weather conditions. Skilled staff are required for the work and such a staff can only be obtained by special training.</P>
      <P>Refunds are given to subscribers when they are left without service for long periods.  My own feeling is that some subscribers are unnecessarily impatient.  It is a popular thing at the present time to attack civil servants.  It has become a popular thing to make civil servants the butt of all sorts of unreasonable complaints. Of all the services, I should say the Post Office is the most sensitive to the needs of the people and gives the most continuous and patient service.</P>

      <P>Go ndeontar suim ná raghaidh thar £46,995 chun slánuithe na suime is gá chun íoctha an Mhuirir a thiocfaidh chun bheith iníoctha i rith na bliana dar críoch an 31adh lá de Mhárta, 1942, chun Tuarastail agus Costaisí cile i dtaobh.  Fóirleatha Neashrangaigh (Uimh. 45 de 1926).</P>
      <P>That a sum, not exceeding £46,995, be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending the 31st day of March, 1942, for Salaries and other Expenses in connection with Wireless Broadcasting (No. 45 of 1926).</P>
      <P>The amount of the Estimate for the broadcasting service for the financial year 1941-42 is £70,595, a decrease of £55 on the provision for last year. Taking the figures under the principal sub-heads, sub-head A&mdash;Salaries, Wages, etc.&mdash;is increased by £1,100. The increase is due to incremental increases in salaries and wages and to additional engineering staff provision for short-wave transmissions.  In sub-head B&mdash;Cost of Programmes&mdash;there is a decrease of £800, due to shorter programme hours and a reduction of outside broadcasts.  The gross decrease is £3,300, but provision amounting to £2,500 has been made for short wave transmissions and increased performing rights fees.  The net decrease is, therefore, £800.</P>
      <P>Sub-head E&mdash;Light, Power, etc.&mdash; shows a decrease of £640.  The full amount of the decrease is £740, arising from reduced programme hours, but there is offsetting expenditure of £100 for short wave transmissions.  Under sub-head F&mdash;Plant, Equipment, etc.&mdash; the net increase is £390.  A sum of £1,460 is included for additional equipment for short wave transmissions, but there are savings, against this, in respect of equipment for the home broadcasting service which is not at present obtainable owing to war conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1498" /> Short wave broadcasts from 4.0 to 4.30 a.m. were radiated from the 1st December, 1940, to the 31st March, 1941, and reception reports were received from representatives of the Department of External Affairs abroad. Reception was, on the whole, unsatisfactory and the broadcasts have been suspended for the time being.  It was hoped to obtain further equipment for the purpose of increasing the power of the short wave transmitter but, for the present, this has been found impossible.</P>
    <P>Broadcasting revenue in the financial year 1940-41 amounted to £125,500 approximately.  The revenue from wireless licences was £109,500 and from advertisements and miscellaneous receipts £16,000.  The revenue from licences in 1941-42 is estimated at £112,500.  The total number of licences on the 31st March, 1941, was 182,694&mdash; an increase of about 13,000 on the number at the same date in 1940.  The increase is satisfactory, but the Department continues to experience considerable trouble by reason of the failure of many owners of receiving sets to take out or renew their licences in proper course.  Last year, legal proceedings were taken against over 800 defaulters.  I would appeal again, as I did last year, to all concerned to comply promptly with what is a statutory and, indeed, a moral obligation, and incidentally avoid for themselves the needless expense of court costs.</P>
    <P>The position regarding advertising programmes is that owing to developing difficulties in regard to supplies of raw materials, the revenue from advertisements in the current year is not now considered likely to exceed £3,000, or one-third of the sum originally expected. The sponsored programmes are confined to Irish registered organisations, excluding the wholesale and retail distributive trades and makers of patent medicines, cosmetics and alcohol.</P>
    <P>Broadcasting organisations everywhere have had to contend with abnormal difficulties during the past year and in this respect Radio Eireann has not been an exception.  I referred last year, for instance, to the interference <Col N="1499" /> with transmission from Athlone from stations of other countries which was being experienced, and while everything possible has been done by way of representations to the Administrations responsible, I regret that a certain amount of interference continues.  I am afraid, however, that no material improvement can be hoped for until the war ends.</P>
    <P>Programme hours have been shortened. The urgent need for the exercise of the strictest economy in expenditure has necessitated a reduction of about six hours a week in broadcasts of local artists, and there has been an increase of recorded programmes.</P>
    <P>Public symphony concerts have also been suspended, but I hope to arrange for some public concerts next season on the lines of the Friday orchestral hour.</P>
    <P>The news service has been given particular attention and an additional news bulletin is now being broadcast daily in the midday programme.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. D. Morrissey Mr. D. Morrissey">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>There is good ground for thinking that, by reason especially of the impartial manner in which news items are presented, particularly those relating to the international hostilities, the news bulletins of Radio Eireann are now followed with considerable interest not only within the country but even in places outside.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The need for developing the purely Irish aspects of the programmes is constantly in mind and to this end the distinctive features such as the Irish news bulletins, the special Irish musical programmes which are given nightly, as well as Irish plays, talks, etc., have been extended and improved. The production of drama and dramatisation in Irish suffers, however, from the lack of creative writers and competent actors and producers, and especially from the difficulty of procuring plays in the Irish language which are suitable for radio production. Music constitutes 54 per cent. <Col N="1500" /> of the total programmes.  Apart from Irish music&mdash;operas, symphonies, chamber music and the classics are broadcast as regular features of the national programmes.  Since I spoke last year, there has been an amount of work done in the orchestration of Irish music and the arrangement of Irish ballads.</P>
    <P>Encouragement is given to Irish musicians to supply the need for new compositions and arrangements, and good fees are paid for performing rights.  I intend to develop the policy of encouraging those who are competent to do work of this kind, as part of my general aim of making the Irish broadcasting service distinctively national.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>As broadcasting can be an instrument of great utility as well as an instrument of pleasure, I suppose it is our duty to point out what we consider to be drawbacks in this service. The Minister&rsquo;s remark with regard to provision, or lack of provision, of power for short wave transmission reminds me to ask what our position is in that regard, and with regard to transmission generally.  Are we tied to a wave length?  In case of emergency, if anything happened here, what would be our position?  Is there any way by which we could change from the present wave length to some other wave length in case of necessity?  Other European countries had to abandon the original wave lengths and adopt other wave lengths.  I do not know if advantage could be taken of the present emergency by way of excuse to allow anything like that to happen here.  It might mean the saving of the country if broadcasting could be continued in an emergency.  Generally speaking, I am not going to find fault with the programmes, because, in a small country like this, we would not be able to compete with the very large broadcasting syndicates in other places.  On the whole, I think we are doing fairly well. More attention should be paid to the news service.  It is really scandalous that we do not get any news on Sunday until 10 o&rsquo;clock at night.  I do not know if there is any excuse for that, or why the present arrangement is persisted in.  I cannot understand why our station <Col N="1501" /> does not open for news at six. What we get is something that I am afraid may be instrumental in killing the Irish language, because it is a rehash of the news of the week in Irish. Do Deputies or anybody outside want to hear the week&rsquo;s news in English, or in any other language, or even of the previous day&rsquo;s news?  They do not, particularly in these times when events move so quickly.  It is the last word to expect people to listen to such news in the Irish language.  I do not know that anyone would do that except enthusiasts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am afraid that the people who design the programmes in Irish are just enthusiasts and design them for enthusiasts and no one else.  We have a broadcast of news in Irish at night for ten minutes and then in English immediately afterwards.  Speaking as one who in his early days learned a limited amount of Irish and by great effort could pick a great deal of the news out of the broadcast, am I going to do that when I can hear the news in English without effort ten minutes later?  I am speaking also from the point of view of country dwellers with families, all of whom learned Irish at school and are able to follow the news in Irish.  Though they can do so will they be enthusiastic enough to listen, knowing that they can get the news without effort in ten minutes?  They are not going to bother.  I do not know any person who will make an extra effort to do something when he can gain the same end without effort.  If news in Irish was broadcast at 8 or 9 o&rsquo;clock we would all listen in to try to pick it up.  It would be news then, and possibly there would be other news at 10 p.m.  I do not think it is reasonable, in the interest of the Irish language, to broadcast news in Irish at 10 o&rsquo;clock; it may be reasonable enough otherwise.  The case may be made that there is more news to broadcast at 10 o&rsquo;clock than at 9 o&rsquo;clock, but if you can force people like me, who have a little Irish, to listen for the sake of the news and not for the sake of the language, then you will have done something.  If, however, you broadcast something to which only enthusiasts will listen, then you are not <Col N="1502" /> catering for anybody but the enthusiasts, and you are really doing no good for the Irish language.</P>
    <P>These are two things which, to my mind, want remedying.  First, we want news on Sunday.  People turn on the news in Irish at half-past five, or whatever time it is, and then they are watching for 6 o&rsquo;clock to get the British news.  There is no news given in English at that time.  I do not know why that is.  It cannot be a question of cost, because five minutes of news would not cost very much and, apparently, the service is paying its way.  The people who are paying for the licences are entitled to some return for their money, and they are looking for it. After all, Sunday is an idle day.  There are no newspapers to be had in the country districts.  People do not hear any news for the day and they are anxious to get some news in the evening, but they do not get it from Radio Eireann.  I do not think that is good enough, and I think it ought to be remedied.</P>
    <P>I should also like to see the broadcasting service used more for urging compliance with regulations and orders made by the Government.  We have that now with regard to foot-and-mouth disease; in fact we have it <i>ad nauseam.</i>  We have a repetition of the same thing night after night but it is required in the present conditions. During the tillage campaign, for instance, we had some very useful talks on agriculture and these might be continued from time to time with very good effect.  The radio, I think, ought to be used to urge the people to comply, for instance, with the regulations about the marketing of eggs.  I have always felt that we are really &ldquo;anti-law&rdquo; in this country.  We have that tradition, and I suppose we are not to blame for it.  I always have the feeling that the women of the country do not wish to comply with the orders relating to the marketing of eggs if they can avoid it.  If it could be brought home to them by wireless talks that they were really engaged in a competition and that only the best can win, I think a lot of good could be done for the country.  I was really amazed and <Col N="1503" /> scandalised recently to hear Government Deputies asking for a relaxation of the regulations regarding the marketing of eggs.  I think that shows a shocking mentality.  In these days of competition, as I said, only the best can win.  That ought to be brought home to the people by every means possible, and I suggest that the radio is one of the best means to do that. There could also be talks about the rearing and marketing of poultry and very good use could be made of the radio in that way.  I do not think that the matter has been very well thought out.  This is an agricultural country. Latterly it has been brought home to everybody that we are depending entirely upon the agricultural produce we can market.  I do not want to bore the people with talks on agriculture, but I do think that more use should be made of broadcasting in that way so that people can have the advantage of hearing talks by persons who are conversant with the subject and not have all this loose talk about the relaxation of orders and regulations which are necessary for the proper marketing of our goods.  I think that is a shocking mistake.</P>
    <P>With regard to ceilidhe music, I am always charmed with that music, and did what I could to popularise it.  But there are times when we get too much of it.  I do not think it is good policy to have, say, the Columcille band on a Tuesday night playing certain jigs, reels and hornpipes, on the following night to have Leo McCabe&rsquo;s band playing the same thing over again, and the night after the same thing over again by some other band.  There ought to be some variation; you can give too much of anything.  If the ceilidhe programmes were a little more selective, possibly you would please the people better and do a little more good.  On the whole, considering our limitations, I do not think that very much fault can be found with the programmes generally.  We have certainly very good broadcasts of records; the selections are usually pretty good.  Before I conclude I should like to say to the Minister that there is something due to the licence holders by way of news on Sunday.  We may tune in and <Col N="1504" /> hear Bing Crosby crooning and somebody else yodelling, but we are looking for news on Sunday, and I hope the Minister will see that we get it, as I think we are entitled to it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Up to and including last year I had to complain about the reception in the Wexford area.  On this occasion I want to thank the Minister for having given attention to that matter. Immediately after the debate on the Estimate last year an inspector was sent down to Wexford, and as a result of his report I am glad to say that the reception has improved considerably. I also want to stress the importance of giving news on Sunday. As Deputy Brennan pointed out, there is no news given in English until 10.5 or 10.10 on Sunday night.  I think it is very important that we should have news broadcast during the day.  At a time like this various rumours are floating around, and one is anxious to hear if there is any truth in them. There are all sorts of rumours going about which certainly do a good deal of harm.  The radio station is open on Sunday at 1 or 1.30 p.m., and it would not be any great trouble to give news at that time.</P>
      <P>Again, in connection with the news service, I am of opinion that Irish news items should get preference.  We get all the war news from the English stations at 1 o&rsquo;clock every day, and then we get a rehash of it from Athlone at 1.40.  Nobody wants to listen twice to the same news.  But there are certain announcements and certain items of Irish news which one wants to hear at 1.40.  Surely it is not too much to ask that the Irish news items should be given preference and put first.  Government announcements and matters like that should be given precedence to English war news.  Everybody is sick and tired of war news.  People do not believe a word of the war news they hear on the radio.  We have a rehash of the war news from the Athlone station after listening to it for 20 minutes or half an hour from some English station. I ask the Minister to see that the Irish news items are given first.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">

    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>That does not make very much difference.  After listening-in to an English station, you get a rehash of the news from the Irish station at 1.40; the hour does not make very much difference. I also referred last year to the question time feature which is broadcast every Sunday night.  It has always been a very interesting feature, and the present compere, Mr. Linnane, has made it even more interesting.  The Minister made a promise last year, I think, that different parts of the country would be given an opportunity of having question time or a question hour.  I cannot understand why question time should be completely confined to Dublin.  Perhaps I should not have used the word &ldquo;completely&rdquo; because, now and again, we have question time from different parts of the country.  I do want to suggest to the Minister that he ought to make arrangements whereby other parts of the country, not already served, would get their share of question time.  As I have said, the Minister made a promise to me last year in that connection, but so far it has not been fulfilled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Brennan referred to the fact that very little information is given on agriculture and subjects of that kind. During the past year, as the Minister knows, the Government have been asking the people, especially those in the towns, to do what many of them had never done before, namely, to till their plots and gardens.  In my opinion, sufficient advantage has not been taken of the radio for the purpose of giving talks to those people on the sowing of their plots or allotments.  It may be that there are many of them who know very little about the cultivation of cabbages, onions, lettuces, etc., and it would strike one, in view of the Government&rsquo;s policy, that advantage would have been taken to give such people instruction over the radio. Many of those people may not know the best varieties of cabbage, for example, to sow&mdash;I mean cabbage of a variety that will be available all the year round.  In view of the fact that the Government want the food situation attended to, one would imagine <Col N="1506" /> that they would have tried to secure the services of someone capable of giving instructions to those people on the tilling of their plots, and on the sowing of the best varieties of vegetables.</P>
    <P>A little over a year ago a competition was initiated on the radio by Count John McCormack.  I would like to know from the Minister what has been the result of it, and what happened to the winner who, I think, was a Cork person.  Certain promises were made that the winner would be trained. We have heard very little about the competition since.  I am sure the Minister will agree with me that there should be some finality about a competition of that kind.  The people of the country should be told what happened in connection with it.  Certainly, Count McCormack was not very complimentary in his remarks on the closing night of the competition.  In view of that especially, we would like to know what happened or were people simply brought up to Dublin to be made fools of?  Competitors from all over the country came forward in an effort to secure whatever prize was offered, but since the concluding night of the competition the thing appears to have died a natural death.</P>
    <P>These are the only points I have to deal with.  I hope the Minister will try to give us news on Sundays at mid-day.  Take last Saturday, for example, in connection with the unfortunate bombing of this city; we got more information about it from the English station early in the morning than we did from the Irish station at mid-day.  The English people seemed to have had more accurate information about the bombing of the people than the Athlone station was able to give to the Irish people at mid-day on Saturday.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonKissane" hpid="Mr. Kissane Mr. Kissane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kissane</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Brennan that wireless broadcasting can be an instrument of great utility. It can also be an instrument of great controversy.  It is hard, I know, to satisfy the tastes of all sections of the people.  It would be impossible to do that.  It may seem strange for me to say that, while I was one of those who <Col N="1507" /> advocated the ten minutes news in the Irish language&mdash;I advocated it very strongly&mdash;I am not satisfied with it.  I think everybody knows that I am a supporter of the Irish language, that I advocate its use and that I am very enthusiastic about it, but, while that is so, I am not satisfied with the ten minutes news given in Irish over the radio on week evenings.  That does not mean that I want to have this feature done away with.  It is with the form in which it is presented I am dissatisfied, and with the way in which it is presented.  I am very much afraid that some of the announcers do not know exactly how to put their voices over the air.  Their voices are not distinct enough.  Some are very indistinct, and even though my own ear is fairly attuned to the Irish language, to nearly all the dialects, but especially to the Munster dialect, I find it hard to follow the announcers.  Surely that is a matter that could be rectified.  I would ask the Minister to see to it that those people who come to the microphone to give us news in Irish are properly instructed how to make their voices clear and distinct: to make it possible, even for people who are not very well up in Irish, to follow them. If they do that they will be rendering a great service to the Irish language, they will be making it possible for people to take an interest in it, and even for those who are not well up in the language, they will be making it possible for them to become more fluent in their use of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I am on the subject of the Irish language, I want to say that I think extreme care should be taken, whenever there is a talk or a discourse in Irish over the radio or, as the Minister referred to it, any drama in Irish, that the very best speakers of Irish should be procured for that purpose.  After all, what comes from the radio station goes all over the country, and if people listen in and get accustomed to bad Irish, well that will be bad for the Irish language.  I am afraid that from time to time I do hear the Irish language spoken badly over the radio. The most important question of all, however, is that of the news.  In order to avoid making this feature&mdash;the ten <Col N="1508" /> minutes news in Irish&mdash;unpopular, we will have to see to it that the voices of the announcers carry over properly, that the announcers take their time and do not, as one might say, eat their words.</P>
    <P>I am in thorough agreement with those who advocate a news broadcast on Sundays at mid-day.  It may be said that to make this provision will mean extra expense.  I do not see why it should.  There is already somebody there putting on records, and it should be possible for that person to give a short bulletin that would satisfy listeners.  I am also at one with Deputy Brennan when he says that we should, from time to time, have lectures over the radio on subjects affecting the agricultural economy of this country.  To my mind they would be much more important than some of the talks we hear from time to time.  I think they would be more important than this new-verse competition.  I wonder how many take an interest in that?</P>

      <P>In my opinion, in order to appreciate poetry properly, one must sit down and read it.  One cannot properly appreciate poetry over the radio.  I must say that I myself am a great lover of poetry but, at the same time, I never could muster up enthusiasm for this new-verse competition. If I do not mistake, it has come to an end and I do not think it should be revived.  Then there is the question of people coming along, from time to time, to give interviews.  I do not think that these interviews serve any useful purpose.  They seem to me to consist of a series of set questions and answers, savouring very much of artificiality.  I do not know how many members of the House will agree with me in these views.  While I have made these few criticisms in the very best spirit, I must say that there has been a wonderful improvement in the Radio Eireann programmes over the past 12 months.  They have been definitely given a better Irish bias.  More prominence has been given to the Irish language and to Irish music.  On the subject of music, I do not at all agree <Col N="1509" /> with Deputy Brennan that we are getting too much ceilidh music.</P>

If what Deputy Brennan suggested could be done, I should like to see it tried.  I should like to see a variation of the ceilidh programme night after night, if that was feasible. I am very much in favour of ceilidh music but I am also in favour of the slow, traditional, Irish airs.  Nowadays, we seldom hear these slow, traditional, airs on the wireless.  While we have very good singers of slow, traditional airs, they do not seem to give them the prominence that they ought to give them.  In many cases they select Scottish Gaelic songs in preference to the Irish songs.  I have no objection to Scottish Gaelic songs.  They are very nice but I should like to see pride of place given to our own traditional songs.  The supposition, I think, at present is that the singing of Gaelic songs is a mark of superiority in the singer.  I prefer to hear the old traditional songs, such as &ldquo;A Mháirín de Bharra,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Sliabh na mBan.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reference has been made to Nuacht na Seachtaine.  I should not like to see that abolished.  I have made reference already to some of the announcers in the Irish language.  I am afraid that some of them do not speak sufficiently <Col N="1510" /> slowly and distinctly to enable the people to understand them.  That cannot be said of the person who reads Nuacht na Seachtaine.  He is most distinct. His voice is most clear and his Irish is musical, natural and perfect. Apart from the news value of the talk, I imagine it is a good education for students of the Irish language to listen in to Nuacht na Seachtaine on Sunday evenings.</P>
    <P>I am also in favour of a regional question time if it could be managed. It has been a success in many cases and it lends novelty to the item.  It creates not alone nation-wide interest but local interest.  If each region got its own opportunity, it would enhance the interest and value of question time. In conclusion, I must say that I am very pleased with the improvement that has taken place in the programmes. I hope that that improvement will continue and that whatever developments take place will be directed from the point of view of our own Irish culture&mdash;Irish songs, Irish music, Irish talks and everything else of cultural value.</P>

      <P>This Estimate is one which merits the close attention of the House.  It is gratifying to observe that, each year, greater interest is being evinced in this service by members of the House, generally.  That is as it should be, because wireless broadcasting is a service of ever-increasing importance. To appreciate its value, we might, even in ordinary peace times, merely refer to its utility as a cultural and educational instrument, as a form of entertainment readily available in every home and as a suitable medium for the distribution of news.  In a period of emergency, its importance becomes very much greater because it may be the only medium through which news can be transmitted and by which instructions can be given to the community at large to do certain things or to refrain from doing certain things.  In these circumstances, it is very important for the Department to ensure that the native station, Radio Eireann, be listened in to by as large a section of the community as possible and as frequently as possible.  Otherwise, <Col N="1511" /> its value in an emergency would be very much less than it should be.</P>
      <P>I regret to note that the progress made by Radio Eireann during the past 12 months has been very slight. It does not appear to be keeping in step with foreign broadcasting stations. That is a pity because I fear there is a general tendency to ignore the native station and to listen in more and more to foreign stations.  I am sure that that is largely due to the fact that the standard of entertainment provided by the native station is very much below that provided by the rival foreign stations.  I think that a little more initiative could, with advantage, be developed by the broadcasting authorities.  So far as we are concerned in this House, the Minister is the authority, because he is responsible to the House for the service.</P>
      <P>I do not see why the proceedings in this House could not be broadcast on selected occasions, say on Budget day, when only the leaders of the Government Party and the principal Opposition Parties speak.  That is an example of something which could be broadcast to the nation and which would focus attention on the Irish radio station.</P>
      <P>There is one specific complaint I should like to make with regard to the news bulletins.  In a general way the news bulletins are good inasmuch as they give a fairly reasonable summary of the current news.  The Irish nation is not behind time in broadcasting the news.  It should be apparent to everyone that as far as the broadcast of news is concerned it is necessary to repeat the broadcast of important news items in the various news summaries. What I am concerned with is that on Sunday there is only one news bulletin.  If there is any day in the week when there should be two or three news bulletins it is Sunday, for the simple reason that there are no afternoon or evening papers and that the news in the Sunday papers is stale.</P>

      <P>Another thing is that there has been no reference to television. Even before the war television in England was regarded as a practical <Col N="1512" /> proposition, and at that time everybody could have seen exhibitions of it and have satisfied themselves that it had reached a fair stage of perfection. The last thing I wish to refer to is a matter that was discussed at some length on this Estimate last year. Very severe criticism was levelled against the Department because of the niggardly fees paid in respect of performing rights.  I understand that the position in that regard has not improved materially.  I think that that is a deplorable state of affairs, as the matter was drawn to the attention of the Minister last year not only by members on this side of the House but, as far as I can recollect, by some of the Deputies on the Government side.  I understand that the position has not improved very much.  In fact, I know of one particular case where a play ran for almost an hour on the air and involved a month&rsquo;s work on the part of the author.  That was a month&rsquo;s very hard work, as I understand the technique in the preparation of such a play is very different from that needed in the ordinary course.  The author has to keep in mind that the audience can only hear the actors and not see them, and that involves a considerable amount of trouble in preparing plays for broadcasting.  In this particular instance I understand that, although the play ran for almost an hour and involved a month&rsquo;s work on the author&rsquo;s part, the princely sum of £3 3s. was paid to the author.  How on earth are we to encourage native talent, how are we to secure the best that is in our artists or bring out their literary talent, how can we provide listeners with good value for their money, if such small fees are paid?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>The point I wish to touch on is that of the failure of the boradcasting authorities, on St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day, to broadcast a very important soccer match played in Dublin, and which was of very great interest to some thousands of people on both sides of the Border.  That match was of sufficient importance to be broadcast. I would like also to ask those who prepared the sports programme why it was that a very important match between Old Belvedere and <Col N="1513" /> Blackrock&mdash;and the replay of that match&mdash;was not broadcast, although it was of great interest all over Ireland, and I would like to know if there is any reasonable explanation.</P>
      <P>I wonder if the authorities were aware of the great interest displayed in the Shamrock Rovers v. Waterford soccer match and the Cork v. Dundalk soccer match&mdash;both of them semi-finals of the Irish Cup.  Again, there was another match between Cork and Dundalk&mdash;a semi-final replay&mdash;and there was a match between Shamrock Rovers and Waterford&mdash;another semi-final replay&mdash;and there was a final, and again there was a replay between Cork and Waterford.  I wish to give credit to the authorities if there was any difficulty which prevented the matches being broadcast.  It is true that they gave a quarter of an hour for an outline of the play at news time, and those interested in soccer were very pleased with what was done.  However, the sporting type who may not have been listening to the news at the news hour, when a review of the match was given, were keenly disappointed&mdash; firstly that none of the matches was broadcast and, secondly, that they were not listening at the news time.</P>
      <P>I wish to assure the authorities that they need not be afraid of any type of public opinion in their broadcast of soccer or rugby matches.  At any time in Dalymount Park or any of the principal parks in this city you will see 30,000 people at these matches&mdash; members of the National Army, members of the Old I.R.A. and followers of certain forms of sport who are not supposed to be there, according to their rules, but are there all the same. The Irish Government should face up to their responsibility.  I can assure them that it was a sight worth seeing when 30,000&mdash;on one occasion 32,000&mdash; were at a football match, and when the National Anthem of this country was played they stood with their hats off and most of them joined in it themselves. We have Ministers of State who enjoy these soccer matches.  The Government should, once and for all, in case there is any prejudice against it, face the fact that the country as a whole desires no prejudices so far as the sport of the country is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1514" /> It is to be hoped that when any of these important games come around again the sports editor will take into consideration the feelings and views of the many thousands of people who would like to listen-in.</P>
    <P>I would also ask the Government to consider, when they are broadcasting news, that they have listeners in many countries.  There are thousands of listeners, our own countrymen, in Liverpool, Manchester, Glasgow, in many parts of England, and items that might be of interest to them, showing how the old country is going on, should be considered, and, possibly, an extra five minutes, especially on Sunday, might be given for the benefit of listeners in other countries.</P>
    <P>A year ago I felt I had a complaint, although it was not personal.  I was at a very prominent function at which a Minister made a very fine statement on the outlook of this country, and gave his views on its prosperity.  The Minister&rsquo;s speech was broadcast, but the moment the leading light of the Opposition Bench stood up to make his speech, and to put his point of view&mdash; which was very interesting for those who heard&mdash;the broadcast was switched off.  May I say, with all respect to the Minister, that the second speech was equally as important and as interesting to the public, regardless of Party politics, as the first speech.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. D. Morrissey Mr. D. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the reason why it was switched off.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>There were some people who said that the second speech, being a criticism of the original statement, was more important and more interesting. That was a matter of opinion.</P>
      <P>About 12 months ago I raised the question here, which Dr. Hannigan has referred to, in regard to the niggardly fees that are paid to our Irish artistes when they are called upon to entertain our public.  I think, for our own Irish artistes who give very valuable hours of entertainment to our people and to those across the water, the fees should be on a greater scale.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another little point.  I do not think there is any prejudice, but those who are in charge might bear it in mind.  It does not affect myself. Some time ago there was a review of <Col N="1515" />&ldquo;What was said in the Dáil to-day&rdquo;. The review gave questions and the Minister&rsquo;s replies, and they were very interesting to all who heard them.  One Deputy, apparently, asked a very important question, the reply to which was of sufficient importance to take up three minutes of the radio programme, but it was not mentioned that it was in reply to Deputy So-and-so that the Minister made this important announcement, although prior to that it had been stated that the other replies quoted were in reply to Deputy So-and-so. When it came to a very important matter, affecting the country as a whole, the reply of the Minister was given but it was not mentioned that it was in reply to Deputy So-and-so.  I do not think that is playing the game and, honestly, I do not think it was intended, but it was commented on by at least three members of the Dáil quite recently that if names are to be mentioned and if an Opposition Deputy does raise an important matter which is worthy of announcement on Radio Eireann it ought to be stated that it was in reply to Deputy So-and-so, as was done with the five or six questions that were quoted prior to the question to which I refer.  Again, I say, it does not affect myself.  I earnestly hope that these little points will be noted.  On the whole, I am glad to see that progress is being made in the station.  I cannot agree with the Deputy who criticised the announcements in Irish because, while I personally do not quite follow as much as I would like to the announcements made in Irish, members of my household have told me that they are most interesting and are very clear and easy to translate.  From that point of view, I do not see that there is any reason to complain.</P>
    <P>I wish to thank the Minister responsible for very kindly granting to many of our charitable institutions the use of the radio for the purpose of making appeals.  The privilege was extended to me by the authorities to make appeals on behalf of one or two very charitable causes, and I have heard expressions of satisfaction and gratification by those who have had the use of the radio to make the appeals for the <Col N="1516" /> many deserving causes that we hear of regularly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. D. Morrissey Mr. D. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that there has been an improvement in the programmes from our radio service.  I should like to say that there was room for improvement.  I think we ought not to forget the fact that what is broadcast from this country is not confined to this country, that we have listeners in other countries.  We ought to remember that people in outside countries are, perhaps, inclined to judge our country by the type of programme we put over the air.  If we are so critical of these programmes ourselves and if we are not satisfied with them&mdash;so far as many of the items are concerned I think we have reason to be gravely dissatisfied&mdash;we must assume that outsiders cannot hold a very high opinion of the programme as a whole.</P>
      <P>Before I go on to one or two points in connection with the figures given by the Minister, I should like to join with the other speakers in asking why it is that we can have no news broadcast in this country on Sunday until ten o&rsquo;clock at night?  Of course, I know there is a broadcast of news in Irish at an earlier hour.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>There may be some reason for it but it is difficult for the ordinary person to understand what it is.  Many Deputies, while making complaint here to-day, seemed to try to excuse the Minister on the ground that to do such and such a thing would cost money.  May I remind the Deputies that the income of this service last year was £125,000 and the amount spent on it was £70,509.  Have I got the Minister&rsquo;s figures correctly?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>We find, as I say, an improvement in the programme.  We find, on the other hand, that our programme does not start until 6.30 in the evening.  Of course, we get sponsored programmes in the middle of the day, news at 1.40 and then there is a gap until 6.30.  The station closes down at eleven o&rsquo;clock.  Frankly, I do not consider <Col N="1517" /> that the quality of the programme put over the air or the number of hours devoted to it are, particularly at present, in keeping with the dignity of this country.</P>
      <P>I agree absolutely with Deputies who commented on the very low fees that are paid to artistes.  Does anybody think that if you get a person down the country worth hearing on the air, two or three guineas is going to attract that person to broadcast from the city?  I do not want to be picking holes unduly but I wonder if any member of the House tried to listen a few nights ago to a broadcast of a concert that was being held in a theatre in the city.  If any Deputy tuned in to that particular broadcast, how long was it before he switched off?  Anything more uninteresting, I think, was never attempted over the air.  Part of the programme, which may have been, and which I am sure was, very interesting and very entertaining from the point of view of the people in the theatre was far from entertaining as it came over the air. Most of the time was taken up with the description of a ballet and we heard something like this: &ldquo;Now they are moving to the left, now they are moving to the right, now they are coming down the centre, now something else is happening.&rdquo;  At least 20 minutes was devoted to a description of that kind&mdash;a complete waste of time.  It was started, I might say, in the middle of a performance given by one of the most popular artistes in the country. Then the balance of the time was taken up giving us a description of the ballet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to know why the Minister talks about economy, why this service should be as strangled as it is&mdash; perhaps that is too strong a word to use&mdash;but why should it be restricted in the way it is when there is a surplus and when that surplus, subscribed by the licence holders of the country, is going into the general revenue of the country?  Let us face the fact that the result of all this is that you merely collect a licence fee of 12/6 from the owner of a radio set and the person who pays that fee to the State listens for nine-tenths of the time to a British station.  We do not want that.  We <Col N="1518" /> want to get our people interested in our own programmes.  We want to make the programme so interesting that the people will, of their own choice, tune in to their own station.  I do not agree with Deputy Kissane that interviews are as uninteresting as he describes.</P>
    <P>I think that interviews can be very interesting and very informative.  I agree with Deputy Brennan and others that we should have more talks upon agriculture and horticulture.  It is, however, one thing to have talks.  It is quite another thing to make these talks as interesting as they should be. Most of these talks can be made very interesting and there is no doubt that, particularly at a period like the present, farmers and, as Deputy Corish stated, plot-holders, many of whom never tilled a piece of ground before, could benefit considerably if proper advice were given over the radio regarding the sowing and cultivation of crops and vegetables.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister when he is concluding to tell us why there is only one news service on Sunday and also why an hour per day has been taken off the programme.  Having regard to the total amount subscribed by licence holders, the saving made as a result of that curtailment of an hour in the programme is, I think, paltry. The Minister mentioned another figure, but I do not know whether I got it correctly.  He estimates a drop in income for the present year of £12,000. Have I got that figure correctly?</P>

      <P>In any case we can, I think, safely assume that the Department is correct in its assumption that there will not be any increase in the number of licensed holders during the present financial year.  A statement of <Col N="1519" /> that kind in a year like this is, I think, a sufficient commentary on the service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcCann" hpid="Mr. McCann Mr. McCann">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCann</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been criticising this service in public and in private for so many years that I wonder if anything I say now on a war-time Estimate is likely to be of any avail.  I am somewhat disturbed by the fact that there is to be a reduction of £800 in the cost of programmes.  I think that it was I who first raised the question here last year of authors&rsquo; fees.  There has been some little improvement in the fees that have been paid to authors since last year, but I am not at all satisfied that the present scale of fees is such as will attract the best writers and the best craftsmen to write for the Irish station.  You can only get the best by paying for the best.  I have based my arguments for increased fees always on the fact that this service is run at a profit.  Down the years there has been a surplus.  Last year there was something in the neighbourhood of £50,000 of a surplus.  Why should that money go into the Central Exchequer when there are writers and artistes generally who are not being adequately paid for their work?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I heard a remark recently in this House to the effect that there was no art in Ireland.  Ireland is teeming with art, but there is no respect for art in Ireland.  The artiste is supposed to work for the most measly pittance. Art is taken as something incidental. The work of an author in producing a script and getting it printed is not taken into account at all.  It is just as if he were only filling in time or filling up columns.  I think that a fee of £3 3s. for the copyright of a play that contains something in the neighbourhood of 10,000 words is a miserable remuneration considering that from the worst pulp magazine in any country the author would get at least double that figure for a work of equal length.  I have appealed to the Minister on many occasions, and asked him to appeal to the Minister for Finance, because I am told that the Minister for Finance has the last word on all those questions.  Why on earth that should be I do not know.  I have appealed time and again, and pointed out that the <Col N="1520" /> station, to my mind, is not anything like what it should be.  There seems to be a looseness there, a lack of businesslike ability, and, above all, a lack of showmanship.  The station is just another Department of State, and that should not be.  If you want to have successful showmanship&mdash;and that is what broadcasting is&mdash;then you will have to have showmen behind the business.</P>
    <P>The Minister might explain why Radio Eireann charges the advertiser a maximum of £220 per hour and yet can afford the script writer only three guineas for filling that same hour.  That sounds incredible, but it is true.  The advertisers, I understand, are charged a maximum of £220 per hour on Sunday, going down to a minimum of £1 per minute on other days.  Generally, I have always thought that the station under proper direction could do much in this country to co-ordinate musical effort.  Every year we have a number of feiseanna throughout the country, and we have a Feis Ceoil here in Dublin. Some wonderful performers are discovered each year.  Recently we had Hugh Maguire; I hope that is not the last we are to hear of Hugh Maguire.  Every year at the Feis Ceoil I have heard wonderful performers from all over the country, but, as Deputy Morrissey remarked, there is no inducement whatever to bring those performers before the microphone again.  They get a ridiculously small fee for travelling from the country, putting up at an hotel over-night and going back again.  The whole thing is farcical.  From time to time I have despaired about it.  It is not an Irish station; it is a Dublin station so far as performers are concerned.  I do not like saying this, but from the inception of the station up to the present I have felt that there is a clique around it&mdash; that the whole thing is just run for the benefit of a few.  I advocated on previous occasions that the station should employ talent scouts.  Before the war the B.B.C. thought it worth their while to send men through the Twenty Six Counties looking for talent. I know a number of young writers and performers who got their chance on the B.B.C., due to being actually sought after.  They were always <Col N="1521" /> anxious to get talent.  They looked for it and they paid for it.  Unfortunately Irish authors and Irish performers have perforce to go abroad to get anything in the nature of proper recompense for their work.  The whole thing is very serious to me.  I hope it is equally serious to the Minister.  I know a number of people who depend for their livelihood upon their writing and their ability to perform.  That is why I have always advocated the setting up of an advisory board, a board composed of people who understand the whole question.  I have no fault to find with civil servants.  I do not criticise a civil servant because he is a civil servant, or because of red tape, but I do say that behind any service you must have specialised knowledge, and I think there should be a proper advisory committee set up.  The Minister promised me last year, when replying, that he would go into the question of setting up a proper advisory board, but so far nothing has been done about it, I am sorry to say.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I should like to refer to the criticism which was levelled at the school programmes here recently. I think that, of all the programmes coming over the air, that particular programme is excellent.  The five minutes in English is probably one of the best done scripts that I know.  I will not delay the House any longer&mdash; I have often delayed the Minister in private&mdash;but I would again ask the Minister to go carefully into the whole question.</P>

      <P>Like other speakers who have criticised the programmes of Radio Eireann, I should like to draw the Minister&rsquo;s attention to one particular defect which I am sure has caused complaints from many subscribers. There is a feeling that there is no supervision over programmes which are relayed in connection with concerts.  I think that, when arrangements are being made for the relaying of concerts, somebody should be given an opportunity of deciding the types of items which are to be given.  I think our listeners are entitled to the best possible talent in that respect.  I might particularly refer to a relay which was <Col N="1522" /> to have taken place on last Sunday evening.  A good many people were very anxious to hear a certain item, but, due to some defect on the stage or wherever the broadcast was taking place, there was no possibility of getting the effects as they should be.  I am of opinion&mdash;a good many other people have been complaining also&mdash; that this very often applies to other relays of concerts.  There is no supervision to ensure that proper instructions are given to whoever is broadcasting. Quite a number of people complained to me during the week that they could not hear a particular concert to which they were very anxious to listen.  I would ask the Minister to look into the matter, and see that those defects are remedied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a few matters to which I wish to direct the Minister&rsquo;s attention.  One of the complaints which I have heard is that the news in English at 6.45 in the evening is too early for country people who keep the winter time.  They have not come back for their evening meal, so that they have no opportunity of hearing the first evening news.  I suggest that 7.30 would be a better time, and would be more satisfactory for the people who live in rural areas.  Another complaint is that the news bulletin is almost wholly devoted to war news.  We can hear news from half-a-dozen stations, and it is almost the same from each one.  If we listen to the German and English stations we hear the same as we get from Radio Eireann.  No doubt, you get both sides of the official bulletins from our station, but I do not think the people of the country are so very interested in war news.  A great many people say that they get too much war news.  I think there ought to be less war news and some more news of local interest which would identify this country as Ireland.  This war news might be given out from any country in the world, and is given out from most countries.  In our news bulletin there ought to be items concerning our own country, but since the war started we have really got no news at all about our own country.  I hope some more time will be devoted to <Col N="1523" /> news of Irish interest, instead of having each news bulletin devoted almost entirely to war news.</P>
      <P>Deputy Byrne complained that sufficient time was not devoted to broadcasts of soccer matches.  I, and, I am sure, many Deputies here, would like to complain that sufficient time is not given to the broadcasting of hurling matches and football matches in the Gaelic code.  Many inter-county and inter-provincial matches are not given sufficient time, and I think that 97 per cent. of our people are interested in these matches, while there may be 3 or 4 per cent.&mdash;and I doubt if there are as many&mdash;interested in soccer matches. I think the big majority should be catered for before the small minority&mdash; not that I have any objection to hearing broadcasts of any game.  I think, however, that what the big majority are interested in should be given more time than what the small minority are interested in.</P>
      <P>Other Deputies have suggested that some time should be given to items of agricultural interest, and I think that is most important.  Some time is devoted to matters of horticultural interest on Saturday evening between 5 and 6 o&rsquo;clock, but the hour is most inappropriate, and it is only people in cities and towns who can listen to these broadcasts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. D. Morrissey Mr. D. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Morrissey</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Probably very few.  So far as people living in country areas are concerned, not one in a thousand will listen to them because their radios are not on at that time.  Broadcasts on horticulture or agricultural matters should be given at an hour in the evening when people living in the country areas will be in a position to listen to them, and I think that at least twice a week there should be broadcasts on matters of interest to the agricultural community.  There are very many items of interest to such people which could be broadcast and our broadcasting station should cater to a greater extent for these people.  Listening to the radio, one is struck by the fact <Col N="1524" /> that only Dublin city, or certain small urban areas, are being catered for. One has that kind of feeling about it, and people often say that they would not bother to listen to our radio programme because it is so poor.  The largest possible sum necessary to provide the best possible programme should be spent, and no expense should be spared.  We have other revenue-producing Departments and there is no reason in the world why the radio should be a revenue-producing service. Any revenue got from wireless licences should be devoted to the production of a programme second to none in the world.  The Irish people are entitled to that.  Our programmes are broadcast all over the world and we are entitled to a programme of which we can be proud, and not to the poor programme which, more often than not, is put across.</P>
      <P>I am voicing the opinions of a great number of people who listen to the radio and who are dissatisfied because our programme is not of the standard it should be.  Something should be done to set a standard and the Irish people are entitled to have a standard in regard to our radio programmes unequalled by any other radio service in the world.  We have plenty of material for the provision of a good programme, and I think we should get it.  It is necessary from the national point of view, because it will counteract the foreign broadcasts, and if people cannot get an interesting programme from our radio, they will listen to foreign broadcasts.  We heard during the debate on the Education Estimate last week that foreign broadcasts have a bad effect on the Irish language, for instance.  People will listen to the station giving the most interesting programme and, for that reason, it is all the more important that our programme should be such as to interest the largest possible number and to keep their interest all the time, and not compel them to listen to foreign broadcasts.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to express my alarm at the suggestion made by Deputy Hannigan that the business of this House should be broadcast.  If that suggestion were put into effect, I <Col N="1525" /> am afraid that some of us who have very little to say would be compelled to remain dumb.  Another aspect of the suggestion is that if the business of this House is to be broadcast to any extent, a little more care would require to be taken in regard to the preparation of the agenda, and at a moment when the country is labouring under the shock of a big national tragedy, at least some time should be devoted in the House to a consideration of that tragedy, and of the means of overcoming it.  I am not altogether in favour of the suggestion by Deputy Hannigan, and I do not think it would be accepted generally.  Although the Minister is a very decent man, and very popular, I am not sure that we could trust him to put this House on the air at the most appropriate times.  The broadcast might be made at a time when the standard of debate was very low, or at a time when the level of tempers was too high.  I suggest that the Minister should be cautious about adopting this proposal, and even more cautious about adopting the proposal in regard to television.  If this House is to be televised&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;it will be a very serious matter.  My suggestion, so far as broadcasting the business of this House is concerned, is that the Minister might be able to find somebody who would be capable of picking out the interesting business and sub-editing it for presentation to the people.  That is a suggestion which might be valuable, particularly if the proceedings were broadcast, not as part of the ordinary news, but for a special quarter of an hour or half an hour at some other period of the night.</P>
      <P>With regard to propaganda, I agree that there is a great danger in our people paying too much attention to the propaganda of other nations, and particularly of belligerent nations.  I suggest that a little more informative propaganda should be broadcast from Radio Eireann in support of our attitude towards international affairs at the moment, that is, the attitude of neutrality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1526" /> That attitude should be more thoroughly explained, not only to our own people, but to the people of other countries.  It may be said that the propaganda of one set of belligerents cancels that of the other, but the fact of the matter is that the people who sympathise with one of the belligerents will not listen to the propaganda of the other, whereas the Irish people, without exception, will listen to statements on the national position from responsible leaders of opinion in this country, and I think it is desirable that such statements should be made at frequent intervals, so that public opinion might be kept stabilised in support of our position of neutrality in this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I have only a few remarks to make on this Vote.  I agree with Deputy Allen that there is too much in connection with war in the news coming from Radio Eireann. Goodness knows, we hear enough lies from the two sets of belligerents, and I think we should hear more of our own news.  I am very much surprised that, in a year like the present, with the emergency conditions which we are undergoing, there is not more time devoted to rural affairs.  At least half an hour should be devoted every night&mdash;probably from about eight to nine o&rsquo;clock, when rural families will be at home&mdash;to agricultural subjects: advising plotholders how to work their plots and advising farmers, generally, on agricultural subjects and things of that description.  Thousands of pounds are spent on advertisements in newspapers in connection with agricultural subjects, which nobody ever reads&mdash;in the country, at any rate&mdash;but the radio, which is in practically every rural home and turned on at night, is very little used for the purpose of such advertisements. We ought to have enough agricultural officials in this country, goodness knows&mdash;and, indeed, we have plenty of good ones, to give them their due, between Glasnevin and the Department of Agriculture&mdash;and I think it would be a good thing to get one of these officials to speak on the radio each night, on agricultural matters, for about half an hour.  In the first instance, this is an agricultural <Col N="1527" /> country; in the second instance, you are going to be short of food; and in the third instance, about three-fourths of our plotholders do not know how to work their plots properly.  That is a hard thing to say about an agricultural country, such as ours, but it is a fact none the less, and advice of that description, if it were given over the radio each night, would do a great deal of good.  It would be far more useful, and more appreciated by the country in general, than having reports of Deputy Byrne&rsquo;s soccer matches or a full-dress report of Deputy Cogan&rsquo;s speeches in the Dáil.</P>
      <P>That is the only matter I wish to refer to, but I think it is something that should be done.  Unless something along that line is done there is no use in clapping on news or anything else early in the evening when the agricultural community are out working in the fields.  There should be a special programme, from about seven o&rsquo;clock in the evening until about eleven, for the rural community in particular.  The majority of these people do not see a newspaper except on Saturdays, and then they buy it only to get three-ha&rsquo;pence worth of lies.  Surely if these people have gone to the trouble and expense of installing a wireless set in their homes, they ought to get some agricultural instruction from Radio Eireann to help them out in their difficulties. Another thing to which I should like to refer is that when they do start off with the news they start with prices on the Dublin Stock Exchange, which nobody would bother about except a bunch of thieves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>They should give us some information about the price of cattle and things of that kind.  It would be better to give more agricultural news. As far as I can see, our nation is catering for a bunch of gamblers around Dublin who draw the money from the country boy.  If the Minister does not change his tune in regard to that matter, he will have a bigger deficit next year, because these people will <Col N="1528" /> throw their wireless sets out the windows.  These wireless sets, of course, bring a certain amount of pleasure into the homes of country people who were lonesome before, but there is very little trouble, or none at all, taken, to give the country people the kind of thing that they require, and if a little of the money that is spent on advertising in the newspapers were to be put into advertising over Radio Eireann, it would have a very good effect, particularly in a period like the present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know that I would be able to deal with all the suggestions that have been made this evening, and I think it would be a more satisfactory way of dealing with them if I were to undertake that I will have all the suggestions that have been made very carefully examined.  It is very useful and very encouraging to find people taking such a keen interest in the station, and although we might not be able to agree with all the suggestions that have been made, at least we can have them carefully examined with a view to seeing what we can do to meet the various proposals.  Deputy Brennan referred to the use of the short-wave station, and being able to vary wave-lengths and so on.  It is impossible, really, to give details of how it is proposed to cope with any emergency that may arise, but the Deputy may be assured that every effort will be made to ensure that the broadcasting service will continue to operate under emergency conditions so far as it is physically possible for us to do so with the equipment that we have at our disposal at the present time.  Frankly, we are handicapped through the lack of certain equipment which we should like to get.  We made great efforts to get it, but so far have not succeeded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apparently, there is almost unanimity in the demand for some news on Sunday.  Thinking over that matter myself, the only thing that occurred to me was that the people who were doing the broadcasting of news were working-people.  It is a pretty severe job, and I suppose they are entitled to a day off during the week, the same as other people.  I shall have the matter inquired into with a view <Col N="1529" /> to seeing whether some arrangement could be made.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. D. Morrissey Mr. D. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that that is a matter that should be attended to, and it seems to me that we should get a better reason than the Minister has given, because I can assure him that that is a very sore point with people in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>Representations may have been made to the station in that regard, but I have not heard of them. I think it would be a very good thing if people would write to the station and inform us of their complaints.  I prefer to indicate the policy of the station rather than to interfere in detail, but it would be really useful if the general public would send in their views and suggestions to the Director of Broadcasting.  If it does not involve extra expenditure of money, I think that we ought to do all that we can in the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. D. Morrissey Mr. D. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister says: &ldquo;if it does not require expenditure of extra money.&rdquo;  It would appear that there is about 60 per cent. of a surplus, and why should not an additional announcer be put on, and a salary paid to him, in order to give the people what they require?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>I hear in all directions about the question of money.  In normal circumstances, I should be ambitious to do as Deputy Allen has suggested and make our station as good as any station in the world, but I am sure the Deputy will realise that, under present conditions, sacrifices have to be made.  We are regarded now as an earning Department&mdash;unfortunately in one sense&mdash;because the Department of Finance contends that we were in debt for a considerable number of years and were really a losing Department, although we are now making money.  Apart from that somewhat technical aspect, I am very keen, myself, to have proposals put up which would increase the revenue for the station, but everybody will realise that, with the present financial stringency, it is not possible to do all that we would like to do.  That applies to a <Col N="1530" /> good many of the suggestions that have been made, especially the reference to artistes&rsquo; fees.</P>
      <P>We did make some small improvement in the matter of artistes&rsquo; fees and we should like to make more, but, on the other hand, authors who write plays may write one that will be acted more than once and every time it is acted the author will get a further royalty.  Besides that, as Deputy McCann admitted, referring to the activities of British broadcasting, young artistes get opportunities of coming before the public, opportunities which they would not otherwise get, and in that way they are to some extent compensated.  I would not press that argument very far.  It is really a question of the amount of money that we have at our disposal.  Certainly the tendency on our part would not be to be niggardly if we had adequate funds at our disposal.</P>
      <P>Deputy Brennan referred to agricultural talks.  I went into that matter some time ago and I had before me a list of talks given on agricultural subjects. I was surprised how many had been given.  I had quite a formidable list of lectures given by experts.  We are always quite willing to give lectures. I do not agree with Deputy Corry, that the farmers would like to get a lecture on farming for breakfast, supper and tea.  They might be the first to get tired of lectures on agriculture, because they are engaged in agriculture all through the day.</P>

      <P>We do so.  The Deputy would be surprised if he saw the list of lectures.  Probably Deputy Corry does not listen to all of them, but large numbers of people hear them.  Suggestions were made about putting the <Col N="1531" /> Irish news before the other news.  There is no question of a contrast between the Irish and the English news.  It is really a question of giving first the news which is most interesting.  The news which is considered most interesting comes first.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>The Irish news is always the most important for Irish listeners, most of whom have already heard the English war news an hour before.  As it is, they have to listen to the English news first and then comes the Irish news.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Not at all.  I think it was a week last Monday that Cardinal MacRory made a statement about his pastoral being held up and that was almost the last item in the news.  All the English war news was given before it.  Surely the Minister does not suggest that for Irish listeners the war news was more important than Cardinal MacRory&rsquo;s statement?  That is merely one instance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>People hold different views as to when items of that kind should be given.  I imagine that our news editors are very anxious to give important Irish news items first. Possibly we have gone too far in the other direction, but I think that most people are mesmerised by the terrible <Col N="1532" /> tragedy of the war and they are very anxious to hear what is going on.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>We did intend to take &ldquo;question time&rdquo; around the country and to do more broadcasting from outside. Sometimes we broadcast a concert from elsewhere than the station. But all that involves extra telephone lines and the employment of people to act as comperes and generally supervise. We were going to provide an extra officer to do that outside work but, unfortunately, it was a question of saving money.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">

      <P>That is regarded as a form of taxation.  We did not initiate that.  This Department is regarded as a revenue-earning Department, and the money goes into the general funds and we get what is considered sufficient to run the station.  Under present circumstances I find it difficult to complain, as the stringency in regard to money is so great.  The complaint made by Deputy Kissane about the news in Irish is one about which I find a great difference of opinion.  We have three announcers representing the three different dialects.  Some people complained about the speakers, but of late I have not heard a great deal of complaint.  I did hear a complaint <Col N="1533" /> from Irish-speaking districts that we did not give enough news in Irish.  In the Irish-speaking districts I think the weekly summary is greatly appreciated. Of course, it is very hard to please everybody.</P>

One of the aspects I was interested in was to try to give a picture of Irish life and of the important events that occur.  That was done sometimes through interviews.  I agree with Deputy Cogan that broadcasting the proceedings in the Dáil would be very undesirable.  Generally speaking, if one is listening here there is a pause, so that the atmosphere of the Dáil would not come through on the wireless in an interesting way. Perhaps the only thing that might get through would be something which nobody would want to go out to the world as a specimen of Irish events.</P>

      <P>That is going to be considered. Television involves the installation of apparatus of the most costly kind.  Even in normal times it would have to be the subject of careful examination before we could spend money on it.  Under present conditions that is out of the question.

      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  It is more than probable that one of the prime causes of industrial disputes in this country in recent years has been the multiplicity of trade unions, with overlapping activities, so that in many cases there have been two or more unions organising the same class and the same grade of workers in one industrial concern. As a consequence of such overlapping, competition for members has become keen.  The unions have made demands upon employers, and have ultimately resorted to strike action, not because wages are unjust or conditions of employment unreasonable, but primarily to anticipate action by rival unions, and by success in pursuing demands to secure increased prestige and membership for themselves.  Similarly, when a stoppage has taken place, if a dispute is in the way of being settled, further undue dislocation in trade and industry may be caused by the fact that, where a number of trade unions are engaged in the particular dispute, some of them may prove, for the same reasons of prestige, recalcitrant, even when the others have come to an agreement.  It is more than merely regrettable from all points of view that inter-unions should exist. Such disputes may constitute a positive menace to the economic well-being of the whole community.  They may damage not only the unions involved, but industry as a whole.  They may occasion irreparable loss to many innocent people.  Sometimes, indeed, they have culminated in open inter-trade union warfare manifesting itself in types of strikes completely without merit, whether viewed from the standpoint of the employers, the workers, or the public.  Frequently, in the case of such strikes, no claims for improved wages, hours of work, or conditions of employment, have been presented as an excuse for the general paralysis of the industrial undertaking which has had the misfortune to be chosen as the battle ground.  On the contrary, this ground has been chosen, and the strike has been openly or, I should almost say, shamelessly fought by the trade <Col N="1536" /> unions, simply to secure for the victor the exclusive right to employment for his own members in the particular trade or area, or sometimes even the particular operation involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In consequence, we have had this sort of thing happening.  There is a certain key industry in connection with which a wages agreement between employers and the trade unions is made annually.  In this industry, in a certain year, a particular union was approached first and negotiated and signed an agreement prescribing the wages to be paid for that season.  There was a second union also engaged in organising the workers in this industry, and it was then approached and likewise signed the agreement.  In the following year, however, the order of approach was reversed, the second union negotiating and signing the agreement first.  The union which, in the previous year, had been the first to negotiate, thereupon refused to sign the agreement governing wages for the second year.  Its members went on strike and work in this key industry was held up for a considerable time, not because of any quarrel about wages or conditions of employment, but merely on a punctilio of union prestige. Then, again, we have the position in the transport industry where we have unions which will not sit in conference with other trade unions, even though the latter have a significant number of the workers engaged in the industry enrolled.  In other occupations, we have unions the members of which are not permitted to, or will not, work side by side with the members of other unions, with the consequence that Government contracts and other important works have sometimes been held up for long periods.  In the engineering industry we have at least 16 unions catering for the workers. Some of these were formed as a result of secession from the older unions, and some even by successive secessions from the first seceders.  We can imagine in these circumstances how harmonious the relations between the splinter unions are, and how vigorously they poach upon each other&rsquo;s preserves.  But consider the general effect upon industrial conditions of all that in this country.  Let me exemplify it by an <Col N="1537" /> example.  After many years of effort, my Department by a fortuitous combination of circumstances succeeded in getting a group to reopen the Dublin dockyard which, as the House knows, had been closed for many years.</P>
    <P>The company concerned in that enterprise had to negotiate with no less than 27 trade unions in recruiting labour.  What a task that was for the employers to face, together with all the special difficulties of this time.  All the possibilities of internal dissension in such a firm can be easily imagined, and they are not imaginary only for, though every precaution had been taken before the dockyard was reopened to obviate the possibility of a stoppage occurring or a strike, a strike did take place not so long ago in that concern which might have resulted in its closing down permanently.</P>
    <P>Now, I am not to be taken as adjudicating upon the particular merits of any one of these causes of inter-trade union disputes.  Sometimes, indeed, so much may be said on both sides that these disputes are often more bitter and prolonged than disputes between master and man, but, without prejudicing the merits of any particular case, I think that we are entitled to ask: Where is this inter-union rivalry going to lead? That is a question which I have no doubt many thinking trade unionists, followers as well as leaders, are putting to themselves.  The trouble indeed with a dispute between trade unions is, that it is no mere private quarrel.  It has public consequences often of a very grave character.  It is all very well for unions to have their points of difference, but when they eventuate in economic civil war which deprives other workers in other unions of employment and paralyses productive effort, their quarrels cannot be ignored by those who are charged with the well-being of the State any more than they can continue to be ignored by those who desire to see a strong, effective and responsible trade union movement in this country.  The truth in regard to the existing position is this: that if it be left to develop it will lead not to labour solidarity but to labour anarchy: if every group, with its disgruntled <Col N="1538" /> workers, is to be left free to break away from the parent organisation and form one union after another, all of them to fight for their own hand out of the loss of hardship which may be inflicted on the community, we shall have eventually a state of affairs in which public opinion will become so exasperated that an irresistible demand will grow up to put someone in power who will squelch the lot.  This Government does not wish that situation to arise.  Neither, I am sure, does any other section of the House desire it.  For this reason we have introduced this Bill, in the belief that its provisions will go a long way to reduce inter-union rivalry, while permitting full legitimate trade union activities for the protection of the classes of persons joined together in these associations.</P>
    <P>In order to appreciate the effect of the proposals contained in the measure, I should begin by explaining that, under the Trade Union Acts, 1871 to 1935, a trade union means any combination, whether temporary or permanent, the principal objects of which are, under its constitution, statutory objects.  In this context, the expression &ldquo;statutory objects&rdquo; means &ldquo;the regulation of the relations between workmen and masters or between workmen and workmen or between masters and masters or the imposing of restrictive conditions on the conduct of any trade or business and also the provision of benefits to members.&rdquo;  Any seven or more members of a trade union may obtain registration of the union by merely subscribing their names to the rules of the union, submitting these rules, with a list of the union officers and their addresses, and the address of the registered office of the union to the Registrar of Friendly Societies and by complying with certain other provisions as to registry, including the satisfying of the registrar that the principal objects of the union are statutory objects.  Both registered and unregistered trade unions are entitled to operate as such.  At the moment, certain trades unions in this country are registered.  Certain others are not registered, while some are British trades unions, recorded &mdash; as the <Col N="1539" /> term is&mdash;in this country prior to 1922. Others are British trades unions which are neither recorded nor registered here.  Prior to 1922, I should explain, a trade union registered in Great Britain could be recorded in this country and so enjoy here the benefits of a registered trade union.  A decision in a recent action between two trades unions has made clear that a union registered in Great Britain cannot be recorded at the present time in this country.  While the court made no pronouncement on the situation of unions recorded here prior to 1922, their position must, I presume, be regarded as doubtful.</P>
    <P>It will be seen that any group of seven or more individuals may set up as a registered trade union by complying with certain simple conditions. Provided they draw up suitable rules, have a registered office and purport to pursue the statutory objects, they can proceed to organise workmen or, for that matter, masters, of any class or classes.  The result of this freedom to set up trade unions has, I believe, been to encourage the formation of break-away unions when a section of the union becomes dissatisfied with the existing management or conditions.  It cannot be said that the right to secede and set up a new union is bad in itself. It may, indeed, represent one means of dealing with evils in the parent union concerned.  It becomes unjustifiable, however, if exercised without a sense of responsibility &mdash; if, for instance, it is due merely to the personal ambition of one or more members of the union or if it is due, as it is suggested has sometimes been the case, to resentment by some member or members, or some official, because of disciplinary action rightfully taken by the union against him, and a desire to revenge such action on the union concerned.</P>
    <P>The evil effects of the secession tendency on the economic life of the community are manifested, however, when a new union proceeds to make exaggerated claims on employers in order to acquire a reputation for successful action on behalf of its members, and follows up <Col N="1540" /> those claims by inducing a withdrawal of labour.  In such circumstances, trade union leaders who are conducting the affairs of their union with a full sense of responsibility to their members and to the nation are often compelled to increase their demands beyond what they believe to be justifiable in order to compete for membership with the break-away union. Beyond question, therefore, the present unsatisfactory position of the trade union law tends not merely to disrupt the trade union movement and to destroy sound and enlightened leadership within it, but to encourage the fomentation of the disputes, strikes and general industrial unrest.  So serious had the situation become in this regard that, in 1936, the then Minister for Industry and Commerce decided that an effort should be made to deal with the evil by executive action within the trade union movement itself.  He made representations to the Irish Trades Union Congress, set the position, as he saw it, before them and said that, if the Congress was unable to deal with it, the Government, in the interests of the community as a whole, would be compelled to act.</P>
    <P>As a result of my predecessor&rsquo;s representations, the executive of the trade union movement called a special trade union conference in April, 1936.  This conference set up a commission of inquiry to report upon the trade union movement, with the following terms of reference:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(1)  the amalgamation or grouping of unions analogous to, or associated with, one another, within specific industries or occupations;</P>
    <P>(2)  to set up machinery for&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  co-ordinating the conduct of trade disputes (i) national or local, (ii) single-unit or multi-unit;</P>
    <P>(b)  to set up machinery of a permament arbitral character to decide on industrial demarcation and other inter-union disputes;</P>
    <P>(3)  to advise on rules to govern applications for affiliations by organisations to</P>
    <P>(a)  Irish Trade Union Congress and</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1541" /> (b)  trades&rsquo; or workers&rsquo; councils;</P>
    <P>(4)  to inquire into the legal position of trades unions;</P>
    <P>(5)  to make recommendations for general organisation.</P>
    <P>The Commission of Inquiry reported in November, 1938.  I hope that Deputies who sometimes cavil at the length of time which a particular investigation involves will make note of the fact that this commission, set up in April, 1936, reported in November, 1938.</P>

      <P>This is a minor diversion, and I should like to repeat that the commission of Inquiry reported in November, 1938.  Its report showed that six members of the commission of 13 desired a radical reorganisation, that six others were not prepared to go so far, and one member abstained from expressing any view; that the members of the commission one and all, however, were agreed that some rule of law was required to bring order into the existing chaotic conditions cannot be denied.  It is difficult to see how it could be otherwise in the light of the view set out in a memorandum submitted to the commission by certain representatives of the Irish Trade Union Congress.  That memorandum, amongst other things stated:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(a)  At the outset it must be realised that the complete implementation of Item 1 of the Terms of Reference means largely recasting the whole trade union movement. That some recasting is desirable cannot be doubted;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1542" />&ldquo;(b) The position of the organised trade union movement, as represented by the Irish Trade Union Congress, cannot be considered satisfactory, either from the point of view of the members organised or the manner in which the whole trade union movement is split up into very small and often opposing unions;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(c)  An analysis of the strength of the various unions affiliated to Congress reveals a position which requires immediate attention.  Only two unions have a membership exceeding 10,000; four unions have a membership of over 5,000; eight unions have a membership of over 2,000; 12 unions have a membership of over 1,000; four unions have a membership of over 500; while the balance&mdash;18 unions&mdash;have a member ship of less than 500 each.  This position is not improved where many of the unions are identical in character or where two, and sometimes three, unions cater for the one craft or calling;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(d)  The elimination of inter-union disputes, if nothing else were secured, would bring relief to all concerned. Such disputes do a tremendous diservice to trade unionism and militate against that progress which should now be manifesting itself in the movement.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, notwithstanding the report of the Commission of Inquiry set up by the Trade Union Congress, notwithstanding subsequent further effort made in 1939 by the Congress to secure a more rational organisation of the workers, the trade union movement appears of itself to be unable to carry the matter further, and the evils which all admit exist must remain to curse and plague Irish industry unless some other power take action.</P>
    <P>In these circumstances, the Government is bound to intervene by making such changes in trade union law as may reduce the incidence of trade union disputes generally and inter-trade union disputes in particular.  If trade union disputes in general and inter-union disputes in particular are to be of rarer occurrence in the future, it is necessary, in my view, to eliminate <Col N="1543" /> irresponsible unions, and to place greater responsibility on trade unions for the discipline and general conduct of their members and to increase the power of the trade union executives with this end in view.  As the position stands to-day, workers are able to abandon membership of one union and, by joining another, to add to industrial confusion.  Naturally, unions are reluctant to take action even against the most irresponsible of their members if the taking of such action means that those members transfer their allegiance and strengthen rival organisations.  A situation in which workers, if they desire to be members of a union at all, ultimately will have only a limited choice in this regard will, I believe, greatly improve the prospects of industrial peace.</P>
    <P>In order to secure these objects, it is not necessary to proceed with drastic amendment or recasting of the trade union law.  We can achieve our purpose by laying clear financial and other obligations and responsibilities on all bodies claiming to be entitled to negotiate on wages or conditions of employment, as this Bill proposes to do.  By confining&mdash;as we do in this Bill &mdash;the new legislation to bodies which negotiate or purport to negotiate in respect of wages and conditions of labour, its effect is confined to trade unions as the term is ordinarily understood and to associations of employers who negotiate wages and conditions of work.  We thus avoid interfering with many bodies which are at present registered as trade unions&mdash;for instance, the Petrol Distributors&rsquo; Committee, the Dublin and Retail Tobacconists&rsquo; Association, the Irish Bootmakers&rsquo; Association, etc.  They are not trade unions in the colloquial sense of the term.  The position of such bodies and their rights will remain as heretofore, save that they will not be permitted to negotiate or purport to negotiate in respect of wages or conditions of employment.</P>
    <P>The Bill now before the House consists of three parts.  The first part contains the usual provisions as to title, definitions, regulation and expenses. Part II relates to the licensing <Col N="1544" /> of bodies to negotiate wages and conditions of employment, and provides that it shall not be lawful for any body of persons, not being an excepted body, to carry on negotiations for the fixing of wages or other conditions of employment unless such body is the holder of what is termed a negotiation licence issued by the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  An excepted body may be any of the following&mdash;(a) a body which consists of persons employed by the same employer, not being a local authority, and which negotiates regarding wages or other conditions of employment with that employer only; (b) a civil service staff association recognised by the Minister for Finance; (c) any organisation of teachers recognised by the Minister for Education; (d) the Agricultural Wages Board, and (e) a trade board established under the Trade Board Acts.  A negotiation licence will not be issued except to a body&mdash;in the Bill known as an authorised trade union&mdash;which fulfils both of the following conditions&mdash;(1) is registered under the Trade Union Acts, 1871 to 1935, or is a trade union under the law of another country with its headquarters control situated in that country; and (2) deposits and keeps deposited with the accountant of the Courts of Justice the &ldquo;appropriate sum,&rdquo; which varies according to the number of members of the union resident in this country, from £2,000, where the membership is not more than 2,000, to £10,000 where the membership exceeds 20,000.  Anybody may apply for a negotiation licence, and on lodging the prescribed documents and the fee of £1 and showing to the satisfaction of the Minister that it is an authorised trade union, the Minister shall grant such licence.</P>
    <P>Section 2 of the Trade Union Act of 1871 and Section 3 of the Conspiracy and Protection of Property Act, 1875, and the Trade Disputes Act, 1906, confer on trade unions the following privileges, that is to say, freedom from charges of conspiracy in connection with the proper organisation and prosecution of trade disputes, the right of peaceful picketing in trade disputes and freedom from actions of tort. These privileges will, under the Bill, <Col N="1545" /> be limited to authorised trade unions for the time being holding negotiation licences and will be withdrawn from all unlicensed bodies.  Authorised trade unions, while holders of a negotiation licence must fulfil certain conditions as to membership rules and as to the maintenance of a register of members. In addition, extern trade unions must maintain an office within the State and furnish the Minister with information as to the rules, committee of management, trustees, secretary and other officers, such as is required for a registered trade union in this country.</P>
    <P>The deposit to be lodged with the accountant of the Courts of Justice may be in the form of money or authorised investments.  Investments may be varied at the request and cost of the depositor and the income derived from the investments shall be paid to the depositor.  Authorised trade unions will be required under the Bill to furnish the Minister with statements as to the number of their members every three years.</P>
    <P>A court judgement against a trade union which is a holder of a negotiation licence may be satisfied out of the deposits to be made under this measure and the trade union concerned shall within 14 days make good the deficit in the deposit caused by such satisfaction.  The Minister may revoke a negotiation licence if satisfied that the holder has ceased to be an authorised trade union.  Finally, the provisions regarding negotiation licences shall not come into force prior to six months after the passing of the Act.</P>
    <P>Part III of the Bill relates to the establishment of a trade union tribunal and under it at any time not earlier than six months after the coming into force of the licensing provisions, the Minister for Industry and Commerce may establish a tribunal to be known as the trade union tribunal.  The tribunal shall consist of a chairman, who must be a practising barrister or solicitor of not less than ten years&rsquo; standing, and two ordinary members. The members of the tribunal, as is usual, shall hold office for such period as the Minister may determine and <Col N="1546" /> shall be paid such fees or other remuneration as the Minister for Finance shall determine.</P>
    <P>The trade union tribunal is to consider applications from a trade union &mdash;mark you, from a trade union&mdash;which claims to have organised a majority, under Section 20, of the masters of a particular class and applies for a determination that it alone shall have the right to organise members of that class.  The tribunal, having heard all interested parties, shall grant or refuse such application or, if satisfied that there are reasonable grounds in the public interest for so doing, may determine that two or more specified trade unions alone shall have the right to organise masters of that particular class.  Such determination in favour of two or more unions shall stand for at least 12 months during which no application for an alteration shall be made by any such trade union.</P>
    <P>Under Section 21, like provision is made in connection with applications by trade unions representing workmen, with the addition that before making a determination in favour of a particular trade union the tribunal may require such trade union to satisfy it that the grant of such determination will not affect adversely any rights or claims to benefits enjoyed for the time being by any of such workmen as members of the trade union.</P>
    <P>Under Section 22, the tribunal, before making its determination, may require a trade union, under penalty, to ascertain by ballot the views of the workmen concerned on the application. Where the tribunal determines that two or more trade unions shall have the right to organise masters or workmen of any particular class, no trade union other than that trade union or those trade unions so determined shall thereafter, so long as the determination stands, have the right to accept as a new member any master or any workman, as the case may be, in that particular class.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not prepared to discuss the conflict between any <Col N="1547" /> sections of this Bill, because I do not think there is any conflict.  Under Section 24, the Minister may make regulations in relation to the times and places of sittings of the tribunal, the admission or exclusion of the public, and its procedure generally.  Under Section 25, the tribunal shall have such powers to summon witnesses, examine them on oath, and to compel the production of documents as are vested in the High Court.  Under Section 26, provision is made for the payment of fees by bodies making application to the tribunal.  Under Section 27, the tribunal may award costs which it will also have power to tax.  Under Section 28, the Minister may, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, appoint officers and servants of the tribunal to hold office upon such terms and at such remuneration as the Minister for Finance shall sanction.</P>
      <P>To summarise the position, it is oped that the Bill, by requiring each union to lodge a deposit of at least £2,000, will lead to the disappearance, by amalgamation with or absorption into the sounder and stronger unions of a number of fissiparous and weaker unions before the licensing provisions begin to apply, six months after the passing of the Act.  After that date, we believe that the tendency will be for unions to have recourse to the machinery of the trade union tribunal to regulate the enrolment of new members in particular unions and to regulate the activities of trade unions <i>vis-a-vis</i> each other.  This, we think, should reduce very considerably the present overlapping and rivalry of trade unions and thus remove an unnecessary and senseless cause of industrial disputes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill treats Irish and British trade unions alike in so far as it is possible to treat unions with headquarters outside this country and purely Irish trade unions alike, and it gives the tribunal power to safeguard any accrued rights or claims to benefits enjoyed by members of any union which is refused permission to recruit new members.  I believe that this measure will be welcomed, not merely by employers but also, on full and calm <Col N="1548" /> consideration, by all thoughtful trade unionists and workers who realise how full of peril for their cause the existing situation is.  The Bill is not designed to hinder the growth and expansion of the trade union movement.  Far from it.  It is a sincere attempt to do for the movement what the movement knows must be done but has been powerless to do for itself, that is, to bring about its reorganisation upon an effective and rational basis.  This Bill will not only promote a better discipline within the trade union movement; it will, I believe, promote better feeling.  It will give to the movement machinery for settling those inevitable disputes which hitherto have been a source of strife and weakness to it and the cause of grave and serious loss to the community in general.  That machinery could not be provided, as the failure of the Irish Trades Union Congress Commission fully demonstrated, by any organisation which was dependent for its existence upon the voluntary adherence of organised bodies, each with their own special interests to serve.  It could only be provided by an independent agency which would have only one interest to serve: the cause of industrial peace in this country.  The State provides such an agency in the form of the Trade Union Tribunal. Because I believe that this Bill will lead to the orderly development of the trade union movement in this country, because I think it will mean a diminution in the causes of industrial strife in this country, because I believe it will conduce to the economic welfare of the whole community, I recommend it to the House.</P>

      <P>I move the amendment standing in the names of Deputy Mulcahy and myself:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To delete all words after the word &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following words:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The Dáil declines to give a Second Reading to the Trade Union Bill, 1941, until such time as the Report of the Commission on Vocational Organisation and the evidence presented to that commission have been presented to the Dáil so that the legislative <Col N="1549" /> proposals may be considered and discussed in the light of the evidence placed before the commission and the commission&rsquo;s Report.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister gave many reasons for the introduction of this Bill, but it is very remarkable that in the course of a fairly long speech, whilst he took care to refer to the commission set up by the Trade Union Congress, he refrained from making any mention whatever of the Commission on Vocational Organisation notwithstanding the fact that that commission took full and detailed evidence not only from representatives of the Trade Union Congress but from many of its constituent bodies.  I want to say right at the outset that I agree absolutely that there is necessity for doing something to settle, as far as possible, the turmoil, rivalry, personal bitterness and personal jealousies that obtain and have obtained for a long number of years in the trade union movement in this country; but I am not satisfied that this is the time to do it in the absence of the evidence taken by the Vocational Organisation Commission and in the absence of its report and recommendations, nor am I satisfied that an emergency such as we are going through at present is the time to do it.  This Bill, if it becomes law and is put into operation, will have very far-reaching effects on the whole economic structure of this country. There is hardly a doubt about that, but nobody knows what the economic structure of this country&mdash;or for that matter, any other country in the world &mdash;is likely to be six or twelve months from now.</P>
    <P>The one thing that is evident to most people is that, as a result of this war, the economic and social conditions in this and every other country in the world will be radically and, perhaps, completely altered from what they are to-day.</P>
    <P>The Minister in the course of his speech talked about inter-union rivalry and the poaching of members by one union from another as if all this trouble and difficulty, the starting and the prolongation of strikes were a matter of recent growth.  Of course they are not.  They have been going <Col N="1550" /> on for years, although I agree that conditions have been getting progressively worse.  The Minister also spoke as if the blame and the responsibility for whatever has happened in an undesirable way over a number of years and particularly recently, could be placed exclusively on the small unions.  I do not believe that that is so.  The Minister also spoke as if all small unions in this country were undesirable unions. It is only fair to say that some of the best unions in this country are small unions, and it is only fair to say that some of the best unions in this country are unions which will be completely crushed out of existence by the terms of this Bill.  I know there is a number of small unions in this country which are no help either to their members or to industry or to the country itself.  I know that.  I know some big unions and I doubt if they are any help to the country, but I know that there is a number of unions in this country, old established unions, which have protected the interests of their members, and not only have protected the interests of their members, but have made provision for them during their illness, and have made provision to a certain extent for a small superannuation when their working days are over.  Neither the Minister nor the Bill gives us the slightest indication as to what is to happen to the funds of those unions, what is to happen to members who have been paying into superannuation funds for a number of years, or what is to happen to members who, through their contributions to those unions, have built up a right to certain benefits during illness.  I do not want to develop those points at the moment; we can go into them in Committee.</P>
    <P>It is admitted that this is a matter which has to be tackled.  It is admitted, I think, by anybody who knows anything about the problem that it is a terribly difficult problem, and that it will take not only the efforts of the Government but the goodwill of all the people affected by this legislation to make it anything approaching a success.  This is thought to be the time to bring that in.  It is being brought in by a Government which, according to the Parliamentary Secretary to the <Col N="1551" /> Minister for Finance, has not seen one line of the evidence submitted to the Vocational Organisation Commission, and has not read one line of that report even if it is in draft.  According to the Parliamentary Secretary here last week the Government has not the vaguest idea of the lines upon which that commission will report.  Are we to assume that the Government does not take the Vocational Organisation Commission seriously, or are we to assume on the other hand that it does not take this effort at legislation seriously?</P>
    <P>The Minister talked about removing dangers.  Is the Minister satisfied that when, under this legislation, he reduces the number of unions in this country to about half a dozen, he is thereby providing an insurance for the safety and security either of industry in the country or of the workers?  I am not so satisfied.  Frankly, if this Bill becomes law, I doubt very much whether we will not find ourselves in the position of having jumped from the frying pan into the fire.  I doubt very much whether the position will not be, if anything, more serious.  Does the Minister contend or does he believe that, when this Bill becomes law and the unions in this country have to comply with it, their number having been reduced, as I have said, to about half-a-dozen, the rivalry and the desire to poach will then finish?  Even if the Minister believes that, there are a great many people who do not believe it.  There are a great many people in this House and in this country who are quite well aware of the ambitions of certain people in the trade union movement here.  Those are not ambitions of yesterday or the day before.  We know quite well that this poaching has gone on for the last 20 or 22 years.</P>
    <P>I know that of my own personal knowledge.  We also know this, that, whilst there were tens of thousands of workers in this country unorganised, and completely at the mercy of employers in this country, the unions made no effort or very little effort to organise them, but spent all their efforts on trying to take from another <Col N="1552" /> union men who were already organised. Does the Minister think he is going to end that by bringing the number of unions down to the figure to which they must necessarily be brought by the size of the deposit?  Let us take a union of 2,000 members; they must be in a position to deposit £2,000.  If they have 2,002 members, they must be in a position to deposit £4,000.  I know it would not be difficult for some unions in this country to deposit £4,000 or £10,000 or £50,000, but have we any guarantee that, by making unions such as those all-powerful in the country, we are making industry or the workers or the country itself more secure?  Is it thought perfectly safe to place the whole of the trade union movement in the country in the hands of a few individuals?  Is not the danger far greater?</P>
    <P>I admit that we have had disputes &mdash;trade union disputes, if they could be so called&mdash;in this country in recent years which I think would be looked upon by many of the oldest and best trade unionists here as a disgrace.  I admit further that, because of the inter-union rivalry, many of those disputes were prolonged far beyond the length to which they would ordinarily have been prolonged.  I admit further that it is undesirable that we should have, as the Minister said, I think, 17 unions catering for one particular class of worker.  Mind you, at the moment if there is a strike in Dublin it is localised to Dublin, and it would be very difficult to spread it throughout the whole of the State, but if this Bill becomes law, and if a strike starts in Dublin or in Cork or in Limerick or in Waterford, and it is going against the desires of certain people there, take care that we might not have it spreading until the whole country is involved. I am not saying, of course, that that is going to happen, but I think I am entitled to point out to the Minister the dangers on the other side.  He apparently sees all the dangers on the one side.  Apparently he is perfectly satisfied that when this Bill becomes law the trade union movement will be sounder and better and more trustworthy, almost perfect, that it will have fewer, if any, trade disputes, <Col N="1553" /> that if there are trade disputes they will not last very long, and that industries can be started and will be perfectly safe from strikes or disturbances.</P>
    <P>I want to make a plea for certain small unions which are looking after the interests of classes of workers who are not very much sought after by some of the bigger trade unions, small local unions which have served the interests of their members very well and which have secured for their members decent conditions and decent wages, and have secured them in many cases without any dispute or rupture of industry. There is in a town in my constituency a local union, the membership of which is confined to the town.  The membership numbers about 500 and the union caters for all the workers in the town, with the exception of postmen and railwaymen who belong to their own respective unions.  That union has been in existence since 1931, and I can say that the ten years since that union came into existence have, from the trade dispute point of view, been the most peaceful and tranquil ten years remembered in that town for a long period.  That union, as I say, secured decent conditions from the employers for their men through their organisation, and they are carrying on in a very straightforward way.  They have built up little reserves, and they have the best possible relations that can exist between a body of workers and a body of employers; but immediately this Bill becomes law, they are wiped out. What guarantee have they under this Bill, firstly, that any union will seek to take them in and, secondly, that if they are taken into any particular union, their particular interests will be looked after in the way in which they have been looked after for the past ten years?</P>
    <P>Let me give another case, and I am sure other Deputies can give similar cases.  In my own constituency, there is an organisation of road workers, men employed by the county council, numbering 300, 400 or 500 men.  They are, if you like, one group of employees, all employed by the county council, having their own union and <Col N="1554" /> appointing their own officers from their own membership, the men working on the roads beside them.  They negotiate conditions with the county surveyor and his assistants or, if necessary, by appearing before the county council. They are wiped out under this Bill and they will have no further right to negotiate on wages, hours, or any other matters with the county surveyors or their assistants, or with the county council.  There are in this city and in other cities small unions of craftsmen, some of them the oldest trade unions in the country, giving excellent service to their members, many of whom are men in a specialised trade and whose interests would not, and could not, properly be looked after by a great general union.  If they cannot put down £2,000 or £4,000, as the case may be, they are wiped out.</P>
    <P>I could go on giving instances, but let me come to this point: the Minister tries&mdash;I hope he will not be offended by the use of the word&mdash;to fool himself into the belief that this measure is going to bring peace and tranquillity, that it will be accepted by all thoughtful, reasonable men in the trade union movement, that all the splits, all the personal hatreds which have existed in the movement are going to be wiped out by the passage of the Bill.  I see a far greater danger.  I see the danger of the membership of all the unions wiped out under this Bill coming together under a leadership which might not be very desirable, and which might bring far more trouble to this city, to industry and the country than is being brought under existing conditions.  The Minister ought not to blind himself to that danger, and he can get information on that aspect if he looks for it. The Minister ought not to deceive himself into believing that the Bill is going to remove the rivalry.  It is not.  The Minister said it was, but I say it is not.</P>
    <P>Again, the Minister said that the object of the Bill was to eliminate the irresponsible unions.  Who told the Minister that all the unions which the Bill is going to eliminate are irresponsible unions, and who informed him that the unions which will be able to comply with its provisions are fully responsible unions?  If the Minister <Col N="1555" /> believes that, all I have to say is that he is ignorant of conditions in trade union circles here.  That is the situation, as I see it, but if we are going to tackle this matter, if this House is ever going to pass legislation which will bring about the state of affairs which we all desire to see, it can only do so by approaching this matter in an intelligent way, and I submit that the House could approach this matter in a much more intelligent way, if we were armed with the report of the Vocational Organisation Commission and the evidence given before that commission. On what evidence, may I ask &mdash;the Minister did not tell us; he merely read briefly from the Trade Union Congress Inquiry&rsquo;s report&mdash;is the Government acting?  From whom and from where did they get the evidence?</P>
    <P>I may tell the Minister that I have a very uneasy suspicion, to say the least of it, as to where the inspiration came from and as to the hand behind the Bill.  I am satisfied that this Bill as it stands, or as it can be amended, is not going to bring about the state of affairs which the Minister says the Government desire to see brought about.  I ask the House in the interests of the trade union movement itself, in the interests of industry, perhaps in the interests of the country and certainly in the interests of peace, to pass the amendment and not to agree to pass the Bill.  The Bill, I am convinced, will not only fail to remove the evils the Minister says he is anxious to remove, but will bring upon us evils which at the moment do not exist.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened with considerable interest to the speech delivered by the Minister in introducing this Bill, and I could not help thinking that even the Minister must have known that the cases which he quoted, and quoted rather objectively, in support of it were based on an entirely fantastic foundation. The Minister told us of the public disorder, and chaos almost, caused by inter-union rivalry, of the fantastically exaggerated claim for increased wages and improved conditions <Col N="1556" /> made by certain unions in order to cause difficulties for rivals, but the Minister did not give us a single instance to support his contention, and if he had the vast amount of evidence he claimed to have to justify the introduction of a Bill of this kind, surely we ought to have got a concrete example from him, so that we might deal with the position instead of being treated to the kind of bogey-man statement upon which the Minister relied in recommending the Bill to the House.</P>
      <P>The Minister was delightfully vague instead of giving us any specific instances of trade union rivalry resulting in the submission of outrageous claims for increased wages and refrained from giving us any example in the past two or three years of inter-union rivalry, in fact, causing any serious dislocation of public services or industry generally. Everybody who knows the trade union movement knows perfectly well that during the past couple of years there have been very few strikes.  I do not believe that one of them was caused by inter-union rivalry, nor do I believe that any strike has been caused by exaggerated claims for increased wages, and yet it is a time when we have relative calm in the trade union movement, a condition of industrial peace, one might say, the Minister selects for the introduction of this Bill.</P>
      <P>The country at present is passing through a serious crisis, a crisis which ought to encourage each and every one of us to generate the maximum measure of unity in order to get the maximum measure of co-operation and concord.  Yet it is such a time the Minister selects for the introduction of a Bill which he knows is opposed, and will continue to be opposed, by the trade union movement.  The Minister said that he believed this Bill would be welcomed by responsible trade union leaders, but he omitted to mention that at a special conference of executives of trade unions which was called recently by the Trade Union Congress a motion demanding the withdrawal of this Bill was passed unanimously and that not a single speaker at the congress voiced an opinion in favour of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1557" /> In the face of that fact, how does the Minister pretend to believe that the trade union movement welcomes this Bill, or that it will be looked upon with favour by any section of the trade union movement?  What I should like to know is why the Minister at this stage should select this particular time to introduce a Bill which is of such an irritating character as this Bill appears to be?  It has begotten and it will continue to beget a hostile reception by the trade unions.  It will continue to beget their antipathy, and at a time of emergency like this, when it is so necessary to promote national unity, why does the Minister insist on throwing a Bill of this kind into the public arena so that it may create all the disunity and all the discord which this Bill is certainly going to cause in the trade union movement?  He must have observed that not a single commendation of the Bill from any of the trade unions has appeared in the public Press, and that every comment that has been made upon it, whether in the public Press or at conferences has been to the effect that it is something that is not designed in the interests of trade unions.</P>
    <P>What I am anxious to know is: is this just the first section of a very substantial link that is being forged to regiment the trade union movement in this country?  Is it just one of a number of Bills?  Is it part of a wider series of measures all dealing with the trade union movement, and is this the first effort to regiment the trades unions so that they may be in a better position to take the hand-cuffs when the Minister brings in further Bills?  Is this all that is intended to be done to the trade union movement, or has the Minister further measures in mind for introduction at a later stage when he has prepared the ground by the introduction of this Bill?  Trade unions have very good grounds for believing that this Bill was not designed out of regard for them or out of solicitude for their welfare.  As has been pointed out already by Deputy Morrissey, in one fell swoop a very large number of unions will be wiped out under this Bill&mdash;unions in the rural areas that catered for workers on a regional basis. <Col N="1558" /> It will probably be impossible to find other unions to cater for the workers who at present are catered for by these small regional unions.</P>
    <P>Many of these unions which exist here to-day are Irish unions which grew up out of the national struggle of 25 years ago.  Many of them represent workers who were formerly organised in English unions and who, whether one agrees with their viewpoint or not, felt that if separation from an Empire was a justifiable national objective, separation from an organisation with its headquarters across Channel was equally desirable. A number of unions of that kind will now be wiped out over-night because, in the main, they are small organisations and will not have the necessary £2,000 to get a negotiating licence, and the Minister who, probably, cheered their formation 25 years ago, is now taking steps to wipe them out by legislation of this kind.  Many of these unions, in fact, will now, probably, become compelled, by the action of the Minister, to go back into the organisations which they left 25 years ago&mdash;and left for reasons which the Minister then approved.</P>
    <P>The Minister makes a lamentable blunder when he imagines that small trade unions are necessarily obstructive and irresponsible unions.  Some of the smallest of these organisations in this country have, in fact, the longest history, and, very likely, an examination of their record and their method of conducting business would disclose that their standard of efficiency is no less high than the standard of efficiency of the larger unions.  Some of the smaller unions have their origin in the days of the old guilds. Some have a history going back over 150 years.</P>
    <P>They withstood every possible obstacle which threatened their existence during that long period, and it is left now, after such a long and honourable record, for the Minister for Industry and Commerce to wipe them out because of their inability to secure the necessary deposit for a negotiating licence.  This deposit is also being exacted at a time when, through long-continued <Col N="1559" /> unemployment, the funds of these organisations are so low as to make it physically impossible for them to comply with the deposit test which will be imposed upon them by this Bill.</P>
    <P>These unions feel&mdash;and I think they are justified&mdash;that the introduction of this Bill represents an attempt to regiment the unions, represents also an attempt to get away from the basis of voluntary membership which has been a feature of trade union organisation, and represents an attempt to have their ultimate destinies decided by a tribunal which may have no qualifications at all for understanding the economic origin and the purports and destinies of trade unions as known to the trade union movement itself.  One of the most reprehensible features of this Bill is that, while pretending to reduce the number of unions, it is in fact opening the door for the establishment of even more unions of a very objectionable type.</P>
    <P>Under the Bill provision is made for the exemption of an organisation which caters for workers, all of whom are employed by the one employer and, if the employer chooses to encourage his workers, as a condition of employment with him at a time like this when a work famine exists, to be members of a house or company union, then it is possible for that group of workers and for that employer to have that company or house union excluded from the scope of the Bill.  A house union of that type will be permitted to carry on, under this Bill, all the negotiations it wishes, including the type of negotiation for which another organisation will have to pay £2,000 or go out of existence.  Under this Bill it may happen that an organisation which has been in existence for over 150 years could be wiped out because it cannot pay £2,000.  An organisation with an honourable record, with a long record of service to its members, may be wiped out because it may be unable to pay £2,000.  But a house union can be formed the day after this Bill is passed and it can function here as a house union and will be permitted to do so <Col N="1560" /> without paying any deposit, while an established union with a long period of service to its credit may be wiped out.</P>
    <P>How can the Minister attempt to justify a development of that kind while pleading that this Bill is in the interests of trade unionism?  Every unscrupulous employer and every self-seeking employee who wants to promote the growth of a company union can do so and one of the attractions that will be held out for the company union is that it will not be necessary to make any deposit once you break up the larger movement into fragments of company unions and enable them to operate in that way.  The fact that the Minister put that provision in the Bill clearly indicates that he is not at all concerned with reducing the number of trade unions, and he shows his hand very badly in that section of the Bill which makes it possible for company union organisations, which are detested wherever there is a decent trade union movement, to claim exemption from the scope of the Bill and from the payment of a deposit, though inability to pay the deposit on the part of another organisation of long standing may well mean its death.</P>
    <P>The Minister has made a bad mistake in introducing at this stage a contentious measure of this kind.  He ought to realise that this Bill is going to generate more hostility than any Bill affecting workers that has been introduced in recent times.  The workers will regard this Bill as an attack on their free method of organisation and as an attempt to regiment and weaken trade unions.  This is being done at a time when workers are being asked to make sacrifices, to make a contribution to the national unity, and at times the attitude of the workers in this regard begets the commendation of Ministers.</P>
    <P>I agree with everybody else in the trade union movement that it may be desirable to reduce the number of unions, but I do not agree that this is the method by which it should be done. If it is desirable to reduce the number of unions, this is not the way to do it&mdash;to wipe out over-night a substantial number of unions which may not be <Col N="1561" /> able to raise the necessary deposits. If the Minister were wise he and some of the officials of his Department would utilise their positions to try to promote a scheme of voluntary amalgamation.  I believe a scheme of voluntary amalgamation is much more likely to yield satisfactory results than a measure of compulsion of this kind.  I was a member of the Trade Union Commission to which the Minister referred.  I did not believe then, and I do not believe now, that you can in our time and in our circumstances regiment trade unions with the ease that the Minister thinks. The better way to approach this problem&mdash;and I said so in my memorandum&mdash;is to encourage the voluntary amalgamation of workers&rsquo; organisations which are ripe for that type of amalgamation.</P>
    <P>I believe the Minister is unwise in trying to push through a Bill of this kind without first encouraging voluntary amalgamation.  If the Minister wants to get responsible trade union organisation developed in this country, if he wants to wipe out the possibility of small organisations starting in a capricious way for the purpose of causing difficulties, that problem will disappear with the voluntary amalgamation of the smaller organisations. Then you may impose new tests on any body of people who want to establish separate organisations which have no more substantial reason for their existence than that they want to annoy the parent organisation.</P>
    <P>I believe the Minister is doing himself and the Government a disservice and definitely injuring the status of the trade union movement by putting this measure before the Dáil. The Minister would be well advised to reconsider the matter and approach it by the method of voluntary amalgamation rather than the compulsory amalgamation of unions such as is provided for in this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P.S. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that anyone who has been either directly or indirectly associated with the trade union movement for the past 25 years will admit that there is a great necessity for some type of reorganisation.  There are some <Col N="1562" /> who consider that trade unionism should be abolished.  I do not think that any Government elected by the people of this country would stand for anything of that sort.  I might go so far as to say that trade unionism is a very essential thing for the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The benefits which trade unions generally provide for their members cannot be obtained by any other means.  The Bill that I would like to see introduced would be one to make some provision for protecting the various classes or sections of craftsmanship by having them grouped in such a way that industrialists would be in close touch with craftsmen in their own industry.  There should be grouping to prevent intrusion on the line of demarcation between respective trades or crafts.  In that way there would be some advantage for the industries concerned.  In the Bill the Minister proposes to group numbers. In my opinion, grouping on the lines laid down will have but one effect&mdash;to give a licence to all.  My contention is that the Minister&rsquo;s statement urging the necessity for the Bill gives no protection in the way of preserving craftsmanship. I am sure the very competent staff that the Minister has at his disposal for dealing with disputes from time to time concerning intrusion by some groups on the work of others realise that that is not going to be ended by this Bill, but that it will be more evident in the future.  In my view the best use should be made of trade unions to develop industries by some kind of co-operation between industrialists and unions dealing with crafts.  The representatives of trade unions carrying on negotiations on behalf of a particular trade should be composed of members of that trade. At conferences at which I was asked to attend in recent years certain lines-of demarcation were laid down by particular groups such as engineers, plumbers, coppersmiths and brass finishers.  Complications arose because at the head of some tribunals or conference there was not a person who was in a position to give a decision concerning a particular craft.  With all respect to civil servants, technical training or experience <Col N="1563" /> of practical workmanship is required in such cases.  Otherwise an opinion cannot be expressed as to whether or not one man is encroaching upon another man&rsquo;s work.</P>
    <P>There has been too much intrusion in the past on the work of various crafts by members who were taken into the unions merely to make them members. That is the interference of which the Minister complains.  Another matter that requires to be dealt with concerns the taking in of apprentices.  I do not know what machinery the Minister proposes to set up to deal with that position.  My attention was drawn recently to the case of a man in a particular trade, who happens to be an employer, and who has his son at the trade.  He applied to have his son admitted to membership of the union but was refused.  The young man is serving his time, and when he finishes at the end of five or six years, as he will not be accepted by the union, he cannot get employment.  Some trade unions are closed boroughs, to which boys cannot be apprenticed because their fathers were not members of that particular union.</P>
    <P>In some respects I appreciate the necessity for a conservative viewpoint, but I am afraid that eventually the country will not get the advantage to which it is entitled.  There are many cases in which in order to make up for redundancy that occurs men have to be imported rather than have any deviation from the rules of a society.  On the other hand there are trades that are crowded with young fellows who are unemployed.  It is necessary to cope with that position in some way, other than that in which the Minister proposes by grouping numbers without giving consideration to the other important aspects.  In what way has the Minister dealt with the composition of the members to constitute the 18 trade unions referred to by him in his opening remarks?  I definitely object to the system under which it is proposed to set up the tribunal.  I hold that men with technical or practical knowledge of trades should be available when required, and that there should be a panel from which members could be <Col N="1564" /> drawn, similar to what is done on other commissions set up by the Government.</P>
    <P>I fail to see how the Minister hopes by this Bill to end the disputes to which he referred, and which no one wants to encourage.  I do not know how the Bill will diminish disputes. The passing of the Conditions of Employment Act by the Minister&rsquo;s predecessor was to the detriment of the workers.  It does not give the results that the workers expected.  The serious flaw in it was that workers have lost the consolation that they always looked forward to, a continuity of employment.  That was a serious blunder.  In my opinion that was a serious mistake.  I also feel that the introduction of this Bill in the form in which it has been presented is going to be very serious for members of trade unions, and I suggest to the Minister that, having regard to the protests that have been made, he should withdraw it.  The Labour Party certainly know the opposition there is to it.  There must be some ground for their opposition. I suggest to the Minister that he should withdraw this Bill and endeavour to get industrialists and others together to discuss some alterations in it, with a view to its presentation later in an improved form.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to support the amendment.  I am not greatly enamoured of it, but the arguments that will be put forward in support of it may have the effect of deterring the Minister from pursuing the course that he has entered upon.  We may ask ourselves, what is the reason for the existence of trade unionism?  I wonder if the Minister has ever put that question to himself.  Trade unionism, as we know it, goes back, as Deputy Norton pointed out, for more than 150 years. Long before that we had the old guild system.  Trade unionism, in its present form, was conceived with the object of rescuing our people from a state of serfdom and actual slavery.  During the period of its existence it has been recognised by the highest authorities, by all Christian-minded and moral-minded people, as a necessary weapon for the protection of those who have nothing to sell but their labour.  In time the old guild system gave way to <Col N="1565" /> the craft union system.  We have these craft unions with us still, I admit in diminishing numbers, but they are still there, and are one of the oldest links in the trade union movement.  It is interesting to recall that they have survived the shocks of alien rule in this country, and that families associated with a particular craft have carried on the tradition of it from one generation to another.  As Deputy Norton has pointed out, very little regard is being shown to those types of craftsmen to-day.  It is now, unfortunately, a question of £ s.d. with too many who should be interested in the development of those crafts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If one is to judge from the terms of this Bill it would seem as if those crafts should not have the right to exist any longer.  That, surely, is a retrograde step, because those craft unions trace back directly to the old guild system, and have done their part to make manifest, even in our own day, some of its best features.  They have done their part in preserving that heritage of artistic skill which has come down to us from the time of the guilds.  Priceless specimens of the work done by those old craftsmen are still to be seen in the City of Dublin.  We have examples of their work in the fine old houses in Parnell Square and in other parts of the city.  Visitors who come to this city from other countries have again and again testified to the excellence of the work done by those craftsmen, and to the world-wide interest it has aroused.  Apart from the goldsmiths, the silversmiths and different types of colour painters and printers, we have the members of many of those crafts associated in small unions of their own.  They are jealous to preserve the traditions associated with their own particular craft.  It would look as if that were now to be regarded as a crime, but their desire is to preserve their own identity.  It would appear from this Bill that the acid test to be applied, as to whether they should be allowed to continue their age-long tradition, is to be this: whether they will be able to put down a sum of £2,000.  If not, these old craft unions are to be considered unworthy <Col N="1566" /> of being entrusted with the task of negotiating on behalf of their members.  That, surely, is a very unfair test to apply to any trade union.</P>
    <P>One of the dangers that I see inherent in this Bill is that the fundamental right of a trade union to negotiate on behalf of its members is being assailed in this Bill &mdash;the right of trade unionists through their organisations to fight unscrupulous employers and to protect themselves against mean types of employees who would creep into positions at undercutting rates of wages.  It is unfortunately true that there are many such.  They forget that even the very low rates they are prepared to accept would not be there for them were it not for the fight put up by organised labour.  That sort of thing is being played up to in this Bill.  It is going to create an atmosphere that I suggest members of this House should not give any countenance to.  In this machine mass-production age there is a tendency amongst employers to cut out the old skilled craftsman.  That tendency will be encouraged in this Bill.  The employers who adopt the get-rich-quick methods by doing everything possible to get men to work for them at the lowest possible figure will no doubt see their opportunities in this Bill.  There are, of course, employers throughout the country who are prepared to pay fair wages but on the other hand we know that there are many who, while pretending to accept trade union conditions, are not ashamed to violate them.  They hand envelopes to their employees which do not contain the recognised rates marked on the outside.  We know that there are many employers holding their heads very high who do that sort of thing.</P>
    <P>It has to be said, on the other hand, that you have mean types of employees who are prepared to accept under-cutting conditions of that sort. Evidence with regard to that could be given to the Minister.  One great danger that I see in this Bill is that it proposes to set the hall-mark of authority on what is called the &ldquo;house&rdquo; union.  That is a matter <Col N="1567" /> which will come up for discussion in another place next week.  I wonder if the Government, by their proposals in this Bill, mean to suggest that the standards and conditions of workers in existing organisations are too high.  I think, when we come to discuss the question next week, we will be able to prove that is their intention: that they <Col N="1568" /> want to make permanent in this Bill the possibility of under-cutting, and a lowering of the decent standards that have been won for trade unionists through their organisations.  I move the adjournment of the debate.</P>
    <P>Debate adjourned.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 10.30 p.m. to Thursday, 5th June, 1941, at 3 p.m.</P>
