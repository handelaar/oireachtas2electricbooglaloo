      <P>asked the Minister for Supplies whether in view of the acute hardship and isolation which will result to the island dwellers by the cutting off of the service of the steamer between the Aran Islands and the mainland owing to shortage of coal supplies, he will make immediate arrangements to have the necessary coal reserved to ensure the continuance of this essential service.</P>

      <P>The Galway Bay Steamboat Company normally import their coal directly, but recently they have experienced some difficulty in procuring direct imports to meet their requirements. A permit authorising them to purchase coal within the State was accordingly issued to them on the 4th of this month, and it is understood that they have since been able to secure a supply which will meet immediate needs.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Recently, a well-known <Col N="1863" /> Irish political thinker and philosopher wrote the following words:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Many democrats share the errors of the totalitarians who see in the voice of the State or the Leader the very essence of truth and goodness, for on their side they claim that the will of the people or of the majority is what makes a course of conduct correct, an opinion true&mdash;that their decision cannot be questioned.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I adopt those words, and though the Government's present policy of indifferent neutrality is the policy of the majority of our people, is the policy of the legitimate, elected Government of this country and, as I believe, the policy supported by the majority of the members of the Party to which I belong, I say that it is not a correct course of conduct.  I say it is not in the true interest, moral or material, of the Irish people.  I, perhaps, am at fault in not having said this much before but I confess that I forbore from saying it in the hope that the Government of the country and the majority of my fellow countrymen would come of their own volition to share my view.  I think, over and above the references which I made to the activities of the Minister for the Co-ordination of Defence in the United States of America, it is right to say that, in addition to his diplomatic activities, indefinite news of ambiguous speeches made by him in various centres of the United States of America lead me to believe that he set out, as the unanimous views of the Irish people, views to which I do not subscribe and to which I believe a considerable number of our people do not subscribe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it reasonable and right that on this occasion of the Foreign Affairs debate in this House I should at least state my view and in stating it I do not want to avoid any particle of the truth.  I do not think it would be any service to this country or any service to the friends of this country to leave them under any illusion as to what the true situation is.  I believe the majority of our people are in favour of the Government's policy of neutrality.  That is a plain, patent fact, to which all <Col N="1864" /> responsible men must have regard.  My view, however, is this: Recognising that no responsible man could conceivably wish to see his country at war, nevertheless, when the choice lies between dishonour and material ruin on the one hand and the risk of war upon the other, terrible as that risk may be, frightful as the consequences may be of facing it, I think a nation with our traditions should face that risk of war and refuse to submit to a blackmail of terror designed to make it sell its honour and stake its whole material future on the vain hope that it may be spared the passing pain of effort now.</P>
    <P>I now reassert the sovereign right of the Irish people alone to determine what the foreign policy of this State shall be now and for all time.  I reaffirm my conviction that it is the duty of our people and the Government of this country to resist aggression against the sovereignty of this State whence ever it may come, with all the resources at our disposal.  But I say that, in the exercise of the sovereign right of the Irish people to determine the foreign policy of this State, we, the Parliament of Ireland, should ascertain precisely what co-operation Great Britain and the United States of America may require to ensure success against the Nazi attempt at world conquest and, as expeditiously as possible, to afford to the United States of America and Great Britain that co-operation to the limit of our resources.  I use that word, &ldquo;limit,&rdquo; deliberately, and I say that the limit of our resources must be deemed by all reasonable men within this country and outside it to preclude the possibility of sending Irish troops abroad.  We have neither the means nor the material with which to equip such forces.  But I do say that our resources extend to ascertaining what accommodation the United States of America and Great Britain may require within our territory to resist the Nazi aggression against the world and, having ascertained it, I do say that we, the Irish people, should afford that accommodation here and now.  I would say to my friends in this House and outside <Col N="1865" /> it to be on their guard lest the Soviet intervention in this war should confuse their minds and lest it should give rise to a false sense of security.</P>
    <P>There may be those who would say the threat to western Europe is now past and is oriented.  Let them beware lest what seems a formidable antagonist to the Nazis now might collapse and we would discover the full fury of an unchequered Nazi aggression turned westward to envelop us and all those around us in the course of their campaign.  Let those who feel with me that there is only one thing more loathsome than Communism in the world not suffer their minds to be confused by the fact that Soviet Russia is fighting Germany now.  Let them ask themselves: if they were being stalked by a man-eating tiger, would they shoot the jaguar that attacked that tiger, or would they not rejoice to see it cripple the aggressor, and give them time and opportunity to successfully prepare their defence? And even though they looked on with equanimity at that jaguar striking down the tiger that sought to destroy them, it would be unnecessary for them to resolve to make a domestic pet of that jaguar when the conflict was over.  The fact that Soviet Russia has become locked in deadly conflict with its prototype, Nazi Germany, is a stroke of luck for which Christian civilisation may devoutly thank Providence, but let it create no false sense of security in our minds.  The utmost endeavour of all Christian men is requisite if the Nazi threat to Christianity is to be repelled with any casual co-operation that may come our way.  I say, Sir, that aid for Great Britain and the United States from this country is called for on spiritual and material grounds.  We are fortunate in Ireland that honour and interest coincide, unlike the unhappy countries of Europe, such as YugoSlavia, Holland, Norway, Belgium and Denmark who, finding honour and interest at variance, chose honour and lost all the worldly possessions that they had.  That is not our choice.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy wishes to speak after me he should do so, but he should keep quiet until I have finished.  These countries had to make the choice between honour and interest, and they chose honour and they lost all their material goods.  This country mercifully finds that its interest and its honour coincide.  I say that the honour of this country is involved, because the justification for our existence as a nation is that for 700 years we fought against injustice. We fought and demonstrated our loyalty to the principle of justice before the nations of the world in our resistance to the British imperial claim to make our country a slave country or to thrust upon our people a religion which our people knew to be false.  In that fight we sacrificed men, money and material, generation after generation, until we won.  That fight was the sheet anchor of resistance in every suffering country in the world, and the beacon of hope to every oppressed people struggling for their liberties from one end of the world to another.</P>
      <P>I say to-day that the German Nazi Axis seeks to enforce on every small nation in Europe the same beastly tyranny that we successfully fought 700 years to prevent the British Empire imposing on this country.  I say&mdash;and I say it on the authority of Our Holy Father the Pope&mdash;that Germany in every small country which she has conquered has sought, not only to establish political domination, but to impose on the conquered peoples an atheist church which derides Christianity and which forbids the people of those States to serve God according to their consciences.  I say&mdash;and here again I claim the authority of the Holy Father for the statement&mdash;that the Nazi domination, in every small State in Europe where it has been established, imposes upon the Christian peoples of those countries the obligation to choose between the Reich and Christ, and that statement is quoted further from the Pastoral Letter from the German Bishops to their own people.</P>
      <P>Naval and air bases are required in this country by the United States of America and Great Britain.</P>

      <P>Air and naval bases are required in this country by the United States of America and Great Britain at the present time, to prevent the Nazi attempt to cut the lifeline between the United States and Britain now.  At present we act the part of Pontius Pilate in asking, as between the Axis and the Allies, &ldquo;What is truth?&rdquo; and washing our hands and calling the world to witness that this is no affair of ours.  I say we know, as between those parties, what the truth is&mdash;that, on the side of the Anglo-American alliance is right and justice and on the side of the Axis is evil and injustice.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>And I say it is our affair, inasmuch as resistance to evil and injustice is the affair of every Christian State and every Christian man in this world.  At the present time the issue involved is whether Christianity will pass through the catacombs or survive.  I am convinced that, if the Nazis prevail in the world to-day, Christianity will pass through the catacombs and only those with martyrs' fortitude will retain the Faith. It would be well for all of us to ask ourselves the question whether we are sure&mdash;each one of us&mdash;of martyrs' fortitude; and, if we are not, whether we are prepared to put our Faith in jeopardy&mdash;because we might lose it if we were called on to suffer the torture and persecution that Catholics in Nazi-dominated countries have been called on to suffer in the last four years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>No prudent man will minimise that danger: no just man will deride that fear.  It is a terrible danger; it is a thing of which every honest public representative must feel deeply apprehensive, when he thinks of bringing that danger upon the people for whom he stands trustee.  It is only when he is certain that failure to face that danger now, failure to urge his people to face that danger now, is a lesser evil than the consequences of sinking our heads in the sand and turning our backs upon the evil, that he would be justified in the eyes of God in asking them to face it.  Were Germany to win this war, the future of Ireland is as certain as the knowledge we have that we are here to-day.  The Germans, if they win this war, will face our country as the conquerors of the world and, in order to maintain that conquest and dominion over the Continent of Europe and the ocean highways of the world, the first thing they will do is to demand and seize naval and air bases on our south-west coast and western seaboard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having seized those bases and established their advance guards in them for the control of the Atlantic highway, the German General Staff must say to the German Government: &ldquo;We have our bases on the west coast of Ireland, but the hinterland of those bases must be made safe for us; and there are only two ways of making it safe.  You have either to exterminate the Irish people in that hinterland or you have to Nazify the whole population of Ireland.&rdquo;  They cannot exterminate our people, and when they attempt to Nazify them, our people will be required to make the choice between the crooked cross of Nazism and the Cross of Christ&mdash;and I know the choice our people will make.  Let us open our eyes to what that will mean.  Our people, in defence of their religion, will be called upon to face a persecution besides which the worst that Oliver Cromwell did in this country will pale into insignificance. That has been the experience of every Christian country into which the Nazis have found their way.  Those who lose <Col N="1869" /> their Faith and those who die in defence of their Faith in the course of that persecution will constitute the monument to the leaders amongst us who fail to face the real issue now, and who prefer the illusory hope of safety to the grim duty of facing facts and doing what is right&mdash;facing the danger of war while we still have friends to fight beside us, resolved that the day will never dawn when our people will be called upon to face the malignity and might of a Germany, conqueror of the world, face to face with an island standing alone, without friends or hope of help from anywhere.</P>
    <P>If Great Britain cannot be guaranteed supplies of food and warlike materials from the United States of America she will be defeated by Germany, and the day she falls we fall too.  I say that the Atlantic lifeline joining these two champions of democracy and Christian civilisation at the present time is no stronger than its weakest link.  British sailors and British ships are bringing England's supply &mdash; and our supply &mdash; through German minefields, German air attack and German submarine attack at the present time.  A gap is opening in that lifeline.  Extending hands between old friends and new friends, we can close that gap.  I know that the closing of it, and acting as the bond between the United States of America and the Commonwealth of Nations at the present time, may bring down upon our heads the fury of the Nazi terror.  If what I say is right, then let us face that terror, let us say to them: &ldquo;Do what you can to our bodies and our goods, but you cannot destroy our souls: no one ever has, and Nazi-Germany never will.&rdquo;  If this course is right, I say that the people of this country are equal to the weight of whatever burden is put upon them in the cause of Right.</P>
    <P>If we see our duty and fail to do it now, we seal for ever this nation's claim to be free and independent.  If we prove unequal to our duty in this time, we shall stand forth amongst the nations of the world as a nation claiming all the privileges of independence but unequal to its burdens. Citizen and soldier must bear together <Col N="1870" /> to-day the perils of warlike times. There was a time in the history of the world when it was, perhaps, one of the most disagreeable tasks a civilian could discharge to suggest that his country should face the danger of war, because it seemed like asking others to go out and bear the heat and burden of the day while he stayed safely at home.  That day is past.  The dangers of every individual citizen of this State are as great as, or greater than, those of any soldier serving in the field.  Ireland has citizens and soldiers who would do her no discredit if tribulation were to come upon her now. The question I ask myself is: has she leaders equal to the great decisions and the terrible responsibilities of the times in which we find ourselves?</P>
    <P>I say most deliberately, I say before God, that I believe the fate of Christianity in the world is hanging in the balance.  I say that what has borne itself in upon my mind, above all other things, is the profound conviction that, if this terrible doctrine should prevail in the world, Christianity will go to the catacombs.  It is the profound conviction that none amongst us but he who has a martyr's fortitude will keep the faith, if that should happen, that persuades me that it is Ireland's destiny and duty to protect her children from that danger.  I am convinced that Ireland's action in this time may prove vital.  It is a queer fate for Providence to reserve for us, that we, a small, comparatively weak country, should be fated to fill so critical a part in so unprecedented a time.  Why that should be so is something which is known only to divine Providence which placed us where we are.  I believe that we have an opportunity of fulfilling our high destiny and proving our loyalty and devotion to things higher than material prosperity and political considerations. I profoundly believe that the Irish people are equal to that destiny, if properly led.  I share with the Taoiseach the desire to see our people a united people in these times.  I should like to see our people, all together, forgetting past differences, recognising the magnitude of the issues now involved and recognising the ability of <Col N="1871" /> this country in matters of this kind to play not only one man's part but to be a host in action.  I should like to see this small, weak country of Ireland demonstrate, as it has never been demonstrated in the history of the world before, that it is not by bread alone that man must live and that, whatever may have been the material squabbles that precipitated war in the world, to us the only issue of significance is whether Christianity shall survive and whether mankind all over the world will be left the right to render to God the things that are God's and to render to Cæsar the things that are Cæsar's.  I am convinced that that right is in desperate jeopardy.  I am convinced that it is given to us to prove its champion.  I am convinced that, were we to accept that charge and face that duty, posterity would have it to tell that in the darkest hour of crisis, when danger seemed heaviest and perils greatest, Ireland, recognising her destiny, faced it without counting the material cost and that, whatever her losses were, the undying glory of having stood as a nation for great principles and in defence of the higher freedom had secured for her and her people immortality in human history.</P>
    <P>If all the struggle that our fathers made and our grandfathers made meant anything, it must have meant that.  They could not have made the sacrifices they made for no other purpose than to give us the right to pass trivial legislation in a Parliament of our own.  They meant to give this country a soul, in the deep conviction that their children would keep it a living soul and a burning spirit before the nations of the world.  Ours is that glorious opportunity; ours is that terrible responsibility.  As it presents itself to me, it is a glorious opportunity. I recognise the appalling nature of the responsibility.  I have never said anything in my public life which I feel more sincerely or more deeply and I believe our people are equal to their glorious destiny, equal to bear the burden and the awful responsibility and I pray God they may yet find leaders who will be worthy of them in this time of crisis.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Dillon has opened up a rather unexpected line, shall I say, of conversation on this Estimate this evening.  To some extent, we can congratulate the House and congratulate him that he can speak out his mind and his convictions in the way he has done.  I think the position of the House, both from the point of view of creating a really solid unity and serving the country, would be stronger and more effective than it is if we could have members who feel about certain aspects of the present situation speaking out in the same way and being listened to readily, knowing that judgment would be passed on their words in a dignified and formal way.</P>
      <P>Our internal problems, about which some of us are afraid to speak, would be more readily tackled and dealt with if feelings on the part of members which have been kept suppressed found expression.  Deputy Dillon has raised this subject in a rather unexpected way and unexpectedly.  When we pool our judgments, we are called upon to take decisions.  The only interpretation I can put on Deputy Dillon's address to the House this evening is that he would like the House, having exchanged views on the subject matter introduced here, to take a decision that this country should declare war on the Axis powers.  He says that that would be done in the interests of Christianity and what Christianity stands for, in the better ordering of our material life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If I saw this country entering a fight for Christianity, for the better ordering of material life, I should like to be convinced that in our national and political joint actions in this country, we afforded a decent sample of what Christianity stands for in its application to our own personal efforts, our own intellects, our lives, and a better sample of the way in which Christianity affects the material ordering of public resources and our public lives here.  If an essential for a proper figuring in the battle arena on the part of Christianity is that a first-class certificate should be necessary of our Christian attitude, of our general political bearing to the proper ordering of our <Col N="1873" /> lives, if such a certificate were necessary for any effective or first-class intervention in a battle for Christianity, then I do not think we have a first-class certificate here.  I think on that ground, as well as from any other point of view, Deputy Dillon is asking us to take on in the first place a job that is too big and, in the second place, a job that I do not think we are called upon to do.  After all, how can we be of any assistance to anybody if we can be of so little assistance to ourselves?</P>
    <P>There are two lines upon which my thought runs.  Firstly, there is the question of the present situation in the world and what it has arisen from, and secondly, our own position and our own equipment to take part in any aspect of that struggle that we may be called upon to take, particularly any aspect of that struggle into which we might, of our own initiative, make up our minds to plunge.  To put the question in the way in which Deputy Dillon puts it this evening is to ask our people to declare war on the Axis Powers with the first page of history from 1918 up to date before their minds.  We have to tell them that at the present time Great Britain is fighting Germany and Italy with certain assistance from the Russian side and certain assistance from the United States side.  We have to ask who is responsible for the present situation that has Europe, and, indeed, the world, now at war.  We have to open the book of history in front of them and we have to let them know something of it.</P>
    <P>It is not easy to judge the history of this century from 1918 up-to-date. We did see set up after the last war, after very strong American persuasion, the League of Nations, as we saw that League of Nations subsequently deserted by the United States.  Then we saw a situation in which France and Britain differed in their policy as to the way in which German interests and German affairs should be managed.  Out of it all, we saw the rise of modern Germany and the development of modern German aggression. Assuming that we leave the <Col N="1874" /> question of the guilt of Germany for the present position out of the question, I find it hard to say that the United States, France and Great Britain can completely wash their hands of responsibility for the situation of Europe to-day.  The people of this country if they are called upon to say that they should take the side of the United States and England against Germany to-day, reading the matter at any rate superficially, as most ordinary people would read it, would be quite justified in saying to the United States on the one hand and to Great Britain on the other that there is no use in asking us a small country here, to throw ourselves into an unavailing attempt to wipe up the mess that was partially at any rate created by themselves.  That is what part of our people are entitled to say; that is what a large number of our people are actually saying.</P>
    <P>We found ourselves after the setting-up of the League of Nations in a position in which we had not control of the whole of our country.  A demand for the control of the whole of our country was made to one of the countries now fighting Germany and we did not get it. Quite a number of people are prepared to point out that and may reasonably point out that.  So that it is very hard to tell a large number of people in this country that a very considerable amount of responsibility for the present situation in Europe does not fall on France, England and the United States itself.  There are very many people who would argue that if the United States had not deserted the League of Nations, the League of Nations would have been made the effective instrument that it was hoped to make it and that even the disagreement between Great Britain and France as to dealing with Germany would not have brought about the present situation because the presence of the United States in the League of Nations would have prevented the development of any serious kind of disagreement between two countries such as these.  On the one hand, to put to our people to-day that they must take a decision to join with Great Britain and the United States in fighting Germany is to put to them a <Col N="1875" /> question on which, if they review the pages of history since 1918, they cannot get any unanimity of opinion that the situation is such that they should take any responsibility for it on, let us say, moral grounds.</P>
    <P>With regard to ourselves here, providentially, following the last war, and arising out of the maintenance of a struggle by a united people here to get control of their own affairs, we got control of the whole country from Fair Head in Antrim to Mizzen Head in Cork with the stipulation put in that if the Irish people of the Six Counties &mdash;Derry, Tyrone, Antrim, Down, Fermanagh and Armagh&mdash;wished to stay out, they could stay out.  That was the one blot.  There were certain defence provisions that, it was said, would disappear with the passage of time, and, so far as the Twenty-Six Counties go, they have gone with the passage of time.  There was one serious provision there, and I do not think that I would like to have the duty of fixing where the responsibility lies for having the Six Counties divided from us to-day.</P>
    <P>I think we could say that we got a chance of taking our own country and running it, and I do not think our exhibition generally throughout the country of the application of Christian principles to our conduct was so very marked that it ought in any way to be held up to any other country as an example of how things could be done if the Christian spirit were let loose. I do not think in any part of the country we will boast that it was the Christian spirit that directed the conduct of our work since 1922 up to to-day. Why, even at the present moment, when it is a matter of holding elections throughout the country for the carrying on of local administration, we are told here by a Deputy that if we had elections under present circumstances the members of the Local Defence Force would be cutting each other's throats.</P>

      <P>I am talking of a proposition that is put before the <Col N="1876" /> House that we ought to declare war, that we ought to join with Great Britain and the United States in going to war with the Axis Powers.  I am discussing our ability to do it on the one hand, and I am discussing the objects that have been put before us for which we ought to do it, on the other hand. One of the objects that is put before us as a reason why we ought to go out and fight this good fight is to safeguard the Christian spirit in the world and order things in the way in which a proper Christian spirit, if let loose on the world, would order them.  I say that if a Christian spirit of an effective kind is necessary for embarking on that adventure, then&mdash;and I am not raising the matter in any way contentiously&mdash; I think we could not boast that our example was an example that we ought to carry far and wide throughout the world and, if strength of arm and strength of mind and courage are things that come from having the Christian spirit, then I am afraid we have not enough to sustain our strength of mind, our strength of arms, or our courage in the difficult circumstances in which we might find ourselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dillon pleads for unity and strength on the part of our people in the extraordinary world circumstances that exist.  I plead for the same things, but you are not going to get them by embarking on your own initiative in this war.  If we have any example to give to a world stricken and torn by international bitterness, by international rivalries, by national weaknesses, it would be that we would conduct our affairs in the way in which we here, looking outside, would like them to conduct theirs.  If we have to face any dangers in future, we are only going to meet them if we have our own work carried out here on such lines as will secure the greatest possible unity. If we could begin to prepare for whatever struggle Christianity may be up against in the world by trying to order our own business in a Christian spirit and by speaking out our minds and exchanging our thoughts without any bitterness, then, if there was a good cause in the world that wanted our help or the assistance of our arms, we <Col N="1877" /> would be there in our greatest possible strength; but, until we can do that, we cannot be of assistance to anybody who wants our help or any cause that wants our help.</P>
    <P>While it is a tribute to this House and an example to this House that Deputy Dillon would speak as he spoke this evening, I do not think it would be of assistance to this country that his attitude here should get any support. I think there is nothing that would more divide the people of this country than to be asked to take a decision on these matters at the present time.  If there are unnecessary misunderstandings or unnecessary criticisms, if there is a lack of unity in facing up to some of the material problems that require to be faced in this country, it is because people allow themselves to have suspicions on all these fundamental questions whether this country should go to war or not against Germany, and people are supposed to hold certain views.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach put it properly yesterday and the day before when he said the policy of neutrality had been accepted by the whole people and, if there was a vote in this House on the question whether we should go to war on our own initiative, there was not a single person who would walk into the lobby against the policy of neutrality. Deputy Dillon has indicated to-day, and the implication of his speech, listened to unexpectedly, was that he would walk into the lobby against that. But I say the position is as the Taoiseach definitely put it.  Why we cannot accept that, why we cannot go ahead dealing with the problems of this country, eliminating from our minds that there is any difference on that point, is one of the things that I do not know.  It would be a pity if the speech made by Deputy Dillon this evening disturbed in any way the conviction in the Taoiseach's mind, or the understanding in the minds of Deputies, that what the Taoiseach said yesterday and the day before on the policy of neutrality was not a fact, because it is a fact.</P>
    <P>My reaction to the speech made by Deputy Dillon is as I say, and to press it or to drive it into a situation that it <Col N="1878" /> required argument or that it required division, would be to destroy any strength that there might be in the country to follow any cause that was good or any cause that required assistance. I do not think that, left to ourselves, left to our natural bent of mind, our natural judgment and understanding, undisturbed by political suggestions of one kind or another, our people are ever going to stand for any cause but a cause that is sound and good and strong.  We should take our stand strongly and firmly and self-confidently on that ground, realising that the dangers that are around us are dangers that demand that we should make the best out of ourselves, gather our strength, and, if we are impelled as a nation to fight for Christianity and the honest ordering of business throughout the world, we should bend ourselves a little more effectively and a little more resolutely to establishing that state of affairs here first.  It is necessary that we would improve the situation here from that point of view.  If our strength is going to be required, then we ought to be quick about attending to it.</P>

      <P>For some years past it has appeared to me that this Vote for the Department of External Affairs would require some justification.  The necessity of making a case for the Vote would seem, as the years pass, to increase rather than diminish.  Within the past six or seven years extraordinary events have taken place on the Continent of Europe.  The best informed institution in this State for the purpose of transmitting information in regard to those events to the House and the country is the Department of External Affairs.  So far as one can judge from any action it took to meet the situation in which we now find ourselves, the Department apparently was not satisfied that Europe was moving towards the catastrophes that have taken place during the last year or two. We stocked up no supplies in the country. We imported nothing extra whatever to deal with the extraordinary situation which has affected this country, as well as every other country, during the best part of two <Col N="1879" /> years now.  The Minister for Supplies, in answer to a charge of that sort which I made in this House, indicated that if we were to take the calendar year from September to September we would find the difference.  Deputy Mulcahy at my request questioned that, and said that probably a month's extra supplies had been taken in rather than a calendar year's. If that be the contribution which the Minister had in mind for dealing with the situation which now confronts us, I would say that his sense of responsibility in his office is a mockery.</P>
      <P>This is a particularly expensive Department.  It has grown in expense during the last ten years, but in so far as it gives information to the House, or is of benefit to the country, one may say that its efforts in either direction appear to be contradictory.  Therefore, I say that some more justification than we have got is required in putting this Estimate before the House.  Within the past two years, three cases have been brought to my notice with regard to the administration of this Department.  In one case a former Dáil Deputy wrote to a member of the House requesting that his son, a parish priest in England, would be facilitated in getting over to this country for the ordination of his brother&mdash;another son of the former Deputy.  The Department, in writing to the Deputy in this House who farwarded the request, stated that these concessions were not granted, and that there was very little prospect of any agreement being reached to allow the parish priest over for the ordination of his brother.  A short time afterwards this former Deputy wrote again to the same member of this House, and said that, having seen the Minister for his constituency, the Minister had secured the necessary permits for his son&mdash;the parish priest in England&mdash;to come over for his brother's ordination.  When that matter was taken up with the Department of External Affairs it denied the imputation that a Minister had more influence with it than a Deputy, but it remains there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second case was that in which a member of a family in this country wished to be present at the marriage <Col N="1880" /> of another member of the family in England.  The family lived here, with the exception of the member in England. A Deputy of this House gave a letter to the gentleman who required it, to take to the Department.  It is quite true that the letter was delivered on a Sunday, but it so happened that it could not be delivered on any other day.  No facilities were afforded in that case.  The third case concerned a fatality which occurred amongst the family connections of a member of the Oireachtas.  On application to the Department, this member of the Oireachtas was informed that he should consider the dignity of the Department&mdash;the vanity of the Department would probably be more correct.  He was not facilitated but he got facilities from the British representative here.  The Department must remember that it is the servant of this country, and that every person in it, from the Minister down, is the servant of the State.  We had the striking contrast that we should have the representative of another country in this State affording the facilities referred to, and entering into the unusual atmosphere associated with a fatality in any family.</P>
    <P>It would be idle to say that Deputy Dillon's speech this evening surprised me.  I had no information whatever regarding the matter of the statement which he considered it advisable to make.  It is no part of my province to pass judgement upon his statement, but the wisdom of making it has not impressed me.  This is a time, above all others, however it may be repugnant to our feelings or to our judgment, when it appears to me to be desirable and necessary that the dominant consideration in this country, a vital matter for our people, is to show what is perhaps euphemistically called a united front.  Nobody can doubt that there are differences of opinion with regard to present events on the Continent of Europe and elsewhere.  There are those of us who take the severe view that, if there is one thing more despicable than another in this country, it is that slave mind which always pictures the British as going to interfere with us, to hamper us, to restrict our liberty or be bent upon injuring <Col N="1881" /> us.  There is, of course the other danger that there are others who think that no matter what emanates from Great Britain must be right.  I take neither view.  I regard the first as weak, and the second as denoting the power of the will rather than of the intellect.  If we in this country take the line that the difference between the belligerents is democracy on the one hand and autocracy on the other, the sinlessness of the one and the guilt of the other, then I want to say that neither appeals to me.  Democracy may have as many sins to its credit and may be as faulty a form of government as an autocracy.</P>
    <P>From what one either sees or reads of the course of history with regard to democracy, there is just as much to its discredit as there can be said to be to its credit.  That it has worked well in one country or two there is no doubt whatever.  That it is perhaps the most despicable form of Government in regard to one of the Continental countries there is no doubt either, and, having read the events of the last two years in connection with one of those countries, it struck me that perhaps the best law that could be passed in that country, if ever again it has a Parliament, is a law which would prevent any person who has been in public life there in the past 20 years from ever again being allowed to stand as a representative of the people.  In the present issue then, to my mind, there are not all the virtues on one side and all the sins and the guilt on the other.</P>
    <P>We are not bound to take part in a conflict of this kind.  It is no part of the Christian religion or of the Catholic Faith to insist upon our taking part in it; that is as far as I know, as far as my knowledge goes, or as far as my experience goes.  The duty and responsibility of every person in public life in this country is not neutrality; it is not taking part in this conflict; it is in ensuring the security and stability and integrity of this country.  If that is better served by a policy of neutrality, then it is our duty to accept and adopt that policy.  If that is better served by belligerency, then it is our <Col N="1882" /> duty to be belligerent.  It is the view of the majority of the people of this country, the vast majority of them at the present moment, that the security of this country, its stability, its future and its integrity, are best served by a policy of neutrality.  On the larger question, and the more important question, upon which side in this war there is the larger number of Christians, it is not for us to speak.  It is the fact that a very great number of Christians are on both sides, and a very great number of Catholics also.  It is no part of the Catholic teaching or of the Catholic religion, so far as I know, that majorities decide whether things are right or wrong.  I do say that, in the present circumstances in which we find ourselves, in the circumstances which govern this country to-day, and which are all around and about us, it would be more than serious to take a decision to enter into this conflict.  I think that, so far as our honour is concerned, our honour is not bound up with entering into the conflict.</P>
    <P>To me, it would have been very much more satisfactory if some notice had been given of the introduction of a matter such as this.  It is not without some disadvantage that one enters into a discussion of this kind, but it is right to say that no particular steps were taken, in so far as this Party is concerned, to persuade it to depart from the policy of neutrality.  As well as I can remember now, speaking from recollection, it has never come before us as a policy; in other words, the question of neutrality has not been the subject of criticism.  It is perhaps not the best time that we should consider, or that we should discuss a matter of this kind.  In a time of war, it is not the Ten Commandments that the belligerents are thinking of.  They have never governed the history of Europe for the last 300 or 400 years, and consequently it is not the question of right or wrong which prompts or agitates the minds of belligerents.  I have yet to learn from any source that the guiding principle in connection with the winning of the war is the true Christian principle.  In that set of circumstances it is obvious that the leaders on either side, in their concept of what is right <Col N="1883" /> or wrong, would be very slow to adopt any line of action which would further the interests of the opposing side in the contest.  That is one of the reasons why it has been impressed upon my mind, and upon the minds of my colleagues, since this conflict began, that the best contribution we, as public men, could make in this difficult situation in which we find ourselves is to show that there is a united front as regards the policy of the country in connection with the war; that we are united in the view that neutrality is the best policy for the country at the moment; that we are united in the view that, if aggression comes, a united country will meet it, and that the best interests of the country are served by those two main lines of policy.</P>
    <P>That may not be, just at the moment, heroic.  The countries which can show the greatest examples of heroism at the present moment are those whose munition depôts are full, packed to the brim.  At a time when the weight of metal beats the finest examples of courage that we have got, our granaries are neither bursting with wheat nor munitions.  It is no part of my intention here this evening to enter into a speculation regarding what might be the effect of the entry of this country into the European conflict.  We did not make it; we learned very little of its making until it occurred.  We could be saddled with some of the responsibility if we had taken part in those deliberations up to date.  In my view it was our responsibility to have taken part in those matters.  If we had taken part in them, it is possible&mdash;some may say it is not probable&mdash;that we might have prevented this conflict taking place. But let us not delude ourselves with any exaggerated sense of our importance. Either on the spiritual side or on the material side, we have much to be ashamed of as well as to be proud of.  It is our responsibility and our duty to improve the spiritual side of our country as well as the material, and I hope sincerely that, in our efforts at improving the spiritual side, we shall be more successful than we have been in improving the material side.  I regret that this matter was raised this <Col N="1884" /> evening, for the reason that it is not the best time to disclose any hesitancy with regard to what is in our minds in a time of crisis.  In a time of crisis it is advisable&mdash;it is necessary&mdash;to make up your mind rapidly, to make it up correctly and, having made it up, to stick to it like a man and to do what you can towards preserving, improving and exalting, in so far as it is in your power, the country which it is our duty to serve.</P>

      <P>I had intended, Sir, to intervene in the debate only for a short time in order to deal with some practical matters of pounds, shillings and pence, concerning certain expenses incurred in connection with communications with some of our people abroad, made through the Department of External Affairs.  Before doing so, however, I want to express the horror with which I and everybody else with any sort of national feelings in this House have listened to the speech that has just fallen from the lips of Deputy Dillon and, since that speech came from a member of the Fine Gael Party, I should like to say emphatically that it does not represent my feelings, nor do I think that he speaks for any other member of the Party except himself, or for one-quarter of 1 per cent. of the feeling outside this House.  I have been horrified that at this time, such a critical time in the affairs of this country, we should have such expressions of opinion from a man with such a decent tradition behind him, and a man who, in my opinion, ought to know a lot better and to have much decenter feelings and know more about the real, honest, decent feelings of the people of this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are passing through a very critical time in this country.  We are now approaching the third year of the war, and I believe that we are approaching that third year of the war in a certain state of immunity from the horrors of that war because of the fact that we have been able to keep up in this country, in this House, and outside the House, a fine, decent spirit of united nationalism, and have been able to present a common front towards the world in general.  We have <Col N="1885" /> maintained that position because we have faced up to facts.  We have looked at things in a very broad way.  We have not looked at them, perhaps, from the point of view of expediency or of the best way in which the issues might materially affect us, but we have looked at things from the point of view of the effect on our sovereignty and nationality and from the point of view of the independence of this country for which so many people fought and struggled so dearly and gave their lives.  I am not so surprised in one sense that a gentleman who, when he first came into this House, used his position as a Deputy here to say that &ldquo;A Soldier's Song&rdquo; was a thing of horror, could now, sitting between two men who fought and were condemned to death in 1916, give voice to such expressions as he has used to-day.</P>

      <P>Yes, Sir, but my feelings have been very offended, to put it mildly, by the things I have heard in this House for the last half hour, and I have been so shocked that I can hardly restrain myself.  However, perhaps it would be better for me to go away from that subject because I think I have adequately and emphatically expressed my repudiation of the opinions that have been voiced here by Deputy Dillon this evening. I shall leave the matter because, as Deputy Mulcahy says, it would be better to leave it to him and men like him who are better able to deal with the matter, and I might take some other action in some other place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What I wanted to deal with was this matter of the intervention of our Department of External Affairs in looking up our nationals abroad during this <Col N="1886" /> time of crisis.  In that connection, I should like, first, to express my thanks and appreciation of the very effective way in which communications have been established with some of our people abroad.  Through the Department, I have been able to get in touch with some of our nationals in the war-ridden countries&mdash;such places as Italy, the Channel Islands, both occupied and unoccupied France, Sweden, Norway and Belgium.</P>
    <P>In connection with these matters, however, the people who are affected are usually poor people, and while our Department was very effective in getting these people in touch with their friends, there was usually sent to their friends a little <i>billet doux</i> to the effect that communications, telegrams, and so on, cost a certain amount of money, and that they would be very glad to get a remission to cover the amount. When these communications came to me I referred them to the Department, and said that I would be quite willing to pay the charges rather than have them fall on these poor people.  Now, I have no objection to paying these charges, but I think that, since we are voting this amount of £7,000 in connection with the repatriation of our nationals abroad and in connection with the maintenance of some of those who cannot maintain themselves in the belligerent and occupied countries, small charges like these should be met out of the funds placed at the disposal of our Department.  In other words, services of this kind should be a public charge and should not be a charge on any individuals.  The matter is very small, and I am sure it is only necessary for me to refer to it to have it attended to in a practical way.  That is all I have to say, but I should like again to express my appreciation of the personal courtesy and great efficiency with which the Department has done its work in connection with our representatives abroad.</P>

      <P>I think the Taoiseach said several times that no single Deputy has raised a voice against our present policy of neutrality.  Now, I think that, as far as this House is concerned, he is perfectly accurate, probably, <Col N="1887" /> in saying that there has been no public announcement in this House such as we have had to-day on that matter.  Probably, it is just as well that this Vote only occurs once a year, but a great deal of water flows under the bridge in a year, and, lest it be thought that Deputy Dillon's remarks are the vapourings of a single, irresponsible madman, I should like to suggest that there is a number of Deputies who&mdash;some of them&mdash;can go just as far as Deputy Dillon has gone, while there are others with shades of opinions differing until, probably, they find themselves in the opposite camp. There is no doubt that the majority of the people of this country are in favour of a policy of neutrality, but there are a great many people who feel that in this struggle there is a moral issue involved, and I believe that if a Vote were to come before this House on the moral issue, even the Taoiseach might be surprised at the result.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some people seem to suggest that if we dissociate ourselves from the actions of the Axis Powers we should immediately declare war on them.  Now, I do not think that that was even suggested by Deputy Dillon.  I should like to suggest that, if there is any difficulty in our minds, we ought first to try and clear our minds by deciding on the moral issues.  There is no doubt about it, as Deputy Cosgrave has said, you cannot put all the arguments on one side in this struggle as to the cause of the outbreak of hostilities.  I think it was Deputy Mulcahy suggested that if the U.S.A. had not deserted the League of Nations there would not be a war on at present.  Another Deputy from the opposite benches called out that because England had denied the Six Counties to the rest of the country we could not come to a decision in this matter.  Another Deputy finds the arrest of Cahir Healy a stumbling block.  Somebody else might say that the German people were a patient, industrious people.  We can all find reasons with which to salve our conscience when we do not want to come to any decision.  But I should like to ask the House where would our Christianity be if the earlier Christians felt <Col N="1888" /> as we feel or behaved as we are doing to-day?</P>
    <P>I should like to see the moral issue made quite clear and correct in our own minds.  Does anybody think that the present policy adopted by one of the belligerent Powers on the high seas is a moral policy and one that could be defended?  That, I think, is the reason for most of our difficulties.  We would probably be able to obtain all the supplies we wanted from America if it were not for that.  But, be that as it may, I should like to see this House deciding the moral issue first.  If they cannot make up their minds about the moral issue, there can be no question about altering our present policy.  But I should like to suggest to the Taoiseach, who ought to give a line to this country, that he has modelled his conduct on a man who said: &ldquo;Let there be peace and rest in my day, O Lord,&rdquo; and then turned his face to the wall.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Dillon expressed the opinion that the members of the present Government were incompetent men led by a very astute politician.  I think that in a way we are rather fortunate that we have not at this moment the brilliant leadership which Deputy Dillon would afford us in this crisis.  It has been said&mdash;I do not know who said it&mdash;that high lights sometimes go up in blazes, and I am afraid that is what happened to Deputy Dillon to-day.  It is an extraordinary thing that Deputy Dillon should have raised this very contentious and very dangerous question at this moment without consulting the Leader of his Party or his colleagues on the Front Opposition Bench.  I think he would have been very well advised, whatever his own personal feelings may be in the matter, not to have raised the matter, because, whatever effect his words may have in this House, and I do not think they will have very much effect, they are likely, if given publicity throughout the country and the world, to carry with them great dangers for this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to dwell very much further on the policy which Deputy Dillon has expressed, except to say <Col N="1889" /> that I strongly disagree with it.  I believe that our nation, so far as international affairs are concerned, has been fairly prudently led and that through that leadership we have been able to avoid the worst consequences of the present conflict.  We must remember that international conditions at the present time are much the same as exist in the remotest jungles of Africa or as possibly existed at a remote age in this and any other country.  I cannot imagine that the human race would have survived if our remote ancestors had been always willing and anxious to join in every conflict between the huge monsters of the jungle. I can imagine our ancestor, the cave man, getting back into his cave while the lion and the tiger were fighting it our and waiting until things became a little quieter before he emerged into the open.</P>
    <P>I think that the Leader of the Opposition Party and Deputy Mulcahy have faced up to the realities of the situation. I came into this House as an Independent, unassociated with any Party, and I cannot imagine how a political party can exist and have amongst its leaders such a wide divergence of opinion as has been expressed by Deputy Dillon and Deputy Cosgrave. I think that in the best interests of the nation this question should not have been raised.  I think it would be a disastrous thing if a discussion such as has taken place here to-day were to take place at every cross-roads and in every town and village throughout the country.  It is desirable that we should not only continue to preserve a neutral attitude towards the present conflict, but that we should to a great extent avoid anything which would create disunity amongst our people, because it is by remaining united that we have the best chance of guiding our country safely through its difficulties.</P>
    <P>If there are people in this House and outside&mdash;and I think they are very few &mdash;who share Deputy Dillon's views, I think that even they would be serving the best interests of the side of the conflict which they favour if they were to refrain from expressing those views, <Col N="1890" /> because a divided nation, a nation in which there is disunity and discord, can be of no assistance to anybody, and cannot be anything but a source of danger to those countries which are in close geographical contact with us.  I hope that for, at least, another 12 months views similar to those expressed by Deputy Dillon will not be publicly expressed here.</P>
    <P>There are a few matters to which it occurs to me this Department might direct some attention.  I asked a question here some time ago as to whether it would be possible for a neutral nation like ours to adopt some form of signalling, either by lighting or otherwise, that would demonstrate to belligerent aircraft that this is neutral territory. When the Minister replied to the question Deputy Dillon intervened and said they should know they were over neutral territory.  During the past week Deputies have noticed that neutral territory in Spain was bombed by one of the belligerents, I think, Italy.  That shows that it is possible for aircraft to make very serious mistakes as to the territory over which they are flying.  It should be possible by some form of distinctive lighting or otherwise to indicate that this is neutral territory and such lighting could be adopted by large towns and other centres likely to be attacked.  For example, hospitals and other buildings are indicated by the red cross.  If that precedent were followed in some other form, say by a circular red sign or some other colour, it would be an indication to aircraft that this is neutral territory.  In addition, it is the duty of the Department to discuss matters of this kind with representatives of the belligerent nations.  The Department should also take some steps to mitigate to some extent the horrors of modern warfare by making representations, in common with other neutral countries, to the belligerent powers as far as possible to avoid the bombing of open towns or non-military objectives.  These are matters upon which the Department could be active.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of refugees who have come from Great Britain and in many cases are being maintained by <Col N="1891" /> relatives in poor circumstances.  As far as I am aware no provision whatever has been made for the maintenance of these people.  The Department should take the question up with the British Government so that in all cases where children and other refugees come here provision may be made by that Government for their maintenance.  I know of cases where very poor people had to take care of evacuees.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach called this House together a couple of months ago to discuss the affairs of another State. I do not know why the House, which was called on a Monday, could not have waited until the following Wednesday to discuss that question.  The Chair, in its jurisdiction, did not allow anybody but representatives of the three Parties here to speak.  If I had been asked I would have said that it was very bad for us to interfere with the affairs of another State.  I do not know whether I would have the courage that Deputy Dillon had to <Col N="1892" /> raise this question to-day.  Probably that might have been expected from me coming as I do from one of the northern counties&mdash;one of the discarded counties of Ulster.  I quite agree with Deputy Dillon that a question that should be freely and very fully considered at present is whether we should enter the present conflict or not.  At the present time we are lying low.  We are living, so to speak, on the lives of men who have taken risks in order to feed us.  If the English and the people who are fighting this war did not take that risk what position would we be in to-day?  Would we be able to exist at all?  Have we anything to carry us on?  All we have to boast of is that we have a grain of sugar.  I suppose we have bacon, eggs and other things. We have nothing else.  If England does not come to our rescue before the winter, what will be the position of the poor people in Dublin?  To a great extent, they will be starving and cold in their houses, unless some of the English traders come to our aid and run the risk of their lives in order to save us and try to feed us.  I do not know whether we are acting the part of men or not.  I am not going into that now.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to pay a tribute to the work of the Department. I had occasion many times to go there in connection with the position of many of our nationals who were marooned in countries which were at war, and I found that the assistance and the advice given by the officials were very helpful in mitigating the hardships which many of our nationals were undergoing during that very trying period.  I should like also to take the opportunity to ask the Taoiseach whether our Consuls or representatives in various countries have in the past given such information as would enable our Government to take measures to deal with many of the difficulties that confront us.  I do not know whether they did all they possibly could in that direction, and especially in the matter of supplies, and I should like to ask whether the Taoiseach can now hold out any hope that, so far as the future is concerned, there is some possibility of the situation improving in respect of supplies which are necessary, if our various industries are to carry on.</P>
      <P>I have very little more to say, except briefly to refer to the speech of Deputy Dillon and to the remarks made by several other Deputies.  I have listened to Deputy Dillon's speech, which he has delivered on his own responsibility, but, no matter whether Deputies agree with the subject matter of it or not, they must at least admit that he had the courage to make it, let him be right or wrong.  It would be much better for the conduct of this debate if the remarks made subsequent to that speech had not been made, and particularly those made by the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, who, in view of the very high position he holds, should be the last man to make such remarks.  I am not now speaking in a personal way, but I can understand the reasons for the Leas-Cheann Comhairle giving utterance to those remarks, and I leave it at that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1895" /> Deputy Dillon has made his speech and he is possibly not the only one of our Party who would make a speech which did not find support amongst even the members of his own Party. There are members in the British House of Commons, even at present, when Britain is engaged in a life and death struggle, who have made statements to which the Prime Minister and members of the Cabinet have had occasion to take exception, but they do not indulge in some of what I might call the ignorant remarks made here to-day in regard to Deputy Dillon.  It does not matter whether he fought in 1916 or not; the fact is that, like myself, he is prepared to do his bit for his country. I have just as much to lose as any other man, but I agree with Deputy Dillon so far as his feelings with regard to one of the belligerents are concerned.  At the same time, I have signed the roll in my own Party to defend my country against all comers, and I make no apology to anyone for doing so. Neither do I make an apology for my private opinions with regard to certain of the belligerents, but I say that if it is a fight as between democracy and autocracy or dictatorship, I, as an advocate of democracy, should like to be in that fight.</P>
    <P>I am speaking now for myself and not on behalf of the Irish people.  It is my own personal view, and I hold it just as I held the view that we should object to conscription being applied to Northern Ireland because it was part of this country.  I should like to take advantage of this occasion to tell the Taoiseach and the members of his Government that, if it was logical and consistent to object to the imposition of conscription on the people of the Six Counties, as being part of Ireland, I hold that it was equally logical and consistent for the Taoiseach and members of the Government to have entered a very emphatic protest against the bombing of the Six Counties, but that has not been done. That is my view.  It might be very unpopular, but I never believed in the policy that might is right.  I believe there are certain bullies in this world <Col N="1896" /> to-day who may feel that they would be in a position to prevent me from saying what I think is correct, but, as Deputy Dillon says, they might destroy our bodies, but they certainly cannot destroy the soul or the spirit of the people of the country.</P>
    <P>Having said so much, I conclude by again expressing my appreciation of the manner in which the affairs of the Department have been carried on during the past year, notwithstanding the very difficult times through which we have been passing.  I can assure the Taoiseach that many of our nationals in those countries which were unfortunate enough to become involved in this world war are very thankful, and have personally expressed to me their gratitude for the great help they received from the officials of the Department.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There were some questions asked last night and I tried, in the interval, to get information in regard to the details involved.  Deputy Byrne asked whether the repatriation of distressed Irish seamen is provided for in the Estimates now before the House.  The repatriation of distressed seamen is provided for, not in these Estimates, but in a sub-head of the Marine Service Vote.  The Department of External Affairs does not bear the cost, but it is usually concerned with the arrangements for repatriation in such cases.  Repatriation is arranged wherever possible and, where it is not possible, it is because transport facilities are not available.  We have knowledge of 25 cases of Irish seamen stranded abroad, some in Sweden, others in Greece and others in Morocco and so on, in which it was not possible to arrange repatriation, owing to the disruption of travelling facilities caused by the war.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In at least six of these 25 cases the men have since been able to join another ship.  In other of the 25 cases, the Department has been able to make arrangements whereby the families of the men in this country have been able to receive remittances, either from the men themselves or their employers, pending repatriation.  I cannot say <Col N="1897" /> anything about the cost of repatriating in such cases because that is a matter for the Department of Industry and Commerce. I understand that the cost of repatriation of distressed seamen is usually borne by, or at least recoverable from, their employers. The cost is not the real difficulty.  The trouble is that in the cases which are still outstanding it has been found impossible, so far, in spite of every effort, to arrange means by which the men might travel from where they are at present to this country.  That is another unhappy result of the war, over which we have no control.  I am afraid that, in addition to the cases of distressed seamen to which I have referred, there are many others of our citizens on the Continent who would like to return home but who cannot obtain travelling facilities under the present sad conditions.</P>
    <P>Deputy Murphy had some criticisms as to the manner in which Consuls in the United States dealt with inquiries. He mentioned cases of persons who had addressed inquiries to the Consuls and had received replies merely referring them to the Department here.  In the absence of details, it is not possible to give the Deputy a reply on the particular cases he has in mind.  As a general principle, however, it is far better that persons or firms here who want some inquiry made in the United States should come to the Department of External Affairs in the first instance instead of going to the Consuls direct. That will obviate the expense and delay which is bound to occur if the inquiry is one which the Consul feels he cannot deal with without instructions from the Department.  Very often a matter which appears quite simple and straightforward to the firm or persons concerned may raise issues or present difficulties which would be apparent to the Consul but not to them, or the matter may be one which is already the subject of correspondence between the Consul and the Department, or one which can only be dealt with by action here.</P>
    <P>The cases referred to by Deputy Murphy probably admit of an explanation <Col N="1898" /> on one or other of these grounds. The best advice which can be given to persons who wish the Consuls in America to take some action is to go to the Department of External Affairs, not to the Consul direct.  The Department will get in touch with the appropriate Consul, giving him whatever instructions and information are necessary to enable the matter to be dealt with as quickly as possible.  If that procedure is followed, difficulties of the kind complained of by Deputy Murphy will not arise.</P>

      <P>Deputy Dillon and Deputy Murphy referred to the case of Mrs. William O'Brien.  The sentiments they expressed about her will be shared by everyone who remembers the services of her husband and herself to this country.  Most of us remember some 20 years ago when some members of the present House were associated with her husband in the cause of protecting our people here during a time of war. Without going into the details contained in my note, Deputies would be aware in advance that everything we could do was done.  It was some time before a letter came to me indicating the plight in which the good lady found herself.  Immediately we got information we cabled at once a sum of money substantial enough, at any rate, to relieve her for the moment.  Since then it has been possible to arrange with her own bank that part at least of her income will be duly forwarded. <Col N="1899" /> I need not read the note I have.  I think it is quite sufficient to tell the House that my sentiments are exactly the sentiments that have been expressed in this House in the matter.</P>
      <P>I was asked about the number of Irish citizens in the Channel Islands and for information about the possibilities of obtaining news of them, particularly from the point of view of speed of communications.  Deputy Dillon is correct in saying that the number of Irish citizens in the Channel Islands is surprisingly large.  The Department has knowledge of about 200.  The Department has endeavoured to obtain news of the welfare and whereabouts of each of these 200 persons and the required information has been obtained in over 180 of the 200 cases.  It might be added that all the Irish citizens about whom news was obtained were well and carrying on their normal employment.  They include priests, doctors, nurses and agricultural workers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is more difficult to answer Deputy Dillon's inquiry about the possibilities of communicating with these people. The communications are extremely slow.  An inquiry can be transmitted to the Legation at Vichy by telegraph within 24 hours but, owing to the difficulty of postal communication between the occupied and unoccupied zones of France and probably also between the mainland of France and the islands, it is often many months before the Legation at Vichy is able to obtain the required information and telegraph it to the Department.  In some cases the delay has been as much as seven months and the shortest period taken by any of these inquiries about people in the Channel Islands was ten weeks. Very often delay is due not merely to difficulties in communication but also to the fact that the person about whom news is sought may have changed his address so that an official inquiry must be addressed to the local authorities to ascertain his present whereabouts.  The position is that while there is no avoidable delay in dealing with these inquiries so far as we are concerned, <Col N="1900" /> the difficulties of communication are such that even under the most favourable circumstances the time taken to obtain news about Irish citizens in the Channel Islands is about three months.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon asked for information about the fees levied by our Consuls in connection with American estates. The practice is that where the Department is asked by one of our citizens to look after his or her interests in an estate in America, a fee of 2½ per cent. is levied on the net amount ultimately recovered from the estate for the benefit of that person.  That is the rate allowed by the American courts to persons acting for the next-of-kin in estate cases.  The rate of 2½ per cent. is a flat rate.  It applies whether the amount recovered is large or small but, of course, no fee is charged if the Consul had nothing to do in connection with the case&mdash;if, for example he had only to transmit a cheque sent to him by an American administrator for a beneficiary in this country.  It is only in respect of work done in connection with intestate estates that this percentage fee is levied.  Normally, no Consular fee is levied in respect of assistance rendered in connection with testate cases.  The reason is that intestate cases entail a great deal of time and trouble.  Very often the mere tracing of the estate concerned involves exhaustive inquiries and, even when the estate has been traced, all the work of establishing the claim to the satisfaction of the Public Administrator falls on the Consul acting under power of attorney from the Irish claimant.  The fee of 2½ per cent. is generally regarded as a very reasonable one.  It compares very favourably with the charges of 33? per cent. to 50 per cent. made by the type of &ldquo;heir-chasing&rdquo; firm referred to by Deputy Dillon.  Moreover, the fee of 2½ per cent. is levied only on the net amount of money actually recovered for the Irish claimant.  If the claim is unsuccessful, no fee is levied.</P>
    <P>Consular services are universally administered on a fee basis.  The grant of passports and visas and the various notarial functions which a Consul performs are, in the practice of all States, <Col N="1901" /> subject to the payment of Consular fees.  Not to levy any Consular fee at all in these intestate estate cases would represent an exception from the general practice and, once it is decided to levy a fee at all, the rate of the fee could hardly be more moderate and reasonable than it is.  The scale of Consular fees generally is under reconsideration in the Department in connection with the making of a new order under the Diplomatic and Consular Fees Act, 1939.  Subject to what I have said, the observation of Deputy Dillon about Consular fees in connection with estates will be borne in mind when this category of Consular fees is being reconsidered.</P>
    <P>I think that covers in the main the points of detail that were raised last night.  Deputy Cosgrave raised some other points to-day.  They are new to me, and I can only say that I will have them looked into.  It surprises me if there was any discourtesy shown by any member of the Department of External Affairs to any Deputy seeking information or asking for service.  It is possible that the information was not in their possession.  It does happen sometimes that private or personal influence with a particular Minister, who might have charge of getting a thing done, might conceivably have more effect than the representations of a Department.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>What was not proved?  I must tell the Deputy that I am completely at sea with regard to particular cases, so I cannot answer in detail.  If he wishes to ask a question, I will answer it in the House at the first opportunity.  I have not had an opportunity to get the information in such a form that I could be quite satisfied with it myself.  I can only promise the Deputy that I will look into the matter and see what the exact position is with regard to these cases.  I understood him to state that some representations had been made otherwise than through our Department, and that <Col N="1902" /> where our Department was not successful these private representations were. I do not know, but it could very well happen.  We know what life is, and that direct personal interest very often achieves results that are not achieved through the ordinary regular channels. It very often requires a great deal of persistence in regard to official communications to get the sort of general consideration that should be given always, but it very rarely happens that we fail, unless there is a definite rule or something of that kind.  I quite admit that it is possible, knowing human nature.  Knowing the nature of Governmental and Departmental activities generally, in other countries as well as ours, it is possible that a direct and immediate approach may succeed in getting more speedy action than you can get through the Department.  I do not know the facts&mdash;they may be quite different&mdash;and what I am speaking about may have no relation to these cases; but it would not surprise me if such things occasionally did occur.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another question that was raised was that of the visit of the Minister for the Co-ordination of Defensive Measures to the United States of America.  I was asked a question here with regard to that, and I gave a reply, giving the material facts&mdash;that the Minister had gone to the United States to examine the possibility of our obtaining arms and supplies there.  It was to examine the possibility: we had already explored the ground fairly fully and knew that, in the ordinary way, it would be extremely difficult to get such supplies. It was suggested to me that it might be well if one of the Ministers went over.  It is strange to find that objected to by Deputies on the Opposition Benches.  It was suggested that we had a Minister already in Washington and that there should be no need to supplement his efforts by the efforts of a member of the Cabinet That runs quite contrary to the views that have been expressed in other cases, when it has been suggested that direct contact by Ministers would achieve results that would not be achieved otherwise.  Now, to see that no stone was left unturned and no effort left unmade to try to secure the essential <Col N="1903" /> arms and supplies, the Minister for the Co-Ordination of Defensive Measures went there.  I am not quite definite, but as far as my recollection goes, I think it was suggested by the American representative here that a member of the Government should go.  Whenever I met the representative of the United States here, I had made it almost a constant practice to make representations with regard to arms and certain necessary supplies.  This led to the suggestion that it would be well if a member of the Government could go to the United States to put the case directly and immediately.</P>
    <P>As I announced to the Dáil, the Minister was unsuccessful.  I do not think it was due to any lack of effort on his part in putting our case&mdash;Ireland's case&mdash;before the President of the United States.  I have always felt a difficulty in talking about these matters fully and completely here, under the present conditions.  The complaint was made that it was possible for the President of the United States to make a statement such as was reported in the Press here, and that we appeared not to be taking any appropriate action about it.  Many things appear in the papers which are not correct.  Obviously, the first thing for us to do, when a statement of that sort appeared in the Press, was to see whether it really had been made.  It seemed so astonishing that naturally we wondered whether the report was true at all, whether there was not something wrong about the news despatches, whether the report was complete or not.  We did not talk about it, as there was no use in making public statements, but we instructed our representative to try, at the earliest possible moment&mdash;one cannot get replies immediately in matters of that sort&mdash;whether this statement was made and if it was made what interpretation was to be placed on it.</P>
    <P>It was astonishing that such a statement should have been made, in view of the fact that the American representative here had, time after time, been made aware of the national <Col N="1904" /> position and of our attitude.  Not merely was it the subject of private conversation, but there were also public statements.  There was nothing that we had done, no document which we possessed, which would give any explanation for the making of that statement.  All I had to do was to make it quite clear that the attitude of this country and of this Government was that any aggression from any quarter whatever would be resisted by us and, therefore, that aggression by Germany would be resisted as well as aggression from anywhere else.  Why we should not have been allowed to do that quietly, without trying to make it appear that there had been some fault on the part of the Minister for the Co-Ordination of Defensive Measures, or someone else, I do not know.  I cannot see that any public loss would have accrued by letting that statement go while that was being done.  Certainly, in this country it would not create any difficulties, as our people understand the position; but misrepresentation of anything said here might create difficulties in the United States of America.</P>
    <P>Naturally, we did not wish to have any section of the people in the United States think that the arms which we were trying to get to be used against any aggression, whence ever it may come, would not be used against one particular aggressor.  That would be a very serious matter.  Our principal concern was, not that our people here should know the position&mdash;because they knew it clearly and could be in no doubt&mdash;but that those in the United States should not misunderstand the position in view of the statement which was made.  It was a delicate and difficult matter.  There was no use in suggesting that we were bungling it, or that my relations with the President of the United States were not good.  My own personal relations with him&mdash;in so far as I can call them personal relations &mdash;have always been of the friendliest character.  Therefore, there was no question of any wrong action being taken by us.</P>
    <P>What I have been anxious about in these matters&mdash;and, perhaps wrongly <Col N="1905" /> so, impatient of in regard to them&mdash;is this.  We are in an extremely difficult and delicate situation.  The policy of neutrality is not by any means an easy policy and it is not a cowardly policy. It will require as much courage to put that policy through, and to stand by our national statements regarding it, as it would to put any other policy through.  It may be a more difficult policy, in the long run, than any other policy.  Therefore, I am not in the slightest affected by statements that the policy the country is following is a cowardly policy or anything of that sort.  What I am anxious about is that so far as we, in this country, can do so, we should refrain from making the position more difficult.  I am particularly anxious lest statements by public men here should be taken up by Press correspondents and sent abroad to cause misunderstanding of our position and increase our dangers.  As an example of that, I have here a telegram sent me by our representative in the United States regarding a London dispatch which figured in a New York evening newspaper.  I shall read it to show the sort of thing against which we have to safeguard ourselves:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;All about England, Scotland and Northern Ireland there are American engineers.  The American Navy during the last war operated from Cork but Cork in this war will be denied to the U.S., just as it has been denied to Great Britain.  It is now obvious that Éire will be as belligerently anti-American as it has been belligerently anti-British.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Everybody here knows that that is not true.  We are not belligerently anti-American or belligerently anti-British. Whenever any attempt was made to make it appear that the Government here was anti-British, we tried to make clear that that was not so.  Statements made here or emphasis laid on one part of a statement will give the cue to those who want to send dispatches of this sort to the United States.  Goodness knows, we have a sufficiently difficult path to tread without giving an opportunity to people who live on this sort of thing, and who, in a time of war propaganda, are only too anxious <Col N="1906" /> to take advantage of such opportunities to stir up feeling against this country. This newspaper dispatch continues:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The story here persists that Wendel Willkie and Premier de Valera parted company in Dublin in a white heat of fury.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There is no truth whatever in that.  I do not say that there were no differences of opinion between us, but there was no question of heat or anything of that sort.  We did not discuss Irish national policy.  It was not our business and I did not feel that there was any necessity to discuss it with Mr. Willkie. Whatever general discussions went on, there was no questioning of our right to do what we were doing and there was no heat or anything of that sort. The dispatch goes on:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Éire is not with us and it is now evident that the only chance we and the British have of obtaining Irish co-operation will come only if the de Valera Government should fall and if he is succeeded by Cosgrave or some other southern Irishman.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave has spoken to-day and given his opinion of what Irish national policy should be at present. It is quite obvious that there is no foundation for that sort of story.  The dispatch proceeds:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The only indication we have, up to date, that de Valera might not ride the storm is the recent defeat of Mrs. Clarke, the de Valera protegée, as Lord Mayor of Dublin.  Economic conditions are rapidly growing worse throughout the whole of Eire.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I was in the United States for a considerable period and I know how difficult it is to keep contact between opinion here and in the United States. In the United States, we have a nation which has been uniformly friendly to us.  Our national struggle was aided considerably by the fact that a large section of the population of that country was friendly.  The position of the administration of the United States is that they are not actually in this war but that they are definitely supplying all possible aid, as they openly say, to Britain.  As I pointed <Col N="1907" /> out yesterday, our difficulty is that our policy of neutrality does not fit in with the policies which are being pursued in the United States and in Britain at the present time.  It is natural for people engaged in war to act as if those who were not with them were against them.  That is not so in our case.  We are not against them but we have a right to choose our own course.  We have a right to make that choice with an eye to what is in the best interests of our people.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon expressed his personal view this evening.  Other Deputies suggested that they felt as he did.  The first thing that occurred to me when Deputy Dillon spoke was that the Censor would have a very difficult problem to-night.  If Deputy Dillon's speech goes forth as it was delivered here, how can we stop other people from replying in kind?  Has not our problem of censorship been a difficult problem?  How are we to keep our people from starting a quarrel of this sort at a time when it is very foolish for them to quarrel?  The Deputy spoke, I believe, from conviction.  He expressed his own views, but it is ridiculous for people who have views of that sort to believe that they can lead a nation simply by giving expression to such views.  I think it would be quite impossible for anybody to attempt to lead our people along a line of that sort.</P>
    <P>Our people have very long memories. They need not have too long a memory to go back to the last war.  A large number of us remember seeing the walls of the Dublin quays covered with posters about the rights of small nations.  We did not, at that time, believe that the fight going on was genuinely for the rights of small nations.  We may have been wrong in that, but that is what we felt.  The test we put ourselves was: If this is a fight for small nations, there is one small nation which has been struggling for its freedom for centuries, and that small nation can be freed without the defeat of any foreign power.  That could have been done if the British people and the British Government at the time had willed it.  They could have given this <Col N="1908" /> country its freedom.  The fact that that freedom was not given was the crucial test which convinced our people that, no matter what professions were made at the time, that was not genuinely and fundamentally a war for the freedom of small nations.</P>
    <P>We know the fight which had to be made afterwards to get the amount of freedom we have got.  I have said, time after time, that we are as free as any other nation in the world in this part of Ireland, but this part of Ireland does not represent the territory of which our people have been struggling to get possession for centuries. As long as that wrong remains unrighted, our people here will not be convinced that the fight is all for freedom on one side and all for slavery on the other.  There is no doubt whatever that a very difficult problem has been created in the Six Counties but, so far as we are concerned, we still claim that these Six Counties belong to the historic Irish nation and are a part of the historic national territory.  We shall never, and I hope no Irishman will ever, be satisfied with any freedom which this part of Ireland may get until the nation as a whole is free and is governed in freedom by the representatives of the Irish people, chosen freely as we chose them here.  That is the aim, and until that is satisfied, there is no use in talking about grand principles which are being fought for on the one side and neglected on the other.</P>
    <P>I am naturally at considerable difficulty in speaking because I have not got the freedom which Deputies who are not in office have when speaking at the present time.  I do not want to say anything which will make the situation more difficult than it is.  All I do want Deputies to be clear about is this: that I am satisfied&mdash;if I am not right I want to be shown the contrary as quickly as possible; the more quickly it is shown to me the better&mdash;that a proportion, as high at least as 90 per cent. of the people of this country support the policy that has been adopted by the Government.  A few Deputies who have spoken to-day would seem to suggest that that is not the situation <Col N="1909" /> and that I would be surprised how many Deputies would go into the Lobby in favour of entering the war.  If there is any truth in that assertion, I should like to have it proved, and I think the sooner Deputies who feel like that put down a motion that the national policy should be changed, the better for us all.  But the problem is precisely this.  I take the same view on this matter as Deputy Cosgrave has taken.  He says that in times of crisis one should make up his mind what he is going to do and then stick to that decision.  There should be no hesitation or shifting about.  You have first to size up the situation as quickly as you can, then make your decision and, having made your decision, stand firmly by it.  That is what I believe has been done.</P>
    <P>We made up our minds fairly quickly at the beginning of this war.  We have taken a line which we believe it was in the national interest to take.  We believed that was the right decision for the country and that we were supported in it by the people.  We heard no voice in the country saying that we were wrong or objecting to our decision. Our anxiety was in this time of trial to make every effort to put the position of our defences both from the military and economic point of view on a sound foundation.  That was our principal purpose.  We thought it right, having made up our minds on the national policy, that we should not have injected into it controversies as to whether the present fight was a fight for Christian principles or a fight for something else.  If Deputy Dillon claims the right to express his views and have them published widely, then there are other people who will take, with no less strength and no less conviction, the completely opposite point of view.  We are then going to have, if they are permitted freely to take place, the most vehement expressions of opinion on opposite sides.  If it were to stop at expressions of opinion&mdash;we all know the further dangers involved &mdash;it would be all right but it is not going to stop at that.  It is going to involve efforts, on the one side or the other, to get the people away from a particular line of policy and to make <Col N="1910" /> another line of policy supreme.  We are going to have here all the efforts of war propaganda.  That is, unfortunately, the position.</P>
    <P>I personally should like to see people express their views, though I sometimes might be inclined with the knowledge I have acquired over a number of years of the motives that drive nations to war, to say of such statements as Deputy Dillon's: &ldquo;It is magnificent, but it is not common sense.&rdquo; Whilst it may be good to have high ideals and to express them, to express the view that right is worth fighting for, and so on, when that leads to developments that are going to have dangerous consequences for our country at the present time, I think the censor ought not permit it.  We have to choose which it is to be&mdash;whether there is to be complete silence or whether there is to be free expression of opinion&mdash;violently expressed on one side and equally violently expressed on the other.  I think we are better off in present circumstances in suppressing such expressions of opinion on both sides.  I think that is necessary, and it is the principle on which the censor has had to act.  I do not know what view he will take to-night about it.  I see he has a problem, because if he allows Deputy Dillon's remarks to be published, he must also allow others. Similarly, the Ceann Comhairle is sometimes constrained to allow a matter which seems to be irrelevant to be raised in this House although it might have been ruled out of order, because some other Deputy was guilty of an irrelevancy prior to that, and the Chair then had to allow the second irrelevancy to be introduced.</P>
    <P>With regard to national policy I have no doubt whatever that our duty here is to protect our people as best we can. I cannot tell what the future may hold. I have an imagination just as lively as that of Deputy Dillon and I can imagine all sorts of horrors that may come to this country as a result of this war, on one side or another.  All I can do is to try so far as I can to put the country into that state of defence in which it will be able to protect itself against attack from any quarter and then trust in God.  That is all I <Col N="1911" /> can do.  I have not got any special revelation to tell me that this is a war for Christianity and that it is our duty as a Christian people to go out on a crusade.  As was pointed out by certain Deputies, we have a large number of Christians on one side and a large number of Christians on the other.  We do not get revelations in regard to these matters.  We have to try to arrive at conclusions by examining the world as we see it about us.  I am just as anxious as Deputy Dillon about the preservation of certain rights and privileges and I have just as great a horror as he has of the possibilities that may face our people but, with the responsibility of meeting the situation that exists, I have no doubt whatever that the line the Government has adopted, a line that has been supported by the vast majority of our people, is the right line for our people.  That does not really mean that people are quite indifferent about the issues.  I am sure there are very many people in this country who are anxious about this war and that there are very large numbers who are thinking about what the whole thing is going to end in.</P>
    <P>Some reference was made to the part we can play in international affairs. All I can say is that on any occasion I had to speak at Geneva I tried to get settled in time by means of conference things which if they were not settled would lead to war.  I have seen, as far as the League of Nations was concerned, certain cases arise in which there seemed to be a moral obligation on the part of the League of Nations to do certain things.  These things were not done by some of the big States.  The reason they were not done was that on some practical ground it seemed prudent to these States that these things should not be done.  However, I do not think we have got any responsibility for the present war.  So far as the question of our entry into the war is concerned, if I could detach a number of countries from it I would do so.  I think the less of humanity that becomes involved in it the better.  It may involve civilised humanity as a whole before it is finished.  We may find ourselves in it. <Col N="1912" /> If we do find ourselves in it, I hope our people will fight for something which they are sure is right and one of the things which we can be sure is right, is that we here are a nation and that we do not want to interfere with anybody. We are not guilty of any aggression against any other nation.  We want to live here peaceably and to be left alone in regard to our own affairs. We want to live and let live.  If anybody does attack us, then everyone of us can die, if necessary, fighting for what we are certain is a just cause&mdash; and I say that, no matter from which side we are attacked.  That is the position we are taking up and it is not a cowardly position.</P>
    <P>We are not a great country.  If we are to be attacked at all, in all probability we will be attacked by one of the big States of the world.  We have to face that and, if we are prepared to face it, our attitude cannot be described as cowardly.  We are not impressed by anyone who pretends that we are following a cowardly policy by trying to sneak out of this or out of that.  We are determined to live our own lives in our own way and, if the warring worlds come upon us, then we will know that in defending ourselves we will be doing what is right.  It will be something to know that if we do fight we will be fighting for something about which there can be no doubt, and that is that we are right.</P>
    <P>The Deputy has been talking about the possibility of our being drawn in on the one side or on the other.  I say that we are ready to fight in order to maintain our rights as much against one side as against the other.  As far as any leadership is concerned, it will be leadership to maintain our rights as a nation against any aggressor whatsoever. We have not the arms we would wish for and we are, therefore, in this position, that in waging that fight we may not be as well-equipped as we would like to be.  The position is that we are not spoiling for a fight and we are not voluntarily involving ourselves in a conflict.  We are simply in the position of a man who may be attacked by somebody who has no right to attack him and he will defend himself <Col N="1913" /> with any weapons he has in his hands and he will fight to the best of his ability.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to go into this matter more deeply.  If there was a positive motion before the House and if there was an appearance of any considerable difference of opinion in the House with regard to national policy, I would, perhaps, deal with it in more detail, but I do not think there is and there will be ample opportunity later for me to go more fully into the reasons for our present policy.</P>
    <P>I do not know that there is any use in my going more fully into the mission of the Minister for the Co-ordination of Defensive Measures to the United States of America.  He was received in audience by the President, by the Secretary of State, by the Under-Secretary of State and by some of the other heads of the Administration.  Whilst there he explained to them fully what the Irish attitude is.  I think that if the report of his conversations was made public, it would be found to be in no way different from the statements I make in the House with regard to Government policy.  We cannot compel anybody to give us what they say they are themselves short of, or what they do not want to give us.  We have simply asked for certain things and expressed our feelings of goodwill &mdash;and there are genuine feelings of goodwill between the people of this country and the people of the United States.  There is no doubt whatever about that.  I have been privileged more than once to express them, so that there should be no doubt about it.</P>
    <P>But we are sometimes asked to give this facility or that facility, as if it were a matter of giving the loan of a grid-iron or something of that sort, quite forgetting that what we are being asked to do is to enter this war&mdash;that is what it amounts to.  I was speaking to one person who happened to visit us here and he asked: &ldquo;Why do you not do this?&rdquo; He observed: &ldquo;If a neighbour's house was on fire, surely you would allow the firemen to get up on your roof to put out the fire next door?&rdquo; Of course we would, but that <Col N="1914" /> is not an analogy to what we are being asked to do.  What we have been asked to do is to set our own house on fire in company with the other house. We have been asked to throw ourselves into the flames&mdash;that is what it amounts to.</P>
    <P>Prudence is not cowardice.  There must be an examination of what your means are and what the consequences of your action are likely to be. Ordinary prudence is not cowardice.  It is one of the powers given to us in order to enable us to conduct ourselves and live as human beings in the world. We have certain duties to perform on behalf of our people.  We try to exercise the virtues of foresight and prudence in so far as it is humanly possible to do it and when people ask us why we cannot give this facility or that facility, we ask them: &ldquo;Do you realise what you are asking us to do?&rdquo; It is all very well for a big nation, a nation at a distance, to give facilities and act in that particular way.</P>
    <P>Let us consider what our position would be.  After this war we might find that we would have very little to say, as little to say about the terms on which it should end as we had to say about the terms on which it began. The big nation is not in that position. The big nation will be big enough at the end to insist that the things it fought for are the things that will be accomplished in the peace.  A small nation getting into the war is in no such position.  Its services are availed of for the time being, but when the end comes, and when it says: &ldquo;Our people fought for such an ideal,&rdquo; its views will not be considered.  Certain people will sit around the table at the peace conference, the big four or five, or whatever their number may be. They will deal with the settlement, and they will be quite capable of making a settlement to suit themselves.  They can give the small nations any sort of an excuse they want to.</P>
    <P>When a small nation is asked to join in the war it is asked to make what are incomparably bigger sacrifices than the sacrifices that are made by the bigger States.  I have never been the slightest bit impressed or affected, or even hurt, <Col N="1915" /> by suggestions that Ireland in this war is not playing its part.  Ireland in this war is doing its national duty, its duty to its own people.  Of that I have no doubt.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Department I am very glad that a number of Deputies who spoke testified to the service which has been rendered by it and the courtesy which has uniformly been shown by the officials.  I have been Minister for External Affairs since this Government came into office and I have found there a magnificent staff. We are blessed in having people who have had long experience there, who know their work and who are competent to deal with it.  It has been a pleasure to work with the officers of that Department.  Although not physically in the office, I have always been connected with it by direct wire and otherwise and I may say that any particular questions I have to ask are promptly dealt with and any decisions I am asked to give are communicated immediately.</P>
    <P>It is undoubtedly an extra task for the Head of the Government to undertake&mdash;to act, at the same time, as Minister for External Affairs.  It would be ridiculous to say that the details of administration could be carried out as efficiently by a person who has other duties as they could by the same person if he were free to devote the whole of his time to that particular Department. If I were leaving public life to-morrow there is one piece of advice I would leave to those coming after me, should they care to take it, and it is that in this State, as in all small States, it is almost absolutely essential that the Head of the Government should also be the Minister for External Affairs. In regard to outside affairs, the nation ought to appear as one.  In a case like that, where decisions have to be come to from day to day, you cannot, if there is any divergence of opinion, as there will be between any two human beings, have that showing itself, and getting wider and wider.  I think, although that arrangement does mean that it would not be so easy to deal with the details of administration as <Col N="1916" /> it would be if you had a Minister giving his whole time to the Department, that, nevertheless, the part-time service that can be given to it by the Head of the Government is, from the point of view of the national interest, more valuable than would be the whole time but divided work of another Minister.</P>
    <P>I believe that the present practice is a good practice, and that it should continue. I have been at pains to see how the system of having a Secretary for Foreign Affairs different from the Head of the Government works in other States.  It is, however, only done in this way: that in that particular Department of work, the Secretary for Foreign Affairs is really not as complete and as absolute a master of his Department as the Ministers in other Departments generally are.  The other evening I said that the ideal would be if the Head of the Government could be a sort of senior partner in every Department, but, as I pointed out, that is not possible under modern conditions. In regard to External Affairs, in so far as I have been able to find out, the practice in other countries has been: that where there was a Secretary for Foreign Affairs, other than the Head of the Government, he was so constantly in touch with the Head of the Government in regard to various matters, that the Head of the Government was really the senior partner.  I do not think I have anything more to say on the Vote.</P>

      <P>That a sum not exceeding £5 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending the 31st day of March, 1942, for a Contribution towards the Expenses of the League of Nations.</P>
      <P>The sum for which this Vote is taken is, of course, merely a token provision. The reason for that is, that at the time at which the Estimate was prepared, no communication had been received from the League of Nations with regard to its Budget for the year 1941 and the amount of the expenditure to be borne by this country.  We have since received a communication containing these particulars and it is under consideration in the Department.  It may be necessary to come to the Dáil for a substantive Vote later in the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It will be obvious to Deputies that, in present circumstances, the League of Nations cannot function.  So far as its political activities are concerned, it has ceased to function at all, and although some of its technical activities continue, principally the activities of the International Health Organisation <Col N="1918" /> and the Economic and Financial Organisation, these can only be carried on on a much reduced scale owing to lack of funds, difficulties of communication and other causes.  Generally speaking, this reduction in the scope of the League's activity has been accompanied by corresponding reductions in its establishment and expenditure.  The total staff of the League of Nations' Secretariat now consists of about 110 officials as compared with 688 officials in 1939. The estimated expenditure for 1941 is approximately one-half of that in 1940 and one-third of that in 1939.  A large part of the continuing expenditure&mdash; about one-third of the total&mdash;is required to cover pensions to outgoing officials and deficits on the Budgets of previous years.</P>
    <P>Of the 110 officials of the League still in office, about 70, I think, are at Geneva and the bulk of the remainder, including the staffs of the Economic and Financial Sections, are in the United States.  The staff of the International Labour Office is similarly divided.  Of the 95 officials who remain in office, 35 are at Geneva and the remainder with a few exceptions are in Montreal.</P>
    <P>Although the proposed Budget for 1941, is only a half that for 1940, and one-third that for 1939, our contribution to the expenses of the League is not reduced proportionately.  The reason for that is that within the last two years an appreciable number of States have terminated their membership of the League and a few, while remaining members, have suspended payment of their contributions.  In both cases the result is to increase the financial burden carried by those States who continue to be members and to discharge the financial obligations of membership.</P>
    <P>Whatever the political future of the League may be, there seems to be a widespread feeling that its technical activities, such as its work in collecting and publishing international statistics, in co-ordinating national public health programmes, in promoting the suppression of the international traffic in dangerous drugs, etc., will survive the present difficulties and continue to <Col N="1919" /> play a useful rôle in the post-war world, and that the financial burden of keeping the League organisation in existence is justified by the desirability of preserving such a nucleus of international co-operation.  Every member of the League, as long as it continues a member, is bound to contribute towards the expenses of the League and a State can only cease to be a member of the League on giving two years' notice of its intention and discharging all its outstanding financial obligations.  We have not given notice of our intention to terminate membership of the League of Nations, and, having regard to the policy which we have adopted towards the present world situation and the position of neutrality which the people of this country wish to preserve in the present conflict, I do not suggest to the Dáil that such a step should be taken.</P>
    <P>With this explanation, I would ask the Dáil to pass the present token Vote on the understanding that if, as a result of the communications which we have received since the Estimate was prepared, it is found that a contribution from this country to the League in respect of the year 1941, is properly and fairly due, it is possible that a substantive Vote for the amount required to discharge our obligation may be presented to the Dáil in the course of the year.</P>
    <P>Vote put and agreed to.</P>

      <P>That a sum not exceeding £8,000 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending the 31st day of March, 1942, for the Emergency Scientific Research Bureau, including a Grant-in-Aid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1920" /> Deputies will recollect that the Emergency Scientific Research Bureau, which was set up on the 20th February last, was financed up to the 31st March by means of a new Estimate for £1,450.  The contemplated outlay for the whole of the current year is £12,000.</P>
    <P>As I explained when last year's Estimate was before the Dáil, the bureau is an advisory body attached to the Department of the Taoiseach, and has been established by the Government in view of the restrictions arising from the emergency on imports of essential commodities and raw materials.  It will deal primarily with the technical problems involved in the provision of substitute processes and materials during the period of the emergency.</P>
    <P>Its terms of reference are as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(1)  To give technical advice to the Government on such special problems relating to industrial processes and the use of substitute materials as may be referred to it.</P>
    <P>(2)  To advise the Government generally on the use of native or other materials to meet the deficiencies caused by the restriction of imported raw materials and commodities.</P>
    <P>(3)  To direct or conduct special researches and inquiries connected with the above.</P>
    <P>This emergency body was not intended to take over the ordinary duties and functions of the Industrial Research Council.  It was intended solely to investigate promptly and advise on exceptional problems which demand immediate attention in the circumstances of the moment arising out of the interruption of our normal supplies. It was not intended that its investigations should be on a long term basis, but rather that it should confine itself to difficulties which there are grounds for hoping can be overcome either partially or wholly within a reasonable time.</P>
    <P>For some time past, and before the foundation of the bureau, the question of the reorganisation of industrial <Col N="1921" /> research has been under consideration, but, to give effect to this, new legislation would probably be necessary, and this would require a good deal of preparation and would take an appreciable time to complete, particularly as most of the Departments which would be concerned are fully engaged on other emergency work.  It is in these circumstances that it has been decided to set up an <i>ad hoc</i> body, rather than to make use of the Industrial Research Council, which, as at present constituted, is not well adapted to deal with the immediate problems confronting the State.</P>
    <P>The Estimate itself is divided into two sub-heads.  Sub-head A provides for honoraria and incidental expenses. The honoraria, which are at the rate of £300 a year for each of the five members of the bureau, amount to £1,500, and the incidental expenses, which include travelling expenses, etc., for members of the bureau, amount to £500.  The second sub-head B is a grant-in-aid of investigation and research and amounts to £10,000.  This sum is intended to cover all outlay in connection with investigations and researches, including remuneration, travelling expenses and subsistence allowances of investigators, purchase or hire of equipment, and so on.</P>
    <P>Since its institution the bureau has set on foot investigations covering a very wide field.  As many of them&mdash;in fact most of them&mdash;are at present incomplete, I do not propose to refer to them in detail.  The Dáil may, however, wish to have a general outline of the matters which are under consideration. Particular attention has been given to the production of alternatives to petrol for road transport. These investigations are concerned in the main with the manufacture of fuel for producer plants.  Experimental work is also being undertaken for the purpose of improving the efficiency of producer plants themselves.  A scheme for the manufacture of turf charcoal as a fuel for producer plants is under active consideration.  Carbonisation experiments on turf are being carried out at the Dublin and Dundalk gas works, but the results so far have been disappointing.  It has been decided, <Col N="1922" /> however, to continue the experiments in view of the importance of the problem.  Information has also been collected on the use of town gas and by-products from gas manufacture as alternatives to petrol for road transport. As regards town gas itself, the production of which depends on imported coal, of which future supplies cannot be assured, an investigation is proceeding into the possibility of utilising wood or peat as substitutes for the imported material.  Experiments are also proceeding in regard to the regeneration of used lubricating oils, which are, of course, essential to a greater or lesser degree in every industry.</P>
    <P>Successful experiments have been carried out on the production of certain materials necessary for the tanning industry&mdash;materials which can no longer be imported.  The possibilities of seaweed and kelp as sources of various materials likely to be in short supply are being examined.  The bureau has also examined the possibility of the use of sewage sludge as manure, and has reported that this material has little or no value as a fertiliser. The question of the manufacture of pulp for paper making is also under examination.</P>
    <P>An endeavour is also being made to utilise native sources of supplies of sulphur dioxide, starch, glucose, gelatine and certain acids used in the manufacture of confectionery, and there is a prospect of getting some of the country's needs of these commodities. Arrangements have been made to carry out an investigation on the value of effluents from certain textile factories, with a view to seeing whether it can be usefully recovered.  Assistance is being given in the manufacture of carbon dioxide for mineral waters, and at least one well-known firm which was about to close down for lack of supplies of this gas will now be able to continue production.  Problems relating to a number of other matters have also been examined by the bureau; for example: soap making, meat extracts, refrigeration, textiles, ropes, cutlery, matches and so on.</P>
    <P>Members of the bureau are in constant touch with the Department of <Col N="1923" /> Supplies and the Department of Industry and Commerce, and are attending conferences with representatives of various industries which are being organised by the former Department. In addition, the bureau has interviewed representatives of numerous firms in connection with their individual problems.  In conclusion, I should like to warn the House not to expect sensational results from the work of the bureau.  At best, it can only assist in the production of substitutes for imported materials, and the extent to which it can do this is restricted in many cases by reason of the fact that our native resources in many commodities are strictly limited.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Can we get any information regarding the operations of this body in respect of other work than merely synthetic experiments? For example, we are now exporting some goods from this country which were not formerly exported, preserved foods and so on, and the containers for certain of those commodities which we export have been stated by some people to be unsuitable.  It is important to ensure that our exports should be kept up to a high standard, and it would be very unfortunate if, by reason of the shortage of materials which were formerly available, the standard of our exports should fall.  The principal one which has been mentioned to me was eggs; the second was meats, either cooked or uncooked, in containers. I am particularly interested in ensuring that the standard of our exports from this country should be maintained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I take it that the work on which the bureau has so far been engaged is that of searching for substitutes.  The Minister mentioned that they had examined sludge, and found it was not useful as a fertiliser.  There are parts of the country where the soil is very light, and other parts where there is practically no soil at all.  Would he consider whether it is a practical proposition to carry the sludge to those places?  In the normal course of events, it might be a practical proposition to incur the transport charges, <Col N="1924" /> but surely even at the moment there may be occasions upon which rolling stock might be going empty to parts of the country, and it may be possible to come to some arrangement with the carrying companies to transport the sludge on those occasions.  It is almost inconceivable that sludge would not be of some value.  Even if it is not used as a fertiliser, it ought to be available for such places as cut-away bogs, and other places of that kind.</P>

      <P>Would the Taoiseach tell us whether there has been any development in connection with the Drumm Battery?  Personally, I believe that this fund is a starved fund.  Having regard to the fact that it was recently announced in the newspapers that the Drumm train would continue to run while other trains are being put off, I would ask the Minister whether he would consider it advisable to make a little more money available for research work in regard to the Drumm Battery.  Personally, I do not think we are using to the full the brains of those who can and who would be engaged in research.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not particularly informed about the case with regard to containers for our produce, which has been referred to by Deputy Cosgrave.  I shall get in touch immediately with the Minister for Agriculture to find out if there are any difficulties in that particular direction which might possibly be overcome by examination by the research bureau. As I say, I do not know what is the exact position, and the Minister for Agriculture, undoubtedly, would be able to let me know if there is anything of a practical character that can be done by the bureau.  If there is anything that can be done, there is no reason why the bureau should not be asked to examine the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to Deputy Byrne's reference to the Drumm train, that does not come in here directly under this particular Vote.  I do not think it is true to say that it has been starved for funds.  My information is that the State has been very generous in giving <Col N="1925" /> funds for the possible development of that particular experiment.  It is a matter, I suggest, that the Deputy had better take up with the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  I do not think there was any question of giving up investigations or experiments on that, at any particular stage, through want of funds.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>And the investigations will continue?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, I am not giving any promise as to that.  After all, as far as the Research Bureau is concerned, it was set up to deal with problems arising immediately out of the war, and not to deal with what you might call long-term problems.  It seems obvious to me, at any rate, that the sums spent in regard to the Drumm experiment were sufficiently large, and spread over a sufficiently long time, to examine the possibilities of anything being done normally, and I think these possibilities have been reasonably examined.  However, I am not passing judgment one way or the other.  That is a matter on which the Minister for Industry and Commerce would be much more competent than I to inform the Deputy and the House.  I could get the information for the Deputy, but I think it would be better for him to have the information direct from the Minister concerned.  My own impression, however, is that we have not stinted that experiment and that the State has been generous in giving every opportunity to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>My point was this: that having spent so much and got so far and met with such success, it might be worth while to continue the investigations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, it is a nice matter of judgment, as the Deputy will realise, to decide how far you have got and whether there is any use in going further or not, or whether it would be wasting money to pursue the matter further.  There is bound to be a difference of opinion in matters of that sort.  Before I could pass judgment on that, I should have to give a great deal more consideration to it than is <Col N="1926" /> possible within the few minutes that I have at my disposal.  I do think, however, that it was wise to establish this bureau.  Wherever research is concerned you can never predict that you will have this result or that result. The one thing is, that you are satisfied that an effort has been made, and that you did not sit down with your hands in your pockets and made no effort to see whether this is possible or that is possible, and any line that seems to offer any reasonable possibilities will be investigated by the bureau in regard to any matter.</P>
      <P>There is another thing that is happening in connection with the various problems that would call for scientific information and knowledge. These problems are gradually coming in, and there is no doubt that the men who are members of that bureau, and the records of the bureau, will finally have a great deal of valuable information, even for the future, and if the bureau did not function in some other way afterwards, all that material would be made available for industrial research or for whatever organisation would be continued in normal times. Its present purpose, however, is to help us in our present difficulties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, there have been. I have read for the House the main line of research, which is to see to what extent it is possible to improve producer plants; for instance, producer gas, and so on, and then to try to get native fuel for these producer plants. If there were sufficient quantities of anthracite, for instance, that would be one form, but we are trying peat, particularly, with a view to seeing what can be got by way of the carbonisation of peat, since that is a fuel that we have in the largest quantities.  As I have said, however, so far the success has not been in any way marked.  One thing we can all be satisfied about now, which we could not be satisfied about before this, is that we have scientists at work trying to use their brains to solve our difficulties with the knowledge <Col N="1927" /> that they have.  It would be worng, I think, to have problems, such as those with which we are faced, and not to have harnessed some of the best minds towards the solution of these problems.</P>

      <P>On the Second Stage of this Bill I pointed out that really it was not at all a Committee Stage Bill and that it appeared to me to be a Bill mainly, for Second Reading.  I think the House was prepared, in the main, to give me the Second and Final Stages at that particular period, but exception was taken, for another reason, I think, by some of the Labour Deputies.  I do not think, however, that there was any suggestion that it was a Bill that was going to be amended in detail, and so I would ask the House to accept the Bill at this stage.</P>
      <P>Bill put through Committee, reported without amendment, and received for final consideration.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill do now pass.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>In the course of the Budget speech, the House learned, for the first time, that a new order had been passed, which has since been called the Standstill Order.  The only manner in which that came before the House was by a motion of a member of the Labour Party to annul it. Three hours' debate was allowed.  On the occasion of the annulment motion, the Minister in charge commenced to speak somewhere about 20 minutes to 10 o'clock, and concluded at 20 minutes past 10.  The seconder of the motion then proceeded to wind up the debate from 20 minutes past to half-past 10, and that is all that was allowed on it. Now, the cause of complaint is that the Ministerial case was not made in connection with this order until within the last hour of the discussion.  Surely, in a matter of that kind, the Government <Col N="1928" /> should regulate business in a more becoming manner so far as the House is concerned.  Here was a measure of considerable moment to very large numbers of people, and if it were not for the opportunity that was afforded by a discussion that took place in the Seanad, in which there was no restriction as far as I know, in connection with the discussion, this House would not have been in possession of the case that was made, as far as the Government was concerned.</P>
      <P>Now, I have got a second complaint to make: that in a matter of that kind, so far as my judgment is concerned, it was not contemplated, when this Act was going through the House, that it would be employed for the purpose of bringing in such an order as that, and we had no suspicion that this Act would be employed for that purpose.  The sum and substance of these two complaints is that, whereas this appeared to the Government to be the best method for introducing the standstill order, it appeared to a number of us that there was a far better method adopted in the North of Ireland or across the water in connection with the same matter, and the subsequent amendment of this order would indicate that the Ministry came to the same conclusion.  Now, it would be a satisfaction to us if, in the event of any similar departure from practice in introducing an order such as this, an early opportunity would be taken by the Government to explain the case for the order.  That is the first point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second point is that in connection with these emergency orders, which are published at frequent intervals, it ought to be the concern of the Government to save people's time.  An order is issued in which there is a reference to such-and-such an Act or to a previous order that has been made, and no mention whatever is made of the subject-matter of it.  It means going to the file, looking up the order and getting it out, and if 100 people do that&mdash;perhaps the Minister will say that is an exaggeration&mdash;there are 100 minutes lost in making that search.  Whereas, if a tag were attached with the information that it <Col N="1929" /> deals with such-and-such a matter, it would be of much more service and save the time not only of Deputies but perhaps of persons outside.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>It was under the Emergency Powers Act that Order No. 83 was made.  That order has not been effective in doing what the Minister thought it would do.  Does he propose to amend it in any way?  It was intended to bring matters to a standstill on a certain date.  While the order was effective as regards wages, the cost of living went up rapidly and no protection was afforded to those whose wages were stabilised.  Does the Minister propose to amend that standstill order in any way in order to get down the cost of living, at any rate, to the figure at which it was when the order was introduced? Unfortunately, it has kept down wages, but it has not prevented the increase in the cost of the necessaries of life.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot go into the standstill order, in general, its merits and so on, at this stage.  That matter has been debated a number of times by the House.  With regard to Deputy Cosgrave's point that the Government's reason for it had not been stated in time, it seems to me that the main lines of it were stated in the Budget speech, so that the House got timely notice of it and of the views expressed.  While that is so, I agree that it would be desirable, even from the point of view of the Government, that a full explanation should be made as early as possible. I do not know the circumstances under which the debate took place or whether the Minister's views were expressed completely before the winding-up of the debate.  There was only a short time given to him, apparently about ten minutes.  I do not know the facts, and I can only say that if that was so, it is desirable that the House should get as full an explanation as possible.  I am not saying whether it did or did not happen, because I am not in a position to judge.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I think my point has been missed.  One Party put down a motion to annul the order.  On the occasion of the Budget speech, I said that I was prepared to hear and decide <Col N="1930" /> on the case made for it.  I did not hear it until the debate was on the point of finishing and, consequently, had no opportunity of taking part in the debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister informs me that the case was made.  As I say, I am not in a position to know the facts at the moment.  All I can say is that, if the contention is that a reasonable opportunity should be given to the House to know at an early stage in the discussion of a motion what the Government's view is, it is desirable in my opinion that that should be done.  I think the Deputy can be met to that extent.  As to the question whether it did or did not happen, I am not in a position to judge.  There is a difference of opinion as between the Minister and Deputies on the opposite side as to what actually occurred.  In regard to the general principle, I think the Minister and everybody else are agreed that it is desirable, if a motion is being discussed by the House, that the Ministerial attitude in regard to the matter should be stated at as early a stage as possible.  If a motion is introduced to annul an order, if that takes a long time and only three hours are available for the discussion, it is evident that the Minister may be put very far back as regards the time at which the explanation will be given.  The matter will be borne in mind, but it ought to be possible to try to get the Ministerial defence or the explanation for it at as early a stage as possible.  But the rules of the House are that, when a motion is introduced to annul an order, the mover of the motion makes his case.  Then the seconder has the right also to make a speech, if he wishes, or to reserve his remarks for a later stage.  If you have two speeches and these are long, then naturally the Minister can only come in after these have been made and may be precluded from giving his explanation at as early a stage as would be desirable.  But everybody knows that it is desirable to have the Government case made.</P>

      <P>Perhaps I might give the history of this matter so far as my recollection of it goes, and I think it is reasonably reliable.  The question of making the standstill order and the general grounds on which it was felt that such an order should be made were stated by the Minister for Finance in his Budget speech.  In the course of the debate on the general Budget resolution this matter was raised by the principal speakers on the Labour Benches, at any rate.  It was dealt with by two Ministers in the course of the debate in fairly long speeches.  My own speech dealt with it mainly, and the speech of the Minister for Supplies was largely concerned with it.  Other speeches made in the course of the debate also touched upon it, some of them at great length &mdash;some of the critical speeches; so that, so far as the House is concerned, it had the earliest possible opportunity of discussing this matter, and, in fact, a procedure was devised which would permit that to be done.  Following that debate a motion was put down in the Seanad and a motion was also put down in the Dáil.  In fact, the motion was put down in the Seanad first of all, and the reasons for the order were debated there.  Subsequent to that debate a motion was put down in this House to annul the order, and a day was appointed for the debate.  At the instance of the Deputy responsible for putting down the motion, the debate was postponed, and then other Parliamentary business intervened.  It was only on the day preceding the lapse of the 21 days, the statutory period, that it was decided to have the debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was general agreement that the debate need not extend over three hours.  I hoped to intervene at a reasonably early stage, but some speakers intervened to prevent me, and I was unable to commence my speech in defence of the order until about 9.55 p.m.  I had to cease at 10.15 to allow the seconder of the motion, who had asked that the right to reply should be reserved to him, to deal with the situation.  The point <Col N="1932" /> I want to make is that, as far as the Government are concerned, they stated before the order was made the general grounds upon which it was being based. That was to give the House the earliest possible opportunity to debate the order.  The order was made that evening and was debated on the general Budget resolution on the following day and continued the whole of the subsequent day.  The matter was then debated in the Seanad.  When the motion was put down here it was again debated in this House, so that there was the fullest possible opportunity of discussing this order.</P>

In the year ended 31st March, 1940, an advance of £89,265 18s. 10d. was made out of the Central Fund to enable the Minister for Industry and Commerce to fulfil a guarantee given by him in respect of a loan of £90,000 raised by the Peat Fuel Company, Limited.  This advance, less certain repayments, was two years outstanding the 17th of the month, and the Minister for Finance has directed that; in accordance with Section 10 (3) of the Trade Loans (Guarantee) Act, 1939, provision shall be made in the Estimates for Public Services for the year 1941-42 for recoupment to the Central Fund out of moneys to be provided by the Oireachtas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. O Ceallaigh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
      <P>As the House is aware, after the occurrence of the incidents of bombing by foreign aircraft in this country at the beginning of this year, the Government undertook that compensation would be provided for the damage caused, whether or not the foreign Government responsible accepted liability and agreed to pay compensation. This Bill makes provision for such compensation in so far as injuries to property are concerned.  It was, at first, the intention to bring within its scope compensation for death and personal injuries as well but, on further consideration, it was thought better to keep such compensation in line with what was done or is contemplated in the case of other civilian classes like the Air Raid Precautions service, the Local Security Force and the Local Defence Force; differentiation could hardly be justified and might lead to complications because of the absence of uniformity.  I, therefore, propose to deal with compensation for death and personal injuries by a scheme to be made pursuant to an order under the Emergency Powers Act, 1939.  The scheme is at present in course of preparation. Death and personal injuries are accordingly not provided for in the present Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As well as injuries arising from the <Col N="1940" /> dropping of bombs, the Bill embraces damage to property caused by the explosion of mines washed ashore, drifting balloons and kindred incidents occurring while the country is neutral. It covers all such incidents that have occurred, or may occur, including the County Wexford incidents of 26th August, 1940.  The Bill follows generally the lines of the Damage to Property (Compensation) Acts, 1923 to 1933, but it requires all applications for compensation to be submitted in the first instance to the Minister for Finance who is given power to negotiate directly with claimants with a view to settlement of their claims. In the event of no agreement being reached, and only in that event, applicants can present their claims to the Circuit Court.  This arrangement is, I think, an improvement on the 1923 and 1933 Acts procedure.  It should save litigation and trouble, and make for economy and the speedy disposal of claims.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for compensation for all damage to property except, on the analogy of the Damage to Property (Compensation) Act, 1923, such personal effects as watches and jewellery not forming part of the owner's stock-in-trade, coins, currency, stamps, postal orders and so forth, as well as consequential loss, such as loss of business profits.  On the analogy, too, of that Act, damage to streets, roads, bridges, water-pipes, sewers and kindred items maintained by local authorities is also excluded, the idea being that local authorities themselves should be able, with their own labour and materials, to make good any such damage without being much out of pocket.  Another thing excluded is damage to ships and vessels, including equipment and the personal effects of the masters and crews which are not registered in this country or, not being capable of registration, are in non-Irish ownership.  The object of this is to preclude the owners and crews of foreign ships and vessels from benefiting under the legislation; the risk of damage should be borne by themselves or covered by insurance.</P>
    <P>The compensation to be awarded by the court for damage to buildings will <Col N="1941" /> be conditional on full reinstatement, and must not exceed the cost of complying with that condition less the amount, if any, by which, in the opinion of the court, the value of the building as reinstated would, because of reinstatement, exceed its value immediately before the damage took place.  The Bill gives power to compromise with claimants who have been awarded compensation by the court and find it impracticable to comply with the reinstatement condition, for instance, where a local authority under a town-planning or rehousing scheme is opposed to reinstatement.  In negotiations with claimants for direct settlement of their claims, I propose to follow the provisions in regard to reinstatement which govern the court, and to make an unconditional offer of compensation only in cases where I would be prepared to waive a reinstatement condition imposed by the court.  Where the property damaged is found to have been insured against the damage caused, the amount of the insurance will be deducted from the compensation payable.</P>
    <P>Some of the compensation under the 1923 Act was payable in the form of securities&mdash;compensation stock.  Under the present measure all compensation will be payable in money; for this purpose I propose to bring in a special Estimate as early as possible.  The Bill provides for a contribution by local authorities on a national basis of 25 per cent. of the total compensation paid in each financial year or whatever would be produced by a rate of 6d. in the £, whichever is less.  This more or less follows a corresponding provision in the Act of 1923 and is, it is felt, preferable to the alternative of a contribution only from the particular local authorities in whose functional areas the damage to property occurred.</P>
    <P>In my reply to a parliamentary question by Deputy Byrne on the 24th June I referred to the arrangement between the Department of Local Government and Public Health and the Dublin Corporation, under which the corporation have authority to carry out repairs to damaged dwelling houses sufficient to make them habitable, to provide temporary accommodation for <Col N="1942" /> people left homeless and to make cash advances to such people for the purchase of furniture and clothing.  Similar arrangements operate in other areas where damage has taken place, and power is taken in the Bill to recoup the local authority out of voted moneys the expenditure incurred. Where a house has been extensively damaged it is not intended that the local authority should carry out the repairs; generally, they should only take on the job where the expenditure is not likely to exceed £100, although no objection has been taken to this limit being stretched, to £130 or even higher where it was found as the work progressed that the cost cannot be kept within £100.  There is nothing to stop the owners of damaged houses from making their own arrangements for repairs.  The advances for furniture and clothing may be up to £50 and £30, respectively.  Money expended by a local authority on repairs, etc., is not to be taken into account by the court in assessing compensation under the Bill, but I am authorised to deduct the amount of such expenditure from the compensation.</P>
    <P>Compensation recovered from an external Government in respect of damage to property will, under the Bill, be paid into or disposed of for the benefit of the Exchequer, but should the amount in any case prove greater than what was awarded under the Act, the excess may be distributed among the parties concerned.  The House will appreciate that I cannot say at this stage to what extent we shall succeed in recovering compensation for all the damage caused.</P>
    <P>I propose to go into more detail on the various sections.  The definition section, Section 1, speaks for itself. Section 2 prescribes the injuries to which the Act applies and says that the Act shall apply only to injuries to property which occur while the State is not engaged in war.  Damage caused by our own Defence Forces, for instance, by anti-aircraft shells fired by them does not come under the Bill but falls to be dealt with otherwise by the Department of Defence.</P>
    <P>Section 3 indicates the persons entitled to compensation.  It precludes <Col N="1943" /> payment of compensation to local authorities for injuries to streets, roads, bridges, viaducts, subways, waterways and so forth which they are required by law to provide, maintain or repair.  I have already mentioned that the idea here is that the local authorities themselves with the resources of labour and materials at their disposal should be able to make good any such damage without being much out of pocket.  Sub-section (3) is to protect the interests of the Revenue Commissioners in the matter of estate duty. Sub-section (4) is to preclude people from getting compensation for injuries who have been compensated for them directly by a Government or authority outside the State; this has happened already in one or two cases where property was injured by aeroplanes, etc., coming down in this country.</P>
    <P>Under Section 4 all applications for compensation must be made to the Minister for Finance in the form and manner to be prescribed.  This may require applications to be in the form of a statutory declaration.  Applicants are obliged under the section to furnish all necessary information and particulars. Applications must be made within three months after the occurrence of the injury or, where the injury occurred before the passing of the Act, within three months after its passing.</P>
    <P>Section 5 directs that the Minister shall consider every application which is duly made to him and make an offer of compensation to the applicant or inform him in writing that he does not intend to make any offer.  The Minister may attach to an offer any conditions he thinks proper in relation to the expenditure of the compensation offered.  Generally the conditions envisaged here will be concerned with the reinstatement of damaged buildings and I propose in this connection, as I have mentioned earlier, to follow what is prescribed for the court.  The applicant is given six months to consider the offer made to him and if he accepts it or, by his silence, is deemed to have accepted it within that period, the compensation offered will be paid to him subject to compliance with any conditions attached to the offer whereupon <Col N="1944" /> he will have no further claim under the Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 6 enables a person who has refused the compensation offered by the Minister, or to whom he has made no offer, to apply within one month to the Circuit Court for compensation and for the hearing and determining of the application by the court in the normal way.  Section 7 provides for the fixing of the compensation by the court and the making of an order that the compensation shall be paid by the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>On the analogy of the 1923 Act Section 8 excludes from compensation watches and personal effects, coins, currency, stamps, postal and money orders, the loss and value of which would be difficult or impossible to prove.  Injuries to foreign ships and their equipment and to the personal effects of their crews are also excluded and, again on the analogy of the 1923 Act, provision is made for preparing a scale of compensation for injuries to documents such as muniments of title to property, stock and share certificates, wills and so forth.</P>
    <P>Section 9 deals with the compensation to be awarded by the court in respect of injuries to buildings and fixtures. It makes the compensation for damage to a building conditional on reinstatement, that is, the money must be used for erecting a new building on the site of the injured one or replacing the injured building, but so that the new or repaired building shall be not less valuable than the injured one and shall be of the same character or of a character suitable to the neighbourhood. The compensation is not to exceed the cost of reinstatement less the extra value, if any, of the new or reconstructed building as compared with the old one.  The reinstatement condition is also applied to fixed machinery and plant, but the court is empowered to waive it upon such terms as it may think reasonable.  The Minister is given power to waive reinstatement where the court has awarded compensation for injury to a building if he is of opinion that, owing to special circumstances or unforeseen events, compliance with that condition is inexpedient or impracticable. A case in point, as already <Col N="1945" /> referred to, would be where a local authority objects to reinstatement for reasons associated with town-planning or a building scheme.</P>
    <P>Section 10 restricts the awarding of compensation to actual damage done and excludes consequential loss and particularly loss of the use of the property or of mere pleasure or amenity. This also follows the lines of the Act of 1923.  By Section 11 the court is required to ascertain whether each person to whom it awards compensation was insured against the loss involved and, if so, to state in its order particulars of such insurance and the sum the person has been or is entitled to be paid under it.  The Minister is empowered to deduct the amount of any such insurance when paying the compensation.</P>
    <P>Section 12 provides that chattels lost or supposed to have been destroyed in respect of which compensation has been awarded and which are subsequently discovered shall be the property of the Minister and shall be disposed of by him for the benefit of the Exchequer to the person who got the compensation, or otherwise if that person does not purchase.</P>
    <P>Section 13 is the expenses section, and provides that the compensation awarded, less any deductions, court costs payable by the Minister, and administration expenses shall be defrayed out of voted moneys.</P>
    <P>Section 14 provides for the payment out of compensation awarded to a person of any debt due by him to a Government Department.  It is on the lines of similar sections in other Acts.</P>
    <P>The disposal of compensation recovered from an external Government or authority is dealt with in Section 15.  All such money received will be paid into or disposed of for the benefit of the Exchequer, and if it transpires in respect of an injury that more is received than the amount of compensation awarded under the Act, the amount of the difference may be paid to the parties concerned out of voted moneys.  Provision is made for the recoupment or partial recoupment from the same source to local authorities of their contribution towards the cost of <Col N="1946" /> compensation where compensation is recovered from abroad.</P>
    <P>In Section 16 provision is made for a contribution by local authorities (county councils and county borough councils) towards the cost of compensation under the Act.  The amount, which is limited to 25 per cent. of the compensation, is to be levied on a national basis at a flat rate in the £ valuation within a maximum figure equivalent to the produce of a rate of 6d. in the £.  Section 17 empowers local authorities to enter on and inspect damaged buildings and, after notice, to repair them unless the occupier or his immediate landlord undertakes to do so.</P>
    <P>Provision is made in Section 18 for the recoupment out of voted moneys to local authorities of money expended by them, under authority given by the Minister for Local Government and Public Health, in relation to or in consequence of injuries to which the Act applies.  This relates to the advances I have already referred to for the purchase of furniture and clothing within the limits of £50 and £30, respectively, as well as to the expenditure incurred in repairing dwelling-houses.  The court is not to concern itself with these items when fixing compensation but the Minister is authorised to deduct from it the appropriate amount in respect of them.  Section 19 contains in relation to any expenditure by Government Departments provisions similar to those in Section 18 as regards expenditure by local authorities.</P>
    <P>Section 20 fixes a time limit of three years, from the date an award is made by the Minister or by the court, for the payment or recovery of the compensation awarded.  Section 21 prohibits court actions against any person to recover damages in respect of an injury to which the Bill applies.  Section 22 excludes from the provisions of the Criminal Injuries Acts injuries to which the Bill applies.  The making of regulations is provided for in Section 23.  Section 24 gives the short title.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, may I say that our assumption of responsibility to pay compensation for damage to property, irrespective of whether or not the external Government concerned accepts <Col N="1947" /> liability, may impose a heavy burden on the Exchequer.  It is not possible at this stage to give any firm estimate of what the total cost will be, in relation to the incidents that have already occurred.  I regret, as I am sure the whole House does, the circumstances that have led to the bringing in of this measure, and I feel that the proposals in it are fair and reasonable.  I ask the House to approve of it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Every member of this House will agree that the last statement of the Minister deserves our commendation. We all deplore the circumstances which have arisen which necessitate the introduction and passing into law of this Bill.  We feel very much for the people who, without any notice and very violently, had their houses and property destroyed, and who were left, in a number of cases, without any roof over their heads. Generally speaking, there is scarcely a comparison between this particular set of circumstances and the circumstances when the Act of 1923 was passed.  I had some responsibility for that Act. At the time, very large estimates had been made of the damage that was done, and the Act was framed with a view to limiting, as far as was reasonably possible, the liability on the citizens for repairing the damage and reimbursing those who had lost their property.  The circumstances of to-day are very different.  In quite a number, if not all of the cases, in connection with the damage covered by the Act of 1923, people were removed quietly&mdash;in comparison with the incidents which this Bill deals with&mdash;from their houses. In certain cases they were allowed to take some of their valuables.  In some cases, of course, the incidents were not very far removed from those with which we are dealing now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our problem is to compensate those who have been rendered homeless, or whose property has been destroyed by reason of damage done by belligerents since the commencement of the present conflict.  It is a case, to my mind, which would call for more generous treatment than was given in 1923.  The damage then was going on while the <Col N="1948" /> Bill was under consideration.  The general impression on the public mind was that it would run to say, 20 or 25 million pounds.  It was not until hostilities had ceased that anything like a measurable estimate could be made, and even then it was purely speculative.  Notwithstanding all that, the Act of 1923 was found, subsequently, to be scarcely fair to the persons concerned; and in 1925 or 1926 an additional ten per cent. was given to these people.  One of the reasons which operated to bring about that additional percentage of compensation was that, in the case of the City of Dublin, when the cases came before the court, the judge struck out any provision in the claims regarding foundations.</P>
    <P>It was quite a reasonable striking out, but subsequently when they lodged the plans with the corporation, the corporation insisted on new foundations, so they were caught.  If they had taken the precaution, and had enough capital, to have started rebuilding the moment the destruction had taken place, the corporation would have insisted then on foundations and they would have had a case to go before the judge.  I know one such case in which the architect insisted on new foundations, and that case went before the court on that basis.  Generally speaking, however, in quite a number of reinstatement cases in O'Connell Street, the judge quite properly struck out the foundation costs and the corporation quite properly insisted on the carrying out of new foundations.  That was one of the reasons.  There was another.  It was discovered, after reinstatement had taken place both in Dublin and Cork, that the valuation of the new premises far exceeded that of the old premises.  Provision was made in a subsequent Act&mdash;somewhere about 1925 or 1926&mdash;remitting for some seven years two-thirds of the rates, and leaving the person liable for only one-third of the then valuation for rates. So far as I can recollect&mdash;it is some days since I read it&mdash;this Bill makes no such provision.</P>
    <P>The first complaint is that this is a skinflint measure.  There is no doubt <Col N="1949" /> about that.  Some consideration should be given to the special circumstances, the extraordinary disturbance, when people were fired out into the street and left for a period without anything in the nature of shelter.  To that extent the provision which was inserted in the 1923 Act, of consequential loss or compensation for disturbance, should be reconsidered by the Minister.  The consequential loss case is very much stronger than it was in 1923.  In the area in which most damage was done recently, most of the premises destroyed&mdash;quite a number of them on the street front&mdash;were business premises. These people may be unable to continue in business for a period.  Anybody with experience as a shopkeeper will tell you that customers going away to other premises do not come back as quickly as formerly.  There is an interruption of business and there is a loss.  If they were unable to earn any money in the period before any restoration would take place at all, surely in equity they are entitled to consideration for that.</P>
    <P>The consequential loss which it was proposed to avoid, in the case of the 1923 Act, was on a much larger scale. It had in mind elaborate and extravagant claims arising out of the events of the period, and claims for the loss of property which might in some cases exceed the value of the property which had been destroyed.  A clause or provision could be inserted in respect of that, in quite a harmless way, which would give these people some consideration.  Take a case in point.  It will be found, in the case of the 1923 Act, that provision was made for a report by the judge in certain cases.  The Minister was not bound by the report.  He could consider it and he could weigh up the case as to whether the sum awarded in compensation was in excess of the equities.  If something of that sort were done in this case in respect of compensation for consequential loss, it would be reasonable.</P>

      <P>How are you going to measure consequential loss?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Take the case of a <Col N="1950" /> man in business.  Several of the persons in that area were licensed traders, grocers and general shopkeepers. Could not the Minister assess compensation on the basis of their income-tax returns?  They may be out of business for three months.  We can see at once what their position will be in that event.  Take the case of the employees who are thrown out of employment. If the employer thinks that they are very good men, he may pay them. Surely a man who puts himself to the pin of his collar to do that should be treated equally generously by the Minister.  I have not thought of an ideal solution of the problem but the minds which are capable of formulating a measure to prevent people getting money should be capable of exercising the prerogative of mercy, as well as dispensing justice, and of formulating a scheme which would meet the equities of the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The next criticism of this measure which I have to offer is in respect of the making of no allowance for loss of currency, postal orders and so forth. I know the Civil Service mind in regard to that aspect of the question; everybody outside the Civil Service is a dishonest man who could not possibly give a correct account of the cash which he has in the bank or in his cash box or anywhere else; only a civil servant could do that.  Some damage has been effected, whatever it is.  Compensation in respect of that damage would be no loss because, if currency notes have been destroyed, the Minister will get the compensation back by and by. I am sure it is not his intention to tax the people to that extent in connection with this scheme of compensation. Surely these business people had some money in their shops.  All shopkeepers are not rich.  There are occasions when a few pounds may be of some moment to them.  When I was down there, I saw one poor woman with 2/- in her hand.  If to that be added 4/- or 5/- which she might have had in the house and which she had lost, it is scarcely just to say that she should be left without compensation.  It is obvious that extravagant claims will be made. Personally, I should prefer to meet five extravagant claims to doing one man <Col N="1951" /> or woman who could not afford it out of a few pounds.  On reflection I am sure the Minister would feel the same way about it.</P>
    <P>The exclusion of watches and jewellery is due, I suppose, to the precautions certain people took, when their premises were destroyed, to describe the value of the jewellery on the premises. That there was some jewellery there I have no doubt.  No matter how modest or unassuming a lady may be, she will have some article of personal adornment.  If it is lost she should get some compensation for it.  The estimate of value may be 50 per cent. sentimental, 25 per cent. excess, and 25 per cent. accurate.  That is not a general rule, but it may be applicable in a particular case.  A little relaxation might be made in connection with that matter.  The provision in respect of the tax of 6d. on the local authority is not on all fours with the provision in the 1923 Act.  In the period prior to 1923, 3,000 bridges were destroyed in different parts of the country These were repaired by the State, and the State imposed a charge on the local authorities of 6d. in the £ for five or seven years in order to get some compensation.  That brought in about £250,000 a year. That figure might have been £280,000.  It is many years since that was done, and figures get mixed up in one's mind.  About £1,500,000 came into the Exchequer in connection with that matter.  It is unlikely that that paid the cost of the restoration of the bridges.  The local authority will have its own troubles in respect of water mains and other things of that sort which will need repair.  Then there will be loss in respect of the valuations put out of commission.  No rates will be paid from the moment of the destruction of the premises.  It would be practically impossible for the Minister to mention a figure in connection with the compensation we are providing here.  As long as the damage was kept within the limit of £250,000 or £500,000 it would be well, in view of the very violent evictions that took place by reason of this destruction, that these people, who must be shaken in mind and body, should get consideration in <Col N="1952" /> which justice would be very largely tempered with mercy.  It is unlikely that it would put an additional cost of 10 per cent. or 15 per cent. on the whole job, taking it from the beginning to the end.  It would be better that we should spend that extra money than that complaints should afterwards be made that we gave these people a lot of sympathy but very little else.</P>
    <P>The Minister is probably wise in introducing the measure in its very skinflint form if he is prepared afterwards to modify his view.  I think there is a case for modification.  He ought to see that, when the premises are restored, no extra cost will be imposed on the people concerned in respect of valuation.  I am sure that it is not necessary to inform him that in respect of one particular street in the North Strand&mdash;nobody amongst the persons concerned has spoken to me regarding this matter&mdash;the valuation of the premises, when reconstructed, is likely to be increased by 100 per cent. There will be no extra business and, in that connection, it would be scarcely fair if these people were subjected to extra costs in rates, seeing that they will not be compensated in respect of certain items and that they will have to face special competition arising out of their being out of business for a period and some of their customers going away.  It is a good thing the measure has been introduced, but it occurred to me that it was a pity to leave out of it the damage that might be occasioned by one of our own aeroplanes coming down.  Aeroplanes have a habit of coming down.  No provision is made, so far as I know, in that respect&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Very good.  The other point mentioned by the Minister does not call for any comment here.  By the time the war is over, the belligerents will have enough to do to pay their own accounts without paying ours.  I should not count very much on what we would get from them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to make a few remarks and, though they are more in the nature of queries that <Col N="1953" /> might be raised on Committee Stage, it is as well to have them cleared at the earliest possible moment, because there are points which are not quite clear in the Bill.  In the first place, we start with persons entitled to compensation. Consequential damages are rigidly ruled out.  I suppose there is a very good case for that, but at the same time there are certain individuals who feel that they have a legitimate grievance.  I can cite the case of one individual who lost his job as a result of one of the earlier bombings, and who is now out of employment.  I do not know whether the Minister could consider a case such as that.  I know it opens a very wide door.</P>
      <P>The next point to which I wish to refer is the time limit for the payment of compensation.  It looks all right on the face of it to say that there are three years within which compensation may be paid, but this is not the only country that after the cessation of hostilities will be rebuilding.  There is the question then as to when building costs will become normal.  This whole Bill is framed on the basis of the cost when the injury took place.  It may be many a long day before the cost of reconstruction comes back to that point, so I should like to suggest to the Minister that he might at least take power to vary that clause.  The Minister has mentioned his power of compromise.  That, I take it, is to deal with a case where a person feels himself unable to comply with the conditions and goes to the Minister to obtain some compromise.  I think the Minister will be placed in a rather invidious position.  Mention was made here some time ago of an occasion when so many buyers went to a fair and would not bid against each other. In this case there will be only one buyer at the fair.  The Minister will say to the applicants: &ldquo;Take it or leave it.&rdquo;  I would suggest to the Minister that he should make the award a marketable commodity. Perhaps the Minister may ask: &ldquo;What do you mean by that?&rdquo; I shall tell him what I mean.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I take it that the Minister in inserting a reinstatement clause wishes to prevent a person getting an award and then saying: &ldquo;Well, I shall invest that <Col N="1954" /> in securities and I shall live on the interest of my money.&rdquo;  I presume that is the object of the Minister in inserting that clause, but I would suggest to him that he is drawing the conditions too tightly.  Remember that there is a considerable area involved in which all sorts of new conditions will arise.  In one case there may be a dilapidated building and the person living next door may be a trader who wishes to acquire those premises.  I would suggest to the Minister that he should make those grants negotiable subject to certain conditions, namely, that they should either be spent in the area or in the city, whatever way he likes to put it.  That would then enable certain people to market their award and would get the Minister out of the invidious position of being the only buyer at the fair.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave raised a point with reference to the remission of rates.  I suggest that the Bill ought to contain a clause that the liability for rates ceased, at any rate, when the bomb fell.  I think that should be the logical outcome of this Bill, namely, that the liability for rates at any rate stopped whatever else was done.  I shall give the Minister an imaginary instance of an unfortunate person who finds himself with a house destroyed in that area and I hope, if my method of computing his losses is incorrect, that the Minister, when replying, will set my figures right.  I take the case of a person who, say, went into court to get compensation under Section 9 (b).  I suppose it does not much matter whether he was offered compensation by the Minister or was awarded it afterwards in court.  Say that A has a tenement house and that he pays £30 a year to B on a long-term lease.  The house has been wiped out.  A, for that house, paid outgoings amounting to £70 for rates, insurance and repairs. Then he has a head-rent of £30 a year making his total outgoings £100.  We shall assume that the gross rental he received was £200 so that he had a profit rent of £100 a year.  My reading of 9 (b) is that the condition of the house at the time of the injury would be taken into account in fixing the reinstatement cost.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1955" /> We shall assume that it would take £2,000 to reinstate the house.  Evidence would probably be tendered that it was an old house and that it was not in a good state of repair.  He would probably be offered five years' purchase of his profit rent of £100, namely, £500. The amount by which the estimated reinstatement of the building exceeds the market value&mdash;although market value is not mentioned in the section I take it that is what it means&mdash;is to be deducted.  Say that the reinstatement cost was £2,000 and that the value was £500, £1,500 would be deducted from the £2,000 and he would be awarded £500.  How is that person going to rebuild a house such as that?  It is not an economic proposition.  He will be unable to rebuild that house and he will be thrown on the mercy of the Minister.  He will have to go around and see what the Minister's powers of compromise are.  I do not know what the Minister's idea of his powers of compromise are but I should like to ask him what he would offer by way of contribution towards that £500.</P>
    <P>Is he going to say: &ldquo;My poor fellow, I see you cannot put up that house and here is £500 for you,&rdquo; or is he going to say: &ldquo;That is less <i>x</i> per cent.&rdquo;?  I should like the Minister to give us his idea of what <i>x</i> ought to be in the way of deduction from the amount that the person asking to make a settlement comes forward with.  That is why I am suggesting to the Minister that he ought to try to divorce these compensations from the site.</P>
    <P>The Minister may say to me: &ldquo;Yes, but what about the ground landlord? He must have some security for his rent.  If I let a person walk off with his compensation, the ground landlord may find that he cannot get his rent.&rdquo; I think that the Minister could very easily find some sort of formula in which, if a person wanted to take his grant away from the site, the landlord who held the site would either have to get a new tenant or be compensated or, in some respects, would have to have his interests protected.  My opinion, for what it is worth, is that the provisions as to compensation have <Col N="1956" /> been far too tightly tied to the site. Of course, the Minister must have ideas as to what is to be done with the grant and, where it is in the area of the city, I leave the Minister to make up his mind what would be the most satisfactory solution.  The more negotiable and the easier it is to trade in these grants, the easier and better and quicker a solution of this unhappy incident will be found.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Cosgrave, towards the end of his remarks, spoke of some of those people as being stricken in body and mind.  There has been one aspect of the situation almost completely overlooked in the drafting of the Bill and that, I think, in spite of the fact that representations have been made to the Minister with regard to the matter, and I feel he must have sensed some of the necessity for compensation, in respect to some of the matters upon which I am going to touch, on the occasion of his visit to the destroyed areas.</P>
      <P>Let us take the South Circular Road, Donore Avenue or the North Strand as they were before any damage took place, and let us speak of private families living there.  If a measure were introduced here that increased the debts of these families, by a stroke of the pen, anything from £25 to £100, the Minister can imagine what a crushing blow that would be to the heads of these families.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister can appreciate that there are very few heads of families at the present time who do not work along the border-line of evading debt, with all the crushing effect it has on the morale.  Very few of them escape without having a certain amount of debt hanging over them; they have just enough to enable them to scrape along and be able to relieve themselves of a little debt now and then. If, some fine morning, by an Act of this House, their debts were increased by anything from £25 to £100, a very crushing blow would have been delivered to those families and yet, apart from the disturbance caused by the bombs, apart from the dislocation and the personal loss, this Bill does, in <Col N="1957" /> fact, even in the stricken condition in which these families are, increase their debts by anything up to £100.</P>
    <P>Let us take a few cases and see some of the expense these families have had to bear, expense that is regarded as consequential loss and that will become, if this Bill is passed, an added debt.  Let me take the case of a man with nine in family.  He was out of his house for three months and three weeks.  He had to make a contract to take a house for three months and only by a certain amount of graciousness and good will was he able to escape making a contract for another three months&mdash;he had to go into the second period of three months. The rent of the house he went into was £26 and he had to pay £7 10s. in rates.  The removal and storage of furniture cost £24.  Under this Bill there is going to be no payment made to that man for the period when he was away from his home.</P>
    <P>His house is going to be repaired. The implication of Section 9 (1) (b) is that, even when his house is repaired and the painting, wall-papering and other decoration have been done, somebody will come along and say that it was two years since the house was repaired and that it is now repaired absolutely up to date and, instead of paying him the full amount of the cost of decorating and repairing, he will take off 20 per cent.  There you have a case in which £60 is going to be placed as a dead weight of additional debt on that man, apart from the family disturbance over that period.  Take a second case, the case of a pensioner and his daughter.  They had to go to a flat and they paid £1 5s. weekly for six months.  The removal and storage of furniture cost £37.  Take another case, that of a brother and two sisters. They had to go to a flat for 17 weeks at a weekly cost of 26/-.  The removal and storage of furniture cost £15 8s.</P>
    <P>In another case there was a widow with two daughters, and her source of income was entirely from boarders, except for the rent from a garage, which was destroyed.  I do not know what expense she was put to by reason of a dislocation of her business, <Col N="1958" /> but at any rate she lost her boarders and her income over a fairly considerable period.  In the case of a father, mother and daughter, they had to get alternative accommodation at £3 a week for a month.  They were with a friend for a considerable period at a rent of £1 a week.  The removal of the furniture cost them £9, and it will probably cost them as much to get it back. They had part of their furniture stored at £2 a month.</P>
    <P>These are only sample cases of individual losses, but they cover a very large number of houses.  In Donore Terrace, out of the number of houses damaged there, only nine families had to leave.  The Minister will understand that the same thing applies to a larger number of persons in the North Strand area.  When the Minister considers the matter, I do not think he can leave the Bill in its present form, with this additional debt hanging over people who have gone through so much.  There has been a considerable amount of fear, partly arising out of the fact that the local authority simply took on a certain type of repair, leaving the less pressing repair and re-decoration of houses to be done later on.  It would be helpful if the Minister would state explicitly that compensation is going to be paid for the complete doing-up and decoration of houses, as well as for repairs.  The impression has got abroad that compensation is not going to be paid in respect of out-buildings, dividing walls and things of that kind.  It would also be well if we had an explicit statement from the Minister that such is not the case, that compensation will be paid for motor cars that were damaged.</P>
    <P>Consequential damage of the kind I have referred to must, I submit, be provided for if serious hardship is not going to be inflicted on a great number of people.  It was sustained by the majority of those who suffered as a result of the bombing.  Hardship should not be inflicted on families in assessing the amount to be paid for the painting and re-decoration of houses.  They should not be put in the position that, while their houses were re-painted and re-decorated after the damage, they are going to be asked to <Col N="1959" /> pay a certain portion of the cost.  In connection with the points touched on by Deputy Dockrell, I think a conflict is bound to arise between Section 9 (1) (a) and Section 9 (1) (b), because, in my opinion, it will be found that you cannot do one and the other.  It is almost inevitable that there will be cases in which some of the people concerned will not be able to make a reinstatement of a kind that would be considered suitable.  Take the North Strand.  Nobody is going to suggest that there should be a replacement of the kind of houses that were there. Anyone who visits the district week after week will see that the area of deterioration and destruction is widening gradually.  Some of the property there was in a very old and damaged condition.  It would be impossible, I think, to expect the people who occupied some of those houses to reconstruct them in accordance with modern conditions and at the same time bear the additional cost of doing so.  You also had some houses there that were off the main road.  No one in their senses would ask for the replacement of these small little houses&mdash;groups of one-storey houses running along the side of the railway, and another group of two-storey houses running in some other direction.  A city planning authority would give no consideration to the erection of such houses.  It would be absurd to restore houses in that location and of the type that the old houses were.</P>

      <P>I must express my disappointment at the contents of the Bill, and of its inadequacy to meet the requirements of those who suffered from the recent bombing in our city. It is not so much what is in the Bill that worries one, but rather what is left out.  For example, no provision is made for hospitals and medical expenses, or for the payment of compensation for the loss of money and jewellery.  I know that money and jewellery were lost.  I saw small parcels of £1 and 10/- notes being burned in a small shop on the North Strand. The singed parts were handed to the authorities.  I think that people who had £25 or £30 in notes put by for the <Col N="1960" /> rainy day, and lost them as a result of the bombing, should be compensated. No provision is being made to meet consequential losses such as the temporary refitting of business premises or workshops.  I know a shoemaker who had to get a temporary hut erected as a workshop.  In his home that was destroyed he had an electrical machine.  To get the hut erected and the electrical machine coupled up cost him a £10 note.  His relatives, and not any public fund, helped him with that amount.  There is no provision to cover removal expenses incurred by those who had to find alternative accommodation, and, apparently, it is not proposed to compensate people who were rushed out of cottages and rooms for which they were paying rents of 5/- or 6/- a week into other accommodation for which they have now to pay 10/6 and 12/-.  A difference of 6/- a week in his rent is a very serious matter for a man in receipt of £1 2s. 6d. a week unemployment benefit for his wife, family and himself.  I have eight letters before me dealing with cases of that kind, as well as a large number of pawn tickets.  The people who have had to undertake this expense were just struggling along. They are now being called upon to pay higher rents than they had been in the habit of paying, and that means taking so many loaves off the tables of their families.  If some committee would examine a few of those cases, I think a few £10 notes or £25 notes would quickly be parted with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another matter for which no provision is made in the Bill is the reinstatement of those shopkeepers, when the premises are rebuilt, at the old rents.  It is all very fine to tell a person at the end of a couple of years that she can go back to her greengrocer's shop, but the rent of the new shop which has been erected on the site of the old one may be £2 or £3 a week, while the old rent was only 12/- or 14/- a week.  The widow who ran that greengrocer's shop, and made her living there, will not be able to pay that high rent, as well as the high rates which, no doubt, the Commissioners of Valuation will impose on the new building.  There is nothing in the Bill <Col N="1961" /> to say that there will be freedom from rates on the new premises for any period of years.  There is nothing in the Bill to say that the people can continue for a number of years in the new premises at the old rent or at the old rates in order to give them an opportunity to recover their trade. There is nothing in the Bill which provides for the compensating of persons who may have been out of business for a couple of years, while rivals in the trade captured their businesses.  There is nothing in the Bill to tell the widows of at least two men who lost their lives that they will be provided for pending a settlement in the courts of any compensation claim which they may put forward.  It is not right or proper that any person should have to write to a Deputy of this House and say: &ldquo;My daughter and myself were also badly injured, and we are at present dependent on relatives.&rdquo;  In this Christian country, people who suffered loss such as that should not be asked to depend on relatives, and they should not be told by any authority in this country that they should go and apply for poor law relief.  I would ask the Minister to make inquiries as to whether any of those people were told to go and apply for poor law relief. I think the Minister should also provide for the payment of costs in cases where some of those people seek legal advice in putting forward their claims. There is nothing in the Bill to say that those costs will be paid by the Government, or whoever it is that intends to pay the compensation.</P>
    <P>In Shamrock Cottages, Shamrock Terrace, which Deputy Mulcahy and myself visited, we found people in five-roomed houses with four of the rooms rendered uninhabitable, the ceilings being down and the plaster off the walls but they are still paying the rent of a five-roomed house.  I earnestly hope that whoever is responsible for the repairs will see to it that those unfortunate people will have their rooms made habitable for them as soon as possible, and that when the plaster is put on the walls again the paint and paper will not be forgotten.  Those are a very decent type of people, who were in the habit of keeping their cottages <Col N="1962" /> in a condition which was a credit to any citizen of this State, and their homes should be repaired for them as quickly as possible.  They always did everything possible to keep their houses clean and tidy, but now at the banging of a door or the opening of a window the plaster comes off the walls on to their bread and butter.  There is a number of things which I think the Deputies of this House should go and see for themselves in the bombed areas in order to realise how those people are suffering.  With the exception of one or two people the corporation had housed all the victims.  The corporation was very fortunate in having a housing scheme very nearly completed, so that they were able to house most of those people, but I understand that there are two who have not yet been provided for.  It is unfortunate that those two people are the widows of men who lost their lives, but I was informed to-day that they will be housed in the course of a few days.</P>
    <P>Consequential loss was referred to by Deputy Dockrell, who mentioned the cases of men who had lost their employment as a result of the bombing.  That would apply to a number of shop assistants who were employed in various shops in the North Strand.  I have personal knowledge of at least one case in which a man who was employed in a butcher's shop there lost his employment. I do not think he was insured. At any rate he lost his job, and nothing has been done for him so far. I hope the Minister will see that the Bill, when it becomes an Act, will be interpreted in the widest possible way. As far as I remember, it was Deputy Cosgrave who said&mdash;I think it would also be the Minister's personal view&mdash; that it is better to pay two people a little bit more than they are entitled to rather than do an injustice to one. Keeping that in mind, I hope the Minister will see that no injustice is done to people who had the misfortune to suffer as those people have suffered.</P>
    <P>There are many other points to which I had intended to refer, but I think most of them have been dealt with by other speakers.  Deputy Dockrell referred to the difficulty of getting the <Col N="1963" /> necessary materials for rebuilding those premises.  The Minister should see to it that every assistance is given to those who find themselves in that difficulty.  My attention has also been drawn to the fact that a number of people had to pay removal expenses, and some of them found it very difficult to get the necessary money.  I earnestly hope that all those matters will be considered by the Minister, and I hope that those people, some of them unemployed, who are suffering such hardships at the present moment, will get some assistance out of whatever funds are available.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestEdmondsonBenso" hpid="Mr. Benson Mr. Benson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Benson</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is regrettable that the Minister should have decided to deal with compensation for buildings and compensation for personal injuries in two different forms.  I think provision to deal with the second of those should have also been introduced by way of a Bill, so that it could have been freely discussed in the House and the best possible arrangements arrived at.  With regard to this Bill, my principal objection to it is in connection with Section 9, which has already been referred to by other Deputies, and more particularly sub-section (1) (a), which provides that compensation awarded by the courts shall be expended on the reinstatement of a building on its original site.  Admittedly, as the Minister said in his opening remarks, sub-section (2) makes it possible for the Minister to vary that qualification, but I think it would be better if the Bill itself did not contain that restriction.  I think it is obvious to anybody who knows or has seen the area of the North Strand that to suggest reinstatement there would be ridiculous.  I think everybody will agree that the only proper course to adopt in that particular case is that the corporation should develop the whole site anew.  Already there have been suggestions as to the manner in which that can be done, and there is no doubt about the fact that it can be done in such a way as greatly to improve the site from every point of view.  Yet if the restriction suggested in this Bill is there, that development <Col N="1964" /> cannot take place without the Minister's sanction.  I think that the Minister, when he was Minister for Local Government and Public Health, was both interested in and sympathetic towards town planning, and I am sure that although he has changed office he cannot have changed his views, and he should give consideration to the matter and simplify the position in that regard.</P>
      <P>The Minister might also consider whether it is desirable that in this Bill should be introduced some scheme which would make the acquisition of a site of that description easier for the corporation, perhaps, than is possible under some of the existing legislation. There is another thing about Section 9 which appears to me not&mdash;shall we say?  &mdash;to go very well with Section 6. Section 6 allows a person who has been either not made any award, or who is not satisfied with the award that the Minister has made, to go to the courts, and Section 9 then deals with the award which the court makes.  I think it may be presumed, however, that every case that does go before the court will go there because the person concerned is not satisfied with the amount of the award that the Minister has made, or because of some of the conditions he has attached to it.  Yet, having gone to the court on those grounds and having got an award from the court, he finds that under sub-section (2) he is back with the Minister again, because if, for any reason, he is unable or unwilling to build on the site, sub-section (2) gives the Minister power to vary the conditions of the award.  Therefore, we start off with the Minister, then go to the court, and then come back to the Minister again, which seems a most extraordinary proceeding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think there is no doubt that if the Minister insists on retaining that restrictive clause as to redevelopment on the site, an opportunity may be lost to Dublin.  We hope that we are finished with this unfortunate damage but, if not, and if there is more damage done, it may even be in a more important site from the point of view of town planning, and if this reinstatement-on-site provision is insisted upon, it may be that we will find ourselves, on a <Col N="1965" /> smaller scale, in the same position as London after the Great Fire of 1666, when there was a magnificent town plan produced, but the redevelopment took place on the old lines in most cases, with the consequence that London still consisted of a mass of narrow streets, courts, and so forth, up till last Christmas, when that position was modified somewhat.</P>
    <P>There is another matter which I should like the Minister to clear up and that is with regard to Section 12, which deals with chattels.  I do not suppose the ordinary man in the street has a very good idea of what a chattel is&mdash;I know that I have not&mdash;and I should like the Minister to clear up a situation such as this.  Supposing a person leaves his car in a garage for repair, and that car suffers damage. I take it, from Section 12, that the person to lodge a claim on that account is the owner of the motor car, it being his chattel, because it is not part of the stock-in-trade of the garage and, therefore, presumably, it would be the owner of the car who would have to lodge the claim.  That applies to various other trades besides that of motor repairing, and covers all trades which hold goods in charge for other persons.  It appears to me, too, that there is a certain conflict between Section 15 and Section 16.  Section 16, if I read it aright, requires that on certificate the Minister for Local Government will demand from all the county councils and county borough councils an amount of 25 per cent. of the total compensation, with a limit of 6d. in the £.  As I understand it, this applies to all county councils and county borough councils, whether their area has or has not suffered damage. The Minister, so far as I could understand, did not advance any reason why the ratepayers should pay this, rather than the taxpayer pay it entirely, but possibly, when he is replying, he will advance some reason for that.  However, the inconsistency &mdash;if I read the Bill correctly&mdash;arises under Section 15 (e), which is concerned with the disposal of compensation that has been recovered from an external government or authority. For myself, I do not consider that this <Col N="1966" /> is of much importance, because I cannot see the Minister realising anything from it, but it would be well to clear it up.  Section 15, paragraph (e) says:</P>
    <P>if any money has been paid to the Minister under the next following section...</P>
    <P>that is the section which demands the money from all the county councils and county borough councils,</P>
    <P>.... by the corporation of the county borough or the council of the county in which the said injury occurred, the Minister may pay through that corporation or council, out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas, such sum by way of recoupment or partial recoupment of the said money so paid to him as he shall think proper</P>
    <P>It appears, therefore, that he is going to demand up to 6d. in the £ from all county councils and county borough councils, but the repayment, if any, will be merely to those in which the injury has occurred.  I agree that there is a certain amount of equity in that, inasmuch as the county is going to be under certain expenses in the repairing of roads, bridges, and so on, but possibly the Minister will be able to explain the matter further when he is replying.</P>
    <P>Another point which has already been mentioned, and which I should like to stress, is in connection with Section 20, which limits the period of payment to three years from the date when the compensation was awarded. I think that, in fixing that period of three years, the Minister is unduly optimistic, because, even going on the assumption that no further damage is likely to occur, I believe that, if the Minister thinks that all that can be reinstated within a period of three years, he is certainly much more hopeful of the world situation than I am, because the war, undoubtedly, will go on for some time yet, and after the conclusion of hostilities practically the whole world will be on the lookout for building materials, and our place on the priority list, I am sure, will be pretty low, and the possibilities of the buildings being completed within that period, I fear, are very remote.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1967" /> I think that this stage of the Bill ought not to be passed without some expression of appreciation on the part of somebody in this House of the work which was done by the A.R.P. services at the immediate time, and at a subsequent period by the city manager and officials of the Dublin Corporation in looking after and re-housing the unfortunate people who were bombed on the North Strand.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephHannigan" hpid="Dr. Hannigan Dr. Hannigan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hannigan</NameTxt>
      <P>This long-expected Bill has at last arrived, and one might have expected it to excite much more interest on the part of members of the House.  I welcome the Bill if for no other reason than that it is the first positive sign of the Government's awareness that, in the titanic conflict which has been raging around our shores and throughout the Continent of Europe almost for two years, many of the capital cities and towns in almost every small country in Europe&mdash;neutral countries at that&mdash;have been subjected to devastating aerial bombing by one belligerent or another, and that the same fate may some day await this capital and the towns and cities throughout the country.  We all hope that such an unhappy event will not occur.  But had there been, as well there might have been, an aerial bombardment on a big scale here, the Government would have found themselves, like the foolish virgins of old who failed to trim their lamps, not merely unprepared, but hopelessly so, in so far as the provision of compensation for loss of life or damage to property is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I find it somewhat difficult to find words to describe this Bill.  It is the goodly apple rotten at the core, the whited sepulchre, the innocent flower with the serpent underneath; in fact, it may be described as the unfinished symphony of the Minister for Finance. It is all these things and more.  It is the meanest, the trickiest, the most cynical measure which this Government or any other Government have tried to foist on this House.  The Bill is characterised not so much by what it proposes to do as by what it proposes not to do.  The first notable deficiency in this Bill is its failure to <Col N="1968" /> provide compensation for personal injuries sustained as a result of hostile action by one or other of the belligerents. In effect, that means that the head of a family may be struck down and that no compensation is available for his dependents.  If he loses a limb, an eye, or is deprived of any of his organs of sense, if his injury is such that he is in any way prevented from earning his livelihood, no provision is made in this Bill for compensation. This Bill takes on a particularly important aspect when we bear this fact in mind, that practically every insurance company has what is known as a war clause inserted in its policies since the outbreak of the war which protects it from providing even as much as one penny piece compensation for personal injuries sustained as a result of hostile military action by one or other of the belligerents.</P>
    <P>This Bill authorises the payment of compensation for property, but only certain types of property.  For property such as watches, articles of personal ornament, jewellery, money, and so on, which are set out in the Bill, no compensation is to be given; nor, as has been pointed out, is compensation provided for in respect of consequential losses sustained as a result of injury to property.  Where the Minister decides to make an offer of compensation to a person claiming damages in respect of property, the following conditions are made to apply: The Minister may offer as much or as little as he likes.  He may attach to the offer such conditions as he thinks proper in relation to the expenditure of the compensation. The applicant is at liberty to accept or refuse the offer within a specified period.  If he accepts the offer, he may have to accept it with certain conditions laid down by the Minister. If he refuses the offer, he has the right of appeal to the Circuit Court.  But there is an important point in that, as the maximum sum which can be secured in the Circuit Court is £300, that is the extent of the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court.</P>
    <P>It is specifically stated in Section 10 that the compensation awarded by the court shall be awarded in respect of the actual damage done to property, <Col N="1969" /> and that no compensation shall be awarded in respect of consequential losses.  That is in the nature of a directive section for the guidance of the court.  It is also laid down in Section 10 that compensation will not be paid for damage to property by the civil authority in an effort to prevent the spreading of fires.  The fire brigade or the auxiliary fire brigade and all those services which are at the disposal of the city may be called out.  Considerable damage may be done in their efforts to prevent the spread of a fire, but there is no provision for compensation for damage caused in that way.</P>
    <P>The Bill actually precludes local authorities from seeking compensation in respect of civic property, such as bridges, streets, sewers and watermains, which the ratepayers are obliged by law to provide and keep in repair.  One can readily visualise that damage may be done to property of that kind on such a big scale as to place on the shoulders of the ratepayers a burden that would be beyond their capacity to bear.  I fail to see why the Minister has seen fit to preclude local authorities from securing the compensation which, according to the law, it has been the practice to award.  It was rather interesting to note in connection with injury to property that the Minister lays it down definitely as a condition in the Bill that new property must be built on the original site.  It will be interesting to see how far that condition fits in with modern town-planning ideas.  It seems to me that in Part II a very glaring injustice may be done.  We can all recall how eloquent and how glib the Government were before they came into office regarding the injustice inflicted on tenants by many ground landlords, and especially the promises that were made to the electorate to curb the activities of these people. This Bill, like many other actions since the Government assumed office, does not show any evidence whatever on the part of the Government to protect these tenants in any way.  Under the Bill, if a person's property is destroyed he is obliged to continue paying ground rent.  That seems very unjust.  One might ask why the <Col N="1970" /> Minister went to such trouble to protect ground landlords in this respect.</P>
    <P>I have received a communication from a committee that was set up in one area, and when the Minister is replying I hope he will undertake to keep some of the points they refer to in mind.  It is pointed out in the communication that none of the following conditions are covered by the Bill: the painting and decorating of houses that have been damaged, removal and storage of furniture, alternative accommodation and the replacement of buildings destroyed.  As far as I can ascertain, this Bill compensates for damage to property at the lowest possible limit, and provides various devices to escape making any payment.</P>
    <P>It leaves the whole question of assessing compensation to officials and prohibits payment of compensation for consequential losses.  Finally it provides in Section 16 that one-fourth of the compensation awarded shall be recovered from the local authorities&mdash; the ratepayers&mdash;while they are to be denied any right of compensation for damage done to their property.  As I pointed out, the Bill is a very mean measure.  It is a tricky measure, and might well be compared to a tricky cross-word puzzle in a Sunday newspaper. It is full of pitfalls for the unwary. At a later stage I hope the scope of the Bill will be extended considerably so as to make the provision for the victims of the bombing really valuable.</P>
    <P>I should like to protest against the fact that when the Minister was having the Bill drafted he did not see his way to consult local authorities, either through the managers, accountants or corporations.  If he had done so I am sure many of the glaring deficiencies in the Bill would not have arisen.  I understand that the City Manager of Dublin Corporation has taken the trouble to prepare a case for counsel, emphasising the disadvantages to and the adverse effect on the city of certain omissions from the Bill.  I hope the Minister will take the trouble to communicate with the City Manager before the final stages are reached.</P>

      <P>When speaking on this Bill Deputy Cosgrave described it as a skinflint measure.  The last speaker was not so elegant in his language, but I gathered that he had in mind something similar to describe it.  I happen to be the custodian of the public purse, and I have long experience in public life and a long connection with local authorities, and from my earliest entry into public life the principle I worked on always was, that I must be much more careful of public money than I would be of my own.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not, unfortunately. I have had Deputies say to me: &ldquo;What is the money there for, except to spend?  Give it out.&rdquo;  I have had that kind of statement made to me more than once by Deputies who are members of local authorities, but I do not act on that principle.  I would fight over every penny of public money, and want to see full justification for its expenditure, before I would sanction it.  That is the principle I go on with regard to any public moneys under my control.  What I do with my own is my own affair, but I can afford to be more generous with it, if I wish. I agree with Deputy Cosgrave that we ought not to be skinflints in this matter, but I, like Deputy Cosgrave, have a conscience.  I know that Deputy Cosgrave has a conscience with regard to public matters, and public moneys in particular&mdash;he and I were brought up in the same school and worked together&mdash;and I know that he would be at least as careful of public money as I would, but he has not the responsibility now of controlling the Exchequer, or controlling public funds and their expenditure that I have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When he wound up his speech, he said that he would not give much for the compensation we are likely to get from foreign Powers, and that they will have more than enough to do to meet <Col N="1972" /> their own debts, when the war is over. I think he is right.  I think the chances of getting full compensation, though, in justice, we should be paid full compensation&mdash;and we are going to ask for it and, in some cases, have asked for it&mdash;are not rosy, and, therefore, we have to go on the basis, I think, that this expenditure will have to be borne by ourselves.  If the money comes later, we shall be very thankful and anything we get over and above what we have already paid we shall divide out amongst those entitled to it.</P>
    <P>From my point of view, I think we have to examine very carefully all the commitments we are entering into in this Bill.  We shall have to do it, as Deputy Cosgrave suggested, with mercy and charity, as well as with justice, and I am prepared to do that within the limits I have laid down as to the responsibility and the care that must be exercised by every public man in the expenditure of public money.  He must guard that money jealously and he must defend the Exchequer, whether of a local authority, or of the nation, and see that every penny he proposes to give out is fully justified.  He must take much greater care of it than he would of his money, whatever it may be.</P>
    <P>I think Deputy Hannigan must not have been here when I was introducing the Bill.  I explained, and explained at length, why it was that personal injuries were not included in this Bill, and I need not go over it again.</P>

      <P>Deputy Cosgrave said that the circumstances of to-day and the circumstances of 1923 are different.  They are unquestionably different in many respects. The circumstances under which we have to pay compensation are, admittedly, different, but there is going to be the same type of charge on the national Exchequer, and the national Exchequer is not any better able to bear a heavy charge to-day than it was in 1923, that is, the national Exchequer meaning our own people, because our own people will have to bear this out of their own pockets eventually, I believe, and taxation will have to bear at least 75 per cent. of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think I am any less charitable&mdash;charity is scarcely the word, because it is not charity&mdash;in the sense of having less heart than any of the Deputies who have urged more generous treatment.  I realise the position of these people, many of them, and probably the greater number, thrown out of their houses&mdash;some of them escaping with their lives and others losing members of their families&mdash; owing to the bombings which took place at different times in different places.  We all have some realisation of what harrowed feelings the survivors must have experienced.  No money will compensate people for such sufferings, and no money that we could give would adequately compensate people for the loss of a husband, a wife or others dear to them.  That we cannot compensate for.  Personal injuries we must try to make up for, but suffering we cannot provide for.  Property is something which is measurable in value and which can be provided for, to some extent. We have to try to provide for it as far <Col N="1974" /> as we can and, within reason, to restore to these people homes, again within reason and as nearly as possible, similar to those they had before the bombings took place.  That may be possible in some cases; it will not be possible in others.</P>
    <P>Most Deputies talked on the question of consequential loss, including Deputy Cosgrave, Deputy Mulcahy, Deputy Byrne and Deputy Hannigan. Consequential loss is something which it is very difficult to measure.  It is hard to get what the Americans call a proper yard-stick for measuring it.  You might measure the actual out-of-pocket expenses of some people who lost employment in shops in the North Strand and that neighbourhood.  I doubt if there were any involved in the South Circular Road.  In the North Strand, employees lost their weekly wages.</P>
    <P>That is one kind of consequential loss.  A trader blown out of his business loses the revenue that he derived from his business.  It is proposed to compensate him for the loss of his property, stock in trade, where he had a workshop with plant and machinery&mdash; it is proposed to provide compensation for that.  But loss of profits, if it were attempted at all, would be a very difficult thing to estimate accurately.  I have no doubt, and Deputy Cosgrave agrees, that there would be exaggerated claims.  There have been such claims in similar circumstances in the past, and there was no compensation paid for consequential losses in the past because it was realised that it raises a very difficult problem.  I went into it before the Bill was drafted.  I discussed it with those who have had experience of administration of previous Bills in the past, and it seems to me that it is not possible to arrange for consequential loss.  There might be some way by which consequential losses could be justly measured.  I do not think it is possible, but I am prepared to look into it.</P>
    <P>Similarly with currency.  Deputy Byrne said that he knew of a case of an individual who had the ashes of currency notes.  If there is anything at all by which a currency note can be recognised, if its number or part of its number even can be distinguished, the <Col N="1975" /> Currency Commission will repay it. They do that frequently.  People come with charred or burnt notes, with numbers gone, to the Currency Commission. They have to sign forms, but if there is any evidence at all that the currency note did exist, they will be repaid for it.  The same, I think, applies to postal orders and postal money orders.  I do not know that it would be equitable to ask the State to pay for coin or jewellery the value of which one has no means of measuring. That problem arose before, and the State at that time turned down that proposition.  I can realise now the difficulties they had.  They had many pressing appeals made to them to pay for jewellery, but the State at that time and the State to-day sees that there is the greatest difficulty in finding any evidence on which one can base the value of jewellery or coin that has disappeared by burning.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave and Deputy Dockrell raised the question about the period over which payment may be made. I am quite prepared to reconsider that.  I think Deputy Benson also mentioned that fact that three years would be probably too short a time. I am sure the period would have been extended had it been done before but, if Deputies think three years is too short a period, I am quite prepared to make it four or five years.  Deputy Dockrell was anxious that the compensation awarded should be a marketable commodity.  I think under the present Bill it can be a marketable commodity.  A person can sell his interest.</P>

On the other point that several Deputies mentioned, including Deputy Benson and Deputy Dockrell, about the section which makes it essential to rebuild on the site, there is power in the Minister to waive that requirement but if we had not that section in the Bill, modified as I say, we would have no power to see that the ruins of any of these <Col N="1976" /> places, North Circular Road or the North Strand would be cleared.  The ruins might remain there for ever and be a disfigurement to the city.  There are cases&mdash;and the majority of cases&mdash; where people will want to rebuild on the site, subject to the local authority's town planning and other conditions that they will lay down.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>They can.  They have the power to do that if they are derelict sites for a number of years. Under an Act passed recently they will have that power but we need to have power to encourage people to build. It is not intended that it should be mandatory on everybody to build exactly on the same site, on the same foundation, but we want to have power to see that the site will not be left a ruin.  There is power in the Minister to waive that condition.  We have thought of town planning and, as Deputy Dockrell reminds us, we have in the last few months given local authorities power, whereby if the site be left derelict for a certain period, they can take it over.  I think the question that Deputy Dockrell and Deputy Cosgrave and others raised about rates is one that is worth considering. I am glad it was mentioned and I will go into it.</P>
      <P>Deputy Mulcahy raised the question raised by that committee.  I got the letter and I saw the committee.  It came to me long ago on deputations.

    <Title>Committee on Finance. - Finance Bill, 1941&mdash;From the Seanad.</Title>
    <P>The Dáil went into Committee to consider recommendations from the Seanad.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. O Ceallaigh) Seán T. O'Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. O Ceallaigh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: That the Committee do not agree with the Seanad in recommendation No. 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In Section 1, at the end of the section, that a new sub-section (4) be added as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(4)  Section 3 of the Finance Act, 1935 (No. 28 of 1935) shall not apply to or have effect in relation to tenements and hereditaments in the occupation of the owner and the rateable value of which does not exceed twenty pounds (£20).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since 1935 the law has stood that valuation on all house property is at five-fourths.  This recommendation seeks to amend that, by removing that <Col N="1980" /> five-fourths in so far as houses of a rateable value not exceeding £20 are concerned.  The first argument that I have against accepting it is that it would cost money that cannot be afforded.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>How much?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot tell accurately the amount, as I have not got the exact figure.  If I did not get the five-fourths with regard to all house property, it would cost well over £100,000. What it would cost if the value of the property were limited to £20, I could not state exactly.  The case was made in the Seanad that the Government had encouraged people to buy their own houses, if they did not build them for themselves, and that it was not in accordance with the Government's own ideals to attempt to increase the burden on thrifty people who purchased their own house property and, particularly, on those who lived in the houses they purchased.  The case was made that the type of person who would live in a house with a rateable valuation of £20 was entitled to special consideration in this matter.</P>
      <P>My answer to that was that the person owning and living in his own house should pay his full share of income-tax, just as every other citizen, and that, even as things stand, he benefits considerably as house property generally is not valued to-day at its proper value.  House property in this city is valued more highly than anywhere else in the country, with the exception of the City of Waterford, but even in Dublin the valuation goes back to 1913&mdash;the last general valuation&mdash;and in 1913 it was only assessed by the then Valuation Office at 90 per cent. of the estimated value of the property. For income-tax purposes, it has been the custom here to accept the rateable valuation of house property. According to the standard we work on the Irish poor law valuation bears no true relation to the value of the premises for income-tax purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The people who have invested in house property and, particularly, the people who live in the houses they own, escape a considerable amount of the <Col N="1981" /> income-tax which is borne by the citizen who, instead of investing in house property and living in it, has put his money in other forms of investment.  The person who invests his money&mdash;say any sum from £500 to some thousands of pounds&mdash;in house property is assessed on five-fourths of the poor law valuation of the property.  It is more than likely that, in 90 case out of 100, the valuation of that house should be twice or three times the rateable valuation which has been placed upon it.</P>
    <P>There are people who own houses valued at £20, the rent of which is £90 or £100, and those persons pay income-tax on the rateable valuation, plus one-fourth. If the house is valued at £20, an individual pays, under the law as it has stood since 1935, on five-fourths of the valuation of that property&mdash;that is to say £25.  If the money that purchased that house, the rateable valuation of which is £20, were put in some other investment or security, and the person concerned was drawing dividends from it, he would be paying more in income-tax, so that those who are at present living in houses which they own have a great advantage over people who have other forms of investment. Investments in house property, whether the owners live in the property or not, escape a considerable part of the tax which is placed on those who invest in industry&mdash;Irish or English&mdash; or in any other form of investment. The valuations in this country, with the exception of Dublin and Waterford, are based on the Griffith's valuation made in 1860, and are entirely out of date.  That was the reason this Government introduced a Valuation Bill about the time that the emergency arose.  We have not been able to go on with it since.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>They are, and therefore should be revalued, but the houses built since are valued on the same basis except in the City of Dublin, which had a general revaluation in 1913, and in Waterford.  Therefore the property owners of these two cities are paying more than they should pay relative to the property owners of the rest of the country.  That was one of the things which it was hoped the Valuation Bill would remedy.  House property to-day is undervalued and is not bearing its full weight of taxation. In 1935, in order to bring it up nearer to what it should be, 25 per cent. was added to the valuation for tax purposes, as a general rule.  It was not generally felt that that was sufficient, but the taxpayer probably thought it was too much.  It probably does not bring the present valuation of that class of property anywhere near what it should be if there were a revaluation this year or next year.  I think that we are entitled to ask the owner of house property to pay his full share of taxation, just as if he had put his money in some other form of investment. Even on this basis of five-fourths of the valuation, he is escaping a considerable amount of taxation which the Exchequer would be entitled to ask from him.  Some people, evidently, think that those who are living in the more cheaply valued houses are entitled to special consideration. From the investigations I have made, I think that, already, they are only too well and too generously treated, and that it is not fair to let even the smaller type of people be free from the full weight of the tax that the rest of the citizens with capital invested are called upon to pay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter has been before the House on many occasions, but this is the first time I have heard the type of explanation with which the Minister has honoured us this evening. The Minister's estimate of the value of a house whose poor law valuation is <Col N="1983" /> £20 and my estimate may be completely different.  I should assess that house at a present value of about £600. If that money were invested in war loan it would bring in £21 a year.  The house would be subject to natural deterioration and to the cost of upkeep, which would not affect the invested money bringing in an income of £21 per year.  Unless we are considering different types of security or unless he puts a higher value on the house than I should put, the Minister and I do not seem to get to the same point.  The sum on which a man in possession of a house with a valuation of £20 is assessed is £25.  That has been the law here since 1935.</P>
      <P>That man owns a house for which, say, £600 has been paid.  He is one of a great multitude of people who would be entitled to look to the municipality, and of course to the State, to help him to house his family. If he had six children or more he could make a very good case for getting one of the corporation dwellings.  That would cost the municipality anything from £10 to £15 a year and the State an equivalent amount for the next 35 years.  Instead of that, with a commendable civic sense of responsibility he either invests his entire capital of £600 in buying a house or purchases it through the agency of one of the building societies or possibly under the Small Dwellings Acquisition Act. Whatever way he acquires it we are going to ensure that he will pay every penny of taxation we can get out of him.  That does not appear on the face of it to be a fair dispensation of legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Up to the time that the change was made in the law, a man who owned a house with a valuation of £20 was entitled to deduct one-sixth of the valuation in respect of repairs.  That meant that he was assessed on a valuation of £16 13s. 4d.  This year, if this recommendation put forward by the Seanad in its wisdom does not find acceptance in this House, he will be assessed on £25.  In other words he is going to be assessed on one and a half times the amount he was assessed some years ago.  That is the fine we <Col N="1984" /> are putting on this man for accepting the responsibilities of citizenship, putting his money into a house and relieving the corporation and the State of the responsibility for paying portion of the cost of his house for the next 35 years.  That is one side of the story.</P>
    <P>The other side has been referred to by the Minister.  Sometimes in this country we hear references to a gentleman who is generally described as of &ldquo;glorious, pious and immortal memory&rdquo; but we might describe Griffith as a man of pious but mortal memory.  He is going to be buried for all time in connection with his valuations. Many years ago, when we were all young, there used to be on the outside of boxes of Paterson's matches a picture of a landlord sitting behind his desk with a farmer coming in to pay him his rent.  Underneath was printed &ldquo;I am going to pay my rent on Griffith's valuation&rdquo;.  The Minister evidently has forgotten all the lessons of his youth.</P>
    <P>From the time he fell into the hands of the Revenue Commissioners, his body and soul seem to have been lost. This is a proposition with which the Revenue Commissioners have been toying for 20 years.  They brought it up 20 years ago when I was young and innocent and I remember that I was the only member of the Executive Council to oppose it.  I succeeded in having it scotched at that time.  Unfortunately fate ordained that I was the Minister left to defend the proposal some years subsequently when a recommendation came back to this House from the Seanad that we should restore the one-sixth allowance in respect of repairs.  The sense of the House and the sense of the Seanad at that time were both against the proposal to abolish that allowance and the proposition was dropped.  However, you may knock out a Revenue Commissioner for a time but he will come up again.</P>
    <P>Here, we have them now opposing this recommendation with all the enthusiasm with which they introduced this increase originally and with all the avarice of a Shylock.  They are also going to ensure that many of these people will pay more than they <Col N="1985" /> are entitled to get out of them.  The worst feature of this imposition is that there are many unfortunate citizens in this State who are not properly assessable for tax of this kind at all and they will pay 7/6 in the £ on five-fourths of their valuations because through the sheer terror that the very name of the Revenue Commissioners inspires, they are afraid to stand up to them.  The unfortunate owner of the house is afraid that if he stands up to them he will have to pay more and he pays, although he is not properly assessable.  I think that this is an excellent recommendation of the Seanad. The Seanad's wisdom has far exceeded my anticipations.  I think the Minister should reconsider his attitude to this recommendation and if he does not get his reward here, he will probably get it in the next world.</P>

      <P>That is just what a burglar would say: &ldquo;I have to get the money.&rdquo;  I would have expected the Minister to put up a better case than that.  With regard to what he says about the person who owns his own house that person, apparently, is supposed to have got away with something. I should like to suggest to the Minister that the valuation of all those house has a relation to their market value and that when that person purchased his house it was in competition with other houses that were probably let at about the same rent.  In face of all that, he walked in and purchased the house.  Of course it is the luck of the game that income-tax has been increased since then, but the landlord was, at least, the owner of the house. I am not complaining about that because, of course, he has to pay his taxes like his fellow-citizens, but the man who purchased the house is bearing the burden of local rates as well. Local rates have increased about 50 per cent. and he has to foot that bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister, by some process of juggling with the valuation figures, arrives at the conclusion that people who own houses are really getting away with something.  Did the Minister ever compare houses in Dublin with houses, say, in Belfast or across the water?  If he did he would probably find that houses outside this State have lower valuations and lower ground rents, and that they cost considerably less to erect.  The consequence of increasing overhead costs on houses here is that you are pushing up rent because, remember, the whole question ultimately comes down to one of getting a return on the money that is invested.  Ultimately the Minister will find that he has pushed up the cost of living on the workers of this country. That is what it amounts to.  A person who lives in a house valued at £20 is somewhere just outside the artisan class.  He is probably what one might call a black-coated individual, getting not very much more money than an artisan and having a very hard struggle for existence.  I suggest that the Minister wants to give house property and building all the impetus he <Col N="1987" /> can, but in doing this he is only putting an additional cost of living on all the community, because it will ultimately come back on the whole community in the shape of rent and a return on the money.  I do not think the recommendation of the Seanad goes far enough, but I certainly feel that the Minister might at least accept it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that the recommendation of the Seanad goes far enough, and I am not over-fond of it for that reason; but because, if it were accepted, it would give some relief and might be regarded as the thin edge of the wedge to do what could be described as belatedly righting a wrong, I would be disposed to accept this recommendation.  I put down amendments to several Finance Bills year after year in order to get rid of what I called, when this five-fourths of the valuation was originally devised, as the Revenue Commissioners' nightmare. I always called it so.  I understand that the Minister makes the case now that his justification is that the revenue would lose too much if this were accepted.  That was not the excuse given here on another occasion; that was not the reason put forward in justification of the five-fourths when it was proposed or when my amendments were put down to the Finance Bills.</P>
      <P>I did everything I could to persuade the then Minister for Finance to revert to the old system.  There was a certain amount of irony in the situation for me because, when I went through my own constituency in the course of elections, it was put up against me that I had never criticised this imposition of five-fourths in the House.  The actual position was that on several occasions I put down amendments dealing with the Revenue Commissioners' nightmare and divided the House on them.  For that reason alone I have a personal interest in the Revenue Commissioners' nightmare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The original excuse given for the five-fourths was not the one proffered by the Minister to-night.  Now he cannot afford to lose money.  On an earlier occasion it was stated that the system <Col N="1988" /> of valuation was out of date.  One reason advanced here was that the Griffith's valuation had so outrun its time that there were inequalities in the various houses valued all over the country; that new houses were valued higher than old houses, and a lot of people, to use the current phrase, were getting away with something.  The Revenue Commissioners' justification for all their taxes is that somebody is getting away with something; that they have in their pockets what should be in the pockets of the Revenue Commissioners. I understand the Minister's justification for his present attitude is that somebody is getting away with something and the revenue of the State cannot afford to lose it.</P>
    <P>As regards the first proposition, that these people who purchased their houses are getting away with something, I will recall the Minister's mind to the position after the last war when most people, being entirely unwilling to purchase houses, were forced under the conditions then existing to buy the houses which they only wanted to rent. I would say that of the people who have purchased houses since the last war, 80 per cent. of them did not purchase the houses by way of investment of their money but as a necessity, because they had to get a roof over their heads and they had to pay any price demanded in view of the scarcity of houses at that time.  That very significant fact is entirely overlooked in connection with the position of people who live in houses they have purchased. They purchased those houses, not because they wanted to invest their money but because they could not get the houses to rent.</P>
    <P>As regards the question whether or not the revenue can afford to do without the money that will be raised by this particular method, I think the Minister can hardly have had the matter properly examined.  Viewed as a mathematical proposition, taking every house with a valuation of £20 and under as being liable for full income-tax, I suppose a substantial amount of money would be lost, but the vast majority of people living in houses with a valuation of £20 and under are married men with families and they <Col N="1989" /> would only have to pay, if they would have to pay anything, a very small sum indeed in income tax and they are the class of people who are deserving of the most consideration.  The few pounds they have to pay to the Revenue Commissioners would mean a very great deal to their exchequers, particularly in present circumstances, but I very much doubt if the loss to the Exchequer by granting this exemption, or whatever you may wish to call it, would be anything like the figure the Minister has stated.</P>
    <P>We must face the fact that the Minister has no intention of accepting this recommendation, but I am glad of the opportunity to renew the protest I made when the Revenue Commissioners' nightmare was introduced as the statute law of this country, a protest which I repeated until I got tired of it and no one seemed to take any notice of that protest.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support this recommendation.  There is a good deal in what Deputy Costello has said.  Many of the people who purchased houses some 20 years ago purchased them simply because they could not get houses to rent.  That was the position in places like Limerick, Cork, Waterford and other towns.  Many people made great sacrifices in order to purchase their houses.  The Minister should have a heart, to use a current phrase.  He got out of another difficulty with reference to taxation by making certain exemptions.</P>
      <P>As regards the Revenue Commissioners, the fraction of five-fourths that they introduced has always impressed me.  It took a Revenue Commissioner to think of it.  I only wish that by some method or other the Commissioners and the Minister would apply such a fraction to our daily lives, so that some of us who are struggling for bare existence on our farms would be able to get five quarters out of a lamb instead of four.  The whole thing reminds me of the story of a judge who sentenced a man to penal servitude for life.  The man ventured some retort and the judge declared &ldquo;If you say another word I will give you five years longer.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1990" /> I have always been opposed to this expedient of increasing the valuation to five-fourths.  The Seanad has made a recommendation to modify it in some way.  Although the modification will not meet the majority of cases, it is still something to the good and I appeal to the Minister to accept it.  It will be a small concession to the people who have purchased houses, many of them under extreme difficulties and at great sacrifices.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>The type of case that Deputy Cosgrave selected of a man with six children living in a house with £20 valuation would not apply at all, because such a man would not be paying any income-tax.  It is also probable that the man with three children, when his allowances for income-tax purposes were taken into consideration, would not have to pay any income-tax if living in a house with the same valuation. Deputy Costello was right in saying that a great number of people, living in houses with a £20 valuation, would not be paying income-tax at all. The occupation of houses with a £20 valuation is not altogether confined to people in the suburbs who have recently purchased their houses.  All over the country you have grave and gross inequalities as regards the valuation of houses.  In some parts you have houses that might be described as mansions with a rateable value of £20, and in some of the smaller towns quite big premises with the same valuation.  My submission is that it would be unfair if houses of that kind, and there are quite a big number of them, should escape their due share of taxation.  Let me give some examples from Dublin and Cork of houses with a £20 valuation, and of the rents that have been demanded and that are being paid for them.  Terenure: valuation, £20; rent, £96.  In that case the landlord is paying the rates.  The rent, excluding the rates, would probably be about £75. Kilmainham: valuation, £19; rent, £84; Milltown: valuation, £20; rent, £96; Howth Road: valuation, £20; rent, £96; Clontarf: (three cases) valuation, £18; rent, £84; valuation, £16; rent, £72; valuation, £23, rent, £91; Drumcondra: valuation, £21; rent, £95; <Col N="1991" /> Rathfarnham: valuation, £22; rent, £108.  These examples show that the valuation of the houses is only remotely connected, if connected at all, with the real value of the property.  That is what I maintained when speaking earlier on the recommendation.  Here are some examples from Cork.  They are probably worse than the Dublin ones because there has been no revaluation in Cork since the Griffith's valuation. Douglas Road: valuation, £16; rent, £92; valuation, £18; rent, £90; <Col N="1992" /> Wilton Road: valuation, £20; rent, £100; valuation, £20; rent, £92 10s; Ballintemple: valuation, £17; rent, £75; valuation, £17; rent, £75; Glasheen Road: valuation, £12; rent, £60.</P>
      <P>As I have already said, these valuations are not even remotely connected with the real value of these properties. We have taken the £20 valuation because the Seanad fixed on that figure. I cannot accept the recommendation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: That the Committee agree with the Seanad in recommendation No. 2:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In Section 41, sub-section (1), page 24, lines 37 and 38, that the words &ldquo;consequent on an invitation to the public to subscribe therefor&rdquo; be deleted, and the word &ldquo;and&rdquo; be substituted; and after paragraph (c) that a new paragraph be inserted as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(d) either the said new issue was made consequent on an invitation <Col N="1993" /> to the public to subscribe therefor or the Revenue Commissioners are satisfied that no part of such issue was paid for or satisfied by the utilisation, directly or indirectly, of assets which were in the hands of the company on the last day (in this paragraph referred to as the said day) of the trade year which ended in the year ended on the 31st day of August, 1939 (excluding from such assets a sum equal to the amount (if any) of dividends distributed and directors' remuneration paid within six months after the said day in respect of a period ending on or before the said day) or by the utilisation, directly or indirectly, of profits of the company made after the said day (excluding from such profits so much thereof as was applied in the payment of dividends or of directors' remuneration to an extent not exceeding in rate the average amount of the dividends distributed or directors' remuneration paid (as the case may be) not later than six months after the said day in respect of the three, two, or one years or year by reference to the profits in one of which the standard profits of the company are computed),</P>
    <P>Section 41 of the Bill is designed to provide for making an allowance in a case in which there has been an introduction of genuinely new capital into the business of a company which has a profits standard, such new capital being introduced after the end of the standard period.  The section, as it stands, however, does not provide for the case in which such capital is introduced otherwise than as a result of a public subscription.  The recommendation is designed to remedy this defect, and I ask the House to accept it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a rather peculiar amendment, because new capital in this case means getting in money from the existing shareholders, or floating an issue which will be subscribed by the public.  That particular operation will cost the company money.  If it were not for this amendment which is now being made it would be open to <Col N="1994" /> the firm to employ some of their reserves, to sell some of their securities, if they have securities, or to employ money which they have on deposit. What purpose the Minister has in mind in making this amendment to the original section has not yet been disclosed to the House.  We should be glad to hear from him the reason for it.  There is no great difference between an extra flotation&mdash;the issuing of extra shares to shareholders who are already in possession of some of the shares of the company&mdash;and using the money which the shareholders have had to their credit in reserves and so on during the past few years. It will be open to the company, unless I am much mistaken, to issue from their reserves a bonus, and advise the shareholders at the same time that it would be possible for them to return the bonus for extra shares.  In that case they would probably defeat the purpose that the Minister has in mind. An issue such as I have mentioned would not be an extra dividend.  It was done some twenty years or so ago, when one firm which had its headquarters in England issued to its shareholders what was called at that time a bonus, but which was really a distribution to the shareholders of funds which had been earned by the company over a series of years.  It was furnished to them in the form of war loan.  It was not cash; it was war loan.  It is very doubtful whether Order 83 or its accompaniment, or the provisions of the Finance Act, interfere with a case of that sort.  There are shareholders here of British companies; what they did at that time I expect it is possible for them to do on this occasion.  It would seem strange if the reserves of a company, which are the property of the shareholders, could not be distributed to them.  In that case, they would defeat whatever purpose the Minister has in mind, unless it is that he wants to find new money, that he thinks money is available for investment and that it ought to be got by those companies.</P>

      <P>I felt satisfied that the section, as originally drawn, was drawn in such a way as to do everything <Col N="1995" /> possible to avoid evasion.  There had been attempts at evasion, and there has been successful evasion of tax by companies using reserves as capital.  We insisted originally that there should be a new issue to the public, but in the Seanad it was pointed out to me that we need not insist on a public issue so long as there was a genuine flotation of additional capital for cash, and the case made, I thought, was reasonable, so long as it was restricted to capital issued actually for cash, as against capital issued in the way of bonus or in some other way that might leave the door open to evasion, especially in regard to private companies.  I accepted the case made by the Senator concerned, and agreed to wipe out the words &ldquo;consequent on an invitation to the public to subscribe therefor&rdquo;, leaving it open, so long as there was actual cash paid for the additional capital, so that it would be counted in regulating the standard.</P>

      <P>After that very able explanation of the Minister, and at this late hour, there is only one point to which I would direct his attention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1997" /> Some 25 years ago, there were certain officials in the service of the British Government here in this country, who were informed that, on a given day, if they did not enlist with the Colours their service would be determined, and those of them who did not respond to the call had their service terminated. Subsequently, some of those people were re-employed and, eventually, about 1922, practically all of them were reinstated in the service.  The interruption operated in a peculiar manner against the length of service which they were entitled to count in order to qualify for superannuation.  The exact terms of the particular cases are beyond my recollection at the present moment, but, in essence, what they came to is this: that after having had a given number of years' service they were entitled to get into a class that was known as &ldquo;established&rdquo;, or some other term such as that, which specified that a man was giving pensionable service.  In some of those cases the requisite number of years had not been served before their services had been terminated, and the sum and substance of the whole story is that when some of those officials went out of the service, according to the age rule, the computation of their years, qualifying them for superannuation, came under the supervision of the Ministry of Finance.</P>
    <P>Now, the general impression amongst those of us who were in public life for those last 20 years or so was that there should be no bar put to a man's service by reason of its interruption for political causes, and quite a number of people were reinstated in the service after the change of Government in 1922.  Quite a number of persons who had lost their service in other firms in Dublin, and who had the same bar, were also restored to the service of the various companies in which they had previous service.  In the calculation for the superannuation of those officials, however, in whatever manner the calculations were made, they were operated to the disadvantage of those officials, and, in consequence, men after having had something like 20, 30, or 40 years' service, as the case may be&mdash;the exact number of years, as I <Col N="1998" /> have said, escapes my recollection&mdash; went out.</P>
    <P>Now, there is no doubt whatever but that the political circumstances of the time interrupted their service and reduced the number of years which, if it had not been for that interruption, would have given them a larger superannuation.  The amount involved is not considerable, and the legislation of this State for the last 20 years bears evidence of attempts made by both the last Government and the present Government to remedy peculiar anomalies, losses, or other disabilities which persons suffered by reason of the political experience or history of that period.  Except for these servants, now, I do not know of any other class in which those disabilities are at present being suffered by people.  The number, as I have said, is not considerable, and the amount involved is not considerable.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate that now, 25 years after the first interruption of their service took place, those men, having taken an attitude which, 25 years ago, would have been looked upon as a patriotic stand of theirs, have now to see, in the declining years of their lives, a reduced superannuation and a smaller pension.  Indeed, in cases like these, where the numbers are few and the amounts inconsiderable, it is more than a pity that reconsideration should not be given to those cases, and I think we should view the regulations, not only with mercy but with charitable consideration for the difficulties of the times in respect of those particular persons.</P>

      <P>I want to raise two matters.  First of all I should like to know when the Minister for Finance, in particular, or the Government hopes to be in a position to make a policy pronouncement on the reports of the Banking Commission.  This commission was set up shortly after the general election in 1933 and sat for four years in secret and heard evidence from representatives of all classes in <Col N="1999" /> the community.  The reports were issued over four years ago and, presumably, have been under the consideration of the Minister or his predecessor or the members of the Government during that period.  Can the Minister hold out any hope that, within his period as Minister for Finance, or before this Dáil is dissolved, a policy pronouncement on this very important matter will be made by him or somebody else representing the Government?</P>
      <P>Six weeks ago in this House the Minister gave an assurance that he would release for publication the reports of certain commissions and tribunals which were set up several years ago.  He has carried out that assurance so far as the Drainage Commission report is concerned and the report of the Dublin Bakery Tribunal has also been circulated to Deputies. But the report of the Transport Tribunal, which is in the possession&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to Deputy Davin's question is that the Department of Finance does not use influence; it uses financial pressure.  There are two points which I want to raise on this Estimate.  The first point, I think, is one that is peculiarly appropriate to the Estimate.  It is a point that has been overlooked for some time.  In effect, the Department of Finance in respect of this point are, if not actually breaking the law, at least ignoring the law.  There is a section of the Civil Service (Regulation) Act that the governance of the Civil Service&mdash;I am not purporting to quote the section but am speaking from recollection&mdash;is to be provided for by regulations, which regulations must be laid on the Table and be subject to the criticism of this House and of the Seanad.  It has been decided in our courts that that is the proper method by which the general administration of the Civil Service, which is the peculiar responsibility of the Department of Finance, should be regulated, supervised, and carried out.</P>
      <P>There have been no regulations of any importance made under the Civil Service (Regulation) Act dealing with the general governance of the Civil Service, speaking by and large, since 1924.  That particular provision in the Civil Service (Regulation) Act has been consistently ignored and, I believe, deliberately ignored and the Department of Finance got away with it, if I may use that expression, for many years.  They were, however, caught out in a particular case or series of cases, but actually went on with, after they had stopped the particular hole made by that series of cases, and are still continuing the old practice of governing the Civil Service by Department of Finance circulars, instead of by regulations made under the Civil Service (Regulation) Act that was passed by the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2001" /> That Act provided that both Chambers, the Dáil and the Seanad, should have some sort of control over the governance of the Civil Service by the Department of Finance; that those regulations which dealt with admission into the Civil Service, promotion inside the Civil Service, and the general regulation of the conditions of civil servants while in the service, should be subject to revision, at least to some extent; that the regulations should be subject to the authority of this House and of the Seanad.</P>
    <P>From the time of the passing of the Civil Service (Regulation) Act up to the present moment, to my knowledge only two regulations have been made, which were of a most peculiar character. The first regulation was made, I think, in 1923 or thereabouts, and provided that civil servants should hold their office at the will and pleasure of the Executive Council.  The second regulation provided in effect for depriving civil servants of their cost-of-living bonus.  There was no effort made during all those years from 1923 until 1940 to provide a code of statutory rules and regulations for the proper administration of the Civil Service.  The statute law dealing with the Civil Service provides that there should be such a code.  It has been consistently ignored by the Department of Finance all those years, and I think it is time that public attention was directed to this matter.</P>
    <P>It has been established by the decision of our courts that the Civil Service is no longer a prerogative.  The Department of Finánce acted until that decision, and have since acted in spite of that decision, as if the Civil Service was being run on the old Crown prerogative. They ignored the fact that the Civil Service is now a statutory body, that the Civil Service is subject to statute, and that its administration and regulation ought to be the subject of regulations, statutory in character, which would be subject to the control of this House and of the Seanad.  I think it is high time that attention was called to this and that the Department of Finance should produce a code of regulations for the general governance <Col N="2002" /> of the Civil Service.  It is convenient to follow the British procedure, based on the Crown prerogative, that the Civil Service should be governed by circular.  One of the greatest industries in this country is the emission from the Establishment Branch of the Department of Finance of circulars dealing with Civil Service matters such as pay, pensions, hours of work, holidays, and all the rest, and also providing that, although the Dáil and the Seanad will not sit on Church holidays, nevertheless the civil servants of this State must not be allowed the half hour that the British Government gave them during the old bad times to go to Mass. All these matters are very conveniently dealt with in the Establishment Branch of the Department of Finance by circulars.  They are doing that, in my opinion, flagrantly&mdash;if not actually&mdash;in breach of the Civil Service (Regulation) Act.  They have done that actually in breach of the strict letter of the law&mdash;certainly in flagrant violation of it.</P>
    <P>Attention was called in court to the fact that the Civil Service (Regulation) Act required a general code for the administration of the Civil Service, and it is right and proper that this House, and the Seanad, should have some say, not perhaps in routine matters, but on the general principles which should guide the Department of Finance, and particularly the Establishment Branch of that Department, and on the principles which should guide the Minister in the various matters that arise in connection with the governance of the Civil Service, leaving if you like routine matters to be dealt with by circular.  This House, at least, should have the opportunity of discussing the whole matter of the general code of administration of the Civil Service. In the old British days orders in council, passed by His Majesty in council &mdash; a polite euphemism, meaning the Crown prerogative&mdash; to some extent did the same thing. There has been no effort to lay down any principle here, and I suggest that it is time the Department of Finance&mdash;one of the chief Departments &mdash;should introduce it and obey the law. They are always asking other people to <Col N="2003" /> obey the law.  The Revenue Commissioners are very keen on other people doing so.  It is about time the Department of Finance obeyed the law, and set about doing what it imposes on others, when the Act of 1924 provided a code of rules and regulations for the general governance of the Civil Service in this State.</P>
    <P>The second point I want to raise is a minor one, but it is of some significance. I wish the Minister would use his influence to stop not only what happens in his own Department, but in every other Department.</P>

Every letter that goes out from any Department written by the most junior and irresponsible official invariably starts: &ldquo;I am directed by the Minister&rdquo; which is a flagrant lie on the face of it, and incidentally one in which the present Minister for Finance was somewhat personally involved in court, where it was laid down that that particular form of locution ought not to be used; and that in any case that came to court where there was necessity to produce authority, the mere production of a letter starting with the words: &ldquo;I am directed by the Minister,&rdquo; when the Minister neither directed nor knew anything about it, was not sufficient. It is about time that that absurdity, which had its origin with the origin of this State, was rooted out of official correspondence.</P>

I wonder would the Minister, when he has some time at his disposal, cause inquiries to be made in the Local Government Department as to the difference of opinion that exists on certain old age pension claims between the officers of the Department of Local Government and officers of the Revenue Commissioners' Department. Some of the cases which have come to my notice expose a scandalously low <Col N="2008" /> mentality in matters of the kind, but I do not believe that these people represent the Minister in the way they deal with these claims.
