      <NameTxt>Mr. Breslin</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Supplies whether it is intended to make available to hotels and boardinghouses in rural areas sufficient kerosene for lighting purposes during the holiday months of July, August and September.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Supplies (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>Owing to the necessity of conserving sufficient kerosene supplies for harvesting operations, it has not been possible to allocate any oil for ordinary lighting purposes.  I am, however, investigating the possibility of making a small allocation for hotels and boardinghouses in areas where there are no other lighting facilities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Breslin</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the Minister's reply, has he, since the debate on this question, considered the urgent necessity of supplying people with at least oil for one lamp during the winter in order to avoid a large part of the rural community being left in absolute darkness from early in the afternoon until the following morning?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope that it will be possible to make available supplies of kerosene for domestic purposes during the winter, but it is not possible to do so during this month or next month.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister adverted to the necessity of furnishing the individual householder with some kind of coupon which would entitle him, as of right, to get the requisite supply of kerosene from a recognised depôt?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The existing regulations permit any householder to purchase half a gallon of kerosene per month, but the difficulty in that regard arises from the fact that the distribution of kerosene to traders has not been possible and, consequently, the concession granted by the regulations is ineffective at the present time.  As soon as we are able to permit of the distribution of kerosene to traders, then each householder will be able to purchase a monthly ration of half a gallon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the important social consequences which might come about from the failure of householders to get their quota of paraffin, would the Minister not consider, in this case, giving the individual householder a coupon on foot of which he can demand the kerosene from the depôt, lest traders might sell the kerosene at fancy prices to selected householders, leaving other householders without any available supply?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I hardly think it will be necessary to do that, but if it should become necessary I will be prepared to do it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure the Minister, from my experience of the country, that it will be vitally necessary to do that.  The kerosene will not go in equitable quantities to each individual householder, rich and poor, unless each individual householder has a coupon entitling him to demand his ration at the depôt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to stress the point made by Deputy Dillon about the issue of coupons.  I have witnessed scenes in Cork of poor tenement people <Col N="1251" /> waiting in queues to get a supply of oil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Coupons would not remedy that situation because at present traders have no kerosene in. When the trader gets in a supply of kerosene he will be in this position, that if there is evidence of his failure to comply with the wishes of this Department in securing an equitable distribution of that kerosene his registration as a trader can be withdrawn and his supply of kerosene given to somebody else for distribution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>This question of coupons is very important.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The existence of a coupon does not necessarily mean that there is a supply of kerosene available for a holder.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Not unless the Minister made up his mind to establish depôts in every rural area, and simply required people to go there for their supplies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be impracticable to distribute kerosene except through the existing traders in kerosene.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether it is intended to give effect to the decision of Dáil Eireann expressed in a resolution adopted by the House on December 12th, 1940, that the Government should appoint a commission to inquire into and report upon the extent, cause and incidence of unemployment, and, if so, whether he will state the cause of the delay in doing so and the steps in contemplation now for the purpose of implementing the decision in question.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if steps have been taken to develop the ochre deposits in the Avoca area in County Wicklow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume the Deputy means to inquire whether steps have been taken by the Government to develop these deposits.  The ochre deposits in the Avoca area are in private ownership, and their development is a matter primarily for private enterprise. Some years ago (1928-29) Government assistance towards that end was given by way of a guarantee for a loan of £4,000 under the Trade Loans (Guarantee) Acts.  The operations of the company concerned were not successful, and operations ceased after 11 months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not true that the failure of the company to operate successfully was due to the action of an international ochre ring which prevented consumers in Great Britain from accepting Wicklow ochre?  In view of the new supply situation existing now, might it not be possible to circumvent the ochre ring and secure a market in Great Britain for this product?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1253" />
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is true that the failure of the company in 1929 was due to their inability to find a market for their product.  I do not know that it would be worth our while to undertake development operations with a view to getting an export trade in present circumstances, a trade which would not, in all probability, continue after the war.  These deposits were worked during the last war, but the operations ceased when the war ceased.  I understand that the Minister for Industry and Commerce has under consideration the extent to which it is necessary to work deposits in the area for the supply of internal requirements.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture if in view of the failure of the efforts of his Department to prevent the spread of foot-and-mouth disease he will take steps to have appointed a select committee of Dáil Eireann to investigate and report to the Dáil on (1) the operations of the various Governmental officials concerned in the eradication of the epidemic, and (2) the extent to which the general public co-operated with his Department, and to make recommendations as to the best methods of coping with a similar epidemic in the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree that my Department has failed to prevent the spread of foot-and-mouth disease.  The disease has been eradicated in Counties Donegal, Meath, Dublin, Wicklow, Offaly, Limerick and Kerry and in County Tipperary (North Riding), and Laoighis, but for the moment a small area in each of the latter counties bordering on Counties Tipperary (South Riding) and Kilkenny is held as a precautionary measure.  In these circumstances I am not prepared to adopt the suggestions made by the Deputy.  The question of the measures which should be taken to deal with similar outbreaks <Col N="1254" /> in the future will receive the fullest consideration.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture if, in order to ensure that an adequate number of men will be available in every district to assist in harvesting operations, he will take steps immediately to ascertain from farmers the approximate amount of additional labour they require, and further, if he will ascertain the amount of suitable labour available for employment in each district.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Special inquiries recently made by my Department indicate that, generally speaking, no real shortage of labour for harvest is to be anticipated. I may also mention that in 1918, when more than 1,456,000 acres were under corn crops in the Twenty-Six Counties, no special difficulty was experienced as regards labour for harvest.  Moreover, harvesting operations are now performed to a much greater extent by the help of tractors and binders.  I see no reason, therefore, why this year's grain crops, even if more extensive than those of 1918, cannot be dealt with provided arrangements are made for those who are now engaged in the winning of turf to be available for the corn harvest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the Minister's reply, I should like to ask him whether he has taken into consideration the possibility of the weather being very favourable?  In that case, the amount of labour required would probably be three times the amount required in normal times.  That occurred in 1930, and there is a possibility that a similar situation might occur this year.  I should like to ask if the Minister has made any provision for such an event?</P>
    </Speaker>

I am not now referring to the unemployed, but to men who have been engaged on all forms of farming&mdash;on harvesting, the winning of turf and everything else.  I should like to ask the Minister if he has taken any steps to get those people to remain on the farms?</P>

      <P>Reports received by the Department of Agriculture indicate that, as compared with last year, there are this season substantially increased acreages under the crops mentioned.

      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>My remarks on this particular Bill will be very few, but I hope that the Taoiseach will take particular notice of them.  I am in agreement with the principle that, in <Col N="1257" /> an emergency such as this, the Government of a country must receive very great powers, and the best we can hope for is that the Government so vested will use the powers so granted to them with discretion and impartiality.  If the Government fail to honour the bond, if they fail to live up to the expectations of the Parliament which grants them those powers or of the people who acquiesced, a difficult situation is likely to arise.  I sincerely regret to say that throughout the country at the moment there are very grave misgivings upon the conduct of the Government and the method by which they have exercised the powers in the previous Act.  The obligation is forced upon us on these benches to get a further assurance from the Government that in the future it is their intention to make sure that every act of their shall be, like Caesar's wife, above suspicion.  I candidly assert that the fact of granting those powers to a Government does not improve their efficiency or their ability to exercise them.  It is true to say that sometimes persons who have not the ability to live up to their responsibility when they get power can abuse it; that power does not increase at all the ability of the persons on whom it is bestowed.  With the lack of confidence that I have in the Government, I assert that it does not improve or increase their ability to handle the problems before them, but they are the Government of the country, in whose interests and in whose defence I am prepared to take whatever risk is necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am forced to the conclusion that the Government have not given the country, or the Parliament that has vested them with these powers, a fair deal, because they have brought the powers of Government and the powers of Parliament into contempt throughout the country.  That is a rather serious statement to make, but if I may be permitted, Sir, I shall give a few examples.  The Government, under the Emergency Powers Act, fixed the profit on tea at 6d. per lb., and said that no trader could charge more than that.  Now 16 is not a multiple in any way of 6.  The Minister for Supplies makes an order that my ration <Col N="1258" /> of tea, as an individual, is one halfounce per week.  Even assuming that I get a fortnight's supply of tea, when I go in to the merchant, what profit is the merchant to charge me on that ounce of tea?  If he charges me a halfpenny, he is charging me 8d. a lb., which is 2d. in excess of 6d.  The result is&mdash;and I can assure you, from my own experience of living in the country that it is true&mdash;that the whole order is treated with ridicule.  Now, there is one thing that no Government or no Party in this country can ever stand, and that is ridicule.  You may attack them for this, that, or the other, but once you start to throw ridicule on them they are finished.  That annoys me to such an extent that I may attempt to make all sorts of excuses for the Government.  I am sorry to be in that position, but what can I do?</P>
    <P>Again, they make an order with regard to turf and coal.  Now, I am one who has had some experience of blacksmith's work in the country and who still, when I am sick and tired of the Dáil, and sick and tired of old age pensions, military service pensions, and all the rest of it, has a forge to which I can go back and try to fashion something in iron out of my own mind.  If I want I cwt. of blacksmith's coal at the moment I cannot get it, and neither can my blacksmith comrade down the road.  That brings the whole order into contempt.  It simply means that I go down to the equivalent, in Ballinalee, of Deputy Dillon in Ballaghaderreen, and I say to that man: &ldquo;I want 1 cwt. of coal for a person whole livelihood depends on it,&rdquo; and he breaks the law in order to give me that coal.  That means that there is neither judgment, consideration or proper investigation into the situation existing, either internally or externally, before these orders are issued, and I feel that the Government should be made fully aware of these facts, and that before they make any orders under the marvellous and extensive powers that this Parliament has bestowed upon them, there should not be any danger of ridicule, disregard or disrespect for that order being thrown upon them.</P>
    <P>It is true to say that, in principle, <Col N="1259" /> Order No. 83 has something behind it. My colleague, of Longford, and Deputy Dillon, appeared to agree upon that. Mind you, I begin to scratch my head when I see the two of them agreeing upon a particular matter of that sort.</P>

      <P>I wish Deputy Victory was here in the House so that we could have a &ldquo;confab&rdquo; with a view to seeing what all this is about, but at any rate I am satisfied that an order such as Order No. 83 should not be made in this way, but that it should be the duty and the responsibility of the Parliament of this country and that, before it would be put into effect, we should all have an opportunity of discharging the responsibility which the people of this country have placed upon us.  I am a subscriber to the principle&mdash;as I know the Government itself is&mdash;that the Government hold their responsibility from the Almighty and that they, under Him, are responsible to us for the full discharge of their obligations.  Although they have that responsibility, however, that does not discharge us from our obligations, and each and everyone of us has our own responsibility to discharge, in our own particular sphere, whatever that responsibility is.  Therefore, I put it to the Government that if we give them&mdash;and I cannot see any way out of giving them&mdash;this authority, they must live up, in the fullest sense of the word, to their responsibilities and that they must not abuse them.  Far be it from me to charge them with abuse. I think that what they have done they have done in good faith, but I assert that they have not taken the care that they should have taken.</P>
      <P>I do not propose to enter on the question of the other orders that have been issued, but what I do protest against is this: first, that down the country we are all charged&mdash;and the Government have taken good care to see to it that we are charged&mdash;with being parties to their policy.</P>

      <P>Fianna Fáil speakers, going through the country, say that we are all united now and that it was Fianna Fáil who did it.  Now, we are certainly united&mdash;and I think the Taoiseach and the Government will agree&mdash;upon one great principle, and that is that this is our country and that we are going to defend it against all enemies whomsoever.  We are agreed on that, and nothing more.  I am sorry, Sir, but I have to say this: that when slurs are thrown upon them with regard to these particular orders made under this Act, Fianna Fáil spokesmen over the country get out of their difficulty by saying that it is the responsibility, not only of the Government but of the people who are associated with them in the Defence Conference.  Yesterday evening, when these matters were being brought under comment, I noticed that the Taoiseach himself adopted the attitude that neutrality was a baby that could not be touched, and he threw that up as a barrier when his administrative work or the Government's administrative work was under survey. I think that that is unfair.  If the Taoiseach thinks that there is any Party in this House not prepared to defend neutrality and subscribe to his policy in that regard, I should like the Taoiseach to name that Party positively, but he should not adopt the attitude, that, were it not for him and the particular attitude he took, our neutrality and our exclusion&mdash;under the favour of God, in my opinion, and not due to the Taoiseach or anybody else&mdash;from the catastrophe that has fallen on the world would not be preserved. If he did not take that line, I should be perfectly satisfied to give him all the credit that I can, but when he adopts the line that it is he, and he alone, who has saved us, then I resent it, because it is untrue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In conclusion, Sir, I may say that there is nobody in this country, in my opinion, with any sense of responsibility, who is prepared to resist the Government in getting the power that is necessary to maintain law and order <Col N="1261" /> and to maintain the settled policy of the country which has been given expression to by every Party in this House.  I, therefore, appeal to the Taoiseach that if, in the future, he has any problem in connection with which he thinks he should issue an order, before doing so he will either call his Defence Conference into being, put the problems before them, give them all the information at his disposal, or, alternatively, let a committee of the House be set up, under the Committee of Procedure and Privileges, and let that order be examined in detail, and let a joint responsibility be taken for its publication.</P>

      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, because if the coal is not provided to produce the machinery that is necessary for the harvest, to keep the Army in the field, the Army will not go far.  It may be very insignificant, but it is part and parcel of the defence of the country. Do not make any mistake about that. It is a problem which should be examined, and such an order should not be issued without Deputies' consent and knowledge, because it is essential for the well-being of the country.</P>
      <P>I appeal to the Government either to refer these orders to the Defence Conference or, alternatively, to a committee set up by the Committee of Procedure and Privileges, so that every aspect of the nation's defence and well-being may be taken into consideration. It is true to say that the defence of this country is not the responsibility or the privilege of any section; it is the responsibility of every one of us. That being so, the Government should give every Party in this country the credit of having the intention of defending this country, for which so much has been sacrificed, in order to keep it as we would like to have it.</P>

      <P>When this House met on September 2nd, 1939, to consider this Act there was unanimous agreement amongst all Parties that the powers <Col N="1262" /> which the Government sought should be given.  Everybody will remember that on that occasion Deputies met in an atmosphere of very grave apprehension. They realised that they were the representatives of a small nation which, for the first time in its history, was called upon to preserve its separate national identity in a worldwide conflict.  For that reason there was a tremendous responsibility placed on this House and on the Government. Deputies, without exception, therefore, were prepared to extend to the Government the powers which the Government considered were absolutely necessary to enable them to guide the nation through the emergency.  The Government, having more detailed knowledge of the situation, of the difficulties that surrounded them at that time and those which they were likely to encounter in the future, had a perfect right to make that demand to this House and, having made that demand, the House had no alternative but to accede to it.</P>
      <P>There has been since 1939, however, grave disappointment throughout the country in regard to the manner in which the powers granted have been exercised by the Government.  That disappointment has been mainly due to the fact that, in the first place, those powers have been used for a purpose which could have been served as well by ordinary legislation.  In the second place, we have a widespread feeling that those powers have been used by the Government in regard to various economic matters with a view to avoiding the criticism which they would have to face if they were to seek those powers through ordinary legislation. Despite having used those powers very extensively, the various Departments of the Government have failed to solve or to deal effectively with any of the problems they were called upon to face, and which they required these powers to face.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When this Bill was before the House in September, 1939, I was one of those who supported the Government in securing those powers.  But at that time I suggested that, having given such wide powers to the Government, it <Col N="1263" /> was undesirable that the Party system of government should continue; that it was absolutely essential that the Opposition Parties, having transferred so much of their functions to the Executive, should be called upon to join with the Government Party in forming a national Government, so that all Parties would have a share in the responsibility of guiding this country through the emergency.  Everything that has happened during the past few years has confirmed me, at any rate, in the belief that that suggestion was a proper one.  I believe that if the Government at the outset of the emergency had taken the step of forming a national Government they would have been able, with the co-operation of the Opposition Parties, to overcome many of the economic difficulties which they have apparently been unable to solve by their own efforts.</P>
    <P>This Act has been used mainly for dealing with economic difficulties and it has been used very ineffectively.  For that reason, strong opposition, I am afraid, will be expressed against this House continuing to extend those powers to the Government.  For example, we have had various orders regulating supplies, orders usually issued when supplies were exhausted. We have inability on the part of various Ministers intelligently to anticipate the trend of events, or the reactions of the people towards a shortage of supplies.  For example, last summer we had the Minister for Supplies appealing to the people to use one teaspoonful less when making tea. An appeal such as that was absolutely childish and could only have the effect of encouraging those who could afford it to lay in an additional supply of tea, thereby aggravating the shortage.  If these orders are to be used in that way they should be used intelligently.  A rationing order is not one that should be talked about beforehand, but one which should be applied without any previous notice.  In this connection, the Minister for Supplies has failed absolutely.  He has always warned potential hoarders in advance that a shortage is coming.  I do not know why <Col N="1264" /> he should take that step, but that has been his invariable practice.</P>
    <P>I think that, if the Government had accepted the suggestion which I made when the original Bill was introduced, that they should seek the co-operation of the Opposition Parties and endeavour to attract into the Government the services of the ablest members of the Opposition Parties, they would have made a better attempt at solving our economic difficulties.  I make that suggestion again, subject, of course, to the reservation that there will always be complete agreement amongst all Parties in regard to national policy and in regard, particularly, to the policy of neutrality. Nobody could expect the Government to absorb any political Party which did not accept, without reservation or qualification, the Government's policy in regard to neutrality.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon has asserted that the Ministers in the present Government are absolutely incompetent, but I think he should have followed up that suggestion by offering to the Government the services of his really competent colleagues.  He also stated that the Taoiseach is a very astute politician. I think the people of the country should be grateful that we have at the head of affairs an astute politician, because it is quite obvious that any statesman competent to avoid or to overcome the various difficulties and pitfalls in respect of internal affairs would also be a very good and useful guide in avoiding pitfalls in respect of international affairs, and, to give credit where credit is due, I think the Taoiseach has been successful in guiding this country through the difficult situation with which it has been faced in the past two years.  I do not agree, either, with the criticism offered with regard to the mission in the United States of the Minister for the CoOrdination of Defensive Measures.  I think every intelligent person realises the difficulties which this country, as a neutral country, has to face, and that not even that Minister can make the policy of this country in regard to neutrality fit in exactly with the policy of the United States, or any other <Col N="1265" /> nation, and so long as that situation exists, there will always be apparent misunderstandings.</P>
    <P>I appeal now to the Taoiseach to use the powers about to be given to him&mdash; and I am satisfied that this Bill will be passed&mdash;with discretion, and to agree that anything which can be accomplished by ordinary legislation will be so accomplished.  We had the emergency powers used in connection with compulsory tillage.  That is a case in which there is absolutely no need to use these powers, as it would be quite easy to introduce and pass legislation making a provision for compulsory tillage, but, instead, we have a position in which it is dealt with by emergency legislation.  In regard to rationing, I agree that it might be necessary to use emergency powers, inasmuch as action by the Government might be forestalled, but there was no possibility that action in regard to compulsory tillage could be forestalled in any way by farmers.  They could not dispose of their farms in the course of a week or two for the purpose of evading the Bill.  We had a typical example of the extent to which emergency powers are used to achieve purposes which should be achieved by ordinary legislation, when some time ago there was a dispute about the price of milk, and these powers were used to break a strike in regard to the milk supply.</P>
    <P>There, again, you had a position in which there was no justification for the use of emergency powers, because we will always have, as between producers and wholesalers and retailers, disputes in regard to price, and there will always exist the right of producers to bargain collectively for more equitable prices and the right to withhold their supplies, in the event of not securing these prices.  There is no reason why the Government should take advantage of emergency powers legislation in order to squelch producers in such an important industry.  Yet that was done.  I ask the Taoiseach, as he is responsible for introducing the Bill, to take special steps to see that his Ministers use this measure exclusively for the purposes for which it is intended to be used, the preservation of the <Col N="1266" /> neutrality of this country and dealing with purely emergency matters, and that the powers contained in it will not be used to interfere with or encroach upon the rights of ordinary citizens.  I think he should also take steps to see that these powers are used intelligently.</P>
    <P>As has been pointed out, there is a grave danger that, as the powers of Ministers are extended by this measure and as they can meet any difficulty which they may encounter by simply making an Emergency Order, they will be inclined to shirk their duties to a great extent and that their Departments, in turn, will be inclined to shirk their duties.  A responsibility rests on the Government in seeking such extensive powers and the House has a right to obtain an assurance from the head of the Government that mistakes made during the past two years will not be repeated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>When I received a copy of this Bill, asking for an extension of the present emergency powers, I probably found myself in the same position as every Deputy belonging to any section of the House other than the Government Party, that is, in the position of a person whose national conscience was opposed to his judgment, his experience and his natural inclination.  It is nothing short of a tragedy that 18 months after these powers were given by a united House, generously given and enthusiastically given to the Government in the face of an emergency, every voice raised since this debate opened last evening has been raised in condemnation, thorough condemnation, of the unscrupulous manner in which those powers have been handled.  It is unfair to Parliament and unfair to the people.  We did hope 18 months ago, when these powers were freely and generously given, that the miracle would happen, but we knew it would have to be a miracle; that the paths of political crookedness would be departed from, and that competence and hard work would replace casual incompetence.  We found that the more freely powers were given, the more generously powers were given, <Col N="1267" /> the more numerous instruments we put into their hands, there was increased and increasing incompetence; that these powers, these vital measures, that were given to save the country from appalling dangers, were used merely to save Ministerial faces from the results of appalling blunders.</P>
      <P>I wonder has this debate any effect on the Government conscience?  I wonder is there anyone putting two and two together?  Is there anyone in the Government saying that when there can be such a complete transformation in 18 months there is definitely something wrong?  It is significant to realise that people have changed to such an extent that responsible Parties and responsible Deputies, who did not hesitate to give unlimited powers to the Government when the war had come to Europe, are now reluctant to give them any powers whatsoever.  The national conscience of any one of us directs that in a situation such as the present a Government, any Government, even a narrow, prejudiced, political Government, must have ample and unrestricted power.  The amendment submitted by the Labour Party recognises that powers must be given, but urges that satisfactory assurances should be given to the Parliament and to the people that, if these powers are given a second lease of life, they will not be abused in the narrow, bigoted, heedless manner in which they have been abused so far.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Who could picture, on that Saturday and Sunday in September, 1939, when these powers were being asked by a Party Government and given by a Parliament of all Parties, that they would be used through the medium of the censorship to strangle every political Party in the State, except the Government political Party?  Who could imagine on those two days or nights that whatever forces would be thrown up from within the country in response to the combined call of the leaders and the members of all Parties, an attempt would be made, as one force was brought into being after another, to cash in politically on each one of those forces in turn?  Who <Col N="1268" /> could believe that perhaps the power that comes hardest to a political opposition to give, namely, absolute censorship, would be used as it has been used continuously in this country to chloroform and strangle the views of every Deputy or any public man who was not puffing incense at the feet of the Taoiseach and the Taoiseach's Party?</P>
    <P>I believe that there is no measuring the harm that has been done to public confidence&mdash;and that means national safety&mdash;by the abuse of the trust that was imposed in the Government.  The Taoiseach, as usual, may pretend: &ldquo;Oh, these things happen without my knowledge; I knew nothing of that.&rdquo; When ugly things of a political nature have to be done, the Taoiseach has a habit of sticking his head up in the clouds, but when he does it he transfers his eyes, ears and brain to his feet to see that the job is being properly done.  The mere fact of having that part of his anatomy in the clouds leaves him in a position to pretend he knew nothing of what was being done.</P>
    <P>The censorship represents an appalling abuse and misuse of the trust that was imposed in the Fianna Fáil Government.  We had unlimited space, censorship idleness, failure to censor the most dangerous speeches once they came from the mouth of a Fianna Fáil spokesman.  Probably the most dangerous speeches from the point of view of a country that desired to be neutral, the most dangerous speeches that were made in the last 18 months, were made by the President and some of his Ministers.</P>

      <P>Yes, the Taoiseach and some of his Ministers.  I have too much respect for the President to think that he would damage the security of this country.  We had every one of those speeches which properly should have been censored.  If the same utterances were made by any Opposition Deputy, no matter who and no matter where he spoke, unquestionably they would have been censored. We had speeches made by the Taoiseach and some of his Ministers, needlessly, <Col N="1269" /> heedlessly, going out of their way to give provocation to one of the bigger belligerents.  Mild transgressions, comparatively speaking, very obscure and humble transgressions by others which might, if stretched to the very limit, be calculated to give provocation to one of the belligerents, when they were uttered by speakers belonging to Opposition Parties were rigidly and ruthlessly censored, not on the grounds that there was anything unfair or that there was anything untrue, but on the grounds that provocation might be taken from such phraseology or such references.  And yet the Taoiseach and his Ministers can broadcast to the world that this country was being blockaded by both sides and recently by design by Great Britain.</P>

      <P>Statements were made that we were being blockaded by design by both sides.  That type of statement could be defended on the narrow line of bare truth by a powerful lawyer, or by a political quibbler&mdash; just that it was barely true; but the implication was untrue, and the effect that it would have on the minds of his readers and audience would be definitely untrue.  This was a statement that was highly dangerous, and that could serve <Col N="1270" /> no useful purpose.  If the same statement were made and applied the other way by any Deputy of this Party it would be ruthlessly censored&mdash;and properly so.  Fortunately, the provocation was not taken, and fortunately allowances were made for the speakers who uttered those statements; but when a Deputy of this Party at a public gathering went there to give the truth and the whole truth, the truth that could not be contested here or elsewhere, his remarks were censored.</P>
      <P>My opinion is that it did not matter what that Deputy did refer to: the mere fact that he was an Opposition Deputy holding a public meeting, and not speaking in terms of high praise for the Taoiseach and his Ministers, would have been sufficient to secure that not a line would be allowed to appear in the public Press of this country.  We had a debate here on a censorship motion.  It went into detail.  I do not propose to go over all that ground again, but I am perfectly certain that if any of the remarks critical of the Government, showing distrust for the Government, are allowed to reach the public eye&mdash;and this has got to be placed on record&mdash;the Government answer will be: &ldquo;Every Government must have these powers.&rdquo;  I say, yes, every Government must have the powers asked for; any Government must have the powers asked for; but, where there is a responsibility on Deputies to give those powers in face of a really appalling emergency, there is a responsibility on a Government to make themselves worthy of the trust imposed upon them, and of the powers given to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Have we had any evidence of a return from that side for the generosity on this side?  The more powers given, the more weapons abused, the more freely given the more freely and incompetently used.  It may be that the mere fact that this Government is dealing with a particularly clear sighted and generous-minded Opposition Party, who give freely in the national interest, that these powers are being abused so freely.  If we gave more grudgingly, were more mean in our outlook, more petty in our giving, I believe that more <Col N="1271" /> consideration would be given to our views.  After 12 months rampant abuse of that censorship a motion was put down here.  In the course of the debate what was asked for?  Was it that the censorship should be abolished?  What was asked for was that the censorship remain as it is: that the machinery remain as it is, but that it be under the supervision of a Parliamentary Committee in which all Parliament and all the people could have confidence.  It is on a par with the general activity and the general outlook of the people that, for the time being, have a majority here and have unlimited powers, that they want to pretend that those powers have been operated only in the interests of the people.  But that offer that I refer to was refused.  They would not tolerate a censorship that would be activated in the interests of national security and of national safety&mdash;a Committee of the country's Parliament to ensure that the censorship would not be utilised for Party purposes.</P>
    <P>We have been asked to renew those powers&mdash;to be abused as they were before.  The motion asks what we asked and expected 18 months ago, that the powers should only be renewed provided satisfactory assurances are given that the abuses will not continue. The abuses of censorship are on record.  They are well known.  If there is anybody in the Government who has any doubts, ample and unlimited information can be given as to how extensively the censorship powers are being utilised for Party purposes, clearly for Party purposes, and for Party purposes in two directions: (1) to advance the interests of the Government Party; and (2) to obstruct the interests and, as far as the public go, to obliterate any other political Party in this State.  The Minister responsible for censorship smiles, but when he had an opportunity to make his case here he skedaddled to America to further bedevil the interests of this country. He carried on there so heroically, and with such a sense of responsibility, that the full powers of the censorship in this country had to be applied to prevent <Col N="1272" /> any utterance of his reaching any Irish paper, and I think rightly so.</P>
    <P>The use of the censorship has been condemned by every Party and by every independent Deputy who has interested himself in this matter since the coming into force of the Emergency Powers Act.  Will that matter be given full consideration?  I may be accused of speaking as a Deputy belonging to a Party, but there are more Parties than one in this House.  There are many Deputies who belong to no Party, but those Deputies gave the emergency powers as generously and as freely as the Deputies of this Party did.  There is not one of them but regrets the manner in which those powers have been used.  Can we be all wrong?  Can we all be suffering from delusions except the Taoiseach?  That will be his attitude when winding up this debate: that we are all wrong. &ldquo;They are all out of step except my son John.&rdquo;  Whenever we take this line we are all out of step but the Taoiseach, and anyone who is not in step with him is out of step.</P>
    <P>When the Taoiseach, 18 months ago, came to this House and asked for those emergency powers, could he, in his wildest fancy, picture a situation in which the Emergency Powers Act, or an emergency order under it, would be used to fix wages at whatever level they happened to be on the day the order was issued?  I believe, if anybody suggested 18 months ago that the powers might be used for such a purpose, they would be laughed out of Dáil Eireann by all Deputies, and the man who would lead the laugh is the head of the Government.  Here was a normal act that could have been done in a normal way.  There was no urgency; no reason why it should be put through before 5 o'clock rather than before 6 o'clock; no reason why it should be done on a Tuesday rather than on a Wednesday; no suggestion that the safety of the State or the security of the people would be in any way jeopardised if there were a few days taken over such an order, rather than a few minutes, and then the Minister's signature.  Does the Taoiseach think <Col N="1273" /> that he is building up a healthy frame of mind in the population of this country, amongst the workers, amongst the lowly-paid, by using the emergency powers to bring in such an order?  I do not say &ldquo;by doing such an act&rdquo;, but by doing such an act in such a way, without giving Parliament, without giving the representatives of the people, without giving the direct representatives of the workers, any opportunity even to meet the case, or to examine or state the case for the lowly-paid workers.</P>
    <P>If I were an enemy of this country, if I wanted to shake the confidence of the people in the Government, if I wanted to create such a volume of discontent, amounting almost to revolt, in order that, when the Government is shaken, when the people are disillusioned and mutinous, I could walk in and take what I could get, I could not devise any better way of harming this State than by doing that particular act in that particular way.  It was a gross and blatant abuse of the powers that were given.  Legislation is awkward. A case has to be made for legislation.  Every section has to be defended and explained.  That order on the face of it bears the stamp of gross and blatant Government laziness.  It was the handiest way.  It was the quickest way.  It did not matter that it was the way which showed no consideration for the humble folk whom the Taoiseach and his lieutenants exploited to the full at every election.  That did not matter.  It had to be done in the handiest way, the readiest way, and in such a way that no case would have to be made.</P>
    <P>The emergency powers were used in that way when dealing with the lowly-paid people, when dealing with the workers, the people who did not matter to those in Chrysler cars.  That is how they were treated.  How were the emergency powers used when dealing with the wealthy folk, the big contractors who had contracts with all the public institutions of the country?  How were the emergency powers used there?  One of the first group of emergency orders was served on all the public boards of this country, doing a thing which <Col N="1274" /> would be illegal but for the use of emergency powers, to build up the price of contracts already given as a result of competitive tendering.  Why?  There was a fair case made&mdash;because owing to the cost of raw materials the profits would not be as great due to the emergency. The wealthy were to be guaranteed the same profits as when there was no war on.  What is the worker's profit?  The worker's profit is the difference between his cost of living for the week and his wage for the week. If the cost of living went up, the profit went down.  The emergency powers were used to guarantee to wealthier folk the same profit that they would have if there were no war.  The same emergency powers were used to guarantee to the lowly folk that their profits would be absorbed by the higher cost of commodities, and that no effort of theirs could ever secure a higher wage as long as the war lasted. Now, there may have been a reason for both those orders, but the way in which it was done meant that no reason had to be advanced.  There may be a case somewhere in the Government offices to justify both those orders, but deliberately the path was chosen which would ensure that that case would never be made in Parliament.</P>
    <P>Does the Taoiseach, does any Minister or any Deputy in the Government Party, hold that that was playing ball fairly with this Parliament, or that that was one of the things which were visualised when the emergency powers were given?  Does any Deputy or any Minister think, when there are such abuses as that, that we could freely renew the powers which we gave 18 months ago?  Does any Minister or any Deputy or anybody in this country think it is unreasonable to ask, before giving a further lease of life to those very extraordinary powers, that satisfactory assurances should be given to Parliament that they will never in future be abused and misused?  The Taoiseach has the advantage of dealing with a Parliament composed of opposition Parties which have a great and deep sense of national responsibility. He has the privilege of being head of the Government in a Parliament where the leaders of all the opposition Parties <Col N="1275" /> would jeopardise political careers, political Parties and everything they ever possessed, in the interests of the country.  He has the advantage of dealing with people in opposition who, in a national crisis, count Party advantage as nothing.  But he has the disadvantage of having around him people who utilise a national crisis for Party advantage.  I am entitled to ask that that should stop, and stop now.  Not only the Deputies and the Parliament, but the people, are sufficiently disgusted with the manner in which those powers have been handled, handled not only by one Minister or one Ministry but by all Ministers.</P>
    <P>Perhaps, the mishandling of these powers that has touched the people most acutely and most harshly is the manner in which they have been handled by the Department of Supplies. Now, it is all very well to take a line from middle-class people, or to take a line from wealthy people, but the handling of the emergency powers by the Department of Supplies, viewed from the angle of the poor people, who are the vast majority, has been nothing short of a scandal.  Tea was rationed suddenly, and rationed on a scale that, twelve months ago, anybody would consider was entirely so harsh as to be regarded as absolutely fantastic. We were told that tea had to be rationed in that way because the supplies did not allow for any more generous rationing than a half an ounce per person per week.  It did not matter to the average person who had a few pounds to spare; he got ample notice to buy tea and to lay it in.  It did not matter&mdash;it does not matter for some time, at least&mdash;to the average person. Many homes spent a few pounds.  Many homes spent a few £10 notes, and many homes went far higher than that in buying and storing tea, and they could always clear their consciences, when a neighbour looked at them accusingly, by saying: &ldquo;We were called on by the Government to do it; we were told that that was the road for a proper citizen to tread.&rdquo;  When all those stores were accumulated, and when those who had never had a spare shilling with which to buy a quarter <Col N="1276" /> pound of tea, to keep in reserve, had nothing, we had the half ounce ration imposed.  No sooner had we the half ounce ration, under the guise that all tea was being controlled now, and that it was being allocated on the basis of a half ounce a week&mdash;no sooner was that order made than there was unlimited tea in many grocers' shops at 7/- and 8/- a pound.</P>
    <P>Now, either there was control of tea in this country or there was not.  If there was control, and if the Minister felt that he would have to ration the people on a half ounce, then he should never have advised them to hoard.  If there was control and if it was seen, or foreseen, that we would reach the day when a half ounce would be the most that a person could get, then those huge purchases should have been stopped.  If there was no control, everyone did the best he could for himself and his friends according to the depth of his pocket, and in that case there was no necessity for that expensive Department, but it cannot be both ways.  If there is control, how does it come about that you have not to go into any three shops until you will find one that will sell unlimited tea at a millionaire's price?  The result of the whole policy is a half ounce per week for the poor, a half ounce per week for the middle-class, who have to be economical in their outlook, and unlimited tea for the wealthy and unlimited profit for those who stored tea when it was supposed to be controlled and unloosed it to the public at exorbitant prices as soon as the public were rationed.</P>
    <P>What applies to tea applies also to flour.  There is not a wealthy house in this country that cannot, by holding up a finger, buy from one to 20 tons of white flour at a price&mdash;at two and a quarter times the price of the black flour or brown flour that the Government has gone in for.  There, again, we have the failure of the Government to do its job.  We have the operation of emergency powers being used, on the one hand, to deprive those who are poorest of something that they fancy or something that they require, and, behind the screen of Emergency <Col N="1277" /> Orders, ample supplies for the wealthy at a price.  Either there is control or there is not.  If there is control, every ounce of white flour, no matter how it came into the country, should be controlled, and the price should be fixed for all commodities so that the racketeering game will stop once and for all in this country.  I do not know how it is, and I say this in no Party spirit, but I am quoting a staunch follower of the Taoiseach's to the effect that in connection with anything that was touched, in the last ten years, that had to do with licences or anything else, gross racketeering grew up around it immediately.</P>
    <P>Since we had certain essential commodities controlled we have had outrageous, scandalous and flagrant racketeering in every town and village in the country.  Is that good for the moral fibre of our people?  Is it wise listlessly to stand by while we develop a population of corrupt racketeers, and is it sound statesmanship to let that go on, especially at the cost of the very poorest people?  It would not be possible but for the Emergency Powers Act and the orders made under it.  If there were ordinary competitive sale prices, being fixed by supply and demand, then all would have at least a fairly equal chance, but certainly the prices would be controlled because there would be competitive buying.</P>
    <P>I do believe in rationing.  I believe it is the fairest principle all around so as to ensure that everybody gets an equal share, but I believe that the rationing in this country was done in a muddleheaded way, without any serious, hard work being done in advance.  It was merely a paper thing, and the necessary anticipatory work was not done thoroughly nor was the follow-up work done competently. When the things that I am mentioning were brought to the notice of the Minister for Supplies&mdash;the most glib-tongued man who ever spoke in the Dáil&mdash;his answer was that those commodities had reached the country illegally and that they would not fix the price for things that reached the country illegally.  That is as false a smokescreen as ever a man dodged <Col N="1278" /> behind.  If he controls an article, then he controls all of that article that is in the country.  I do not care whether it came in by the back door or by the front door, if we are to pay for the huge cost of a Department of Supplies to control commodities in the country, then it is the job of the Minister to control those commodities and to stop racketeering, to stop victimisation, and to take into account all the supplies that are in the country, and then adequately ration on the basis of all the supplies instead of inadequately rationing on the basis of only a fraction of the supplies.</P>

      <P>Is beag rud atá agam le rá ar an mBille seo, agus tá súil agam gan bheith le fada ag cainnt. When I was listening to Deputy McGilligan's contribution to this Bill yesterday, a particular phrase of his struck me.  He dealt with the censorship on news and views. As far as I can see, in connection with the items of news you can read the communiqués of the various belligerents every day, so I do not know exactly what he complained of under that head.  With regard to views, I think it necessary that the censor or the Government should intervene to put a stop to the publication of views that would bring the tragedy of the North Strand into every town and village in the country.  I am not in favour of the Labour Party motion. I want a tighter censorship.  I want a state of things that will prevent enter-the-war speeches being sent to the pro-British, enter-the-war <i>New York Times</i>, published word for word in that paper, and represented as the views of the people of this country. However these were sent, the censorship and the Government are not doing their duty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I listened to Deputy O'Higgins talking about the censorship of public speeches.  In a way I would like to see the speeches we have listened to for the last couple of months from the Front Opposition Bench published word for word.  They would soon get their answer from the Irish people.  The safety and freedom of the people are much more important <Col N="1279" /> than any coalition Government.  We have preserved our neutrality.  We are backed by the whole of the Irish race in America and abroad in preserving our neutrality and the Government have the support of the Irish race in their attitude.  I appeal to the Government to take sufficient steps to see that there is not a repetition of what occurred in New York by representing a war-mongering speech as the views of the people of Ireland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>Like many other Deputies, I believe that during this emergency it is necessary for the safety and security of the State that the Government should have the powers sought for in this Bill.  But I, too, feel, in the light of the way in which the Emergency Powers Act has been operated by the Government, that it is right and proper that the House should insist on the assurances asked for in the Labour Party motion.  From reading the official report of the debates on the original Bill, it is obvious that it was never the intention of Parliament that the very wide powers sought for at that time and freely given by all Parties in the House should be used in the way they have been.  I, too, join with the many other Deputies who have expressed their opinion in condemnation of the way in which the Government have abused those powers during that interregnum.  In Section 2 (1) of the Bill we are told why it was necessary to have those emergency powers.  We are told that it was the opinion of the Government that it was necessary and expedient for securing the public safety, for the preservation of the State, for the maintenance of public order, and for the provision and control of supplies and of the services essential to the life of the community. We all realise, because of the war situation, that it would be impossible for the Government to foresee all the changing circumstances that might arise from day to day, and that it would be necessary for the Government to have powers to deal expeditiously with unforeseen difficulties, some of them difficulties of considerable magnitude; that, owing to the rapid changing <Col N="1280" /> of circumstances and conditions, it would be necessary for the Government to have powers to guard against those rapidly changing conditions that might seriously affect the welfare of the country, particularly the economic welfare of the country; that orders made by outside countries, particularly Great Britain, day to day orders varying the supplies position of this country, might have to be offset to a great extent by orders made here to bring our position into line with the new position created. Deputies realised the necessity of giving powers to the Government to deal with that type of situation.  In doing so they expected that those powers would be used for the better welfare of the country.  It was made clear by Deputies, particularly on this side of the House, that it was on these conditions, and only on these conditions, these powers were freely given.  In reading the records we see that we got those assurances.</P>
      <P>What is the position now?  How have they been used?  Since that time, a spate of orders, possibly numbering 300 or 400, has been issued.  They come through the post to Deputies every day, they are being turned out like cigarettes out of a machine.  Many of them do not fall within any of the three categories set out in Section 2 (1). Many of them relate to major social economic problems.  Many of them, as has been stated by other Deputies, have been made without due regard to their implications and how they would affect the particular set of conditions obtaining here.  Many of these orders were not of an emergency character at all and could have been, and ought to have been, passed into law through the ordinary channels here.  Many of the orders undoubtedly have created an incongruous situation.  That situation has been created because the people responsible for issuing the orders, and the civil servants dealing with them, failed to appreciate the reactions that they might have on the people, because we all know that those civil servants have not any practical experience of the conditions that obtain in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As to the Emergency Powers (No. 83) Order, the standstill order, I think <Col N="1281" /> that the making of such an order was unfair and unjust, that it was an abrogation of the powers of the House to make such a highly-contentious order.  If it were necessary to take steps in that matter, legislation should have been introduced to deal with it, so as to give the various Parties and the representatives of the people in this House an opportunity of discussing the merits or otherwise of the measure.  Instead, the Government takes the opportunity to abuse the powers given to them and to short-circuit this House by issuing an Emergency Order.  It has been pointed out that, by reason of the coal order recently applied to turf districts, a blacksmith cannot get coal for his ordinary operations, which shows how incongruous the whole situation is. That situation has been created simply because practical minds have not been brought to bear upon our problems. Many orders have been made in respect of tillage and, in my opinion, it would have been much more in the best interests of the country if these had been brought before the House and properly and duly considered by the House by people representing different interests and different sections of the community, and if the minds of practical men with practical experience had been brought to bear on them.  The combined knowledge and experience of Deputies is required to help us through this emergency, and I say that particularly with regard to our food drive.  It struck me at the time that drive was initiated that there had been no effort at all to devise a constructive plan to get the best effort out of our people during the emergency. The plan simply took the form of the issuing of a compulsory order and a general appeal by the Taoiseach and by the Ministers, over the air and at a few meetings down the country, and that was the end of it.  No effort was made to provide an opportunity to the House to discuss the order, its implications and ramifications, the effect it was going to have and the problems it gave rise to for the people concerned.</P>
    <P>I suggest that this should definitely <Col N="1282" /> have been duly and fully considered by the Dáil and I feel that, with the combined practical experience and knowledge of Deputies representing agricultural interests, much more would have been adopted.  Imagine a Minister stating to-day in reply to a question about the acreage of wheat, oats and barley that he was not in a position to tell us how we stood in regard to these crops.  Normally a census of production is taken in June and we are treating this year as if it were a normal year. Would one not expect some attempt to have been made last February at taking some sort of census of production? Any farmer at that time was in a position to tell the Guards what crops he had sown and what crops he proposed to sow.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am trying to point out that failure has been the result of the introduction of the tillage order and that the problem should have been dealt with by ordinary legislation.  I am making a passing reference to a question on a very important matter&mdash; our position with regard to the acreage under crops&mdash;and pointing out that when we are approaching mid-July, the Government has no information as to how we stand with regard to crops and the produce we may hope to get from them.  I think that whole situation has developed from our method of using emergency powers and abusing emergency powers, when the matter should have been dealt with by normal legislation on which the help, the co-operation and the advice of practical men would be given.  What are we sent here for?  What is the function of this <Col N="1283" /> House, if it is not to serve the best interests of the community and the advantage of the State?  Deputy O'Higgins has made reference to the tea order.  There were so many orders made that one could speak for hours about the effects of them, and I have had infinite trouble in respect of orders about kerosene and fuel oil for tractors, because opportunities were not given to the House to consider how best to ration oil for tillage purposes with the result that many tractors were left to stand idle during a critical period in the spring.  I suggest that this was a wrong method of approach and a wrong way in which to deal with the situation.</P>
      <P>With regard to censorship, there is no doubt that, from the assurances we got from the Taoiseach at the time, the House was led to believe that the censorship would not be operated as drastically as it has been.  We were told that it was news, and news only, and not views, which was to be censored, and that news would be censored only if it tended to give any information relating to belligerents, or if it was likely to affect or jeopardise in any way the neutrality of this country.  We all know that the censorship has been used in an altogether different way, and the assurances given at that time have not been honoured, so far as this House is concerned.  It has been used to suppress and to stifle opinions expressed here and outside relating to Government policy, both economic and social, and, to my mind, that is an abuse of the privileges given to the Government under that Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think this situation has made for the creation of a healthy public opinion.  Far from it.  The Dáil undoubtedly has been brought into disrepute and has to bear criticism and gibes thrown at it through the medium of the Press.  Coming across to Leinster House, one can see a poster displayed stating that the Dáil is going to seed.  What effect will that have on the ordinary countryman?  Does it make for respect for this Parliament of the people?  We certainly do not want to create down the country an opinion disastrous to the interests of <Col N="1284" /> Government institutions.  It is the duty and responsibility of every Deputy to create respect for these institutions and for democratic institutions generally, if we are at all anxious to preserve democratic institutions, but we are definitely treading dangerous ground and pursuing a very dangerous line in this whole matter.  Deputy Kennedy a few moments ago defined his attitude on this question of censorship.</P>

      <P>That is, in effect, what he said, or what he meant.  I join with other Deputies in asking the Taoiseach to give us the assurances that have been asked.  We do not want to deny the Government the measures they seek.  We believe it would be impossible to carry on the administration without those emergency powers; but in getting those powers the Government should realise they are taking on a very sacred trust.  They should honour that trust.  In my opinion the trust that has been placed in the hands of the Government by this Parliament has not been honoured.  Deputies are entitled to an assurance that at least some effort will be made to improve the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnLymbrickEsmonde" hpid="Mr. Esmonde Mr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>We are discussing the advisability of continuing for another term the provisions contained in the <Col N="1285" /> Emergency Powers Act which was passed in September, 1939.  I do not wish to depart from the attitude I took up on that occasion.  I said then that I was not in favour of giving the Government the extensive powers which they have obtained under this Act, but, in view of the desirability expressed by everybody, that the Government should, in the existing circumstances, be given them, I said I would not be against their having those powers.</P>
      <P>It seems to me the powers that we are going to give the Government for another 12 months are very dangerous powers indeed.  I think the Taoiseach will be the first to appreciate the fact that legislation by decree, if I may use that expression, is a very dangerous form of legislation and a very difficult form of legislation.  I think that a Government or a Minister to whom is deputed the duty of bringing out a decree is practically in the position of being placed on a certain standard of conduct, having a trusteeship imposed on them or on him, as it were, in order to represent the views of Deputies here.  In these circumstances it is the duty of the Government or of the Minister to see that the particular decree is such as, having been fully debated in the House, would have gone through the House in the ordinary way of legislation.</P>
      <P>This form of legislation rather reminds me of the position of a young man who gets a cheque book for the first time.  There is even in legislation such a thing as inflation.  I understand ordinary inflation to be the use of a printing press for the production of an unlimited amount of bank notes until eventually the country goes bankrupt. The danger of this form of legislation is that it is something similar.  You can have inflation in legislation; you can have so many decrees and orders turned out that it may eventually lead to bankruptcy of statesmanship.  The young man with a cheque book for the first time thinks that all he has to do is to write unlimited cheques and that there will be unlimited money to meet them.  In the same way a Government entrusted with those very dangerous powers might be inclined to overrun the mark.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1286" /> I think we should be very careful indeed, because of the danger of this form of legislation, when we are giving these powers to the Government.  It is a difficult form of legislation and I think the Taoiseach and his colleagues will be the first to recognise that fact. By reason of the volume of orders that may be turned out, human nature is such and the time is such that I do not believe a great number of these orders can properly be considered before they are issued and become the law of the land.  They are orders that in many respects touch upon every aspect of the nation's life.  Such orders should be drafted with very great care and consideration and they should not be done in any hurried fashion.</P>
    <P>I think this debate has served a useful purpose in this respect, that it has brought us back to the stage of realising that the original Act of 1939 and this continuation Bill, is out of the category of ordinary and well in the category of extraordinary legislation. If we did not have this debate, if we had not various views expressed, we might find ourselves in the position of regarding the passing of legislation of this kind as a matter of course.  It is a very useful thing that we have had this discussion.  I should have liked to see every Deputy joining in it, contributing something towards it.  What we are doing at the moment is handing over our rights and duties to the Government and in this legislation there should be a sort of personal message contained the views of all Deputies, if I may put it that way.</P>
    <P>The legislation which the Government can enact by decree is not, excepting on one or two occasions, usually the subject of discussion in this House.  The answer to that is that there is a section of the Emergency Powers Act which states that a motion can be brought forward within 21 days to repeal the order.  That is not practicable at the present time.  All last autumn and winter the Dáil seemed to have practically ceased to exist.  It seemed to me just to come together for the purpose of adjourning for another fortnight or three <Col N="1287" /> weeks.  All last autumn and winter we were pouring out from the Government printing presses laws affecting the citizens.  If there is legislation going through in that fashion, I suggest the Dáil should be in almost permanent session for the purpose of dealing with it and properly criticising it.</P>
    <P>Every citizen is affected by one or other of these orders.  Every citizen is deemed to know the law and, if he breaks it, it is not a defence on his part to plead that he is ignorant of the law. Usually he obtains his knowledge of the law from the discussions that take place in the legislative assembly or in publications in the Press dealing with laws passed by the Legislature.  Deputies do not become aware of much that is done by way of decree.  They find it very difficult to keep up to date with changes in the law.  The difficulties of the general public are enormous compared with the difficulties to Deputies.</P>
    <P>I should like to impress on the Government the necessity of giving greater publicity to the various orders that are printed, that become the law and that impose serious liabilities, penalties and duties on members of the public.  I think it better that the public should become aware, not only of the actual terms of the orders, but their effect and what condition of affairs they are intended to bring about.  In that connection, there is a very easy and ready method of informing the public.  We have in this country a wireless service which, for some reason or other, is absolutely silent during certain hours of the day.  During those periods somebody on behalf of the Government could be engaged to inform the public of the purpose and likely effects of a particular order that the Government intend to make.  I do not think that, even with the best will in the world, it is possible for Deputies to keep themselves fully acquainted with the various new laws that are, so to speak, made overnight.  Certainly, the public are not able to do it.  As I have said, I was not in favour of giving those enormous powers to the Government, <Col N="1288" /> but it seems to be the view of the country that they should have them. If that view existed in 1939 it should exist doubly so to-day.  The Government committed faults in connection with the administration of the powers given them under the Act of 1939.  I believe grave errors were committed, and that mischief was done in regard to the manner in which that Act was administered, but if the situation was such in 1939 that it was necessary to give the Government the powers it contained, then I think we can say that it is much more acute to-day.</P>
    <P>I think this discussion will have served a very useful purpose if the Government will appreciate the fact that the criticism from this side of the House has not been put forward for the purpose of any particular Party gain, or any particular political point. It has been put forward because we are entitled to do so as members of the House.  A renewal of the Act of 1939 is being sought.  We are entitled to give our views to the Government because the Government represent, in connection with this particular matter, not merely their own Party but the unanimous will of this House, as they did when the 1939 Act was passed. The Government should accept our views and our criticism.</P>
    <P>I hope the Taoiseach will not look on our criticism as being put forward in any Party sense.  I found it very hard to sit and listen to the speech that was made a short time ago by Deputy Kennedy.  I do not think it is right that members of our Party who, since the outbreak of hostilities in Europe, have done their best, collectively and individually, to act the part of good citizens, by assisting to maintain the neutrality of this country, should have to listen to a speech such as Deputy Kennedy made.  It is very wrong and very unfair to suggest that members of this Party, because they sit on this side of the House and may hold certain views, are in any way anxious that this country should depart from the policy of neutrality which has been pursued since the outbreak of the war.  Anything that I <Col N="1289" /> have said or done since the outbreak of the war can be checked.  I think it is most unfair to suggest that because we are in opposition we have no greater feeling for Irish nationality than the Party which supports the Government.</P>
    <P>I would impress on the Taoiseach the advisability of appreciating the difficulties of legislating under the 1939 Act because of the way it touches everyone.  Let me give this as an illustration.  There is hardly a Bill of a controversial nature introduced into this House that could not, in some shape or form, be brought in as an order made under the Act of 1939.  But, as we know, there are five stages for every Bill.  As a rule we see a sheaf of amendments brought forward in the case of most Bills.  These amendments are moved not only by members of the Opposition Party but by the Government, which means that between its introduction and the taking of the Committee Stage, the Government and their advisers have thought it advisable to amend the Bill in many material parts.  Sometimes a whole section is taken out and a new section put in. The Bill, in that way, gets very careful consideration, not only on the Committee Stage but on all other stages. If that be the position in regard to a Bill, surely the same thing is likely to occur but in a more acute form, in connection with any order made under this Act.  For that reason I ask the Government to accept in the proper spirit the criticism that has been levelled at them in connection with this Act.  We here are voicing the real public opinion of the country.  Governments sometimes are not in a position to gauge public opinion.  We, from this side of the House, suggest that it would be wise for the Government to hold a sort of minor inquiry in the case of each of these orders which affect so many people in various ways&mdash;much in the same way as a Bill is examined when it is being piloted through the Dáil.</P>

      <P>I desire to express my views as a representative of the people before giving the Government a renewal of the powers asked for in this <Col N="1290" /> Bill.  The powers in the 1939 Act were unanimously given by the House to the Government.  I do not think that the debates, such as we are having on this Bill at the present time, are good for the country.  At the same time I want to say that only the Opposition Parties feel that the Government mishandled the powers given to them in the 1939 Act, they would not have made the statements we have listened to yesterday and to-day.  As the last speaker said we, as the representatives of the people, handed over the powers of the 1939 Act to the Government because we felt that it was absolutely necessary that they should have them.  We are passing through a great emergency. I do not want to make a long statement, or to criticise the Government in any way, because I think that criticism at the present time is not the thing. What I do suggest to the Taoiseach and the Government is that, in future, when orders affecting different sections of the people are being made under this Act, such as Order 83, he should call together the heads of the different political Parties and have the orders discussed in private with a view to some agreement being arrived at before the orders are placed on the Table of the House.  In that way a good deal of the kind of censure that we have had in the House during the past two days could be avoided.  After all, are we passing through an emergency? Is it necessary that we should have complete unity in this House and in the country?  If it is, then let us stop wrangling.  Let us stop wrangling if the situation is as serious as we are being told it is.  The people down the country treat the situation as very serious.  The whole country are with the Government in their policy of neutrality, and we hope and pray that this war will pass without our entering into it.  The Government have the good will of this House and of the country in that policy, but I would advise the Government, in the future working of those powers which are to be granted to them, that there should be more agreement with the Opposition Parties before orders affecting the livelihood of sections of the people are brought in.</P>

      <P>It has been pointed out by various speakers that this House was called together by telegram in September, 1939, in order to hear what the Government's proposals were in so far as the then rapidly developing European situation was concerned.  The Taoiseach on that occasion told the House that it was necessary that certain powers should be given to the Government to enable them to deal with anything of an international character which might interfere with the neutrality of the country, a neutrality which had been declared by every Party in the House, and I believe that every Party in the House, in declaring that neutrality, were voicing the opinions of the people they represented all over the country.  From the remarks of Deputy Kennedy, who spoke a few moments ago, one would infer that nobody wanted neutrality in this country except the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I said that that could be inferred from what he said, and if the Deputy will read the official report I think he will find that I am perfectly right.  He talked about members on the front Opposition Benches making certain speeches from which he inferred that they wanted this country to enter into the war.  Then he went on to say that they, the Government, had certain people behind them in an effort to keep the neutrality of this country. I do not know what other inference is to be drawn from that.  As far as this Dáil is concerned, I do not know anybody who wants to enter the war on the side of anyone.  I think that has been made clear by the leaders of all Parties, and by every member of any Party who has spoken either in this debate or in the debate of September, 1939.  The House, on that occasion, met in a very tense atmosphere. The Taoiseach, as I said before, asked for certain powers.  He told us, of course, that we were in an emergency situation, and that it was necessary that those powers should be granted, but during the course of the debate the whole trend of the discussion <Col N="1292" /> was that those emergency powers which the Government asked for were only to be used to prevent our neutrality from being interfered with, to deal, so to speak, with international affairs or actions which might cut across the neutrality that we had decided should be our policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Certain promises were asked for from the Government that those emergency orders would not be used to cut across, say, social legislation, or to bring about industrial conscription, or things of that kind.  I suggest that those promises were broken.  Apart altogether from Order 83, which has been referred to repeatedly by the different speakers, I would refer to the setting up in this country of what is known as the Construction Corps.  I presume that that Corps has been set up under the Emergency Powers Act. The Construction Corps may be a good thing in so far as bringing people to do certain national work is concerned, but I should like to know under what authority the people who refused to join the Construction Corps in various parts of the country have been refused unemployment benefit at the labour exchanges?  I suggest that that is something which should not be done under an Emergency Powers Order.  I know quite well that, under the Unemployment Insurance and Unemployment Assistance Acts, a person who refuses work at a labour exchange in the ordinary way is prevented from getting benefit, but I suggest that to offer a man a position in an army is not work in the accepted sense.  I have in my mind two or three cases of young men who were apprenticed to trades in the town of Wexford.  Those young men or youths were offered work in the Construction Corps, and, in consequence of the fact that they refused to join, the labour exchange refused to pay them benefit.  I suggest that that is going a little too far. Those young men were out of work only for a few months.  They expected to be going back to finish their apprenticeship in a very short time and it is very unfair of the Government to insist on those people joining the Construction Corps of the Army, and to refuse them unemployment assistance for <Col N="1293" /> failure to do so.  I would ask the Taoiseach to look into that matter.  It has been pointed out here that, in so far as the neutrality and the defence of this country are concerned, we have unity of purpose and unity of intention here.  As far as this Party is concerned, we are willing to lend all the co-operation necessary in the defence of this country.  We recognise that it is not a question of Fianna Fáil.  Fine Gael, Labour or anybody else; that it is our country, and we have to defend it.  Certain suggestions have been made that because of certain things men should leave the Local Defence Force or the Local Security Force. I do not hold with that view at all.  It is the business of every Party in this State to defend this country against all comers, and I want to dissociate myself from any suggestion of that kind.</P>
    <P>Reference has also been made to censorship.  It is very hard to know how the censorship is applied.  If we take the Government organ, I might say that the members of this Party get very little publication in it.  One is not sure whether or not it is the censorship is responsible for that, but, during recent debates in this House on very important matters, a new technique of journalism has made its way into the columns of the Government organ.  One will remember that on a certain day there was a certain long debate in this House.  Various people spoke in that debate, and we found when we picked up that paper in the morning that almost a whole column was given to the answer of the Minister, and a line might be given to people who brought forward important amendments or important resolutions, but with the sense absolutely taken out.  Last week there was certain censoring so far as Deputy Norton and I were concerned.  I am not grumbling about that at the moment.  What I do grumble about is this, that on the same day on which we made statements that were alleged to be seditious, or something approaching sedition, the Minister for Industry and Commerce referred to the leader of this Party as a leader of Muscovite opinions in this country, and that was not censored.  I <Col N="1294" /> suggest that that is just as dangerous as anything that we said, and that it certainly should not be said by a responsible Minister about a man who is a member of the Defence Conference in this country, and who has done a man's part in securing that arrangements would be made to defend this country in the event of invasion by anybody. That, to my mind, means a biased censorship, and I would ask the Taoiseach to see that it does not occur in the future.</P>

      <P>That may be, but I am suggesting that the censorship should have intervened there.  When Deputy Childers was speaking yesterday he said, in connection with Emergency Order No. 83, that it was impossible for the worker in the country to appreciate the economic conditions.  I suggest to Deputy Childers that there is nobody in a better position to appreciate the economic conditions in this country than the worker at the present time.  The Deputy states that he has been in his constituency and that the workers have recognised that this question of supplies and wages is an extremely difficult matter to deal with and that it has been recognised by the workers in his constituency that what the Government has done through the medium of Order No. 83 has been helpful to the poor and the working class.  I wish Deputy Childers would come to my constituency and try to reconcile the working class in my constituency to that point of view.  I think he would find that a good many of the people in that area would not agree with the viewpoint expressed in the Deputy's speech.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Emergency Order No. 83, which was promulgated by the Government and applied hastily, in my opinion, was not thought out as it should have been <Col N="1295" /> thought out.  About a week ago we had a discussion here, through the medium of a motion that was put down by this Party in an effort to annul the order, and from that discussion certain anomalies were indicated to the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  It appeared to me, from that discussion, that the Minister was not aware of how heavily the order pressed upon the working class in this country, until that debate took place.  If the Minister for Industry and Commerce had had any consultation with the people who are in direct touch with the working class in this country he would never have made errors of that kind.  The result of that debate was&mdash;although the Minister may not admit it&mdash;that on the next night the order was varied to such an extent that certain minimum wages were allowed in certain centres&mdash; the minimum, of course, being the maximum.  If the Government took people into their confidence so far as matters like this are concerned, I believe they would not be making the mistakes which they have been making since they got these emergency powers.</P>
    <P>I have little else to say because the ground has been covered already by various speakers.  However, I should like to point out that during Deputy Dillon's speech yesterday he indicated that, in his opinion, it was impossible to control foodstuffs in this country, and he gave a very poor example.  He stated that he had certain peas in his shop, Canadian peas, some of them at 90/- a cwt., others at 60/- a cwt., and others at 45/- a cwt.  He said that it would be impossible to fix a price for these commodities.  I quite appreciate that, so far as imported articles like peas are concerned, but I would not accept the viewpoint which Deputy Dillon put forward, that it was impossible to control the price of such things in this country as butter, beef, bacon, milk, and things of that kind that are produced in the country.  After all, the people in this country could do without Canadian peas, but I suggest that they cannot do without sugar, butter, milk, beef, bacon, and so on, and these are the things that we are asking <Col N="1296" /> should be controlled.  If food prices were controlled the working classes would not be so unreasonable as to look for higher wages just for the sake of looking for them.  The reason that they want higher wages is that there has been a huge increase in the cost of the foodstuffs, which they are using every day, since the war began.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Higgins referred to one very important point in connection with this whole matter.  He suggested &mdash;and I agree with him&mdash;that the Emergency Powers Act has been used ruthlessly against the working class and the poor whilst contractors have been sheltered by it.  One has only to be a member of a public board to know that, immediately prior to September, 1939, certain contractors tendered prices for articles to be supplied to public boards, articles such as flour, butter, bacon, potatoes and commodities of that kind.  Two or three months of the war had only elapsed when these people made application to the Department of Local Government and Public Health to enable the prices which they had tendered to be increased, and the Minister for Local Government agreed immediately; perhaps it was the Minister for Supplies in conjunction with the Local Government Department, but at any rate the increases were agreed to.  I submit that that was very unfair, because other people had sent in tenders to public bodies for these particular articles and, perhaps because they had taken into account that the war would come and that the production of these things would be more costly, their tenders were not as low as those of the other people, with the result that the people who had sent in low tenders were given the contract. Then, with the sanction of the Department, these people were enabled to extract from the public bodies a greater amount than their tenders called for.  I again submit that that is using the Emergency Powers Act in favour of people who are not as badly off, at least, as the working classes, but so far as the working classes are concerned these powers have been used ruthlessly to prevent them from getting the wherewithal to live.</P>
    <P>The amendment tabled by the <Col N="1297" /> Labour Party is not an unreasonable one.  We are only asking for certain guarantees that the powers which will be given under the Bill shall not in the future be used for the purpose of reducing wages or of suppressing expressions of opinion concerning the social and economic consequences of Government policy.  In that connection, one wonders are guarantees from the Government any good, because the Government certainly gave very definite guarantees on the last occasion, but they broke their promises. This Party, as well as other Parties in the House, supported the Bill when it came before the Dáil in 1939, and if there is one thing about which we have been criticised more than another it is because we supported the giving of these powers to the Government, powers which they have abused.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Giles</NameTxt>
      <P>It is most unfortunate that so many contentious matters have been discussed here from time to time in connection with prices.  I ask the Government to be more prudent and wise at the present time because it would be very dangerous if the safety-valve were to be taken off at the moment, and it might be very bad for the country.  As far as I can see, the food situation is the cause of 70 per cent. of the troubles between the different Parties in this House.  A few years ago, our own people welcomed the setting up of the Defence Conference, whereby all Parties were brought together to devise means for the defence of this country.  That was a very wise and useful thing to do, and I ask that the scope of the Defence Conference should be widened now and that such matters as the food position and censorship should be matters for discussion by the Conference.  If that were done, I believe 70 per cent. of the difference between the various Parties would be wiped out because, after all, the food position is the whole crux of our situation at the present moment, and I believe it would take the wisest heads from all the different Parties combined to try to solve our problems. If such problems were brought under the Defence Conference it would ease the situation in this House a good deal. <Col N="1298" /> The Defence Conference is the safety-valve keeping our people together.  Our people have confidence that they will act wisely and prudently, and when we have the heads of the Government and Opposition and other Parties working together happily and in unity, it gives the people in the country every confidence that things are going well.</P>
      <P>So far as we can see at present, the Defence Conference might as well not exist.  We had unity and happiness for a while, but we seem to be getting away from each other again.  The national emergency is too great to allow Party opinions to flare up again. We are not yet half way across the stream.  We do not know what the future may bring us.  We can only see black clouds looming ahead.  I agree that emergency powers are essential to the Government in a time of crisis.  I also agree that everything depends on the way those powers are used.  The Government, in operating those powers, have acted more or less in a hasty and irresponsible manner.  So far as these powers are concerned, the people need guidance.  Many people never read the paper and are not able to discuss these matters.  When they find power taken to curb their activities in some way and to tighten up their way of living, without being given beforehand some idea of what is coming, it irritates them and gets on their nerves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The emergency powers were given to the Government for dealing with the censorship and defence matters.  They were not given for the purpose of keeping down wages.  The Government exercised that power without being given any right to do so.  I ask them to withdraw that order and to allow free scope in that matter.  The emergency powers were not given for the purpose of interfering with the functions of this Parliament, which was elected by the Irish people.  If those emergency powers continue to be operated as they are at present, this Parliament will be merely a farce.  It is only right that Parliament should be able to exercise its functions and discuss different matters.  Defence and neutrality are the chief things which come <Col N="1299" /> within the scope of the emergency powers, and in other matters the Government should not act without the authority of the House.  They have gone far beyond that, and are irritating, not alone the other Parties in this House, but the entire population.</P>
    <P>The Government know the history of this country.  They know that the Irish people will not be dragooned.  They can be led; but they will not be dragooned.  The Government should take heed of that, at the present time, because the people are being driven to desperation.  They are not being given the wise lead they should be given in a time of emergency like this.  This Parliament is powerless unless it has the people behind it.  In order to save the country, it is necessary that many nonsensical policies should be cast aside.  We must face the real situation that exists.  Political face-saving must be dropped by all sides.  We have had too much of that for the last ten or 15 years.  If we had less of that and more constructive work, the country would be in a much healthier position. The people of the present day are not like the people who were rescued from slavery many years ago.  They are far more enlightened people; they are beginning to think for themselves.  The Government should not think they can fool the people as they like; they may do it once or twice, but they will not do it all the time.  The people do not want political nonsense.  They want the Government to see that they are provided with the necessaries of life and that an economic price is paid for the things they produce.  They want to be provided with plenty of work. They do not want the catch-cries that we hear so often.  They may have been useful in the past, but they will not be useful in the future, and it is time they were dropped.</P>
    <P>We ought to realise that we are now at the cross-roads after 20 years of national Government and that we should be very cautious as to the road we shall take in the future.  If we take the right road, all may be well; if we take a wrong turning, we will throw the country back for generations to come.  It is unfortunate that one of <Col N="1300" /> the Deputies on the other side of the House tried to make out that certain people on this side of the House are pro-British and proud of it; that they are endeavouring to bring the country into the war on the side of Great Britain.  Everyone realises that we are all very happy to be out of the war and that each and everyone of us should endeavour to keep the country out of the war.  It may be a concern of ours to a certain extent, but we had nothing to do with bringing it about and we will do our best to keep out of it as long as we can.  It is my hope that we will be able to keep out of it. Small nations have no right to be butting in when bulldogs are fighting. The principal thing for us is to try to realise the situation which will exist when the war is over.  That should be our foremost consideration, because everything depends upon it.  If we take the right steps now, we may be able to overcome many of the difficulties that lie ahead.  If we get a wise lead and keep our heads we may be able to overcome many of those difficulties.  But if we carry on with the old nagging we will make no progress.</P>
    <P>I ask the Taoiseach to widen the scope of the Defence Conference.  In that way I believe that much of the grumbling and criticism which takes place in this House could be avoided. I suggest that the Defence Conference should be asked to deal with the food situation, the censorship, and things like that.  If these matters get full and free discussion there, we shall ease many of the difficulties which confront the country at present.  Wise counsel is what we want at the present time. So far as I can see the Government want to have everything for themselves. If there is anything to be gained, they want to get it for themselves; if anything goes wrong, this Defence Conference is blamed for it.  I, therefore, ask the Taoiseach to widen the scope of the Defence Conference and in that way try to bring about more harmony in this House, because if we have not that we will not get the people behind us.  The people are uneasy and restless at present and are longing for that.  If we do not give them the lead they expect, they will drift away and form sections of their own.  We do not want <Col N="1301" /> that.  We want to see the supremacy of this Parliament upheld.  We want to raise this Parliament to the highest pinnacle.  We have sufficient people outside at present doing their best to &ldquo;down&rdquo; this Parliament and to besmirch it in every way.  These are the people who were not with us in the past in times of danger.  We, who were united in the past in defence of this country, must realise that there is a dangerous situation confronting us. If we can unite now to do all we can to ease the situation for our people, we will be doing a good thing, and unless we do something we cannot hold this Parliament together.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. Everett Mr. Everett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government has been criticised in this House, and rightly criticised.  I think the Government will not object to that.  It has been stated that that criticism might be interpreted in other countries as meaning that, if the country was in danger, the people who are criticising the Government would not respond to an appeal for its defence.  Although we have criticised the Government, and have had reason for it, the workers of the country, if it is attacked, will defend it to the best of their ability. They recognise that it is the duty of every Irishman to render what assistance he can if called upon in such a situation, no matter what Government may be in power.  As Deputy Corish rightly pointed out, the country does not belong to any Government.  The Government is only the trustee for the time being for the country.  I hope that they are finished with these references about criticism here being an encouragement to foreigners to think that there is any disunity in the country, or to think that we have not all got the same idea, that is to keep Ireland out of the war, and that should she be attacked by any nation, Irishmen, and especially the working classes, will defend here with their lives, if necessary, notwithstanding the fact that they have good cause for complaint against the Government for the manner in which they have been treated for the past six or eight months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Mulcahy appealed for a regulation in respect of the taking of turf <Col N="1302" /> from bogs, and I support that appeal.  I know where 3,000 tons of turf are available, and I ask that a price be fixed, so that that turf may be taken away from the banks and the men employed in cutting more turf.  Due not so much to the fact that it is produced in one particular county, but to the fact that, when inquiries are made as to the cost of it, the county engineers are unable to state the price, people are not purchasing, but are waiting for the Minister to make an announcement, with the result that great inconvenience is caused to both the county surveyors and the public bodies who are anxious and willing to get a larger amount of turf cut.</P>
    <P>We have heard also about the Construction Corps.  I am glad the Taoiseach is present because, as I mentioned last week, I was in an area in which there are 100 turf workers on strike.  I found that the Construction Corps, which is costing £2 per week per man, were learning how to cut timber.  The men showing them this process, forestry workers, were in receipt of 30/- a week, and they pointed out that the Emergency Order prevented them from getting more than 30/- a week.  These men are engaged in fuel production.  They are cutting all the timber supplies for Dublin. They are men with families, who are not given tea like the turf workers, and who are out from early morning until 6 o'clock in the evening for 30/- a week, while the Construction Corps, learning how to cut trees, are getting food, and 11/- per week, amounting in all to 38/6 per week.  Is that not likely to cause dissatisfaction amongst the men on whom the Government rely to give their best in the cutting of turf and timber?  Forestry workers have a grievance in this matter.  While I was making my statement here last week and while the Parliamentary Secretary was saying that there was no interference with engineers in connection with the wages of turf workers, the Local Government Department was wiring to a county engineer that the Emergency Order was there and, therefore, he could not increase the turf workers' wages or make any arrangement other than a return to the piece-work system.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1303" /> I had many misgivings on the occasion of the introduction of the original Bill and the Government are doing exactly what I then prophesied they would do&mdash;that a meeting of the Dáil would be called and the Government criticised but that the papers would not be allowed to publish it.  I have no grievance in this respect.  I realise that when any Party is in power for a few years, they may use their powers in a way which it was never intended they should use them, but we have complaints about young men being refused unemployment assistance because they refused to join the Construction Corps.  I know one case of a young chap suffering from epilepsy. He refused to join and, because of his refusal, was prevented from receiving unemployment assistance.  The arbitrator decided that work was available, notwithstanding the nature of his illness, and that he was, therefore, not entitled to any assistance from the Government, with the result that the Board of Health had to put him on home assistance.</P>
    <P>We have a position in which the Government are obeying the whip of their executive officials.  We have been told by Deputy Murphy about a great Bill brought in by the officials of the Local Government Department, by which, they assured the Government, they were going to bring about economies in the different counties. The Government agreed to the Managerial Bill.  That Bill is not yet an Act, but there is resentment all over the 26 Counties in connection with it, because it is realised that men are not going to take any interest in it because the county managers are going to be yes-men for the Government Department, and there can be no honest criticism and no power in the hands of men elected to these boards.</P>
    <P>The trouble is that the Taoiseach has no knowledge of public boards.  He is engaged on other business, and is prepared to accept the opinions put forward by a Minister, who, in turn, is prepared to accept the opinions of his officials.  If there is any county manager required, he is required in <Col N="1304" /> the Local Government Department at present, and, if the Taoiseach were on a board, he would realise the trouble there is in getting even a reply from the Local Government Department. That reply, when it does come, comes probably two months after the time has expired for the sanction of the appointment of even a temporary official.  I have said before, and there is no harm in repeating it, that it is in the Local Government Department that the tightening up is required.  Certain officials have got it into their heads that they can treat the public boards with contempt.  But what is going to happen?  I know what is going to happen in my own county.  I guarantee that the Managers Bill will not work, or be put into operation, because those public men who have given service are not going to be mere yes-men and have the right only to listen to the county manager putting forward the estimates of rates, and to leave it there.  The men are determined to take such measures as will bring it into contempt, because we maintain that all the emergency powers necessary have been worked since 1939.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach says that it is in the interests of the poor.  He may believe that, but what is the position?  We find that the wealthy people are protected. They had the resources, and were able to get in supplies, but the poor, a very large percentage of whom were in receipt of home assistance and unemployment assistance, were not in a position to lay in supplies.  We then had an Emergency Order preventing a man who found employment from getting more than 30/- a week, and I am sure that the Taoiseach did not realise the implications of his statement that 30/- a week was a good wage for a forestry worker.  We all know that, even though food may be dear in Dublin, it is dearer in the rural areas, because the small shopkeeper living a distance from the railway puts on an extra charge for the cartage, which may be over a distance of ten or 12 miles.  There is discontent of which the Taoiseach, from the reports of the Secret Service and the Guards, must be aware.  There never was such discontent as prevails at present.  It <Col N="1305" /> arises not from the fact that these men are not prepared to defend their country, but that the Government which asks them to do so and which asks them to make sacrifices&mdash;and it is the poor who will have to make them&mdash; have not up to the present given them any encouragement or inducement, but that the whole system of government seems to be to attack the poorer sections. We have workers in rural areas with five or six children in receipt of a wage of 30/- a week and the Taoiseach says that the turf might be dearer, if that wage were increased.  Their point, however, is that, whether it be £2 10s. or £3 10s. per ton, they will be unable to buy it out of 30/- a week.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to say anything which might be interpreted as an attack upon the Government in their present position, but we got assurances in September, 1939, and we ask the Taoiseach: &ldquo;How have those assurances been carried out?&rdquo;  If a similar assurance is given to-night, I wonder what will be the future position?</P>
    <P>I am certain the Government realise the seriousness of the position.  If they do not receive, as perhaps some Governments do, information from officials not quite representing the realities of the situation, they must realise that there are people prepared at the present time to advise non-recognition of certain laws.  In September, 1939, the Taoiseach referred to Deputy Murphy and myself as the two irresponsible members of the Party.  Up to the present the responsible members have assured the Taoiseach and others, by statements inside and outside the House, what they are prepared to do should certain events take place.  I am prepared to wait for the main body to decide what they will do.  It will be then time enough for myself and others to say what we are going to do.</P>
    <P>The Government have exercised their powers under those Emergency Orders, and the manner in which they have done so has been referred to by various Deputies in the course of the debate. I am concerned mainly with the men who are in receipt of only 30/- per week, and with the right given to the employer, notwithstanding what the Minister for Supplies may say, to reduce <Col N="1306" /> wages.  Employers have been doing so in many cases, and I think the Government have had evidence of that. Some employers have taken advantage of the existing situation, and they regard the Government as their friends. As regards the Trade Union Bill, the Taoiseach must realise, from the list of members who have voted, that the employers are in favour of the Bill, and are encouraging it in every way.  I am sure it must be very pleasing to the Taoiseach and others to have certain men agreeing with them on a question where they are out to attack working people.</P>
    <P>It is a pity that Bill was brought in. It has evoked considerable criticism and delayed the business of the House for the past fortnight or three weeks. It may be a blessing in disguise, because the Government will realise that the power of the united workers is similar to what it was in 1918-19.  The workers in the Twenty-Six Counties are as united in their opposition to the Emergency Powers (No. 83) Order and the Trade Union Bill as they were to other things in years gone by.  When the emergency arose we were appealed to for the purpose of unity.  That appeal was responded to by all the sections of the people.  An appeal was made yesterday to the Minister for Industry and Commerce and we saw how he responded.  He was asked to postpone the Report Stage of the Trade Union Bill for at least a week.  Notwithstanding that facilities have frequently been given here to the Government, the Minister and the Taoiseach refused to accede to the request to adjourn the further stage of the Bill pending an All-Ireland Labour Conference on the 16th July.  However, the conference will go on and the Bill may be put into operation and the emergency powers will be made effective, but it will be only for a time.</P>
    <P>The Government must take notice of the prevailing discontent if they want to have a continuance of the unity that has existed here and do not want to give some foreigner a chance to take advantage of a disunited people.  The Government should endeavour to meet the wishes of various sections of the people.  They should not take <Col N="1307" /> advantage of an emergency order to attack the lowest paid workers.  On another occasion I will explain how the higher paid workers are being protected by the Government.  The least the Government should do now is to agree to the Labour Party's request.</P>
    <P>The consideration of this Bill is being conducted in a different atmosphere from what we had in 1939.  I am quite certain that whatever a Deputy's views may have been prior to recent happenings in Dublin, he does not now want Ireland to be in the war with one or other of the belligerents.  The Taoiseach must be satisfied that we are on the only course the Irish people require, that all we want is to be allowed to remain strictly neutral.  Our criticisms here must not be interpreted in the sense that we do not want our country to be neutral.  The fact is that we do not want to take one side or the other.  I am one who is critical of the Government both outside and inside the House, but I believe I am voicing the opinions of the people in the Labour movement when I say that, should we be attacked by one or other of the belligerents, notwithstanding the grievances we have and the attack by the Minister for Industry and Commerce on the whole trade union movement, I am certain that the working classes will take up the same attitude as they adopted from 1918 onwards; they will be prepared to unite with other sections of the community in defending the neutrality of our country.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Taoiseach to give the assurances that have been asked in connection with this Bill, that the orders that will be put into operation will not be used as, perhaps, quite unintentionally, they may have been, by officials against the lowest paid workers, the men who get only 30/- a week.  I should like him to reconsider the position in connection with forestry workers.  If he cannot give them higher wages, perhaps he will give them a similar allowance to that made to men working almost beside them on the turf banks or under the Construction Corps&mdash;that is, to give them an allowance of tea while engaged on such necessary work.  It is a small concession <Col N="1308" /> to ask; yet it is one that will be highly appreciated by the men.  I hope in that way we will put an end to some of the propaganda that is going round.</P>
    <P>I trust that in the future we will be enabled in this House to give expression to honest criticism of the Government without having some people interpreting it as an anxiety to put an end to unity and an invitation to outside countries to invade our native land.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Fisheries (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>On the 24th May, 1939, this subject was before the Dáil.  The Dáil agreed to Vote £25,000 on account to the late owners of the Erne fisheries as it was decided that we should compensate those people as the owners under the Act.  It will be remembered that they had been declared as not the owners by the Supreme Court here.  Nevertheless, we thought that they should get compensation as they had purchased the fisheries in good faith, and thought that they had a proper title to the fisheries on that occasion.  I said then that I thought we were not going too far in voting £25,000, because the fishery was purchased in 1869 for £45,000.  In 1926 we had documentary evidence that a one-sixth portion of it was sold for £12,000.  That would mean that it was worth about £70,000 in 1926. That transaction, of course, included the fresh-water fisheries as well as the tidal-water fisheries.  Now, the owners claim that the fresh-water fisheries are <Col N="1310" /> not worth very much, if anything, but, whether they are or not, it does not make any material difference to this particular Estimate, because they would eventually be purchased, and the whole transaction would come up for final settlement at the same time as the tidal-water fisheries and certain fresh-water fisheries.  Some of those people are old, and would naturally like to get whatever amount may be coming to them now, as it is believed that it may be some years before this thing will be finally settled.</P>
      <P>We have gone into this very fully in the Department, and I think that I can safely recommend the Dáil to vote another £6,000.  That is on the understanding, which has been made clear to the owners, that the matter is not to be reopened for another four years&mdash; until the end of 1945.  As I said before, we have to be careful not to set any headline for the arbitrators who may be appointed in connection with the Inland Fishery Act of 1939.  There are certain guiding principles laid down for the arbitrators, but I think we are well within the amount that they may decide to pay.  I do not think we can be accused of setting them any headline by voting £6,000, in addition to the £25,000 already voted, which will make a total of £31,000.  I, therefore, recommend the Estimate to the Dáil.</P>

      <P>These fisheries came to the State as a result of a decision in the Supreme Court, and it has now been determined that morally there is an obligation on the community to compensate the owners, an obligation which is being honoured in these several Estimates and in the Bill. Would the Minister say if it is intended to give the owners interest on the capital sum which they have received and will receive under the Supplementary Estimate for the period between the date of the surrender of the fisheries and the date of the receipt of these compensating sums?</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister has pointed out, many of the people beneficially interested in these fisheries are <Col N="1311" /> elderly.  Now, it may be very nice for them to know that their posterity will ultimately get, under the terms of whatever wills they care to make, a capital sum for compensation in respect of the fisheries.  In the meantime these people have to live.  They are getting no income, whereas formerly they had been enjoying a very substantial income.  On the one hand, I think we are behaving very reasonably in making an <i>ex gratia</i> payment. But there is an old saying that it is &ldquo;a mistake to spoil the ship for a ha'porth of tar,&rdquo; so that if we recognise the equity of their claim, can we not see to do it that we will take such measures as will provide them with an income which will bear some relation to the income they would have been enjoying had this Supreme Court decision never been handed down?  I recognise the complexity of the problem and the difficulty of arriving at a reasonable figure.  I commend the matter to the Minister for his consideration. I have no doubt that if he came before the House with a modest proposal on those lines, he would have little difficulty in convincing the House that it should be passed.  Would it be expedient for the Minister at this stage to say what the future of these other several fisheries in the State is?  I take it that all legal proceedings in regard to the several fisheries are suspended now in view of the Fisheries Act that we passed declaring the titles to be valid, whether in fact they were valid or not, and providing for their acquisition by the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the Deputy's point concerning interest, that will be considered.  I think that between now and the end of 1945 we will hardly be called upon to pay anything further, because the £6,000 spread over four years would represent, at least, the net income which they had from these fisheries before they lost them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Agreed, but the Minister will see at once that he might force those people into spending their capital, which is not very fair.  If it is <Col N="1312" /> meant as a payment which will be ultimately off-set against an agreed sum for interest during the period that those people were waiting for compensation to be assessed, that is all right, but, if it is to be regarded as part of the ultimate capital compensation, I think it is unfair to force those people to spend their capital by depriving them of their income at this time.  However, the Minister, having reviewed the position, might say: &ldquo;I see that we will have to give those people some sum of money at the end of those proceedings in view of the interest they would have drawn on the capital sum had they received it on the date of compulsory acquisition, and this £6,000 that we are now giving them will be first deducted from the interest payable at the end of the negotiations.  If the interest payment does not amount to £6,000, the balance must come out of the capital.&rdquo;  I think that would be reasonable.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The Dáil might have expected, on the occasion of the introduction <Col N="1313" /> of a measure to continue the operation of the Emergency Powers Act of 1939, that we would have been given an account of the number of orders made under that Act, of the general purpose of those orders, of the useful work, if any, that had been accomplished during the period, and of the number of orders that have been made which were of a penal character. Now, apparently, it was not considered advisable to give us that information. But the latest number, according to the Statutory Rules and Orders publications that have been given out, is 91. In Section 2 of the Act, paragraph (a), it is stated that the Government may &ldquo;authorise and provide for the regulation and control by or on behalf of the State of all or any supplies or services essential to the life of the community and...the maintenance and provision of such essential supplies by or on behalf of the State and the provision and operation of such essential services by or on behalf of the State&rdquo;.  It was not until last January that we were generally informed regarding a shortage of supplies, when the Minister for Supplies circularised some members of the Dáil. He sent one of the letters to me, asking that, with the co-operation of the other members of my constituency, we should address farmers on the desirability of growing wheat this year.  That letter to me referred to a borough constituency, and it is fairly obvious that very little practical effect could be given to such a proposal in a place like that, but that was the first occasion that the House or the people generally became aware of the shortage of supplies. This Act had been at that time in operation for some 15, 16 or 17 months, so that, so far as the portion of it which referred to the activities of the Minister, in fulfilling certain essential duties to the community was concerned, it took a period of something like 15 or 17 months to galvanise any sort of life into him in order to make provision for the future.  One is rather forced to the conclusion that when the Government seek co-operation from everybody, they are themselves withholding their co-operation from the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1314" /> It was a great shock to people to learn that there was a shortage, in the first place, of flour and, in the second place, of tea, and then explanations in connection with the petrol situation were very disheartening. Notwithstanding all that, in this House, if one can interpret correctly the speeches that have been made in connection with this measure, there is a general disposition to continue it. In other words, the sense of the House, apparently, is that a measure of this sort must be in the hands of the Government; that it must be there for some Government, and, for the moment, the House is almost prepared to ignore the existence of the immediate personnel of this Government in its opinion that a measure of this sort must be within the power of the Executive here in the special circumstances with which we are faced.</P>
    <P>Now, this week we got two batches of these Emergency Powers Orders. The first one, unfortunately, went into the sieve and it now has been put in its place amongst the others; it is pocketed or parked, but I have to-day's issue, and to-day's issue gives Statutory Rules and Orders No. 257.  Lower down on the page, we have Emergency Powers (Control of Prices) Order No. 81, 1941, which is dated 26th May, and I come to No. 248, 1941, and Emergency Powers Order, No. 85, which is dated 13th May, 1941.  Even in respect of an application such as that, we should have been entitled to have had an explanation for the enlightenment of the House in the first place and of the public in the second place.  This one dealing with the control of prices&mdash; dated 26th May&mdash;fixes the prices for barley, oats, maize, pollard, bran, molasses, meat and bone meal, and fish meal.  An order such as that should be mentioned here in the House by the responsible Minister because it affects such a very large percentage of the community, and information regarding prices is of the utmost importance to them.  Now, we get the printed document to-day, 9th July, although the order concerned is dated 26th May.</P>
    <P>During the last five or six months there have been many criticisms of the exercise of the censorship.  Nobody in <Col N="1315" /> this House objects to the principle of censorship.  I do not propose to spend any time dealing with that particular sphere of activity under this Act, other than to say this: that it appears to have been very foolishly administered. Let us take one case, although I can mention three or four cases.  Some time early this year a foreign bomber came here and dropped some bombs down in the County Carlow in a very unfrequented part of the country, and, naturally, there was a feeling of repugnance and horror on the part of the peace-loving and law-abiding people of this country.  We were not at war, we had not even unfriendly relations with the belligerents.  One of the bishops of this country, in writing to an old friend of his who was a parish priest of the parish where this thing occurred, mentioned the words &ldquo;accursed bombers&rdquo; and these words were too strong for the censor in this country.  What is the meaning of a censorship of that character?</P>
    <P>This war is, perhaps, more ruthless than those that have gone before, but are we not learning a very bad lesson if, as a result of the operations of the censor in this country, it is not within the competence of an ecclesiastic to express his abhorrence in suitable language of a dastardly act against peace-loving, law-abiding citizens, living peaceably in their own homes and sent before their Maker without a word of notice?  Surely, the censorship in this country or in any other country goes beyond its authority, and abuses any authority that it has, if it takes from private citizens the right to give expression to their abhorrence of certain acts by belligerents?  There was a time, prior, perhaps, to this present war, when public opinion throughout the world revolted at the idea of bombing women and children and making war upon civilians, and there was a general acceptance of the idea that war was to be waged between soldiers.  If it so happened that, by reason of unusual circumstances, civilians came within the line of fire during a military operation, there was even an expression of regret from the belligerents on either side regarding the loss of life.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1316" /> I find no justification whatsoever for an autocratic censorship which keeps away from the public mind a proper conception of the judgment that should be passed upon actions such as that. It would be no breach of our neutrality to give expression to our feelings in that connection.  We have the right in our neutral position to have our opinions about those things.  If we pride ourselves on our individuality as a nation and on a higher conception of citizenship than we occasionally express, and if we have regard to what is more priceless to us, our Christianity, surely it is our duty to give expression to our feelings in cases such as this.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mulcahy put a question some time ago regarding the prohibition of the circulation of a book here.  That book dealt with events which took place in one of the countries which has been overrun.  It was not allowed to be circulated here.  What would our opinion be, if from 1916 until the 11th July, 1921, our case was prohibited from getting into any one of those countries at present at war or any other country? Was it not our desire to bring before the peoples of the whole civilised world what our case was?  Is it not the desire of people who are suffering from aggression in any form to let it be known what the condition of affairs is? We would have no objection to a work brought out by those responsible for the aggression in defence of their action, if they had any.  But, at least, let us not add to the sufferings of those unfortunate people by saying that we will not allow anybody to know what is happening within the confines of a territory that at one time was an independent State.</P>
    <P>The third case I wish to mention is this.  Within the last fortnight statements made by Deputies in this House were prohibited from appearing in the Press.  I am not standing over those statements.  I am indifferent as to what they were, but this is a Parliament in which these Deputies are public representatives.  We may disagree with what they said, but the people are entitled, and these Deputies are entitled, by reason of their representative position, to have what they said published, particularly in regard <Col N="1317" /> to an economic question which is at present agitating the minds of the people.  Surely they are placed in an impossible position if one of their constituents, one of their active supporters, questions them with regard to what they said or did on a piece of legislation introduced here and says, &ldquo;Whatever you said on that, it did not appear in the Press; the Press must not have thought anything of it.&rdquo; They have to go to the trouble of bringing forward the official report in a matter of that sort.  A Deputy ought to be allowed in a matter of that kind to have whatever he may say published in the Press alongside what a Minister says.</P>
    <P>Let us see what happened in a fourth case.  Last evening, Deputy O'Sullivan addressed the House on this matter, not for a very long time.  A very fair report of his speech was given on the radio, pretty much what he said, but in a condensed form.  But it was mainly because he was opposing the amendment and supporting the measure that he was reported on the radio.  If that is to be the standard of what is allowed to appear in the Press or to be given on the radio, then there is an end to liberty in this country.  It is unfortunate that there is such a narrow-minded conception of justice in this country, that any individual in the State can regulate what is to appear when Deputies speak in this House and that it is only when supporting a Government measure that a Deputy is likely to get a full report.</P>
    <P>This measure came before the House two years ago.  It was to the credit of the Dáil that Deputies almost vied with one another in their acceptance of the principle of that measure.  What has happened since?  Seldom has a measure got such criticism as this has got during the last two days.  When Deputy Costello mentioned that it was strange that the phrase &ldquo;in the opinion of the Government, it is necessary and expedient for securing the public safety&rdquo;, did not preface some of the orders, the remark was made from the benches opposite: &ldquo;If that were done, the order would be found faulty.&rdquo;  Mind you, that is the prime <Col N="1318" /> consideration; that should be the governing principle.  If more is wanted, and a case is made for it, this House is still in a generous mood, not by reason of anything that has happened during the period, but by reason of its conception of the general situation and the conviction that, no matter what Government is here, it must have those powers.  If the Government make a case for other powers, we are prepared to consider that case. In view of what has happened up to this, it is unlikely that if a case were made it would not be conceded.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to the Emergency Powers (No. 83) Order.  In my view, for what it is worth, it was never the intention of anybody in this House that such an order should be issued under the powers conferred by this Act.  I am prepared to concede that some provision might be necessary, but certainly not in that form. What have they done in Northern Ireland and across the water in regard to this matter?  My information is that, if an application is made for an increase of wages, or an alteration in conditions of working, it has to come before the Minister, and the Minister, in his discretion, decides whether or not it is a proper matter for consideration. If it is considered a proper matter for consideration it is submitted to arbitration.  If it is not, there is no more about it.  There is no such provision, so far as this order is concerned. We have a penal order which, it is evident, was made by persons inexperienced in the exercise of authority and inexperienced in business matters.</P>
    <P>When we go further and see what happened about this order, we are still more amazed.  The order was first mentioned by the Minister for Finance when introducing the Budget.  So far as one could judge, it was taken by him to be a corollary to the penal provisions that he was introducing in his Budget, the new impositions on business, the excess profits tax, the corporation profits tax and the increase in income-tax.  Having made those charges in respect of one section of the community, he said there is also another, and this is an order the Government is bringing in to prevent any <Col N="1319" /> increase in wages or in salaries.  I seldom read what transpires in the Seanad, but I did read a good deal of the debate which took place in that House on this order.  In the course of his statement there, the Minister for Industry and Commerce said that some 10,000 persons had, since the commencement of this emergency, applied for and obtained increases in wages varying from 5/- to 13/- weekly, and that a still greater number had applied for and obtained increases varying from 2/- to 5/- weekly, that he was satisfied that these increases in wages were reflected in the costs of production, that they increased the cost of the articles which were in production by these people to the consumer, that they had added to the cost of living and that the Government were determinded and had decided not to allow a vicious spiral.</P>
    <P>Wage increases of 5/- to 13/- weekly to 10,000 persons, and of 2/- to 5/-weekly to, let us say, 20,000 persons&mdash; a total in extra expenditure, so far as the community is concerned, of under £400,000 annually.  One wonders that a Minister of this State did not suffer from a slight shock when he spoke of an extra £400,000 annually, when, since this emergency began, the Government's impositions on the people amount to at least five times that amount in each of the two years.  If we were to repeat what happened on a celebrated occasion, and to write down the deficiencies of the Minister, on one side, and, on the opposite side, the few extra shillings those people got, even the Government would be astonished by it, if it is still possible to astonish them.  The method of dealing with that situation was far better both in Northern Ireland and Great Britain. One wonders why was it not followed when they followed so carefully many of the other regulations enforced over there.</P>
    <P>Occasionally people have taken to themselves the privilege of dealing with what is needed in this country, and what should be done to improve the situation, to inspire more public confidence and so on.  Even the Taoiseach on one occasion, and the Minister for <Col N="1320" /> Supplies on another occasion, gave expression to their views regarding what some people call a coalition Government and, other people, a national Government.  A national Government or a coalition Government in this country is an impossibility.  Everybody who talks about it ought to know that there is a different language spoken, there is a different conception of civic duty and civic responsibility on the two sides of this House, and that this is not the time when we should accentuate those differences or magnify whatever criticisms we have to make of each other.  It ought to be finished and done with, once and for all.  There can be no coalition Government and no national Government in this country in present circumstances, and there is no reservation with regard to present circumstances.  We are in absolute and entire disagreement with the Government regarding the manner in which they have handled this situation from the beginning, and let there be no misunderstanding about it.</P>
    <P>It is not to-day, nor yesterday, when spoken to as regards any possibility of belligerency or hostilities on the Continent, that I said to everybody who came here from any country that we could not participate in any war for two very good reasons, if there were no others: Firstly, we had not the men, and, secondly, we had not the money. I could add many other reasons to those since, so let us not have any more of the kind of nonsense talked by Deputy Kennedy here this evening.  If there is any hope for the future of this country, it lies in the conception of patriotism and in the conviction of nationality which there is on this side.  So far as this measure is concerned, I can see no justification for withholding it.  I see no satisfaction in getting an undertaking from a Government which have abused the powers they got in the last 12 months.  Now, if they like, let them give that out on the radio.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That the Dáil should be critical and very careful in handing over the powers in this measure is very natural.  I think it is right.  I am not surprised at all, therefore, that there has been criticism of the Government <Col N="1321" /> in the exercise of its powers.  All I expected was that there would be some attempt to keep close to the facts and avoid exaggeration which does harm to the case put forward.  If anybody reads some of the speeches made on this measure and does not completely discount the exaggerations in the charges, he will think that we were living in an extraordinary world.  We are living, I know, in an extraordinary world from many points of view, but it is very extraordinary that every day one opens the paper, one sees constant criticisms of the Government, while we hear from speakers on the Opposition Benches that the Government is exercising its power of censorship to cut out completely all criticism of the Government.  The very speakers themselves contradicted themselves in their statements about it.  Obviously, they cannot have it both ways.  They cannot say that everybody is criticising the Government, that the newspapers are criticising the Government, and, in the same breath, say that the Government is abusing its powers of censorship, by preventing criticism of the Government. That, however, is by the way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us go back to the main idea.  I, for one, am very sorry that powers like these have to be assumed by the Government.  I do believe that the criticism which a measure receives here is all to the good.  We may not agree with it and we may not ultimately be impressed by the arguments.  Those responsible for bringing forward the measure, having heard the arguments on one side, may decide that the arguments on the other side are better and that, notwithstanding the arguments of the other side, the measure should take a particular form; but one is much happier&mdash;at least I always was, and I am sure that all the other Ministers were also happier&mdash;that the measure had to run the gauntlet of criticism by representatives of the people, not merely in their representative capacity as speaking for a body of people, but as individual citizens, as members of a jury, so to speak, and I want to say that I am in full agreement with those who hold that this body is more competent to judge what is in the general interests of the <Col N="1322" /> people than any group of civil servants or officials.</P>
    <P>If it were possible to bring all these measures which have now been issued in the form of orders before the Dáil and to give them the complete criticism which ordinary Bills get, I should be very much happier and it would be very much better for the country.  There is not the slightest doubt that, if it were possible, some of the hardships which follow some of these measures might possibly be mitigated and some avoided by amendment of one kind or another. But we are dealing with a situation in which that is not possible.  To listen to some of the speeches, one would think the Dáil had been prorogued or had been on vacation all this time, or that nothing was being done when the Dáil was in session.</P>
    <P>I asked for particulars as to the number of days the Dáil has sat since the war began, and the number of days it has sat in the corresponding period of the two years before the war.  What do I find?  I find in the period before the war, from 3rd September, 1937, to 9th July, 1939, the Dáil sat on 120 days. In the period, 3rd September, 1939, to the 9th July, 1941, the Dáil sat on 118 days.  That indicates that there is a difference of only two days between the number of days the Dáil sat during this period of extraordinary anxiety for the Government and the people, and the period before the war.  Was the Dáil idle during all this time?  Is it possible that we could have crammed into that period 97 Governmental orders that have been issued?  I do not think it would have been possible.  Apart altogether from the need of swift action, there is the practical impossibility of giving to those measures which are necessary the full discussion which we give to Bills.</P>
    <P>One of the measures particularly criticised in this regard is Order No. 83.  I am quite willing to concede that, under ordinary circumstances, if such a measure was in contemplation, it would have been very much better to have it before the Dáil subject to criticism, the arguments and reasons for it being put forward, and the necessary publicity given by those arguments and views, so that the people would understand <Col N="1323" /> why this thing was being done. I am quite willing to admit to anyone who charges me with it, that one of the things we have not done sufficiently was to give adequate information to the people with regard to orders and other things of that sort.  I have only one excuse to offer, and that is that it has been a time of tremendous pressure, and if you were going to do that you would have to set up a special staff.  You cannot put work of that sort into junior hands; you have to put that into the hands of people competent to deal properly with it, and it does mean setting up, in effect, practically a special department.  The ordinary Information Bureau, with its small staff, could not handle it.</P>
    <P>It is true that some of the complaints we hear are complaints which are due to the fact that the people do not thoroughly and completely understand the situation in which we find ourselves and the reasons for some of the measures which have been taken.  With regard to the measures that have been taken, why they were taken has been explained more than once, but that is not sufficient.  We know our people, and we know that not everybody reads the newspapers or listens to the radio. These people are affected in their lives by these particular orders, and it is important that the people should understand why they are suffering certain disabilities.  The truth is that our people, notwithstanding there have been two years of this war, do not yet understand the peril in which this nation stands, both from the point of view of the possibility of physical military attack and from the point of view of the hardships we are going to suffer here before this war ends.</P>
    <P>This coming winter is a time which I look forward to with the greatest apprehension for all the people and the reason is, in the main, that we are cut off largely from the source of supply which we formerly had.  That is a fact which our people must thoroughly understand, that the raw materials and other materials which we got in the past, mainly through one channel, are being, for one reason or another, through the war circumstances <Col N="1324" /> obtaining in that country, cut off from us.  Therefore we have been driven largely to depend upon ourselves. Anything that this Government or any other Government could do will not be sufficient to save our people from suffering some of those hardships.  All the Government can do is to try to make it possible for our people to get the primary essentials, and even that is going to be a very difficult task.</P>
    <P>I have admitted, as fully as it is possible to admit it, that I and the Government regard it as a misfortune that we have to legislate, because it is undoubtedly legislation&mdash;it is temporary legislation, no doubt&mdash;by a form of decree, but nearly every one of the speakers, no matter how much they have been opposed to our exercise of them, have in the long run admitted that these powers are necessary.</P>
    <P>I have been asked for assurances.  I can give no assurance that in the future, as long as these powers are in our hands, we will use them otherwise than we have used them.  I deny that we have abused them.  There have been one or two cases, and the Methodist Church was one, in which it is true that there may have been a tendency to use these powers in a way which was not anticipated.  In that particular case it was because it was urgent and also, I must say, because I felt that it was a matter in which, if it did go to the Dáil, there would not have been any question of disagreement about it.  One might say: &ldquo;Very well, why do you not bring in a short Bill and get it passed through all stages quickly?&rdquo;  Perhaps that was one way of doing it.  But there was the other question of the pressure of public business and I did not think it was going to be raised as one of the cases in which the Government had exceeded its powers.</P>
    <P>I have another admission to make, and that is, that it is natural that Ministers and Departments should be inclined to take the quick way, the ready way, of getting what they want done, and this tendency ought to be resisted.  I agree fully that everything we can do to avoid that, we should do. I believe it is better for the country <Col N="1325" /> to do it.  I can give no assurances. There was no desire to abuse these powers.  I deny utterly and absolutely that the censorship has been used for a Party purpose.</P>

      <P>The censorship has been used for one purpose and that is to try to safeguard the national position in this time of crisis.  We have here a choice of evils.  I am admitting that the powers in themselves, if taken in a certain sense, would be an evil, but you are in the position that you have either to tie the hands of the Government down or to give them the necessary powers.  Either course means the evil that I have pointed out.  You have the same thing in regard to censorship.  You can either have no censorship or have a narrow censorship confined, for instance, to military secrets.  If you had that narrow censorship, what would the position be here?  Do we not all know perfectly well that in this country, as probably in every other country, you have on the one hand a group that strongly feels with one set of belligerents, another group that feels strongly with the other set of belligerents, and in between the two groups you have the great mass of the people who stand definitely for the policy which this Parliament stands for, and I say absolutely this Parliament, and not merely the Government.  No matter what views have been expressed here by individual Deputies, not one has stood up and said that the policy that we have adopted is not the policy of the people.

      <P>If there is one thing that we want at the present time it is a proper understanding, both amongst ourselves and amongst the people as a whole, that this Parliament does represent the national view and that there is no difference.  If there was a vote taken to-morrow in this Parliament, I do not believe there is a single Deputy who would go into the Opposition Lobbies from the point of view of saying that we should change our policy.  That is the test.</P>
      <P>If the test were applied as to whether this Parliament and this nation should change its policy, I do not believe there is a single Deputy in the House who would go into the Opposition Lobbies to say that it should.  Now I think that is of tremendous use.  It prevents the suggestion being made that this is the national policy of a group or of a faction.  It is, at any rate, the policy of this part of the Irish nation in the Twenty-Six Counties, and there is no question about it.  There has been no question about it since it was announced.  If there is one thing known about this nation at the present time it is the fact that it has adopted a policy of neutrality, and that it has organised itself, with whatever means it has at its disposal, to defend itself against attack coming from any quarter whatsoever.  That is a universal statement covering all the belligerents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That view is known to every State that has a representative here, and it is known to every State where we are represented, and, therefore, when I am asked: how is it possible that something different should be thought elsewhere I can only say that I do not know, that I cannot understand it, and <Col N="1327" /> that, naturally, I take the ordinary means of trying to see how such a misunderstanding could possibly have arisen.  I would much prefer to see this left to be settled in the ordinary way so that it should not become a matter of public controversy here.  That is the only reason why there was any unwillingness on our part to discuss it. I do not want to go into it further. I believe that the Deputies understand what the position is.  One of the Deputies who spoke this evening put the position very well when he said that the fact that we are neutral in this war, and that we have adopted the policy of neutrality, does not fit in with the policy and with the position of the two nations with which we have been most closely associated in business and otherwise in the past.  That is the position, and nothing that we can do, so long as we maintain that position, can alter that.</P>
    <P>I do not want to go into the merits of the various orders that were mentioned here, but a few things stand out. There was a suggestion about blacksmith's coal.  I suppose that would be regarded as coal for industrial purposes. Permits for coal for industrial purposes can be secured.</P>

      <P>That is what I understand, that there are permits for coal for industrial purposes.  I suggest to the Deputy that, if he gets in touch with the Department concerned, the matter will be looked into or else he will be given a reason why he was refused.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We have here an example of the service that Deputies can render to the community.  They are in touch with things that might easily escape official cognisance at the centre of control.  Deputies are in a position to bring matters of this kind to the notice of the Departments concerned. It is, I think, one of the great services <Col N="1328" /> that Deputies throughout the country render to the community.  When we were in opposition it was our experience that, when Deputies went to the Minister or the Department concerned with regard to a particular case, in which it appeared that by some oversight an individual was being severely hit, the circumstances of the case were examined, and if a remedy could, within the law, be found, the remedy was attempted anyhow.  That is the position to-day.  Therefore, if Deputies find, in regard to orders of this kind, that something of the kind they mentioned has happened, one of the services they can render to the community is to bring it to the notice of the Government.  The Government only regards itself as the Executive for the community, so that one of the services which they can render to the Executive is to point these things out.  That is one of the values of a Parliament like ours.  I have always stated my belief in a representative institution like this. It has a lot of disadvantages; there is the necessary evil of Party controversy, if you like, when you would like to have a greater amount of unity, but, in the long run, and taking it over a long period, I believe that this form of representative Government is the best for us anyhow.  The more it is given an opportunity of playing its part properly, the better for our country. As I am on that subject, I have never been a party to any attacks on the character of the Assembly here.  We do not agree.  That is true.  People in the country have their different views. There are different interests in the country, and people are naturally anxious to safeguard their individual interests.  The only thing we do want in the end is that, when we have our controversies over and when a decision has been taken in a regular manner in accordance with the Constitution, there should then be acceptance of the law as it is made.  I think Deputy Corish, and Deputy Norton if he were present, would not in sober afterthought think that any harm was done them in suppressing their particular incitement. It was done by the censor in the general way, trying to prevent, at a time like the present, incitements of that kind coming from people who <Col N="1329" /> occupy responsible positions.  As I said earlier about the censorship&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>We must remember in regard to all those things that all human instruments are fallible, and in any case, even though they are right, they cannot satisfy all Parties.  I want to say this: I have heard criticism of the censorship here, and I am absolutely convinced that the firm and, if you like, inclined to be rigid attitude of the censor in dealing with all those things has been fair, has been scrupulously fair between Parties, and has saved us from a great deal of evil.  You must either have a rigid clean-cut censorship or you cannot have any at all.  There is no half-way house in this.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course I know that Deputies on the opposite side will not agree at times with the judgment we will have to pass.  When I say &ldquo;we&rdquo;, I take responsibility, and also the Minister for the Co-ordination of Defensive Measures takes responsibility, for the acts of the censor.  It is our business to see that the censorship is impartially carried on.  Occasionally I have been asked to express my opinion with regard to a particular matter which was before the censorship. I do not say that if there were other people in my place they would have taken exactly the same view. Deputy Cosgrave has given an instance of the use of the word &ldquo;accursed&rdquo;. If that is a complete picture, I can see his point of view, but I can see, in other circumstances, a person taking another point of view.  If we did not have that censorship we would have, on the one hand, one group.  We know there does exist a group which thinks that this country should not be neutral; <Col N="1330" /> a group which thinks that we should go into this war on one side.  They would naturally want to have propaganda in order to try to prepare public opinion for their point of view.  Immediately that happened, you would have propaganda by people who wanted to go in the completely opposite direction.  If you stopped one and did not stop the other, then where were you?  The task of censorship is a desperately difficult task, and one of the reasons, perhaps, which has led to its being of a rather rigid type is the fact that by having definite rules which are followed rigidly, you get fair play all round.  You do not give an opportunity to any person really to make a case about unfairness.  But, if you were to lean to one side and say: &ldquo;I think I will let that go&rdquo;, and on the other side you were to say: &ldquo;I wonder is that as bad as the thing I let go on the other side?&rdquo;, the result would be that you would get nowhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Notwithstanding all that has been said about censorship, I do believe that this country owes a debt of gratitude to the people who are in charge, seeing that after practically two years of this war&mdash;naturally with people's feelings in one way or the other being influenced by events&mdash;we are still outside the actual physical conflict.  I think that we ought really to be satisfied from that point of view.  I admit, fully admit, that inasmuch as the ultimate last word about the censorship lies with the Government here, as it does in a number of other things, there is naturally a suspicion on the part of people on the opposite benches that, in regard to some particular question, self would be put in the balance, that the interests of the Government would be put in the balance, and that, therefore, either consciously or unconsciously, the decision would be weighted on the Government side.  I understand those suspicions perfectly well, but I do believe, notwithstanding the exaggerated statements which have been made here, that if Deputies do go into it, and take it by and large, they will find that, over a period of 12 months, the censors have done their work well.  They have done what they were set up to do&mdash;to try to keep this country on a reasonably level keel, to <Col N="1331" /> keep the particular groups within the country from getting super-heated, as they would immediately get if one group got ahead with its particular propaganda and the other group with its propaganda.</P>
    <P>There will be a number of other occasions on which it is certain that I will have to speak during this coming week&mdash;on the Taoiseach's Vote, the Vote for External Affairs, and so on.  Therefore, I think I can leave the present Bill with that much, and not tire the House too much.  I ask the House to extend that measure for another year. I do wish&mdash;it is a wish; I am afraid I can hardly put it as a hope&mdash;that long before that we could dispense with it. I must add that I do not see any great likelihood of it.  My fear is that we are going to face a prolonged and difficult situation; a situation that will become increasingly difficult from day to-day.  In the situation in which we find ourselves, and in view of the difficulties which have to be surmounted by the community and the Government, I would ask the House not to exaggerate in dealing with those matters.  Their criticism will be much more effective, it will have much more weight, and be much more valuable from every point of view, if it is direct and simple, without exaggeration. I have no doubt whatever in my own mind that the Government has used those powers consciously for one purpose only, and that is for the public good.</P>

    <P>That a sum, not exceeding £9,167, be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending the 31st day of March, 1942, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Department of the Taoiseach (No. 16 of 1924; No. 40 of 1937; and No. 38 of 1938).</P>
    <P>As Deputies are aware, a sum of £4,600 has already been granted for this service by means of the Vote on Account.  The amount now asked for is required to complete the total of £13,767 which is the estimated expenditure for the current financial year. Last year's Estimate was for a total sum of £14,577, and there is thus a decrease of £810.  This decrease occurs entirely in sub-head A (Salaries, etc.), and is mainly due to the fact that the duties of Director of the Government Information Bureau are now being performed by an officer on loan from the broadcasting service, whose salary is borne on the Vote for Wireless Broadcasting.  The sums provided under sub-heads B, C, D and E are the same as in 1940-41.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Estimate be referred back for reconsideration. Less than two years ago the Taoiseach, acting in his capacity as head of the Government, made arrangements for certain changes in the Ministry, and I contend that the changes then made have not been justified; that the majority of the members of the Ministry have not been doing their work efficiently as heads of the various Government Departments.  If an increasing number of people in this country are of the opinion that this Parliament is not doing its work efficiently, in my opinion it is because certain members of the Ministry are incompetent and unfit for their positions. It is also due to the fact that a fairly high percentage of Deputies, particularly of the Government Party, do not deem it necessary to attend this House as often as they should to discharge their duties as representatives <Col N="1336" /> of the people and to assist the members of the Ministry to do their work better than they have been doing it up to the present.</P>
      <P>Speaking to his constituents recently at a meeting in Ennis, the Taoiseach said that we can agree to differ; that differences of opinion can exist between the different Parties in this House on questions of social and economic policy.  On other occasions in this House and outside, the Taoiseach has invited representatives of the different Parties to consult, advise and assist the Government in the discharge of their duties, and to co-operate with the Government in every possible way, especially on the question of national defence.  He has admitted this evening that co-operation in the matter of defence has been given, not alone by every Party but by every Deputy, in a whole-hearted manner.  If we are to co-operate in the most effective way with the Government in doing their duty on behalf of the citizens, the representatives in this House, regardless of Party, are entitled to all the information at the disposal of the Government or Ministers who are heads of the different Departments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On several occasions during the past few years, and particularly since the emergency arose, information has been denied to Deputies in connection with matters that would not in any way endanger the neutrality of the State.  Questions have been addressed to different Ministers by Deputies on this side of the House and by Deputies of the chief Opposition Party asking for information of a purely internal nature having a direct bearing on the welfare of the community, and having nothing whatever to do with external affairs.  In some cases that information has been refused on the alleged ground that it would not be in the public interest to disclose the information. In other and more recent cases, Ministers have departed from that excuse and said that it was not in the interests of economy to give the information, that it would cost too much to supply the information asked for.  I make the case that, if Deputies are expected to do their duty in submitting proposals for the good <Col N="1337" /> government of this country and criticising the work of the Government in a constructive way, they must have at their disposal all the information which members of the Government Party have access to.  I see no reason why Deputies should not be given any information which is in the possession of Ministers, and which, previous to the emergency, was normally supplied to Deputies whenever it was required.</P>
    <P>Shortly after this Government came into office, the members sitting on this side of the House had every reason to hope from promises previously made that the plans which the Government said were in existence for the solution of the unemployment problem and other problems confronting the country at the time would be put into operation.  As against that, the Ministry, shortly after their election in 1933 particularly, proceeded to set up a number of commissions and tribunals for the purpose of giving them the information and advice which we understood they had in their possession previous to their coming into office. One of the most important commissions set up by this Government, or by their predecessors, was the Banking Commission, which sat for four years.  It is now four-and-a-half years since the reports of that commission were made public and circulated to Deputies, but up to the present the Minister for Finance has been unable to make a policy pronouncement arising out of them.  The solution of the problem of unemployment and every other problem confronting the Government and the people of this country is bound up with the financial policy of the Government, and, after nine years of consideration, it is time the Minister for Finance was able to make a policy pronouncement, arising out of these reports.  If the Minister is not able to make such a pronouncement, I am taking advantage of this opportunity to invite the head of the Government to do so.  If the Minister is unable to make up his mind on the matters raised by the various reports on banking matters submitted to the Government, over four and a half years ago, I seriously suggest that he is quite an unfit person to hold the position of Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1338" /> Over two years ago, on 7th December, 1938, the then Minister for Industry and Commerce came to the House and invited Deputies to agree to the establishment of a transport tribunal.  In doing so, he stated quite plainly and deliberately that the matters to be submitted to the tribunal were matters of urgent public importance.  He stated that the transport industry was in a chaotic condition and financially bankrupt, and that the position was so serious that he expected the tribunal to bring in a report inside two months. He promised in that speech that amending legislation would have to be introduced and passed as a result of whatever report was made.  Not alone has no action been taken to regularise the position of the transport industry, to put the industry on a firm financial foundation, to cut out the wastage which has been going on over a long period, but the members of the House, notwithstanding the promise made by the Minister for Finance about six weeks ago, have not yet been furnished with the report, which has been in the hands of the Minister concerned for nearly three years.  How, therefore, can members of the Opposition Party, or of the Government Party, who are not given access to the reports issued by tribunals set up at the public expense, discharge their duties as Deputies in an efficient manner or submit constructive proposals for the consideration of Ministers?</P>
    <P>Several years ago, the then Minister for Finance set up a Drainage Commission. That body sat for a couple of years and submitted their report to the Minister in October last.  The report was circulated during the past few weeks, but we have not yet heard what the Government proposes to do arising out of the recommendations of that very important commission.  The solution of the greatest problem confronting this country, unemployment, is bound up very definitely with Government policy arising out of the reports of the Banking Commission and, to a great extent, a large number of persons at present on the unemployment register can be found employment, if a progressive policy is announced in connection with the difficulties associated <Col N="1339" /> with the solution of the transport, drainage and other problems.  If the transport industry is to be modernised, is to be put on a sound financial foundation, is to do its duty towards the citizens of this State, I say that a large number of our unemployed can be found useful employment in the carrying out of that process.  The same can be said to a far greater extent&mdash; and I am sure the Taoiseach will agree &mdash;of drainage, and very large numbers of our unemployed can be put at useful and necessary work, if the recommendations of the Drainage Commission are put into operation.</P>
    <P>It is impossible for Deputies who are desirous of doing their work as efficiently as they can to comply with the wishes of the Taoiseach and his colleagues unless they get the information which the representatives of the people are entitled to get and unless they have access to the reports of the different commissions and tribunals set up by vote of the House.  I could refer to a number of other commissions, the reports of which have been circulated in recent times, but on which no action of any kind has so far been taken.  If the Government, in setting up these commissions, were desirous merely of getting a certain number of people to continue talking, while the Government are not even thinking&mdash;in other words, if it is their desire that time should be wasted and the taxpayers' money squandered&mdash;it is all right, but I take it that that is not their desire or their wish.  If that is so, I think the reports of any tribunals not circulated so far should be furnished without further delay, and an early announcement made by the Government as to what they intend to do arising out of them.</P>
    <P>In November of last year Deputies of this Party tabled a motion asking the Government to set up a commission to submit proposals for the solution of the unemployment problem, and it was so worded as to request the commission to furnish its report inside six months.  The Government at the time tabled an amendment to the motion, which was passed, agreeing to the establishment of a commission for the purpose of dealing with the unemployment <Col N="1340" /> problem, but not stipulating, as did the Labour motion, that the report should be issued inside six months.  To-day I addressed a question to the Minister for Industry and Commerce as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;To ask the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether it is intended to give effect to the decision of Dáil Eireann expressed in a resolution adopted by the House on December 12th, 1940, that the Government should appoint a commission to inquire into and report upon the extent, cause and incidence of unemployment, and, if so, whether he will state the cause of the delay in doing so and the steps in contemplation now for the purpose of implementing the decision in question.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I was amazed to receive this reply from the Minister:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The terms of reference of this commission are in course of preparation and it is hoped that the commission will be duly appointed in the near future.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>The terms of reference of a commission which the Government agreed to set up on December 12th of last year are still in course of preparation and not yet agreed upon, and, so far as I know, nobody has been invited to act upon the proposed commission. If it takes the Minister for Industry and Commerce seven months to consider and prepare&mdash;he had to admit to-day that he has not yet completed the preparation&mdash;the terms of reference for an unemployment commission which the Government last December agreed to set up, then the Minister, for that reason alone, is unfit to hold his position, and some other person should be found by the Taoiseach who will, in an important matter of this kind, do the work more expeditiously than the Minister, who is apparently unwilling or unable to do it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach has repeatedly appealed to Deputies to co-operate with the Government in the solution of the very difficult problems that are confronting the country, but it appears to <Col N="1341" /> me, from my limited knowledge, some of it inside knowledge, of dealings with the present Minister, that that co-operation is always asked and expected on the condition that you will allow the Government to do what they please, or to do nothing at all if they so wish. There is no plan before this country for dealing with the issues arising out of the emergency; there is no plan for the critical position which we all know will confront the citizens during the coming winter.  Notwithstanding the position that exists, we are told by the Minister for Industry and Commerce that he is not able to prepare or get approval for the terms of reference of the unemployment commission.</P>
    <P>During the past year or two many questions have been asked in connection with matters arising in the country. Every Deputy who has been actively doing his duty has had the experience of sending communications to Government Departments, particularly to the Board of Works, for the purpose of getting sanction for small grants for the making of bog roads and the carrying out of very necessary works of public utility.  I have repeatedly received communications from the Board of Works stating that, although these undertakings are regarded as essential, the necessary money to carry them out was not available.  I have in mind minor relief schemes in the rural portions of the country.</P>
    <P>We were informed by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance during the Budget discussion that £500,000 had been returned to the Exchequer because suitable schemes could not be found upon which to spend it.  Is there any Deputy who has not submitted minor relief schemes, such as bog road repair work and bog drainage schemes, only to find them turned down?  Now, when there is a fuel drive, it is suggested that the requisite number of men cannot be found to repair bog roads in order to get out the fuel that will be so urgently required during the winter.</P>
    <P>We are sometimes told that there is no difficulty in getting money for schemes of a useful nature upon which numbers of men can be employed.  I know from personal experience that <Col N="1342" /> there is no difficulty in getting money to buy guns, bombs, and bayonets, and the other articles and implements of destruction which make up our defence machine.  The Taoiseach sees to it, and I suppose it is part of his duty, that whatever amount is required, be it thousands or millions of pounds, it will be found by the bankers and the moneylenders for the building up of our defence services.  But, when it comes to getting a small grant for a minor relief scheme, you can carry on correspondence for a long period, and eventually get the reply that there is only so much money available for each county, and that that sum has already been exceeded, although it is admitted by the Department that these minor works are necessary and would give useful employment.</P>
    <P>The most serious thing that confronts us is unemployment, due largely to the failure of certain Ministers to do their duty since the emergency arose.  This evening we had a statement from the Taoiseach in connection with the position which has arisen as a result of the cutting off of the supply of raw materials.  Is the Taoiseach aware that close on 2,000 industrial concerns failed to get the necessary supply of raw materials during the past year because they had not financial backing either from the banks or State guarantees to enable them to do so?  I have been allowed to read correspondence between the representatives of a very big industrial federation and the Minister for Supplies and the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  In one communication addressed to the Minister for Supplies within the last 12 months, a request was made for the reception of a deputation in order to enable representatives of the industrialists to satisfy the Minister that they were not in a position to get the necessary raw materials without backing from the banks or State guarantees.</P>
    <P>I remember listening to a discussion in the House in September, 1939, when the Emergency Powers Bill was being debated, and Deputies were certainly left under the impression that every possible assistance would be given to industrialists to enable them to secure a reasonable supply of raw materials <Col N="1343" /> or get sufficient supplies to carry them on over the period of the emergency. Does the Taoiseach know that close on 200 industrial concerns failed to get raw materials because of the lack of financial backing by the banks or State guarantees, backing which has been given by Governments of every country under similar circumstances?  I had a discussion recently with representatives of industrial concerns in my own constituency arising out of short-time working and the reduction of persons employed in at least two concerns.  One of the concerns in normal times was giving employment to 630 persons. They failed to get the necessary supply of raw materials, and less than half the number of workers who would normally be employed are now obliged to work every second week.</P>

      <P>This particular concern was in a position at a certain period to get supplies of wool tops, the raw materials which are required for these industrial concerns, if it could get State assistance or the necessary facilities from its own bankers.  I am informed, and I invite the Taoiseach to contradict my statement if he can do so, that the woollen and worsted people in this country could have got a surplus of 1,000,000 wool tops in the year 1940 if they had been able to get the necessary financial facilities to enable them to buy and pay for them.  I understand that the allocation for all these industrial concerns for the current year is only 885,000 wool tops, while a surplus of 1,000,000 wool tops was left on the hands of the British Wool Control Board last year.  To-day between 2,000 and 3,000 workers in the woollen and worsted industry in this country are either out of employment altogether, or are only working part time, as a result of the failure of the Minister for Supplies and of the Minister for Industry and Commerce to do their job, and as a result of the failure of the Government to give these industrial concerns the necessary financial assistance which they should have been given in the period of the emergency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An announcement appears in to-day's <Col N="1344" /> newspapers from the principal transport concern in the country to the effect that, as it is impossible for it to get the necessary coal supplies, it will be obliged to cut down passenger train services almost immediately, and in the near future services which are much more essential in so far as transport is concerned.  Will the Taoiseach say whether any representations have been made by this concern&mdash;the Great Southern Railways Company&mdash;for financial facilities to enable it to purchase sufficient supplies of coal to carry it over the emergency period, and if so whether these facilities were refused?  I am not in a position to state definitely that such an application was made, but whether it was or not, it is evident to those who know the directors of that company that four out of seven are also directors of some of our principal Irish banks.  It would be an amazing thing if the majority of the directors of the railway company, who are also directors of the Bank of Ireland mainly, and of other banking concerns, could not arrange the necessary financial facilities for our principal transport company of which, as I have said, they are also directors, to enable it to buy a reasonable supply of coal to carry it over the emergency.  If they were not able to do that, then I take it their duty was to make the position on that matter known to the Government.</P>
    <P>I am very anxious to know from the Taoiseach if an application for such financial facilities was made by the Great Southern Railways Company during the past 12 months, and if so whether it was refused.  It strikes me, speaking with some limited knowledge of the operating side of the railways of this country, as being rather peculiar if the principal transport company in the Twenty-Six Counties could not get a reasonable supply of coal to carry it over the present period, while the Great Northern Railway Company could have a ten times greater supply in its possession at the present time than the Great Southern Company has.  I wonder how the Great Northern were able to make arrangements to get a 22- or a 23-weeks' supply <Col N="1345" /> while the Great Southern has only a two or at most a three weeks' supply to enable it to carry on essential transport services in this country.  There must be something radically wrong behind the scenes.  Otherwise, we would not have our principal transport company making the announcement, which we all read in the papers this morning.  I take it that it was made with the approval of the Department of Industry and Commerce and of the Department of Supplies.  Would the Taoiseach tell us how he thinks the fuel which will be required by the citizens of Dublin during the coming winter is going to be got here if our principal transport concern is to be paralysed because of the shortage of coal?</P>
    <P>When the Transport Bill of 1933 was going through the Dáil, we on this side advocated, as an alternative to the policy of the Government enshrined in that Bill, a policy of State ownership or of public ownership, a policy which had been previously advocated by the present Minister for Supplies when sitting on the Opposition Benches.  As a last resort, we advocated that the Government should have a nominee on the Board of the Great Southern Railways Company.  It is not yet too late for the Government to take that step. It would enable the Government to be more fully informed than I understand they are, in regard to the inner working of this concern.  I cannot recall the name of any other country in the world to-day where the principal transport concerns are not State owned or State controlled.</P>

      <P>I suggest to Deputy Dillon that they are pretty well under control there.  I see nothing wrong in the Government, in present circumstances, having direct representation on the board of that concern, especially when we are confronted with the terribly serious, if not impossible, problem of providing the necessary fuel supplies not only for the citizens of this city, but for those in every other city and town in the country during the coming winter.  In my <Col N="1346" /> opinion, if all the registered lorries were in possession of a full petrol supply, if all our canal boats were in use, and if every railway wagon were put into full effective use, we would hardly be able to do the job of transporting all the fuel that will be required for our people in the cities and towns of the country during the next four months.  I think that this matter of the Minister for Industry and Commerce writing a letter to the manager of the Great Southern Railways asking him for certain information as to what the company propose to do in relation to certain matters in the present situation is a pure waste of time.  The way in which contact between the Government and the principal transport concern in the country should be maintained is, in my opinion, by having a nominee of the Government on the board of that concern.  Personally I do not believe in that kind of control in the case of public transport companies.  I believe in the policy of public ownership advocated by the Minister for Supplies many years ago, a policy which the Government have, so far, failed to put into operation.</P>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach know how the petrol supplies available are going to be allotted during the next few months?  What percentage of the supply available during the next three or four months will be given to commercial lorries to transport fuel and do other transport business?  How much of the supply will be allocated to commercial lorries and private car-owners? I am of the opinion that all the available supply of petrol should, as far as possible, be given to the commercial lorry owners&mdash;that is, if the transporting of fuel and other essential commodities is to be done in the way the Government think it should be done.  I think that certain classes of private car owners are getting too much.</P>

I am not prepared to support the Government in allocating petrol to private car owners to be used for pleasure purposes, while commercial lorry owners are badly in need of petrol to enable them to do their work for the community.  I know that certain private car owners must have petrol, such as medical men and so on, to enable them to carry out their duties.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not engage in a wordy warfare with Deputy Dillon; I presume he will express his point of view before this discussion ends.  The petrol which is available should be given, as far as possible, to those who are engaged in essential services.  I am not opposed&mdash;I do not want it to be taken for granted that I am&mdash;to the allocation of petrol to private car owners if the petrol is available, but essential services must get first consideration. I wonder can the Taoiseach give us any information as to the number of commercial lorries registered for every kind of work at the present time?  If he has not that information at his disposal at the moment&mdash;it is very essential information for some Minister to have at his hand&mdash;I will take another opportunity of getting that information by means of Parliamentary question and answer.  I should also like to know from the Taoiseach, on this question of transport, whether any of the Ministers concerned, or himself in particular, has had any consultations with the transport and carrying companies in the country in regard to the distribution or transport of turf <Col N="1348" /> from the bogs to the areas where turf is required?</P>
      <P>I think it is desirable that he or the responsible Minister should know as soon as possible what percentage of the turf required to be taken from our bogs to our cities and towns will be carried by rail, road and canal.  I should like to know whether there is any detailed plan in the possession of the Government, submitted by the carrying companies concerned, indicating what percentage of the fuel requirements will be carried by the several methods into the cities and towns before the winter comes along.  If that matter has not been given consideration up to the present time, it is very desirable that it should be given immediate consideration, and that the carrying companies concerned should be requested to indicate what they are prepared to do in that respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the general question of supplies&mdash;the supplies which our people are sending out of this country to Great Britain, and the supplies which we are getting in such small quantities from Great Britain&mdash;I should like to ask the Taoiseach whether any representations have been made to the British Government, or whether he is prepared to agree that our responsible Ministers here should get into immediate personal contact with the appropriate British Ministers, in regard to the exchange of commodities. The Taoiseach must be aware that large quantities of fresh meat, fat cattle, bacon, eggs, butter, porter, whiskey and other commodities of that kind, are being sent out of this country to Great Britain up to the present time, whereas the people of this country are suffering from a shortage of tea, petrol, coal and the raw materials which are necessary to carry on our industrial concerns and keep our industrial workers in employment. I think there can be no loss of dignity on the part of the Government of this country in sending over the Minister for Agriculture, the Minister for Supplies, or the Minister for Industry and Commerce, if the Taoiseach himself is not willing or able to go, and asking the British Government whether they <Col N="1349" /> are prepared to discuss on its merits the question of exchanging our fresh meat, fat cattle, bacon, eggs, butter, porter, whiskey and other commodities, for a reasonable supply of tea, petrol, coal, and the raw materials necessary for the carrying on of our industries.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Suppose they say &ldquo;No&rdquo;?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am prepared to say that they should go even though there is no response from the other side.  I think it is a business way of doing things. It is surely a sound basis upon which to make a good business bargain.  It is fairly well known that the British Government or the British authorities, whoever they are, have a fairly long-period supply of tea in their possesion. I have heard it stated, although I do not speak with any great authority on this matter, that there is a seven years' supply of tea in Great Britain under the present rationing scheme in existence there.  They have large quantities of petrol; at any rate, they have the power to control the diversion of whatever surplus petrol they may have to this country, if they are willing to do so.  They have in their possession certain raw materials which they are not using for their own purposes, and I am sure a good business bargain could be made by good Ministers on the lines which I have suggested.  At any rate, there can be no loss of dignity on the part of the Government here in making such a proposition, and sending their Ministers over, if they have not already agreed to do so.  I want to say quite definitely&mdash;I have personal knowledge of it&mdash;that for a long period British agents acting for big concerns in Great Britain, and agents of the British Ministry of Food, have been here in this city and have proceeded all over the country trying to get every bit of food they could possibly pick up for the use of their own people.  If they are badly in need of our food and commodities of the kind I have mentioned, and if we are badly in need of what they can give us, I think we can make a good business bargain on that basis, without interfering in any way with our relations with Great Britain on other matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1350" /> In previous discussions, the members of this Party have already raised the question of the failure of the Government to set up any effective machinery for the control of prices of essential commodities.  Cases have been cited here in this House where tea has been sold, freely and openly sold, at 5d. or 6d. an ounce, without the purchasers being called upon to produce ration cards in some cases.  Petrol has been sold at prices ranging from 5/- to 10/- per gallon.  White flour has been sold here publicly in Moore Street, and advertised for sale in the windows of several shops in the city, at 7d. a lb. Coal is being sold at excessive prices. Turf is being sold at excessive prices. Vegetables produced here convenient to our own city are being sold at outrageously high prices.</P>
    <P>No effective machinery appears to be in existence up to the present for the purpose of dealing with people who are charging excessive prices to the community.  I do not want to go over ground which has been already covered in connection with this matter, but I invite the Taoiseach as the head of the Government to say whether it is the intention of the Government to set up effective machinery to control the prices of essential commodities, and to punish in a proper way through our courts the people who are found guilty of charging excessive prices.  I do not see why there should be one law for the farmer, the producer of our food, who gets a fixed price&mdash; though not in all cases&mdash;for what he produces, while there is a different law altogether for the person who sells the produce of the farmer at excessive prices in the cities and towns.  I have quoted a case here in this House, and I can prove it, where certain distributors in the city picked up turf at Kingsbridge Station and Grand Canal Harbour, and got 22/6 for themselves for picking up that turf out of a canal boat or a railway wagon and handing it over to the person to whom they sold it, whereas that turf was sold on the bog at 15/9 a ton; in no case, as far as I know, did the price exceed 17/6 a ton.  I think there is something radically wrong with the system which allows that, and I hope the <Col N="1351" /> Taoiseach or the responsible Minister will set up effective machinery for the purpose of dealing with profiteering without any further delay.  Most of the trouble which arises as a direct result of the bringing into operation of Emergency Powers Order No. 83 is because of the fact that the workers of this country are being compelled to live on low wages at the same time as prices are soaring.  The failure of the Government to deal with the question of profiteering from that angle is, in my opinion, going to provoke considerable trouble for the Government in the coming months.</P>
    <P>I was amazed to hear the Taoiseach attempting here this evening to justify the many orders which have been issued under the Emergency Powers Act by saying that, in his opinion, it was necessary to take swift action.  I do not think that anybody sitting on this side of the House, or any of his own Deputies who sit so silently behind him, can accept the plea that swift action was the justification for bringing Order No. 83 into operation and for relating it to any of the Financial Resolutions that have been passed in connection with our Budget Resolution. The swift way in which this Emergency Powers Order was brought into operation, without any previous consultation of any kind with people who might be able to tender good advice, has been the cause of a great deal of the trouble that has arisen since that very drastic order was brought in by the Minister for Finance under cover of his Budget Resolution.</P>
    <P>The order has been amended on two occasions since it was brought into existence, and that in itself shows that the contents of the order must not have been given any careful consideration by the responsible Minister. It was amended, in the first instance, for the purpose of allowing certain employers who had made agreements with their workers, or with the representatives of their workers, between 7th May and 6th June, to legalise these agreements and to enable the employers concerned to pay the increased wages that had been agreed to between the dates mentioned.  It was <Col N="1352" /> amended in the second case so as to allow the low-wage employers in this city to increase the rates of wages to any workers who are employed in this city under a wage of £2 10s. 0d. a week. That second amendment of the order was made on the night that a vote on the order was taken here in the House, and it was announced in the papers the following morning.  I notice, from looking up the order, that it was signed by the Taoiseach on 13th June, and a striking instance of how the wireless is used for propaganda purposes is that an announcement was made on the wireless, giving particulars of the amendment to the order, on 21st June, eight days after the Taoiseach signed it.  Of course, we all know why it was announced over the wireless on that particular night.  It was the night before the College Green protest meeting against the issue of this order, and the details of the order and the amendment were announced on the wireless at 10 o'clock&mdash;I was listening to it&mdash;on Saturday night, 21st June, eight days after it was signed by the Taoiseach. It was announced then for the sole purpose, I suggest, of confusing the minds of the workers of Dublin on the issue with which the meeting at College Green was concerned, and which they would be attending on the following Sunday morning.  Of course, we shall be told that that was not Government propaganda.  We know, of course, that the Minister for Industry and Commerce has not been able to explain anything that he has done, either in regard to this matter or the Trade Union Bill, for the last three or four weeks.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>According to the information supplied to me in this House some short time ago, the Minister for Defence admitted that approximately £150,000 of the taxpayers' money had been spent on the administration of the Military Service Pensions Act of 1934.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Although applications were under consideration, and revision in the case of appeals, for a period of six years, there are still a large number of cases outstanding, even those of men whose claims were dealt with by the board as far back as 1936, 1937 and 1938.  Can the Taoiseach give any good reason why claims for military service pensions which were heard as far back as 1936, 1937 and 1938, should be still awaiting decision by the responsible officials concerned?  I object on the Vote for the Department of the Taoiseach to any further money being spent in connection with the administration <Col N="1356" /> of this measure, because, if the work was done in an efficient way, and if there was any desire on the part of the responsible Minister to complete the inquiries inside a reasonable period, it would not be necessary to spend further money in connection with the administration of that measure during the coming year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I have failed, as a result of repeated representations to the Minister for Defence and his predecessor, to get any satisfaction on this matter, and therefore I am taking advantage of this opportunity to bring under the notice of the Taoiseach the incompetence of the present Minister and his predecessor to carry out their duties in an efficient manner.  If the Minister cannot do his duty in an efficient and satisfactory manner, and with less expense to the taxpayers, then there is a clear case for the removal of the present Minister and for putting somebody more active and efficient in his place.</P>
      <P>I am sure the Taoiseach will admit that the members of this Party and the workers of this country have, generally speaking, given every co-operation that was necessary since the emergency arose in this country; that no strikes of any importance have taken place since the Defence Conference was established.  I should like the Taoiseach to say &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo; to that question. If he is of opinion or has been advised that there has been any serious industrial trouble caused in this country since the emergency arose or since the Defence Conference was established, I would be surprised to hear that that was the case.  I am not aware of any strike having taken place in any big industrial concern.</P>
      <P>In conclusion I want to say that if the Taoiseach agrees that that is the case, the introduction at this particular period of a provocative order like the Emergency Powers (No. 83) Order, which, properly christened, should be called the starvation order, and the Trade Union Bill which nobody is looking for is not going to help&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The general impression is that, if you want anything done by a Minister, the best thing you can do is to go to the Taoiseach, because going to the other fellows produces no result as they are afraid to do anything without the Taoiseach's previous approval, for fear he will chew the ear off them for having put their foot wrong.  Everybody knows that. Pooh Bah was a stout gentleman who occupied every office in Japan except that of Lord High Executioner.  Deputy Davin has been wandering about trying to get things done.

I want to direct the attention of the House to a rather strange development of the Taoiseach's encyclopædic interests.  We passed an Act through this House about a year ago called the Institute of Advanced Studies Act.  There was a good deal of controversy at the time as to the desirability of passing the Act at all.  I took the view very strongly that it ought to be passed.  I supported it strongly on account of the Institute of Advanced Studies which was to be primarily concerned with the Irish language.</P>

    <P>There is a difference of opinion in the House as to many details of the <Col N="1358" /> scheme, but there was unanimity on one proviso, and that was that the independence of the institute was to be as complete as legislation could make it, albeit its endowments were derived from Government funds.  All sides of the House said, &ldquo;If you establish the institute, do not let us have civil servants interfering in it. We have to take the risk that if a suitable council is set up it will employ whatever moneys are available to it to the best possible advantage.&rdquo;  Many, I think, were won over to the proposition of a State-endowed Institute of Advanced Studies on that representation, and so that institute was established.</P>
    <P>Now mark the sequence of events. The Taoiseach himself chose the council of the institute, consisting of eight gentlemen, and he chose the most distinguished scholars he could find in the country, into whose care he proposed to commit the affairs of the Institute for Celtic Learning, and they proceeded to get on with their job. There were, shall we say, three Regius professors and there was a council. Now, with the passage of time, it appeared to the council expedient to appoint a junior member of the institute. I should like to say at this stage that I think it would be becoming and right that we should leave out of our discussion altogether the personal merits of that appointee, because I think they are quite irrelevant to the matter I propose to raise.  The council, by a majority of seven members to one, decided that it was expedient in all the circumstances to appoint this junior member of the staff.  The possibility of seconding him from his present occupation to the institute was considered and rejected by the council, and it was decided to offer this young man a junior permament position on the staff of the institute.</P>
    <P>That decision being given by a majority of seven to one, the young man very naturally thought he was appointed. The Minister for Education was consulted, and, I think, concurred. But they forgot that in this country we had a Pooh-Bah.  The Taoiseach intervened at this stage and said: &ldquo;No, you cannot appoint him; I will <Col N="1359" /> not allow you to appoint him.&rdquo;  Remember, eight members of this council were men of his own appointing. Eight members of this council took office on the understanding that their autonomous discretion was to be interfered with as little as it was humanly possible to do so.  The eight members concerned were eight of the highest authorities on education in Celtic studies the Taoiseach could find in the whole of Ireland.</P>
    <P>The appointee was to be appointed to a particular branch of Celtic studies, of which this body of eight men were peculiarly well fitted to judge; but seven of these men having voted for his appointment and one against, the Taoiseach takes it upon himself to overrule the decision of the council he himself chose, because, he said, they were the best fitted in all Ireland to run this institute, and to declare, by implication, that these men did not know their job, but that he, Eamon de Valera, did know what they ought to do, and that he would cancel that which they attempted to do, and usurp for himself the functions which this House clearly intended he should delegate to the members of that council.</P>
    <P>It is noteworthy that seven members of the council voted for the proposition and one against, and that the one against is a distinguished scholar, but the Taoiseach himself is on record as saying that the views expressed to the Taoiseach by that dissenting scholar carried no weight and did not influence his judgment at all, that he, the Taoiseach, had made up his mind to veto the decision of the council before he ever heard that this individual member had dissented from the majority decision.  The net issue is this: is the Institute of Advanced Studies going to be run by the Taoiseach, or by the council established for that purpose? So far, the result of the intervention of the Taoiseach has been that two of the most distinguished members of the council, one of whom is one of the Regius Professors, have resigned, and the institute is now denied the services of Professor Osborn Bergin who, in his own sphere, I understand, is probably the greatest scholar in the world. <Col N="1360" /> I think it reflects little credit on this country that, within 12 months of the institution of the foundation, it should burst up as a result of the wholly unnecessary intervention of the Taoiseach in a matter of minor administrative detail.</P>
    <P>Does the Taoiseach claim the right himself to appoint every minor member of the staff of the Institute of Advanced Studies in all its branches?  Because if he does, I suggest that such a claim is daft?  He is not fitted to do it; he has not the qualifications to do it, and he ought not to labour under the delusion that he has.  Let us be frank and plain about this.  We are dealing here with what is meant to be the highest institute of learning in the country.  I am an intelligent grocer and the Taoiseach an intelligent secondary teacher.  He and I cannot sit down together and declare that in matters of this kind we have superior knowledge to Professor Schroedinger, Professor Osborn Bergin, Professor Alfred O'Rahilly, Dr. Best and the other members of the council of that institute.  All we can say as public men is that we can assess the worth of these distinguished scholars, that we can commit to their care the carrying on of an institute of this kind, and that whatever they decide to do in the best interests of the institute, we will facilitate them in doing.  That is what I understood this House wished the Government to do&mdash;to choose the very best men, to hand over the Institute of Higher Studies to these men and to say: &ldquo;Now, in respect of anything you want to do to promote higher learning in this country, within the limits of our capacity to pay, we shall do our best to help you.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>What is happening is that the Taoiseach chooses to brush all that aside and to say: &ldquo;I know more than Professor Schroedinger in his branch; I know more than Professor Bergin in his branch; I know more than Professor O'Rahilly in his branch; I know more than Dr. Best in his branch; and, as for the minor members of the council, I know infinitely more than they, including the Chairman, Dr. Browne of Maynooth, and when I do not agree with the seven members of <Col N="1361" /> the council, Eamon de Valera's view prevails, and the view of the seven members of the Council must go down.&rdquo;  If that continues, I tell the House that the Institute of Advanced Studies will very rapidly become a by-word and a repository of second-class scholars who are prepared to prostitute themselves to political canvass in order to get soft jobs, because independent scholars are concerned solely with the pursuit of truth, are not going to stoop to the task of conciliating the Civil Service and political Governments in order to get positions in the Institute of Advanced Studies, when almost all of them would be welcomed by continental and American universities without any canvassing at all.</P>
    <P>This House ought to make up its mind as to what it wants done.  Does it want the Taoiseach to run this institute, or does it want the council to run it?  If it wants the Taoiseach to run it, <i>in nomine Domini</i>, close the place up, because it will become a disgusting by-word, another repository of crocks.  Every old cod whom the Gaelic League are sick of looking at will be dumped on the institute in a soft job.  If you want the council to run it, then let it be left to the council, but let us make up our minds which we are going to do.  I am in favour of leaving the administration of the affairs of the institute to the council&mdash;and it was a good council. I will give that to the Taoiseach. When he chose the council, he chose it extremely well, and, if he had not fallen into the egregious error of poking his nose where he was not wanted, this experiment had a good start and might have done very well.  Is it too late to ask him now: will you take your nose&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>No attempt to shout me down will prevent me from doing so. I invite the Taoiseach to keep quiet <Col N="1363" /> until I am finished, and then he can talk as much as he likes.  The facts are as I have reproduced them for the House, and I want the House to instruct the Taoiseach definitely in its wish.  The choice is clear.  Either the Council of the Institute of Advanced Studies is going to run the institute or the Taoiseach is going to run it.  I stand for the council, chosen by the Government of this State, running the Institute of Advanced Studies.  I believe that if they are allowed to run it, that institute can ultimately become a worthy addition to the educational system of this country, and, not only that, but a powerful instrument of higher learning and research, which may be of service not only to Ireland but to the world.</P>
      <P>If the Taoiseach runs it, it is going to become the repository of every political hack who wants a soft job and who is prepared to prostitute himself in order to get it.  That is the choice, and as certain as we are in this House, we are at the cross-roads, because once that institute begins to go down and to acquire a reputation as a repository of crocks, no decent scholar will seek admission to it.  I want to keep the reputation of that institute high.  I want to ensure what we all intended originally&mdash;appointment to it constituting a high reward for distinguished academic work in the sphere of learning. I say that if the Taoiseach pursues his present course that will not be achieved, and I urge the House to make it perfectly manifest to him now that he has to take his nose out of affairs that should not concern him, leave to those who are capable of handling those matters their control, and turn his own mind to the political matters with which he is peculiarly well fitted to fiddle.  That is all I wish to say about the Institute of Advanced Studies.  I hope the Taoiseach will approach the problem in a chastened frame of mind and demonstrate that if he has made a very grave error, it is not too late to mend his hand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Davin spoke at some length of the Government's failure to fall in with the recommendations of the Banking Commission.  The world has <Col N="1364" /> changed considerably since the Banking Commission presented its report, and while it is true that many of the recommendations would be appropriate and even desirable for times of peace, it is equally true that in time of war and emergency those recommendations may not be very profitably implemented. It is true that during the Siege of Derry it was good public practice to put the population on a diet of rats when there was nothing else for the population to eat, but few would suggest in the piping times of peace that because rats were welcome in a time of siege, the whole country should continue to eat rats when the siege was over.</P>
    <P>This country is in a state of siege, as is almost every other country in the world.  We may be obliged to do things now for the preservation of our existence which, in peace time, would be regarded as cracked and foolish.  In these circumstances I suggest that we should reserve the full consideration of the Banking Commission's report until the period of the emergency has passed. It was conceived in peace time; it was for a time of peace that its recommendations were designed.  In times such as these the recommendations have little application.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to ask the Taoiseach who is going to feed the population this winter?  I like democratic institutions; I like parliamentary debates; I think it is the decent way to carry on the affairs of men; but it carries with it the temptation to content ourselves by talking and getting nothing done.  The Taoiseach has said in public, and his Ministers also have said, that they foresee a situation this winter in which the public may be hungry unless our people put their shoulders to the wheel to overcome the emergency.  What plan <Col N="1365" /> has he in mind to meet that?  He has gone past the stage when he says there may be a danger coming.  He says now that there is a danger, that the danger is there.  I submit that the moment he sees a danger of that character in existence he is perfectly entitled forthwith to make plans on the assumption that the danger is upon us.</P>
      <P>It may be, after he has gone to considerable expense and made comprehensive plans and inconvenienced considerable numbers of people, that something untoward may turn up which will make the whole thing unnecessary and the acute danger may never develop.  I do not believe that anyone in this country will complain or charge him with intolerable extravagance should such a state of affairs come about.  I think that the unwanted precautions should be regarded as a monument to his prudence.  We would be all glad if events so turned out that these precautions which had been taken were, in fact, not required. There would be the feeling of security that, should disaster fall upon us, we had the means to deal with it, and there would not be any danger of anarchy or public upheaval resulting from the failure of the people in this Parliament to do their duty in time.</P>
      <P>I do not believe that anyone in rural Ireland is going to be starved.  I do not believe it is possible, in any circumstances, for the rural population to starve&mdash;and I know the circumstances of rural Ireland very well.  There may be very grave inconveniences if paraffin is not provided for the kitchen lamps, or if candles are not available, but I do not expect the Taoiseach to deal in detail with matters of that kind.  Paraffin for the kitchen lamp is vital to the morale of the rural population, but outside that, I do not believe there is going to be any vital supply problem in rural Ireland.  There may be great inconvenience and annoyance, but no one is going to go hungry or naked in rural Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But, in the cities, we are going to find ourselves confronted with this problem, that even if we can muster the food, albeit not food to which the city populations are accustomed, we <Col N="1366" /> may find ourselves in a situation in which they will have the food and not be able to cook it.  You cannot eat raw flour, raw meat or raw potatoes.  I do not think the coal problem is one for which this Government can be made primarily responsible, nor can the British Government.  I think the fact is that the coal is not there.  But it is not very tactful to be delivering six ton supplies of coal at the city restaurants when poor women are passing by while it is being put down the chute, and they are wondering why they cannot get half a stone.  That is a detail I do not propose to pursue.</P>
    <P>Let us assume we can get the food to the people.  The problem is how will they cook it.  We cannot establish communal kitchens over-night, but some day we will have to take a decision as to how we are going to meet a situation when the people cannot cook their food.  I know of two ways in which it can be met.  One is communal kitchens, to which the people will bring their food, cook it and take it away to be consumed in the family circle.  The other is communal feeding.  I would be prepared to adopt communal feeding if it is the only way to surmount the difficulty, but I do not like it because it tends to disrupt the family system.  The people can either bring their food and have it cooked, or purchase it in a cooked state and bring it to their homes for consumption.  If we are all agreed that that is the right solution, now is the time to establish the communal kitchen, now is the time to train the personnel, and it is not going to be an easy task.</P>
    <P>Although with the best intentions we go out to provide the poor with the best service, it is going to be somewhat inconvenient for the poor.  They will naturally resent their troubles, trials and tribulations, and they will vent a good deal of their resentment on the personnel engaged in cooking food at the various centres.  These people will be doing their best, but naturally, being the first persons that the people in trouble meet, they will get the weight of the abuse and the dissatisfaction. You have to get tactful, prudent people who will be prepared to face that, to understand it and make the <Col N="1367" /> scheme a success if serious disturbances are not going to result.</P>
    <P>Suppose we decide to have a communal kitchen where food is brought for cooking purposes and then taken away to be consumed at home, or a communal kitchen where people can purchase food in a cooked state, or if we are to have communal feeding centres, how is the food to be rationed?  I say that there is not any system in which you can ration it out other than by giving to the mother of every family a definite allowance.  You could then regulate the food issued at those centres at price levels which would enable any women to get a fair meal on seven days a week from the family allowance that is being provided for her by the State.  I think that is the limit to which a prudent Government ought to go.</P>
    <P>I want to say this in particular to the Labour Party, that in a state of emergency of this kind, in our desire to serve, we may be tempted to interfere to excess in the administration of family life.  There are limits beyond which we, as public representatives, should not go in attempting to control the management of children by the father and mother.  We have got to assume that 99 per cent. of the mothers of this country, if given the means to feed their children, will feed them.  We have got to reconcile ourselves to the fact that there will be 1 per cent. who will not feed them, but, instead, will spend the money on drink or in the betting shop.  In fact, we have got to realise that we are not all saints and angels in this country, that there are some weak brethren amongst us for whom we must be prepared to make provision, no matter how exasperating they are.  But the great difficulty is that the civil servants are always so obsessed with the danger of public money going astray that they are afraid to launch any scheme for fear one individual in the State will manage to collect 6d. illegitimately. There never was a scheme initiated by a Government in any country in the world in which some money, which was intended to be expended on deserving people, did not find its way into the <Col N="1368" /> hands of undeserving persons.  That should not deter us from pursuing the scheme if we are satisfied that it is the most effective way of banishing hunger from our people in a period of unexampled emergency.  If anyone has a better scheme, let him get up and adumbrate it.  There at least is a scheme that will work though it may not be the best scheme.  If there is a better scheme, I am prepared to work for it and advocate any taxation or public expenditure that is necessary to finance it, but do not crab this scheme until someone is able to get up and say: &ldquo;We sympathise with Deputy Dillon, but we think he is wrong, and we have a better scheme.&rdquo;  I am prepared to adopt anybody's scheme that will give me the assurance that no man, woman or child will go hungry next winter.  I ask Deputies to bear this in mind, and I want to say it deliberately, that no man, woman or child in this country is entitled to be finicky about the diet he or she gets.  All that they will have the right to demand is that the diet will be of a character which, when consumed, will be adequate to maintain normal health, and that there is a fair do for everyone.</P>

      <P>This emergency may be the means of securing that they will have it hereafter.  If they did not have it in the past some of that may be due to dire poverty and some of it to a failure on the part of the family administrator to use the money available to the best advantage.  Let us be fair and say that some of it was due to one cause and some to the other.  This emergency may be the means of carrying to far wider circles of the community good sense in regard to dietetics for children.  Let us take advantage of the occasion to do as much as we can to that end.  But, whatever we do, let us take the precaution here and now to ensure that, however the wind blows next winter, no one will go hungry as far as we can prevent it, and that no one will go naked.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some people, I believe, think that I am unduly pessimistic, but honestly, I <Col N="1369" /> do not think I am.  I was talking recently to a man who came back from Spain, which has a much larger coastline than we have.  This man told me, and he was in a position to know, that there are areas in Spain, as big as a county here, where people are actually dying from hunger on the roadside because the Central Government could not get food or fuel to them.  The Government knew because they could not get either the food or the fuel to them, that citizens of their country were lying by the roadside dying from emaciation and hunger.  Now, that is the case in Spain, which has contact with the United States of America&mdash;to which American ships are still sailing.  I need hardly tell Deputies that in Belgium, in occupied France and Holland, the state of affairs is shocking, and you have people dying of hunger.  Their position is not analogous to ours, because they are belligerents, albeit not all of them by their own desire.  Spain is a neutral country.  We are neutral, but by the mercy of Providence, and thanks to the British Navy, we are not in the position that Spain is in.  If it were not for the British Navy we might easily find ourselves in the position in which Spain is, though not perhaps to such an acute degree, because we are able to provide a supply of food for ourselves, but, from the point of view of fuel, the position might become very serious.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether I am going into too great detail if I refer to a matter which is very near to my heart. The Borstal inmates in this country are at the present moment in a prison in one of our cities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to discuss the administration of the interior of that prison, nor do I want to suggest for a moment that the Taoiseach is indifferent to the fact that those Borstal boys are in a prison.  I want to put it to members of the House: would it not be much better to take those boys out of the prison in Cork City and put them in some derelict house rather than pen them up where <Col N="1370" /> they are to-day?  I will not refer to it further.</P>
      <P>The last thing I want to say is this. I do not mind embarking upon any new departure if we make up our minds deliberately to do so.  I do not mind anything going up the spout if we mean it to go up the spout.  What I hate to see is something that is vital to the national position of this country gradually disintegrating and no one, apparently, caring where it goes.  The Defence Conference either is of value or it is not.  Personally, I think it is. I think that if its value is to be maintained we have got to be perfectly clear in our minds as to what its terms of reference are.  The Defence Conference has nothing to do with policy.  That was made as clear as crystal from the very beginning.  There are large lumps of vital policy in regard to which I am poles apart from the Fianna Fáil Government, but that does not seem to preclude me from co-operating with Ministers or the Government on the Defence Conference.</P>
      <P>There is one matter on which I am in complete agreement with the Government, and that is: that in accepting responsibility for this sovereign State we must be prepared, whatever the cost may be, to resist aggression against its sovereignty whencesoever it may come.  On that agreement I think the Defence Conference can function.  I think the Labour Party sometimes talk about throwing up the Defence Conference, and I have heard the Taoiseach say, when he gets vexed, &ldquo;Well, what is the use of the Defence Conference?&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Do not draw me too far, or I might talk more.  If the Defence Conference is to go, it should go by a carefully taken resolution.  It cannot satisfactorily function if people will not keep before their eyes what its function is.  Its function is to co-ordinate certain Government activities, on the basis of Government policy which is fixed by the Government and not by the Defence Conference.  People ought to make up their minds to that, and ought <Col N="1372" /> to appreciate that.  Differences about policy there are likely to be, strong and emphatic differences, and, so long as this Government is a Party Government, it is right and good&mdash;as the Taoiseach said to-day &mdash; that those differences should be freely ventilated in the Legislature of the State.  I, therefore, would welcome from the Labour Party the strongest possible repudiation of the misapprehension under which apparently I have been labouring.</P>

      <P>I would welcome from the Taoiseach a clear reiteration of his view as to whether or not the Defence Conference is a valuable factor in the present situation.  I am expressing my view.  I think it is, and I would be sorry to see it go, but if others take a different view I would be prepared to fall in with it if that view were calmly come to, and the action upon that view resolutely embarked upon, but what I do want to say is that casual observations and petulant gestures might quite casually wreck something which would be extremely difficult to reconstitute.  I have said all I want to say, and I invite the Taoiseach to deal patiently and explicitly with the five separate matters upon which I have touched, because I think that they are all-important and all-deserving of the Taoiseach's attention, as distinguished from the attention of such an officer as Pooh-Bah was represented to be in Gilbert and Sullivan's opera <i>The Mikado.</i></P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. D. Morrissey Mr. D. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>On this Estimate I want to return to what I consider the most pressing and the most urgent matter with which we have to deal at the moment, that is the fuel position in relation to transport.  I want to try to impress on the Taoiseach that the transport in this country, such as it is, will be free and available for turf transport only for another five weeks. At the end of five or at the outside six weeks, all road transport available, and the greater part if not all of the railway transport, will be required for <Col N="1373" /> shifting grain.  By the time the grain harvest has been transported, we will immediately be up against the question of transporting beet.  I should like some members of the Government, if the head of the Government cannot do it, to explain to this House and to the people how they propose to transport grain, beet and turf at the same time. It cannot be done.  We are in this position to-day, that turf is not being transported from the bogs into the towns even in the turf counties.  In the only period when our transport is available&mdash;when, as a matter of fact, the greater part of our transport is idle for want of work&mdash;we are not using it.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach complains of the complacency of the people.  Notwithstanding the fact that he and other members of the Government and this House have tried to impress upon the people the seriousness of this crisis, notwithstanding the fact that they have tried to impress upon the people the grave economic dangers facing the country, not to speak about the military dangers, he complains that the people still go on in the same old way.  My complaint is that, with only five, or, at the most, six weeks' transport time available, the Government are plodding along as if we have unlimited transport and unlimited fuel.  I want to state in the most emphatic way that, in my opinion, and according to the best information I can get, it would require all the transport that we have in this country working full time from this until the end of this year to carry from the bogs and from the woods of this country the fuel supply necessary to carry our people over next winter, and it would require that, during all that time, we never had to carry a bag of grain or a ton of beet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can see certain reasons for what I might call this Standstill Order No. 2 under which turf is not allowed to be removed from the turf areas.  I explained here yesterday that the first effect of that order has been that throughout the bogs of this country the sleans have been thrown down and the turf cutting has ceased.  It is understandable.  Men have cut X-tons of turf.  They have worked hard. <Col N="1374" /> I am talking now for the moment of private turf cutters, the types of people upon whom the head of the Government himself has told us that we must depend in the main to make up the additional supplies of fuel. Those men have been working for the last two or three months without getting any money from anybody.  Now, when they have the first harvest of turf saved and ready to be sold, they are not allowed to sell it.  Does anybody expect that they are going to carry on cutting turf?  Those men who are living down the country, who are facing the realities, who know the position regarding transport, are saying to themselves: &ldquo;My neighbours and my family and myself between us have 100 tons of turf cut and saved. If we cannot get transport now when transport is idle and available to remove that 100 tons of turf, what possible chance have we of getting 200 or 300 tons of turf removed from the bogs when every lorry in the country will be engaged in carrying wheat, barley, oats, and so on?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I do not like to repeat myself or to raise this matter too often, but I look upon it as the most urgent of all the matters which we have to consider.  I must confess that I find it most astounding that the Government can sit down, apparently unconcernedly, during this period, whilst no effort whatever is being made to distribute the turf which has been cut and saved, to clear the grounds to enable the people to cut more turf, and to enable them to get paid for the work they have done on the bogs in the last two or three months.  I should like the Taoiseach or the Minister for Industry and Commerce, or the Minister for Supplies, or some member of the Government, to get up here and explain to us what transport, if any, is going to be available during the months of August, September, October or November for the carrying of turf.</P>
    <P>Further, I want to get from some member of the Government information as to whether any estimate has been made of the transport that would be required to bring a sufficient quantity of fuel from the bogs and the woods to the towns and cities of this country <Col N="1375" /> so as to ensure that there would not be a shortage of firing.  I suggest that no attempt has been made to get that estimate and that, if such an estimate were made, it would be shown that more transport will be required than we have in the country.</P>
    <P>We have got no clear lead on this matter.  Since I spoke here yesterday evening in this connection, I have taken the opportunity of talking to other Deputies from various parts of the country, and they have told me that the position in the various constituencies, which they represent in this House, is, as a result of the recent Turf Order, just the same as it is in my own constituency. Very large numbers of men who had been engaged in cutting and saving turf have ceased to cut it.  That is a very unfortunate position, and it is particularly unfortunate when we face the fact that even if they worked all the time and to the very maximum of their capacity, and even if we were granted the most favourable weather conditions that we could possibly hope for, they would not be able to produce enough.  It is lamentable that, for any reason, they should have stopped work on the cutting and saving of turf at this particular period of the year, particularly in weather that is so favourable.  I do not want to say any more about that matter.  I raise it again now because, as I have said, I look upon this as the most important and most urgent matter which should have the attention of the Government.</P>
    <P>There is one other matter that I want to raise on the Taoiseach's Estimate.  We had one of the results of it here this evening and yesterday in connection with the Emergency Powers (Continuance) Bill and the allegations that were made that the Government were abusing those powers by making orders, covering matters that should have been dealt with by ordinary legislation.  The Taoiseach's answer to that was that there was only a difference of two days in the number of days that the Dáil sat for the last two years compared with the number of days on which they sat in the preceding <Col N="1376" /> two years.  I want to say that the position in which we find ourselves here to-day, of sitting in this House this week, with the prospect of sitting here for the remainder of this month and, probably, a part, if not the greater part, of next month, is due absolutely and entirely to the Government's inability&mdash;I shall not use any other word&mdash;so to arrange the business of this House as to get discussion to the best advantage and at a time of the year in which matters could be discussed fully with the least&mdash;I shall not say the least inconvenience to the members of the House but with the least loss of valuable time.  I think that the majority of the members of this House&mdash;certainly more than half of them&mdash;are farmers, or directly or very closely connected with the land, and it seems to me to be an appalling thing that we should not be sitting here during the winter months and the earlier part of the spring doing our business in the House and that we should be kept here, during the busiest time of the year for the farmers, discussing Bills which, if they had to be discussed&mdash;some of them, at any rate&mdash; could have been discussed last winter, or else could be discussed next winter, instead of telling us, as we have been told&mdash;the only feeble excuse that could be made for Order No. 83&mdash;that it is a question of time.  Surely to goodness if time and, apparently, unlimited time, can be found for a Bill like the Trade Union Bill, that time could be used to far better purpose in discussing any other Bill.  If we had not any more important measures to discuss, the time given by members of this House, and particularly farmer members, for the last two or three weeks&mdash;and that probably will be given for the next two or three weeks&mdash;could be spent by these Deputies, with much more value to the nation and to themselves, at home on their own farms.</P>
    <P>We have had to complain of this before.  There is no doubt at all about it, there is, apparently, no intelligent looking ahead or planning ahead of the business of the country and the business to be put before this House. I know, of course, that there are times when legislation has to be brought in <Col N="1377" /> or Bills have to be passed or orders made, in a hurry&mdash;matters that cannot be foreseen.  I know that, but that does not happen every day.  So far as the vast bulk of the work is concerned, it should be out of the way long before this, and I think that the time of the House would be used to better advantage if a programme or agenda were prepared by the Government and presented to the House in a much better way than has been the practice up to the present.</P>
    <P>I do not want to dwell&mdash;although I suppose I could properly do so on this Estimate&mdash;on the wisdom or otherwise of introducing the Trade Union Bill, but I do say that it shows, to say the least of it, very little appreciation, firstly, of the value of keeping, as far as possible, highly controversial legislation out of this House during the period of the emergency, and, secondly, very little appreciation, indeed, of how necessary it is that every member of this House, and particularly every farmer member of this House, as I have said, should be at home on his farm working or directing the work that has to be done on his farm, particularly at a time like this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JeremiahHurley" hpid="Mr. Hurley Mr. Hurley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hurley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach is the head of a Government, and the Labour Party has put down this motion to refer the Vote back because we consider that the Government, as a whole, lacks initiative, imagination, drive or direction, especially in this time of crisis and emergency and, probably, disturbance.  The Government still continue to act in the old orthodox, peacetime ways, without any apparent realisation of the dangers that beset the country.  The Taoiseach has told us that he apprehends a dangerous position next winter, in the cities and towns, I take it, but I want to ask the Taoiseach what plans he has made to meet that dangerous position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as Deputies and the citizens of the country can see, nothing is being done that will ensure that the apprehensions of the Taoiseach will not be justified next winter.  The ordinary man down the country turns to his Deputy and asks him what he is doing about it.  By means of Parliament, and other means as well, Deputies <Col N="1378" /> have tried to impress on the Government the need for making definite plans to meet the situation which is so imminent.  There is no doubt that the war effort of the belligerents will be intensified and will definitely put this country into a much more serious position than it is at present.  This is evident to any thoughtful person.  But I wonder does it impress on the Government the responsibility to plan and to see that the worst of the impact of that position will not be experienced next winter by our people.</P>
    <P>Deputy Morrissey referred to the position in towns and cities with regard to fuel.  I want to join in the appeal he made for a more intensive drive so far as fuel is concerned.  So far as I can see, the position in Cork next winter will be a deplorable one. Even with all the turf cutting that is going on, the county council scheme, the goodwill scheme, and the work that owners of bogs are doing, there will not be sufficient fuel for Cork City next winter or for the areas east of Cork City, which comprise the greater part of my constituency.  I can corroborate what Deputy Morrissey said about the restriction on the removal of turf from turf areas.  A man who has supplied a good deal of turf to Cork City from the bogs over the border in Kerry told me that when this standstill No. 2 Order, as it has been called, came into force he was prohibited from taking turf to Cork City.</P>
    <P>I do not know what the reason for that is.  I made representations to the Turf Development Board in order to get that man a licence.  He did a very big business in bringing turf into Cork City.  He supplied some of the big coal merchants who, I am sure, are trying to lay in stocks.  He also supplied the small coal merchants.  Now he is stopped from doing that.  Can the Taoiseach give any definite reason why that is being done?  From what the man told me, what Deputy Morrissey has stated is a fact.  The people from whom that man bought turf&mdash;and he spent about £3,000 on turf this season &mdash;on account of the turf being left on their hands, are not prepared to go ahead and cut any more.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1379" /> I do not know what the purpose of this order is.  There may be some good reason for it, but to my mind it seems ridiculous, because no matter what supplies of turf can be got into Cork City during the next few months, they will not be sufficient for the coming winter. I would like, therefore, to get from the Taoiseach some indication of the purpose of this order.  The area that I mentioned is just over the border of Cork County, and supplied turf to various parts of Cork County.  Why that has been stopped I do not know. That is only an indication of the Government's policy in this matter.  It looks as if they have adopted a Micawber-like policy of waiting for something to turn up; waiting until the emergency is really upon them.</P>
    <P>While that position obtains, we are exporting food to Great Britain.  If there is to be a food shortage in the coming winter, and the Taoiseach himself admits that there is a danger of that, I cannot understand why we are exporting food at present.  My information is that £100,000 worth of potatoes have been exported, and I do not see what we have got in return.  We may have got promises to pay under the signature of the Bank of England.  If we have a surplus to export, we should get some commodities in return, either materials that are wanted for industries, or some other foodstuffs such as tea, flour, etc.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach is very fond of describing the nation as a family, and saying that each and every member of the family is entitled to a share.  That position has not obtained at any time in this country to my knowledge, and, so far as indications go, it will not obtain.  People in my area who are trying to live on 14/- a week cannot get their share of food or fuel.  That sum is only given to a man who has a wife and five or more children.  The family idea does not go very far in those cases. Extra allowances have been promised to the recipients of unemployment assistance, home assistance, old age pensions, etc., but there is no evidence of these being put into operation, and the position at the moment is that <Col N="1380" /> people in those areas are in a very bad way.</P>
    <P>I am referring to an area in my constituency bordering on Cork harbour, comprising a big population, and including Passage West and Cobh, in which there is no employment to be had.  There are no bogs adjacent to that area, so that the people there cannot be employed on turf cutting. I therefore want to impress on the Taoiseach the necessity for useful schemes for employment in that district. Since the turf drive was started in Cork County the surveyors and their staffs are engaged altogether in connection with turf production.  But there should be some consideration for areas where turf schemes and ancillary schemes, such as the making of bog roads, etc., cannot be put into operation.  I have had letters from people in that area asking me to get something done.  I have put the matter before the Department and before the Taoiseach, and I am putting it now publicly before him. Something must be done in those areas.  We are supposed to be making provision so that people will not be hungry next winter, but there have been hungry people in this country for a long number of years.  People are hungry at this moment, and we sit complacently here and do nothing about it.  If the family idea is the key-note of the Taoiseach's operations now and in the future, let him turn his attention to these places I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>There is a steel works in Cobh which has been closed down since 11th February last.  I know for a fact that the Taoiseach was appealed to in the matter, because the Minister for Industry and Commerce did not seem to take any further interest in it.  Private enterprise had failed and, therefore, it was not the duty of the Government to do anything further.  There is a need for that industry, if industries which are useful, such as house building, railways and a number of subsidiary industries are to be kept going.  I should like the Taoiseach to listen to the appeals made in this matter.  Very probably there will be a further appeal made, because I understand <Col N="1381" /> that a conference of public bodies is to be held on next Monday night and a deputation may be sent to the Taoiseach in an effort to get him to do something.  Private enterprise having failed on this occasion, the Government has a responsibility and a duty to an industry which is vital almost to the very existence of the State.  It was an industry which gave a certain amount of employment. Probably the war caused its dislocation but, at the same time, there is enough scrap material available to keep the industry going and to keep the other industries I speak of going as well.</P>
    <P>I think it was the Minister for Supplies who said, in reply to a question by my colleague, Deputy Corry, that no scrap was being exported from this country, but I think Deputy Corry proved to the satisfaction of the House that 30,000 tons of scrap iron were exported under licence from this country last year.  My information is that with that amount of material and the amount which can be collected, if there is a drive for it, Haulbowline could be kept going as a major industry in the country.  I am sure the Taoiseach knows very well what I am talking about, and I hold that it is his duty to see that this industry is kept going. There is definitely room for it, and there is definitely a demand, even at present, for such material as was being turned out there.  There are 2,600 tons of rails there which, if the industry was put going, could be utilised.  It is the duty of the Taoiseach and the Government to see that where there is employment for people who cannot find employment in the fuel and food drives, these people should be put to work.  I have given one example of what could be done.  I do not want to go into the matter in detail, but I want to bring it to the notice of the Taoiseach that the people down there believe that a responsibility rests on him as head of the Government to do something to get this industry going again.</P>
    <P>What is the position in the country to-day?  We have numbers of people who cannot get employment, no matter how the fuel drive is arranged.  They cannot be absorbed in that drive.  We <Col N="1382" /> have in Cork City 2,300 applications from people who are anxious to cut turf.  Half of them could not be employed in the fuel drive, with the result that many of them have gone across to Britain.  I am not arguing that they should be kept here in the conditions of starvation which they experienced while they were here, but it is a fact that these people are facing the bombs and the submarines, the dangers and the hardships in Britain in order to get work there.  My contention is that if the Government plans its operations in regard to fuel, industries and whatever other schemes are available&mdash;and I have a number of schemes which I can give to the Taoiseach, to the Minister for Local Government or whatever Minister is concerned&mdash;these men need not go across to Britain.</P>
    <P>My information is that there are at present 30,000 men seeking passports to go to England.  The Government are well aware of that position and, side by side with that, we have large numbers of young men, the best of our young men, leaving the country to join the British Army to become cannon fodder for one of the belligerents. That is the position because the Taoiseach and his Government have not so arranged matters that these people would have&mdash;and they do not expect much more&mdash;frugal comfort in their own land by the work of their hands and their brains.  The only remedy for the position is to put people into useful employment in which they will have purchasing power in respect of the necessaries of life for themselves and their families.  There is very little use in talking of the family as a unit when families are being broken up, and when the head of the family has to go across to Britain to find work, or to join the British Army, so that he can send something home to keep his family.</P>
    <P>Does it not show a callous indifference to the whole principle of family life?  Is 14/- a week for a man, his wife, and five, six or seven children in a rural area, sufficient to provide the ordinary necessaries of life at present? Surely that is not the conception of family life that should obtain in a <Col N="1383" /> Christian Parliament.  We are looking complacently on at that position.  On the one hand we are told that the work is not there, that schemes cannot be got&mdash;and £500,000 has to go back into the Exchequer because schemes cannot be found on which to use the money&mdash;but, on the other hand, we are told that the money cannot be got.  The men, however, can be got, because they are there in thousands, ready and willing to work, and the work, I contend, is available.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1384" /> I want to come back again to this question of fuel.  In connection with the food and fuel problem, there was a system of parish councils set up some time ago, and I want to say to the Taoiseach that I cannot see any practical good being accomplished by those councils down in my constituency.</P>
    <P>Progress reported; Committee to sit again.</P>
