      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Neill</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he is aware that at the present time the control of our marine activities is scattered amongst various Departments, the Navy being under the Army, Mercantile Marine under Industry and Commerce, Sea Fisheries under Agriculture, our Nautical College under Education, etc.; and seeing that our national interests will now demand greater expansion of our commercial and defensive activities on sea, will he consider the advisability of co-ordinating the activities into one Department with one responsible administrative head.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The various services connected with marine matters are at present assigned to the Departments with whose functions they are, respectively, most closely related.  I am satisfied that no improvement in the efficiency of the services would be secured by concentrating them in one Department.  The existing arrangements provide for all necessary co-ordination between the Departments concerned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. O Ceallaigh) Seán T. O'Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. O Ceallaigh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the growing difficulty <Col N="2302" /> to which the Deputy refers. Tariffs are designed, as the Deputy is aware, to raise revenue and not solely to restrict imports.  Both the revenue and the protective aspects of tariffs are, however, issues of major importance, and, naturally, have to be considered in relation to the problem of supplies, which problem, in present circumstances at any rate, would not be solved by their removal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister will agree, even though he has jettisoned the Government's protection policy by that statement in which he claims that tariffs are for the purpose of revenue, that the supply problem would be simplified if there were no tariff obstructions in the way of getting supplies from abroad.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if his attention has been drawn to the Infant Aid Society Annual Report for 1940-41, in which it is stated that owing to the rise in the price of milk combined with the increase of unemployment and consequent increase in applicants for free milk, the society finds it hard to meet the demands made upon its resources; if, further, he is aware that at the present time a much greater supply of milk is required to off-set the shortage in other foodstuffs; that so far from being in a position to increase the amount distributed, the society has been obliged to curtail milk allowances, and if he will have the grant for that purpose increased so that the activities of the society may be extended.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether his attention has been directed to the inequity of the arrangement whereunder the Sugar Company delivers sugar carriage paid to certain stations on the Great Southern Railways and not to others, and whether he will represent to the Sugar Company the expediency of quoting delivered prices at every station on the railway system in Éire where goods traffic is handled.</P>

      <P>The matter raised in the question has been brought to my notice.  While I do not admit the implication in the question that the present arrangements are inequitable. I am prepared to ask the Sugar Company to consider these representations. I would like to point out to the Deputy, however, that the arrangements are matters within the competence of the company for settlement.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether he is aware of the growing difficulty of securing supplies of any sort, and, if so, why he retains in operation a series of quotas designed to restrict imports, and thus render the getting of supplies even more difficult than it already is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the first part of the question is in the affirmative. The second part of the question raises issues which cannot be satisfactorily disposed of by way of Parliamentary question and answer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the Minister's reply, I take it that he is not in opposition to the statement that quotas are designed to raise revenue. Seeing that this new Fianna Fáil defence for them is not available to him, can he argue with anyone, that when we find it difficult to get the wherewithal to cover our bodies and fill our stomachs the difficulties are not manifestly increased by the quota system?  When the British imposed a quota system on us, have we not loudly protested?  Why, then, do we impose a quota system on ourselves?  Is the Minister not aware that the Prime Minister, when addressing America on the radio, protested against the quotas put on us by Great Britain, and that his colleague, the Minister for Supplies, renewed these protests?  Why, then, does the Irish Minister for Industry and Commerce put quotas on himself?  Is there any defence for them, or are we gone daft?  I think we are.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture whether he is satisfied that the foot-and-mouth disease is now under control; and whether he has any reason to believe that the disease has at any time been deliberately spread by any person desiring to injure the State or serve any other ulterior motive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan) James Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The foot-and-mouth disease position at present may be regarded as well under control in all areas except County Kilkenny and County Tipperary (South Riding).  The position in the latter area has improved considerably, but the situation is not satisfactory in the east side of County Kilkenny.  The disease has been eradicated in Counties Donegal, Dublin, Meath, Wicklow, Kildare, Offaly, Clare and Limerick, and the position may also be regarded as satisfactory in the County Kerry and Laoighis areas.  There is no evidence to show that the disease has been deliberately spread.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as the Minister knows, there is no foundation for that allegation and, therefore, co-operation on the part of the farmers will effectively end the disease and there is no reason to apprehend that, if co-operation ends the disease, it will be maliciously spread thereafter?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne (Junior)</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Co-ordination of Defensive <Col N="2306" /> Measures if, in view of the facts that the number of air-raid wardens appointed in Dublin City is 740 short of the establishment and that in some areas &ldquo;auxiliary&rdquo; wardens are being enrolled, he will authorise the appointment to the official service of those auxiliary wardens in order that they may be fully trained and equipped.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Defence (Mr. Moylan)</NameTxt>
      <P>As I informed the Deputy in reply to a question on the 29th May, 1941, there are no such things as auxiliary wardens. As mentioned on that occasion, there are very few sectors in which the establishment for the wardens' service has been exceeded.  It is not practicable to utilise in one area the wardens which are surplus in other areas.  Recruitment for the wardens' service is still proceeding in the sectors where the establishments have not been reached.  The equipment available is to meet establishments only.  It is not, therefore, possible to equip wardens surplus to establishment in any sector.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne (Junior)</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Co-ordination of Defensive Measures if he will state on what basis the establishments for the various air-raid precautions service in Dublin are computed; what steps are being taken to enrol volunteers up to the numbers of the establishments, and if, as a result of recent experience, it is proposed to increase the establishment for any of the services.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>The establishments for the various air-raid precautions services in Dublin are in accordance with the schemes submitted by the corporation and approved, with amendments in a number of cases, on the advice of my technicians.  The volunteers for the various services are recruited by the Dublin Corporation, who are continuing their efforts to obtain the numbers required.  The intensity and effects of air raids which have been experienced during the present war were found to be in many ways unpredictable. As the result of experience, <Col N="2307" /> it has been decided to increase considerably the strength of the fire-fighting service and the rescue service in Dublin. The fire-fighting personnel has been increased from 686 to 760.  A national fire-fighting reserve consisting of six heavy self-propelled units and six large trailer units is also being formed at a convenient distance from Dublin to provide a reserve for the whole country.  The personnel for this service will be 78.  The strength of the rescue service has been increased from 350 to 600.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>The shelters being erected by the Dublin Corporation are to provide for people caught in the open during an air-raid and for people who live in unsafe dwellings.  Shelters for 30,000 people have been constructed in Dublin City.  I have during the past few weeks made a personal tour of the more congested districts in Dublin to determine the shelter requirements.  I propose this week to ask the corporation to provide shelters sufficient for the needs of these areas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Supplies (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I can fairly summarise most of the speeches made during the past two days in the debate on the Estimate for the Department of Supplies as expressing the view of Deputies that all our supply difficulties are due to that Department.  That was the easy course for Deputies who are concerned more with Party interests than national interests to take.  It appeared to excuse them from any obligation to think and even to excuse them from their duty to speak here on public problems in a constructive way.  I suggest, however, to those Deputies who took that easy course that, in doing so, they failed in their duty as public representatives.  I do not think that any Deputy in the House believes that it would have been possible for us to avoid shortages in overseas supplies and the economic and social consequences of such shortages, situated as we are, an island nation in the middle of the vast battlefield of the European war&mdash;not even if the Archangel Michael, instead of Deputy Lemass, occupied the post.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no other country in Europe which has avoided these difficulties. Some of them, neutral as well as belligerent, have had to contend with these difficulties in a much more acute form than we have experienced them. I can say that there is no country in the world, even those geographically far removed from the battle area, which has not been experiencing supply difficulties because of the war.  It is because the Government knew that these supply difficulties were inevitable and that administrative measures of considerable scope and magnitude would be necessary to cope with them <Col N="2311" /> that a separate Department of Supplies was set up.  That Department was given the function of organising the getting of supplies, if possible and where possible, the conserving of stocks and the regulation of distribution. It was charged also with the responsibility of endeavouring to cope with price and other problems which would inevitably result from scarcity.</P>
    <P>I have been told that because of my administration as Minister for Supplies I have lost whatever popularity I had in the country.  I am not very much concerned about that.  I knew better than most Deputies who spoke here yesterday what exactly was involved when I was asked by the Taoiseach to take the post as Minister for Supplies. I knew that in this Department there were going to be very few victories and many difficulties, that it would be my job to direct a losing battle, one in which the odds were entirely against us, where the most we could hope to do was to make our retreat as brief and as least costly as possible.  I knew that it would be my job to make plans in all the uncertainty of a war situation, knowing that almost inevitably the circumstances which we foresaw would not arise in the form which we foresaw them, that there would be developments that we could not foresee at all, and circumstances against which we could not provide.  I knew, further, that I would have to face here, after the event, the criticism of those who by then knew precisely what did happen, and who could pretend that they knew all the time what was going to happen and that they could have made precise plans that would meet the exact circumstances that did arise.</P>
    <P>It is now a commonplace for Deputies opposite to pretend that they knew all the time that the war was going to start and the course it was going to follow. I do not believe that.  I do not think they believe it themselves.  I feel certain there is nobody in the world who knew what these Deputies now pretend to have known, not even Herr Hitler.</P>
    <P>It is true that we foresaw the possibility of war and planned against it. <Col N="2312" /> We did not know when, or how or between whom, that war would develop, but we knew it might affect us and we tried in all that atmosphere of uncertainty to make the best plans we could to deal with the situation that might develop from it.  At the time we were making these plans, everybody in Europe who could claim to speak as an expert appeared to think that the war when it came would develop with exceptional rapidity.  Everybody thought it was going to take the form of a <i>blitzkrieg,</i> a lightning stroke in which the central European Powers would employ all their strength in an endeavour to crush their enemies as quickly as possible and procure a speedy decision.  Deputies opposite pretend that they knew that it was not going to take that form but, before the war actually started, that was the general impression.  It did not, however, happen in that way.  The war developed slowly and leisurely.  Not for some eight or nine months after it began, did it take the very serious form which is affecting us so considerably. We did not anticipate, and I am sure there are very few Deputies who anticipated, the rapid collapse of France.  Herr Hitler has said in public that he did not expect it.  He did not know, apparently, as much as Deputy Dillon or some of the leading lights of the Fine Gael Party.  We did not know for a certainty that Norway would be involved, that Greece would be involved, that these neutral States, who desired to remain neutral and on whose mercantile fleets we were depending for our supplies, were going to be engulfed in the vortex.</P>
    <P>I am sure it puzzles people to read in the Press speeches of Deputies opposite claiming that they knew all these things were going to happen, asserting that the Government should have known as Deputy Cosgrave said yesterday, apparently believing that we have a secret service at our disposal which beats the combined British and German secret service to a frazzle.  It is, I submit, a facetious way of approaching the problems with which this Dáil has to deal to make that pretence now of knowing all the time what was going to develop and trying to get people to think that if only they, with <Col N="2313" /> their knowledge and their wisdom, had been in charge of affairs here, the plans necessary to obviate hardship for our people would, of course, have been made.</P>
    <P>Deputy Norton said here yesterday that he and his Party had been urging us to buy ships.  Deputy Hickey said the same thing and the whole Labour Party, in this House and at their annual congress outside the House, have been trying to create in the public mind the idea that they were pressing all the time on the Government to buy ships knowing that ships were eventually going to be our greatest need. I have had the records of the House examined from the date on which the war started to the end of 1940 and not once during that whole period did a single member of the Labour Party mention the word &ldquo;ship&rdquo; in this House much less urge on the Government any course of action in relation to ships.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government decided, and, I think, for good reasons, not to purchase ships until there was no other course open to us.  We considered carefully the advantages and the disadvantages of acquiring a mercantile marine.  So long as it was possible for us to charter the vessels of other neutral nations to serve our needs, we decided that was the better <Col N="2314" /> course than to send ships bearing our flag into these dangerous waters, carrying with them all the risks to neutrality which were so great that even the great nation of America decided to enact a law prohibiting its ships from entering these waters rather than take the risks involved.  Deputies now know that the pool of neutral shipping eventually dried up.  When it began to dry up, we understood clearly that a situation was arising which would compel us to take the risks which we originally decided to avoid, if possible, to acquire ships, and to send these ships into the battle area bearing our flag.  We have done that.  We shall be discussing on another motion to-day the precise plans that were made in that regard, but I want Deputies to understand that if we hesitated at the beginning of the war to acquire a mercantile marine, and to take the course of action which circumstances finally forced us to take, there were good reasons for it.</P>
      <P>Deputy Mulcahy spoke here yesterday about the creation of a wheat reserve before the war.  I admit that I am amazed by Deputy Mulcahy's audacity.  I thought that if there was one Deputy who should not refer at all to this matter of building up a wheat reserve, it was Deputy Mulcahy. Deputy Dillon would have had some right to talk about it, because he alone of his Party in the months before the war appeared to give approval to the course which the Government was following. Deputy Mulcahy, who now criticises the Government for not having built up a larger reserve than was built up, who claims that we were at fault in not taking more strenuous action to fill the granaries of the country, moved to refer back the Estimate for the Department of Industry and Commerce, in the spring of 1939, in these words:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I have moved to refer this Estimate back because I want to protest against that element in the policy to which the Minister last referred in the laying in of imported stocks for an alleged national emergency here.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know that consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds, on the authority of Emerson, but surely the Deputy who <Col N="2315" /> had taken that definite line before the war is pushing audacity to its limits when he comes now, after the war has broken out, to criticise the Government for not having followed more vigorously and more thoroughly the policy which he condemned when they initiated it.  I do not know what Deputies opposite think should have been done before the war.  I announced here on 29th March, 1939, the policy on which the Government had decided, and not one Deputy rose to criticise it.  I told the House then that we were endeavouring to create a reserve of wheat sufficient in size, when taken in conjunction with the stocks normally held by millers and the native wheat crop, to carry us over one cereal year, one sowing and one harvest.  That is what we set out to do and that is what we did.  In fact, we found ourselves, at the beginning of the war, in a somewhat stronger position, and it is now, in 1941, nearly two years after the commencement of the conflict, that we are calling upon the reserve of wheat which we built up then.  It is that wheat which is feeding our country now and it is that wheat against the accumulation of which Deputy Mulcahy protested in 1939, and asked this House to support his protest by rejecting the Estimate for the Department.  Deputy Dillon who, I will admit, because he wishes to show his independence of the rest of the Party, occasionally takes a different line, took a different line on that occasion&mdash;&mdash;</P>

According to Deputy Dillon's speech yesterday, his view was that not merely should we not have attempted to build up a stock of wheat, but we should not have attempted to grow wheat.  We should have brought in, and stored in <Col N="2316" /> the country, flour sufficient to carry us on.</P>

      <P>So long as they are handing out abuse, criticism and misrepresentation, they are all happy, but as soon as somebody comes to expose their tactics, they lose their tempers and try to create disorder and to cause interruptions, so that the person exposing their tactics cannot be heard. However, let us leave the question of wheat reserves, which is so distasteful to Deputies opposite, and turn to some of the other criticisms made of the administration of the Department of Supplies and of the emergency supplies branch, of the Department of Industry and Commerce, for which I was responsible in the years before the war. Deputy Benson apparently thinks it is a criticism of my Department that we operated through private enterprise. He expressed that as a criticism of the Department.  I came here, before the war and after the war, and told the House that it was our policy to act through the private industrial and importing companies who ordinarily conducted the trade of this country, for we regarded it as our function to help them, financially, by means of increased credits from the banks, diplomatically, by means of representation to other Governments, if impediments to their trade were imposed and by our advice, if our advice was required. When they had difficulties in combining among themselves, we helped them to overcome these difficulties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our aim, in the years before the war, was to encourage and assist private enterprise to increase the stocks available in the country.  After the war started, I told the House here that it would be my policy to continue to function through private enterprise so long as possible.  Nobody criticised that then.  Is it being criticised now? It is quite true that private enterprise let us down in many respects, and in <Col N="2318" /> connection with some commodities we-had to establish central importing organisations because they appeared to be more suitable in overcoming the difficulties of the situation than a number of individual firms acting on their own.  It is true that some of the industrial and importing groups, whom we contacted before the war started, proved more enthusiastic and more efficient in bringing in additional supplies than others, and that some of them did not respond at all.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>What ones did not respond?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a fair enough question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>But nobody in this House or in the country should have had any doubt in their minds as to the line on which we were proceeding, because it was explained on more occasions than one.  I do not believe that State buying and State storing, as suggested by Deputy Davin, would have improved our position.  Even still, there are many commodities which we can obtain through the activities of private firms taking advantage of previous trade contacts in other countries, where State purchasing organisations would be of no avail.  That was true before the war, it has been true up to the present, and it is still true in relation to a number of commodities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another matter to which I want to refer, before I leave questions of the past and come to deal with questions of the present and the future, is the continuous misrepresentation by some Deputies opposite of the motives of the Government in giving advice last year to wholesalers and traders, to managers of institutions and private people, to lay in additional stocks.  It is now a commonplace tactic of certain members of the Fine Gael Party to represent that advice as having been given for the benefit of wealthy people so that they could forestall the rationing that we knew was coming.  We <Col N="2319" /> gave that advice when we had reason to believe that an invasion of this country was likely to take place in the very near future.  We knew that if an invasion did take place there would be wide areas in the country which might be isolated from sources of supply and where local stocks would be inadequate to maintain the necessaries of life for the population for any period of time, and there was no quicker or more effective method of securing the distribution of our stocks throughout the country than by getting wholesalers, traders, local authorities, and the managers of institutions to purchase and hold exceptional quantities of various essential goods.  We did that, not merely to prevent starvation arising in districts which might be isolated in the event of invasion, but also because we felt that there were undue risks in holding huge stocks of essential supplies, that could not be replaced, in a few centres that might be subjected to aerial attack.  These were the reasons that that advice was given.</P>
    <P>Deputies, surely, understand that the conditions created by a war cannot be static: that they are changing continuously. The danger of invasion, which appeared so acute in July last, did not materialise, but will any Deputy say that it has passed?  Will any Deputy say that, if we could do it, it would not still be advisable to secure that widespread distribution of essential stocks which we tried to achieve in a hurry last July?  Of course, it would, but we have not got the stocks now because there occurred a fundamental change in the course of the war between then and now, a change which left us bereft of shipping, and made it impossible for us to replace those stocks by imports from abroad, a change further emphasised by the decision of the British Government to withdraw the open general licence applying to exports to this country, which removed from imports to this country from Great Britain the restrictions that applied to similar goods exported from Great Britain to other countries.  We have had some discussion here in the course of the past couple of days.</P>

      <P>The Deputy has said that the words I have quoted are not in the Official Report.  I am going to prove that they are.  Let me proceed now.  Of course, Deputy Dillon will chance anything, but he will not get away with that.  In the course of the past few days we had a number of references to our trade relations with the United Kingdom.  Deputy Mulcahy said that I had made statements, and that other members of the Government had made statements, which suggested that the British were deliberately withholding supplies from us, and that the only reason I had for making these statements was to cover up my own incompetence.  Now, it is true that the British are withholding supplies from us, that they have made orders prohibiting the export of a number of classes of goods to this country, and that they withdrew the open licence which applied to all goods exported here, but I have never suggested that the action which they took to prevent or reduce supplies coming to us was taken for any reason except the exigencies of their own position.  I am not here to answer for the motives of the British Government, but I do know that, so far as we are concerned, the stoppage of supplies to this country <Col N="2322" /> has precisely the same effect, no matter what the motives may be.</P>
      <P>When that stoppage occurred in the case of tea, in the case of petrol, in the case of coal, in the case of a number of other commodities, Deputy Mulcahy said it was due to the incompetence of my Department.  I am prepared to agree with Deputy Mulcahy or with any other Deputy that it is not desirable that we should have wrangles here as to whether one or other belligerent is responsible for our circumstances. I have, as the Americans say, taken the rap for far more than Deputy Mulcahy will ever guess.  I have frequently here refrained from speaking of difficulties that had arisen, even when Deputy Mulcahy and other Deputies of the Fine Gael Party attributed these difficulties to my own incompetence, although I knew that they had been given all the facts in private.</P>

If there is going to be that form of co-operation, it has got to be a two-sided co-operation.  I, for one, have become thoroughly impatient of this trick of Fine Gael in urging reticence in utterance here, pleading the inadvisability of discussing various matters about which difficulties have arisen, and then <Col N="2323" /> proceeding in an attempt to put all the blame upon the Government, even when the whole truth is known to them.</P>

      <P>One other aspect of our trade relations in the United Kingdom was referred to at length by Deputy O'Higgins, Deputy Cosgrave and many Deputies opposite as well as by Deputy Norton of the Labour Party. They urged that I or some deputation of Ministers should go over to Great Britain.  It was suggested that we did not do so because of some difficulty arising out of our political past.  That was Deputy O'Higgins' suggestion.  I do not know on what grounds Deputy O'Higgins thinks that there is any hesitation on my part or on the part of the Government as a whole in establishing personal contact with British Ministers.  I personally have had negotiation with British Ministers on many occasions, in Great Britain and this country and elsewhere, since I came into office.  I went to Great Britain last year and entered into negotiations with a number of British Ministers in an effort to effect between the two countries a trade agreement that would cover the war situation.  I failed.  I think there are many Deputies in the House who know the reasons for that failure.  I will refer to them again if need be, but there is in that suggestion made by Deputy O'Higgins, and supported by Deputy Cosgrave and Deputy Norton, the implication that the British Government have got supplies of these goods of which we are short, surplus to their own requirements, which they are withholding from us for some reason of policy.  I do not know why or how they came to that conclusion.</P>

      <P>I want to make it clear that there is no hesitation about or no objection to going over to Great Britain for personal discussions with the British Ministers if we think that anything good is going to come of it, that any beneficial results will follow. It is quite clear that it must be for the decision of the Government whether the circumstances that will lead to beneficial results exist.  My Department is in daily contact with the appropriate Departments in Great Britain controlling the supplies in which we are interested.  We know, or believe that we know, what their position is in regard to these supplies.  Deputy Norton said here yesterday that the British have plenty of coal, tea, petrol and cocoa and we could get them if we only went over to England and asked for them.  Deputy Norton surely reads <Col N="2326" /> the public Press.  I am not asking him to rely upon any more reliable source of information, but when he makes a statement of that kind, a statement in flat contradiction of the statements made by their Ministers and reported in the Press, there is surely an obligation on him to explain why he will not accept their statements.  The British Minister for Mines, Mr. Grenfell, said in the House of Commons recently that for the past two months their production of coal was 500,000 tons per week below their requirements.  Does Deputy Norton believe that or is it his opinion that Mr. Grenfell was misleading the members of the British Parliament when he made that statement?</P>

      <P>When the British Government is announcing its intention not merely of applying a coal rationing scheme to its domestic consumers&mdash;that has been in force in many districts in England for a long time&mdash;but rationing industries, and when the British Press is talking about having to close down non-essential industries in order to save their coal for the industries associated with their war effort, is it not idle for Deputies to come here and convey the suggestion that there is plenty of coal in England, and that we could get it if we want it?

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that the British Government have stated to us that their supply position in respect of those commodities and a number of other commodities is so restricted that they cannot meet our requirements. What their exact position is I do not know.  We now have the British Government proceeding upon the same course that we had to follow in in creasing the extraction of flour from wheat.  They believe they will be able to keep their extraction at a lower point than we had to go to, but nevertheless it is foolish for Deputy Norton to suggest that in Britain there is such an abundancy of those goods that we can get all we want of them if only we will go over.  Deputy Norton said that we have supplies which the British want, and that we should go to the British Government and say: &ldquo;We will give you those supplies, if you will give us what we want.&rdquo;  As I have told the House, I was in Great Britain last year, and I met in conference all the British Ministers who are concerned with trade matters.  We tried to make an agreement upon some such basis as Deputy Norton had in mind, and we failed, because we found that in fact the British Government did not want our supplies, or that they were only prepared to take them at a price which we regarded as utterly uneconomic having regard to the costs of production here.  Deputies know that. What can we go to the British Government with as a bargaining factor to secure supplies of which they themselves are short?  What have we got that they so urgently require that they are prepared to go short of other goods in order to meet our needs?  Is it cattle?  Our cattle trade has stopped because of foot-and-mouth disease, but, even apart from that stoppage due to disease, there was an announcement by the British Government that they would be unable to take anything more than a proportion of the store cattle which they imported in previous years. They were prepared to take our surplus bacon and ham, but at a price which we regarded as unattractive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In any event, a situation will probably be reached by the end of this <Col N="2328" /> year in which we will have no surplus of bacon to export.  They were prepared, if we wished it, to take our surplus butter, but at a price so uneconomic that butter could not be exported to them except we were prepared to subsidise it, because its production at the price they were prepared to pay would be entirely impossible in the circumstances of this country.  Those are facts, and Deputies, when they come to discuss those problems, must deal with facts.  There is no utility in trying to build a policy for this emergency upon fancies.  Deputy Norton said that for every £3,000,000 worth of goods we sent to England we are only getting £2,000,000 worth back.  Now, misreading our trade and shipping statistics was, up to the present, the prerogative of Deputy Cosgrave.  If it is going to be the characteristic of all Opposition Party leaders, discussions in this House will cease to have any value.  Deputy Norton might study the trade and shipping statistics again; if he had gone to that trouble before making his speech in this House he would have found that that statement is incorrect.</P>
    <P>I want to turn now to more intimate problems, tea, petrol, coal, and the commodities about which Deputies expressed a number of opinions in the course of the past few days.  There was an attempt by Deputies Mulcahy and O'Higgins and some other Deputies to convey the suggestion that the rationing of tea in this country was unnecessary.  They pointed to the fact that we imported last year a somewhat larger quantity of tea than our average annual imports.  That is true.  The excess quantity was small, but there was an excess.  We decided to reduce the distribution of tea amongst the consumers here when we were notified that our future allocations were going to be reduced.  We were notified in January that our allocations were to be reduced to 75 per cent., subsequently to 60 per cent., and at a later date to 50 per cent. When the tea rationing scheme came into force on 4th April, we were planning on the basis of getting 50 per cent. and only 50 per cent. of our normal imports.  But shortly afterwards we were notified that we were going down <Col N="2329" /> to 25 per cent., and 25 per cent. of our normal imports permits only of a half ounce per head for everybody in our population.  It is quite true that there was a small reserve in hand, represented by that surplus importation of last year.  It is still in hand.  Is it the considered opinion of Deputies opposite that we should have let all that run out without attempting to impose restrictions upon its purchase so that we would be in the position of having only that tea which came in from week to week, passing into consumption immediately it came in?  I do not think that would have been a wise policy.</P>
    <P>The circumstances that we were endeavouring to plan against before the war and in the early stages of the war still exist.  We know from statements of British Ministers that they do not rule out of the realms of possibility an invasion of Britain.  If an invasion of Britain should be attempted, much less successfully attempted, there might be a period, even a protracted period, in which even the 25 per cent. of our normal supplies which we are now receiving would not come in, and we believe that that surplus importation of last year&mdash;that little reserve stock, small in relation to our normal consumption, but comparatively larger in relation to our present ration&mdash;should be held so that that ration could be kept up even if our imports should cease entirely for a period.  We are endeavouring, as I told the Dáil, to purchase substantial quantities of tea in the countries in which tea is produced, but, because the tea harvest is only coming in now and because it will take time to collect a cargo of the various blends of tea which must be brought in to produce a palatable beverage for our people, and to arrange for the shipping of that tea to this country, if we can arrange it at all, it will be some time before there can be any appreciable improvement in our position.  It is not true that substantial quantities of tea came into this country last year and passed out into the secret hoards of private individuals.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. D. Morrissey Mr. D. Morrissey">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>During the 12 months which preceded the introduction of rationing, sales of tea in this country were slightly less than normal.  It is probably correct that even in normal circumstances there is a fairly substantial quantity of tea held by traders throughout the country, and even by individuals throughout the country, but I feel certain that the quantity of tea which could be brought into a central pool, even if we used all the Army and all the police force to ransack every private dwelling, every institution, every convent, and every retail trader's shop in the country, would not be sufficient to make any appreciable difference in our tea ration.  It takes 1,000 chests of tea per week to give half an ounce of tea per head of the population here.  Deputies should appreciate the quantities that are involved. I do not believe, even if we sent out the Army and the police force upon such a mission, that we would get the whole of the tea that is available, and I am certain that we would not get enough to permit of any increase in the ration.  I am also certain that tea is being sold irregularly and illegally by some traders.  That is as certain as that we are just ordinary human beings in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure also that, for that tea sold illegally, fantastic prices&mdash;5/-, 6/-, 7/- and 8/- a lb.&mdash;are being asked and are being paid.  I do not know by what machinery we can check that.  The people who are selling that tea are breaking the law and the people buying it are breaking the law.  It is because each party to the transaction has entered into a conspiracy against the law that these fantastic prices can be asked and obtained.  It is because each of them has an interest in keeping the transaction quiet that there is no prospect of evidence being forthcoming which could be produced in a court to secure a conviction of one or other of the parties if put on trial.  I do not believe that these transactions are as widespread as is suggested, and I think it is not in the public interest that the idea should be conveyed here that these exceptional prices for tea are common, as traders working upon a <Col N="2331" /> normal basis of profit within the law may be led to believe from these statements that everybody else is getting these high prices and that they should try to do the same.</P>
    <P>Deputy Byrne appealed to me to increase the tea ration.  There is nothing I would like to do better than increase the tea ration, but it is useless for any Deputy merely to appeal that something should be done.  I would like to do that as well as Deputy Byrne or any other Deputy.  It is no pleasure to me to have to curtail the deliveries of tea to the people of this country&mdash; and especially to the poorer people. However, there was behind that appeal some suggestion that we were withholding tea from the people deliberately. Nothing could be further from the truth.  The little reserve stock that we have is being held for the reason I have mentioned&mdash;because we think it is wiser, in the interests of the people, to hold it.  If there is any improvement in our position, the benefit of that improvement will go at once to the people in the form of an increased ration, even if that increased ration is only for one week in four.</P>

      <P>Deputy Norton suggested that we should give a differential ration.  He said it was wrong to give the same allowance to people in Townsend Street as to people in <Col N="2332" /> Merrion Street.  That is very attractive, as the people in Townsend Street will think that Deputy Norton is trying to get more tea for them and, of course, the Deputy will not commit himself to an opinion as to who should be deprived in order to get them more tea.  That would be the dirty job of the Minister for Supplies, if the plan were adopted.  However, we can examine the question in detail.  I presume that Deputy Norton would propose to increase the ration to the Townsend Street people&mdash;as I would like to do&mdash;to one ounce per week. The quantity we have to distribute is fixed; the number of people in the country is known; and if we are to give one ounce instead of half an ounce to one half of the people the other half will get none.  Which half is it to be?</P>
      <P>There are 2,900,000 people, and we can put them in various categories. There are 670,000 engaged in agriculture: is it Deputy Norton's idea to leave the farmer or farm labourer without tea?  If not, that 670,000 must get a share.  There are 173,000 employed in other productive occupations&mdash; workers in various industries&mdash;and it will be agreed that they must get their share.  Apart from those employed in industry, 461,000 are employed on transport, in commerce and in domestic service or similar occupations&mdash;non-productive occupations&mdash;and as they are all workers I am sure Deputy Norton will agree they also must get their share of whatever tea is available. These three groups come to 1,300,000 out of the 2,900,000.  Let us examine the balance.  There are 807,000 children under 14.  Are we to deprive them? Are they to get none?  Is it at their expense that the ration is to be increased for the rest of the population? If not, add them to the 1,300,000 and that leaves 859,995 not gainfully occupied. That is the census description, but the housewife who keeps the home, does the washing and cooks the meals is included in that figure.  There are 551,000 women engaged in home duties. Their claim to a share in any tea available is at least as strong as that of any other section of the population.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2333" /> The balance is made up of old age pensioners, invalids, people in mental homes and hospitals, and other descriptions of that kind.  It is quite clear that, if there is any section of the population so situated that their claims upon our tea supplies can safely be regarded as less strong, the number in that section is so minute that it would make no appreciable change in the situation which would result from depriving them of their tea supplies.  Of course, Deputy Norton can say that we should proceed on another basis of calculation and have regard, not to the occupation of the individual or his mode of livelihood, but to the amount of his means.  It is a very simple matter to compare the millionaire with the unemployed worker&mdash;anyone can see the distinction&mdash;but where are we to draw the line?  At what point in the social scale are we to put the pointer and say that those above the line get no tea, and those below get a ration? Where would Deputy Norton himself come in?  If that situation is to be seriously discussed&mdash;and I am prepared to discuss it seriously if Deputies agree &mdash;those who advocate it must work out their ideas in greater detail and tell us precisely how we are to distinguish between one person and another.</P>

      <P>The number living alone is a different matter.  We got some surplus tea, and we gave extra rations to the St. Vincent de Paul Society, to night hostels, to charitable organisations running cheap meals, to bog workers, and other organised groups of workers who have to carry out their daily labours a considerable distance from their homes, and to certain railway workers whose duties upon the railways take them a long way from their homes.  I think that type of differential distribution is the only one that is practicable and fair, having regard to the very limited quantity of tea that is there, and to the problems <Col N="2334" /> inevitably associated with any scheme of differential distribution.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It might be, but it would be a very difficult matter from the administrative point of view.  I do not want Deputy Murphy to be left under the impression that I had told the House that the quantity of tea which we now have surplus, which we are distributing in the manner I have mentioned, and which came from America, was brought in by the Department of Supplies.  It was brought in by a private firm and taken under our control for utilisation in that way.  But we are setting up a central purchasing company for the purchase and importation of tea on the lines of the company now operating in connection with grain, and other similar companies, and those associated with the company have already purchased in the United States a quantity of tea for the transhipment of which we have made arrangements.  That quantity will not, however, be sufficiently large to affect the ration, but it will be an addition to our reserves and will possibly permit of an expansion of the differential distribution to which I have referred.  It is upon that company that we will have to rely to finance and arrange for the larger shipment from India which we hope to make later.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That has been the position since the arrangement with the British Government terminated. <Col N="2335" /> Under that arrangement the British Government had undertaken to give us the whole of our tea supplies, 100 per cent. of our normal imports, and we agreed to buy only from their tea control organisation.  While that arrangement operated, we prohibited our importers from buying elsewhere than through the British tea control organisation. It was only when the arrangement with the British Government ended that private firms here were encouraged to seek tea elsewhere and arrangements were made by the Department to procure tea elsewhere.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I prefer not to talk on that subject now.  The people who are making the purchases of tea are the most competent persons we can get in the country.  They are fully alive to the type of tea that is usually consumed here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to refer to petrol, and, perhaps, before going on to deal with the present position, I might make reference again to Deputy Dockrell's criticism, relating to an earlier period, of our failure, as he described it, to build additional storage tanks.  I have pointed out that if we covered the whole country with storage tanks, not one additional gallon of petrol would have been available in consequence, and that the existing storage tanks have never been full since the war started.  There is, on the part of the oil companies supplying us, or those who are directing the policy of these companies, apparently a view that there should be no stocks of petrol here.  Possibly the decision not to facilitate the accumulation of petrol stocks here was due to the belief that, in the existing conditions of scarcity, stocks should not be allowed to accumulate anywhere.  Perhaps it is due to another reason, but the position since the beginning of the war was that our supplies were regulated in relation to the stocks available, and when we restricted the ration allowed to consumers <Col N="2336" /> in order to acquire stocks, our action was offset by a reduction in the next consignment.  That is still the position, and it is impossible for us to take any action which will result in the accumulation of any reserves of petrol here.  There is nothing we can do about it.</P>
    <P>We are entirely dependent for our supplies upon the oil companies operating here.  If they, for any reason, fail to supply, there is no alternative source open to us.  That fact must be understood. When Deputy Morrissey asked me yesterday if I could give any assurance that there will be petrol available in this country to move the wheat, the beet and the peat which will require transportation during the year, I knew that the only answer I could give him was that no such assurance could be given.  The only assurance that would be worth having would be a stock of petrol here.  We have been told by the oil companies that petrol will come in. They have submitted figures indicating the total quantity of petrol that we may hope to have delivered during the year, and they set out the amount they hope to bring in each month.  Our position is that we have to utilise that monthly quota of petrol to the best advantage, having regard to the needs of the month.  If, therefore, there will be an exceptional demand for petrol for moving the grain harvest or the beet and peat, then in these months, while that exceptional demand exists, there will have to be a curtailment of the utilisation of petrol by everybody else. Deputy Corry said that if there is not enough petrol&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Yes, but the reserves for defence purposes are not available to us.  Deputy Corry said that petrol was being given for private motors during the present month and he suggested that if there was not likely to be any petrol available for the harvest, supplies should not be given to private motorists now.  If I have made the position clear to Deputies they will understand that the non-issue of licences for private cars, or the non-utilisation of petrol now made available to private car owners, would not have resulted in any improvement in our position.  That has been so for months past, and it is still the position.  I am sure the oil companies will do everything they can to give effect to their promises.  I feel reasonably confident that we will be able to control the position but, of course, there may be developments in the war and in circumstances outside the control of the oil companies, which will make it impossible for them to fulfil their promises, in which case there will be no petrol available.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite simply.  We had accumulated it by a process of reducing the monthly allocation to users of petrol.  It was not a very large supply, but was sufficient to keep us going over any emergency period.  But by the simple process of leaving us for one month without any supply that reserve was absorbed.  No petrol came to this country during the month of May.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think so.  It is impossible to deal with all the ramifications <Col N="2339" /> of this problem in the course of a speech here, but it has been made clear to us that the policy of storing petrol will not be facilitated.  Much the same consideration applies in the case of paraffin.  I appreciate as much as any Deputy the hardship which the absence of paraffin for domestic purposes causes in wide areas.  I do not know whether Deputies agree with me or not in the course I am taking.  We utilised already for agricultural purposes a larger quantity of paraffin than we considered would be necessary. We have been informed by the oil companies of the quantity of paraffin we would get in each month of the year and we have already exceeded that quantity.  We were consequently notified that we would have to make good the excessive amount used, and if we did not make an attempt to do so, by curtailing distribution now, then we would be left short in the months of July, August, September and October and the gathering of the harvest would be made an intensely difficult matter.  We decided we would try to make it good by curtailing supplies for other purposes at this time of the year mainly for domestic purposes, so that we could be sure of having for harvesting purposes the quantity required on the basis of our estimate.  I think, having regard to the situation in which we find ourselves, it is a better policy to make sure of gathering the harvest rather than giving the minimum of domestic lighting in areas that are now without it.  In each of these matters the problem for us was to choose between two evils.  It is sometimes not as easy as it sounds to choose the lesser when we try to do so, but there is no possibility of escaping one or the other.  Our situation in that regard has not become easier.</P>

Deputy Crowley referred to supplies of fuel oil for fishing.  During the months up to June the quantity of fuel oil given to owners of fishing boats was in fact slightly more than the quantity they used for the corresponding months last year.  The allocation had to be reduced for June.  I dealt at some length yesterday with the fuel oil position.  Of all petroleum products, we are being most severely curtailed in the matter of fuel oil, and must take drastic measures to curtail the use of it.  I am not without hope that there may be some improvement in that position. If so I will endeavour to ensure that the fishermen in whom Deputy Crowley is interested and also other fishermen will get the maximum amount of fuel oil possible.</P>

      <P>That is so, to some extent, but there are other problems which do not appear on the surface. Whether our coal position or the fuel oil position is the more difficult is hard to decide.  At the present time with my advisers I am considering most urgently ways and means of reducing the consumption of electricity, because the quantity of coal used for generating electricity is very considerable, and is eating substantially into the supplies available.  So far as I know, no system has been yet devised in any country for the rationing of electricity: nevertheless, we will have to curtail its use in whatever way we can, either in public transport, public lighting shop lighting or for industrial purposes.</P>

If you take off the buses you will have to increase the number of trams, and if you take off the trams you would have to increase the number of buses.  The fact that different services are operating does not mean that there is wastage, but, as I indicated, a curtailment of the transport service in Dublin is inevitable.

We may have to face a winter in which no coal at all will be available.  I hope that will not be the position.  I know that the British Mines Department which, up to the present, has been most helpful in trying to meet our difficulty, despite the difficulties they have themselves, have told us that they will endeavour to ensure that whatever supplies can be released to us will be made available, but facing the difficulties which are arising now, at a period of the year when difficulties should be least, and knowing that the winter is going to be a period of still greater difficulty, that possibility cannot be ignored.</P>

Whatever possibility there is of getting fuel oil, there is none whatever of getting either new tram rails or new overhead copper wire.  Reference was made to an announcement in the Press concerning coal for threshing engines. I think that matter was explained by the Minister for Agriculture yesterday. Deputy Corry waxed fairly eloquent in denouncing my Department for issuing the notice, and said that it must have been done by some official there who had never been outside the office and knew nothing about farming.  If the Deputy had taken the trouble to read the whole of the notice he would have found that it was issued by the Department of Agriculture, a Department which, presumably, knows something about farming.  It is the Minister for Agriculture who has responsibility for all matters connected with the harvesting of the season's crops.  I understand from him that the object of the notice was to arrive at some estimate of the coal requirements in each area so that the farmers will be in a position to buy the coal which will be required by the owners of the threshing mills.  Deputy Esmonde spoke concerning the use of timber for fuel.</P>

      <P>I am not at all trying to under-estimate the problem that we are facing.  I want to assure the Deputy that the matter is being discussed by my Department with the departments which are more directly concerned. The exact line of demarcation between the functions of the Department of Supplies and the functions of other departments, is not I think, understood by some Deputies.  The Department of Supplies, so far as internal production is concerned, comes into the picture only after the process of production has been completed.  For example, the Department of Agriculture is responsible for the production of agricultural goods and the harvesting of agricultural products.  At that stage we come in to regulate distribution of the goods produced.  The Department of Industry and Commerce is responsible for the production of industrial goods.  We come into the picture in the matter of regulating their distribution. The Department of the Board of Works is responsible for the production of turf and because in the case of turf the problem of production could not be dissociated from the problem of distribution and price control, the whole of that job has now been given to Deputy Hugo Flinn.  With each of these separate Departments we are concerned.</P>

      <P>Last year we were in a much happier position than we are in this year, but even so, in certain parts of the country, it was very difficult to obtain transport for the harvest. I suggest to the Minister that, at the moment, we have a great number of lorries that are not serviceable lying up all over the country.  If a register was taken of them they might be put into a serviceable condition at small cost for this year.  I have been told that quite a considerable quantity of railway rolling stock, which for a number <Col N="2344" /> of years has been lying on railway sidings and in the backyards of railways, could, if some little repairs were carried out, be made serviceable for this year.

      <P>I want to refer now to the use of timber for fuel which was mentioned by Deputy Esmonde, and to say that a great deal of attention has been given to the matter.  At the present time scrub wood is being cut in a number of State-owned forests through the good offices of the Minister for Lands.  It is hoped to accumulate about 100,000 tons of firewood by next winter.  I am strongly of the opinion that such timber should be stored against next winter's needs, and not used now.  I realise that, in certain districts where there is a coal shortage and no turf within a reasonable distance, current requirements may have to be met by the use of timber.  As a general principle the maximum amount of timber should be cut for storage. There seems to be a false impression about that there is an unlimited amount of timber suitable for firewood. While there is a substantial amount, having regard to the large normal consumption of coal, there is nothing like a sufficiency of timber to replace all the coal that is required.  My Department has got in touch with the owners of private woods.  A fair number of those owners have offered to us standing timber free, and I want to take this opportunity of expressing to them <Col N="2345" /> my appreciation of their public-spirited action in the matter.  Where those owners so desire, arrangements can be made for the felling of the timber and its removal through the services of Fuel Importers, Éire, Ltd.</P>
      <P>Reference was made to the prohibition of the export of pit props.  There was the suggestion that their export was inadvisable, having regard to our coal difficulties.  It was even suggested, I think, that our coal difficulties were in some way associated with the prohibition of these pit props.  So far, no representations have been made to me by anybody in authority in Great Britain, associated with coal mining, concerning the prohibition or the export of pit props.  If any such representations are made, I will, naturally, consider them very carefully.  I have no desire whatever to embarrass the coal mining trade in Great Britain.  As I said before, the quantity of pit props available in this country is limited.  It is, in fact, very small in relation to the quantity normally used in Great Britain, but still it represents a quantity of material that will burn. Frankly, I feel reluctant to let any kind of fuel that will burn out of the country, having regard to the very serious fuel situation which we are facing. Anything that will burn will be of value to us in view of the situation that we may be faced with before next winter is over.  Therefore, we have felt it desirable to prohibit the export of these pit props.  Permits are being given to people who were engaged in this business pre-war to export pit props from the country.  I am prepared to reconsider the whole policy if there is any desire to that effect expressed by the appropriate mining authorities in Great Britain.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly.  Before I go on to deal with some questions concerning prices, I want to refer to the question of white flour which agitated Deputy Dillon and some other Deputies yesterday.  Deputy Dillon suggested that we should abolish all tariffs and, <Col N="2346" /> then, he put in this qualification&mdash;&ldquo;except the tariff on flour.&rdquo;  Frankly, I cannot see the logic of that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that the Minister is honestly misunderstanding what I said.  What I said was that you ought to allow honest merchants to buy flour wherever they can get it and that you ought to forbid the smuggler to steal English subsidised flour&mdash;flour which they have subsidised for consumption by their own people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>If we can get flour legitimately anywhere, we shall be glad to get it but, frankly, we cannot get it. As to the removal of all tariffs, we have a number of tariffs on articles the exportation of which is prohibited by Great Britain as the exportation of flour is prohibited by them.  With regard to the flour situation, I do not want to be put into the position of having to prosecute people found importing flour.  I felt that that would be a ridiculous position in which to find myself.  The flour situation at the time the Minister for Industry and Commerce removed the restrictions on the importation of flour was much more serious than it is now.  Because of the measures we took to conserve the supply of flour and because of the response of the public to the appeals made to them not to waste flour, we have got out of the very dangerous position in which we appeared to be at the beginning of the year&mdash;that of not having enough wheat to last until the harvest.  We know now that we have enough wheat to last until the harvest and I think the Department of Supplies deserve a little congratulation on their handling of that situation. Because of that, it is no longer of any importance to us whether we get in white flour or not.  Whether I make an order admitting white flour or prohibiting its importation will not make the slightest difference.  It will come in anyhow.  Those who are bringing it in are breaking the law in the place from which it comes and they will not mind breaking the law here.  They may charge an extra 1/- a stone for their trouble.</P>

      <P>If I were to make an order fixing a lower price for that flour, either of two things would happen&mdash; the flour would stop coming in, in which case nobody would be better off, or the order would not be obeyed, and the Deputy knows that one cannot make an order of that kind effective. I could make an order prohibiting the sun from shining or directing the moon to shine green, white and yellow, and it would be just as effective as to try to fix a maximum price for a commodity imported in that particular way.  The order would simply not be effective.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I want Deputies to point out to me, if they can, the fallacy of this argument: We guarantee to everybody a sufficiency of flour at a controlled price.  If we can get further quantities of white flour which must, in our circumstances, be regarded as a luxury product, only at prices higher than the price fixed for our own flour, it does nobody any harm.  People may be annoyed by the knowledge that the flour is available, here and there, at that price; they may even be annoyed at the thought that somebody is making a profit out of it, but the mere keeping of it out is not going to improve our position one way or the other, and I do not see why we should make an order which is going to be completely ineffective, in any event. The flour position next year may be more difficult than it is at present, and we may have to face the problem of mixing barley and oats with the loaf. I saw a specimen loaf, produced here, containing an admixture of 15 per cent. barley.  I am glad to inform the House that it looks much better than the loaf we are getting at the moment.  I do not know whether our position will improve sufficiently to maintain the all-wheaten loaf on a lower extraction than that which at present obtains.  I told the House that we arranged to have wheat from America brought in in our own ships, and that we had brought <Col N="2348" /> some thousands of tons of wheat to Lisbon in American ships for transfer here.  The House will be glad to know that the first cargo arrived here yesterday.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That cargo of wheat will enable me to illustrate to the House exactly the size of the problem with which we have to deal.  There were about 2,500 tons in that cargo. We require, to maintain the minimum consumption of bread and flour, more than 1,000 tons per day.  That figure will help Deputies to appreciate the size of the problem we have to contend with in maintaining a sufficiency of flour and bread for our people.  The consumption is substantially in excess of 1,000 tons per day and these ships can only bring 2,000 or 3,000 tons each. The bulk of our wheat will, therefore, have to be our own production.  We do not know what our production will be, but we are hopeful that the quantity available for milling into flour will not be less than 300,000 tons.  If it is less, there will be no possibility of avoiding the admixture of other cereals with wheat for the production of flour, no matter how successful our importation plans may prove to be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One other misunderstanding which I want to correct concerns sugar.  It is true that I mentioned the illegal exportation of sugar but I did not intend to leave the House under the impression that that illegal exportation of sugar was the only reason, or the main reason, why we have placed restrictions on the delivery of sugar from the Sugar Company to the traders.  These restrictions were imposed mainly because of the excess withdrawals which took place prior to the Budget. A substantial quantity of sugar went out from the Sugar Company to wholesale and retail traders in the weeks prior to the introduction of the Budget. That sugar is available in the country. It is desirable, from everybody's point of view, that it should be got back under control and the only way to do that is by limiting deliveries of sugar to those traders in the next couple of months sufficiently to ensure that they <Col N="2349" /> will get over the whole period only their normal quantity of sugar. Because they got an excess quantity in the early part of the period, they will have to accept a reduced quantity in the later part of the period.  That is the main reason why the restrictions were imposed.  Further restrictions may be necessary.  We may think it desirable to adopt a rationing scheme for sugar even if the ration be the full, normal quantity that is usually bought by individuals.  Circumstances might arise&mdash;and perhaps arise suddenly&mdash; which would jeopardise our position. We are depending on the operation of four factories to make sugar out of the beet grown in the country.  Even assuming that we can get the requisite quantity of beet in the country, there is always the possibility that, for some reason or other, one or more of these factories may go out of production. We could not now replace the machinery in them if that machinery were damaged.</P>

We feel that we are safe for 12 months ahead, and possibly longer, but we do not know how long the war will last. I notice that somebody foretold recently that it would be a 30 years' war. If it is, we shall have other problems concerning sugar to tackle, if not more serious problems.</P>

      <P>I propose to deal with all the questions regarding prices at the same time.  Reference was made to the display of price lists in shops. It is the law, not under the Emer gency Powers Act, but under ordinary peace time legislation, that these price lists be displayed.  I know, as a result of what has been said here and because of representations made elsewhere, that, in many districts, the <Col N="2350" /> law is not being observed.  I am going to get it observed, and I have given instructions to my officers to institute proceedings against any trader who is not carrying out the requirements of the law in this connection.  The price lists are to include bread, milk, cheese, eggs, butter, oatmeal, jams, sugar, meat, including sausages and puddings, potatoes, and other vegetables, apples, and other fresh fruits.  The law requires the current prices at which these things are being sold in a shop to be displayed in a prominent position, visible from the street.</P>

      <P>Bacon is not included, but sausages are.  There are a number of cuts in a side of bacon and the difficulty of enforcing an order relating to the prices of the various cuts is obvious.  I know that in the last war traders were compelled to publish a diagram of a pig with the prices marked on each part of the pig, but I do not think that that proved a very effective form of control.  I am considering the possibility of extending, by order, the list of goods in respect of which prices must be displayed.  I have now got a substantial number of outdoor officers attached to my Department and they are being given explicit instructions to see that such lists are displayed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, and they are quite successful.  The next matter to which I wish to refer is a question raised by Deputy Dillon about oatmeal.  He said that he got only 8/- per barrel for his oats.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I should be greatly surprised if an enterprising businessman like the Deputy were satisfied with that price.  The facts are that the oatmeal millers cannot get oats at a lesser price than £20 per ton.  They had to get oats <Col N="2351" /> from Grain Importers, Limited.  The market price for oats is £20 per ton, that is 30/- a barrel.  At that price oatmeal would cost £43 per ton, as it takes two tons of oats to make one of oatmeal. We made an arrangement with Grain Importers, Limited, who had bought oats some months ago, as a result of which they are now supplying oats to oatmeal millers at £15 per ton. It is due to that arrangement that oatmeal can be sold at about £32 per ton at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Then I wish the Deputy would report that to my Department. We made an arrangement that oats would be supplied to millers at a price below the market price in order to keep the price of oatmeal down to the fixed figure.  I want to refer to the matter mentioned by Deputy Hickey in regard to the purchase of a file.  Deputy Hickey bought a file in Dublin for keeping correspondence, at 7½d.  He then went down to Cork, and for the same file he was asked to pay 1/3.  In normal times Deputy Hickey would have told the shop proprietor to go to hell, himself and his file, and would have gone out of the shop and bought a file elsewhere.  However, he did not do so on this occasion.  He paid his money, snapped up the file, and said to himself: &ldquo;Think of all the fine speeches I can make in the Dáil about this.&rdquo;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I say that there is a duty, not only on members of the Oireachtas, but on ordinary citizens, to <Col N="2352" /> protect themselves against over-charging of that kind.  We investigated the complaint made by the Deputy in this case, and we got the explanation from the shopkeeper that his assistant had mixed up one file with another, and he was glad to make a refund of the overcharge. However, that was a waste of time for my Department, and I do not want the time of my Department to be wasted with matters of that kind.  I want the House to understand that we are going to concentrate on essential things, and that we cannot be expected to protect citizens in trivial matters of that kind.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I want it to be understood that we cannot be expected to deal with all sorts of trivial complaints of that kind, where the parties concerned might reasonably have been expected to protect themselves.  As I am telling the House, there are a whole lot of these non-essential articles concerning the price of which we have not got time to agitate ourselves, so the public will have to adopt their own methods of protecting themselves, by buying their goods elsewhere, or in some other manner.  We admit the obligation to investigate every complaint, and to take suitable action to deal with over-charging for essential or near-essential articles.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The suggestion has been thrown out here that all prices have gone up and that the control exercised by the Department of Supplies over prices has been ineffective. I tried to explain here yesterday that the only control which my Department can exercise is over avoidable costs. We cannot prevent prices going up when costs are unavoidably rising, but we do prevent rising prices where there are avoidable costs, and the impression that prices have gone up all round is unfounded.  So far as milk, butter, cocoa, condensed milk, stout, beer, whiskey, porter and other alcoholic <Col N="2353" /> drinks are concerned, prices are the same as last year.</P>
      <P>I want to refer particularly to the question of milk because the sincerity of Deputies in this House and their representations concerning prices are going to be put to the test fairly soon in this matter of the price of milk.  We have fixed a maximum price for fresh milk sold throughout the country.  That price order has been openly defied in certain towns&mdash;Dundalk, and to some extent in Mullingar.  That defiance may spread.  Milk suppliers in these areas are not merely refusing to supply milk at that price, but they are taking steps to ensure that anybody who demands milk at the legal price will not get any milk.  That movement will have to be resisted.  It is going to involve, perhaps, drastic action in order to ensure that that type of resistance to maximum price orders does not spread.  This is the first case we have had of organised resistance to maximum price orders, and if we are going to rely on these orders to keep the price position under control, we cannot tolerate opposition to price orders.  I hope I can rely on the co-operation and active assistance of all Deputies in enforcing measures designed to give effect to the maximum price order for the supply of milk.  We have told the parties concerned that if they can show that the price is unfair to them, that it is out of relation to the cost of production, the price will be changed, but that meanwhile they have to obey the order.  I think Deputies will agree that we should require proof in a case of that kind before permitting the price to consumers to be increased.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>We have not promised, and do not promise, that there will be no increase in prices.  That is not possible. There must be increases.  All the goods which come in which have to be transported are costing us many times more than they cost before the war.  The costs of production here, where materials imported from abroad are involved, have necessarily increased. These prices must go up.  I cannot compel people to remain in business at a loss.  They will have to recover unavoidable increases in cost. Even though we exercise rigorous control, allowing only the approved increases <Col N="2357" /> in cost to be reflected in prices, nevertheless a substantial rise in the price level must result.  It may be that the price level will rise, despite the control, to the point at which it will cause serious concern in consequence of its social reactions, but that problem cannot be met by price control, and Deputies who try to suggest that it can be met by price control alone are, as I said yesterday, confusing and not helping thought on the matter.</P>
      <P>Deputy Davin was somewhat perturbed by the fact that we have not had any prosecutions for overcharging, and he considers it the acid test of the efficiency of any system of price control that the number of people who break the law, and are prosecuted for breaking the law, should be going up.  I do not regard that as the acid test, but I want to explain to the House that price control takes three forms.  You can have maximum price orders which have the force of law.  The charging of prices in excess of those fixed by these orders is an offence, and, given evidence sufficient to support prosecution, the people concerned will be prosecuted. You have also price control by means of price arrangements entered into with manufacturing companies and importing and distributing companies.  These price arrangements relate generally to commodities which cannot be conveniently dealt with by maximum price orders.  In their case, the total profits which they are allowed to make in the year are fixed, but, within that overriding limitation, they can manipulate their own prices to a limited extent.  You have then a wide range of commodities concerning which no supervision over the prices to be charged can be exercised in advance, where you can come in only after the sale has taken place and for the purpose of rectifying any wrong that may have been done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Somebody did suggest yesterday that the prices charged in retail shops in Dublin should be supervised.  I cannot contemplate sending an inspector of my Department into some of the department stores for the purpose of inspecting the prices at which articles are <Col N="2358" /> to be sold and determining whether these are reasonable or not.  That is not practicable.  In the case of commodities of that kind, which are sold in a wide variety of design, quality and price, it is possible to exercise supervision only after a complaint has been lodged that an excessive price has been charged.  As I said, in relation to some of these commodities, we may eventually be able to reach a position in which maximum price orders can be made by the process of reducing the number of varieties and qualities, and in certain cases fixing a standard quality.</P>
    <P>The suggestion was made that we should have a standard price and quality for tea.  I am not in favour of it.  By a standard price for tea is meant an average price, and the effect of a fixed average price for tea is to increase the price of the cheapest tea, the tea bought, and still bought despite difficulties of supply, in many shops by the poorer sections of the community. The only advantage is secured by those who pay the highest price for tea, who, when the average price comes into operation, will get their tea cheaper. I, therefore, do not favour the fixing of a standard price for tea, because I think it will inflict hardship upon a large number of people and still only benefit those who least require the assistance of the State to protect them. We have fixed instead the maximum margin of profit which can be made by the retailer.  That was the average margin of profit taken by retailers pre-war. That figure was determined after consultation with organisations of traders and examination of their accounts. I know that a number of traders say that the margin is too small&mdash;Deputy Dillon thinks it is too small&mdash;but it seems from the information available to us to have been the average pre-war margin, and we are trying to maintain pre-war margins of profits, even in the case of commodities such as tea, in respect of which the turnover possible to a trader is now substantially reduced.</P>
    <P>It can be argued that that is unfair and that a trader who can now sell <Col N="2359" /> only one-fifth of the quantity he sold pre-war should be allowed a larger margin of profit to make up for the lost trade.  We are trying to restrict that tendency in a number of cases&mdash; we will not be able to do it in every case&mdash;and, in the case of tea, we think it is not unreasonable to impose that restriction.  I know it is going to be appallingly difficult to prove an offence against that order, because it will always be difficult to relate the tea purchased on an individual sale to the various varieties of tea which may have been purchased by a trader on various dates previously, but, by having that order in existence, it becomes possible to exercise some check on the prices charged.  Up to the present, a trader could charge any price for tea, and, if he got away with it, could feel certain that he was immune from prosecution because he was breaking no law.  He cannot have that immunity now by reason of this order.  The charging of a price involving a profit margin in excess of 6d. a lb. is an offence and if, on investigation, it is found to have taken place, will lead to prosecution and possibly to a cancellation of the tea trader's licence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one question I should like to put to the Minister.  If we are to take the average rate of profit on parcels of tea, it must be remembered that the minimum size of parcels of tea before the war would be ¼ lb., or mainly ½ lb packets.  How is the margin of profit to be regulated now where, in fact, the tea is now parcelled out in ½ ounce or even one ounce packets?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a point that was made by the Tea Traders' Organisation before the Department.  I am quite prepared to admit the force of that point, but we have got to take other considerations into account, and I do not think it is unfair to ask the traders to carry <Col N="2360" /> some portion of the burden, having regard to the fact that, under the present regulations their customers are now tied to them, and that in consequence of that their trading position has not disimproved, but, on the contrary, probably has improved.  There are, perhaps, other considerations also, which I do not want to mention, which make it, in my opinion, fair enough to apply these pre-war margins in present circumstances.  I admit that the balance is so fine that I might as well have come down on one side as on the other, but taking the various considerations into account, I think that the pre-war margin, even though the trade was reduced to one-fifth of its pre-war dimensions, is not unfair.  If we succeed in bringing tea from India later in the year&mdash;as I have told the House we are trying to do&mdash;the price, under present circumstances, will be substantially higher than anything we have known up to the present.  The cost of transporting that tea will be very heavy indeed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister would be good enough to tell me this. If a purchaser&mdash;a consumer&mdash;of tea goes into a shop to purchase some tea and does not know the wholesale price, on what can he base a complaint as to the question of price?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>If a consumer makes a complaint to the Department, and if, on investigation, that complaint is found to be justified, then we are in a position to take legal proceedings against the trader&mdash;a position in which we were not hitherto.  So far as the customer is concerned, he will make his complaint to the Department in the ordinary way, investigation will follow, and if the complaint is found to be justified, then legal proceedings can be taken.  In the past, the most we could do would be to secure a refund of the overcharge, but in the future we can institute proceedings.</P>

I do not know that there are, even in this country, half-a-dozen people who are competent to go into a tea shop, take up a sample of tea, grade it, and decide what would be a fair price for it.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>We can enforce it by an investigation of the trader's accounts.  There is another matter to which I should like to refer.  The complaint was made here, upon no foundation whatever, that I have in some way withheld information from the Dáil with regard to supplies.  I feel certain that there is no member of this House who has spoken more frequently or at greater length, both inside and outside this House, on this question of supplies, than I.  On every possible occasion I have tried to give information to the public with regard to that matter.  Through statements to the public at various meetings, statements over the radio, statements to the Press, and statements here in the House, I have always informed the public of the <Col N="2362" /> position, and whether the situation seemed to be for the better or for the worse, I informed the public of the position on every occasion.  The complaint of Deputies, evidently, is based on my inability to give a forecast as to the future.  I cannot give that.  I do not know what is going to happen during the next six months.  I have no more information about that than I had in 1939.  Of course, Deputies will pretend afterwards that they know now what will happen in the future, but they are keeping very &ldquo;mum&rdquo; about it now&mdash;for what reason I do not know. At any rate, I cannot say what may happen in the future.  The situation, according to which we are now planning, may change fundamentally, and what we now think adequate may prove to be inadequate to prevent hardships occurring here.  I can only tell the House what the present position is and what we are trying to do for the future, but if I were to make any forecast as to future developments, it would be worth nothing because they will probably be entirely different from what we think.  There were other matters to which I should like to have referred, Sir, but I think I have spoken too long already and perhaps I should conclude on that note.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Supplies (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That a sum not exceeding £102,000 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending 31st March, 1942, for expenses in connection with the provision of shipping.</P>
      <P>This Estimate makes provision to enable the Minister for Finance to subscribe for shares in Irish Shipping, Ltd.  I have already earlier to-day explained the considerations which prompted the Government to delay action in the matter of acquiring ships for oversea trade, but when our supply position became critical the Government decided that, notwithstanding the risks involved, an effort should be made to arrange for the purchase of ocean-going ships which would trade under the Irish flag.  It was felt that the best procedure to follow would be to establish a limited liability company under the Companies Acts, the directors being nominated by the Government and the company to be directly under Government control.  It was decided that the board should include representatives of the Limerick Steamship Co., Ltd.; Palgrave Murphy, Ltd.; and Wexford Steamships Co., Ltd.; a representative of Grain Importers Ltd., and representatives of the Department of Supplies and the Department of Industry and Commerce.  The necessary measures to that end were taken some time before the company was incorporated, because the directors decided not to proceed with the incorporation of the company until they were satisfied that they could acquire some tonnage, and they had, in fact, been exploring the possibility of purchasing ships for several weeks before the company was registered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The nominal share capital of the company is £200,000.  Of this, 51 per cent. will be subscribed by the Minister for Finance, and this Estimate makes <Col N="2365" /> provision to enable him to acquire these shares.  Grain Importers (Éire), Ltd., have subscribed for 87,500 shares of £1 each, and the three shipping companies have agreed to take up shares to the value of £3,500 each.  The Emergency Powers (No. 72) Order, 1941, also authorises the Minister for Finance to purchase shares in the company from any of the shareholders.  That order further empowers him to guarantee the company's borrowings.  The Articles of Association provide for borrowings on debenture up to a maximum of £2,000,000.</P>
    <P>The Emergency Powers (No. 72) Order also empowers the Minister for Finance to pay subsidies to the company, and it may be necessary at some stage to ask the House to make the necessary financial provision for this purpose.  I may say at this stage, however, that the present intention is that the company will charge such freights as will enable it to meet outgoings, and make such provision as may be appropriate for depreciation and other items.  At the moment, the company is carrying on its operations on as economical a basis as possible.  Apart from the services of a part-time secretary, no staff is employed.  The company has not taken any separate premises; its registered office is in the premises of Aer Rianta and Aer Lingus.  The directors are acting without remuneration, and I should like to take advantage of this opportunity to express the Government's appreciation of the services given to the company by those businessmen who have agreed to act on the board.  The company does not intend at the present stage to set up any organisation of its own, nor to operate such ships as it may be possible to acquire.  The arrangement in mind is that the ships should be managed by the existing shipping companies who are represented on the Board of Irish Shipping, Limited, and if this arrangement should prove unsatisfactory it can of course be revised.</P>
    <P>I understand that the board have already examined particulars of some 100 ships, and have made offers, or provisional offers, for a number of them.  In present circumstances there <Col N="2366" /> are considerable difficulties to be encountered. In the first place the number of suitable ships available for purchase at any particular time is very limited.  All ships controlled by any of the belligerents may for practical purposes be ruled out.  Until recently it has not been possible to acquire any ship of United States nationality, but an intimation has now been received that the United States Government are prepared to agree to the transfer of two vessels.  The board are not prepared to purchase any ship unless they can secure transfer to the Irish flag. Another difficulty is that most ship-owners are not willing to sell unless they can be paid in dollars, and the dollar resources at our disposal are extremely limited.</P>
    <P>It is only right to tell the House quite frankly that ships cannot now be bought on a basis which could in normal times be justified by any commercial criterion.  The amount of tonnage offered for sale is very limited and prices are absolutely abnormal. Having regard, however, to the circumstances in which the company is established, it must be recognised that in order to give effect to Government policy as regards the provision of tonnage the board have no choice but to pay the sort of prices which now prevail in the market.  It may perhaps interest the House to know in this connection that the company has already been offered on one vessel purchased by it a profit of $100,000.  Five vessels in all have been purchased up to the present.  That number does not include the two offered by the United States Government.</P>

      <P>I will get that figure for the Deputy.  Any repairs which may be necessary on these ships can be carried out at the Liffey Dockyard or the Ringsend Dockyard provided the necessary materials are available.  The company will have to deal with various <Col N="2367" /> practical difficulties about which I need not trouble the House, but I want to emphasise that these vessels will not go very far towards solving our main problem of getting essential imports into this country.  In order to import our normal supplies of grain alone, over 30 ships of the average size of these vessels would be required. Importers must, therefore, realise that it will not be possible to make space available to them for imports of various commodities.  In allocating cargo space, priority must be given to wheat, and the company in deciding what freight it will carry to this country will be guided by my Department, which, in turn, will act in close consultation with other Government Departments concerned.  The total tonnage figure which the Deputy asked for is 24,100.</P>

      <P>I would like to ask a few questions in connection with this Estimate.  The Minister tells us that it is proposed to set up a company known as Irish Shipping, Limited, the State paying 51 per cent. of the capital of £200,000, and Grain Importers, Limited, putting up £87,500, and some shipping companies putting up the balance.  The Minister said there was some provision for making either a loan to the company or underwriting some loan for them.  Is that right?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

      <P>I understand from the Minister that the company has purchased tonnage in these five ships to a gross weight of 21,100 tons.  How many more ships does the company hope to buy?  Is it aiming at any particular figure to satisfy requirements?  Is it the intention of the company to go on buying ships wherever they can get them at anything like a good bargain in the existing circumstances?  If these are only required to supplement our present shipping resources, what quantity of shipping would it be necessary for the company to purchase in order that, with existing tonnage, we would be in a position to have a reasonable mercantile marine to transport to us such goods as we are likely to get, in the existing circumstances?  I think the Minister may at this stage have found an opportunity to tell us how much tonnage is under our flag, how much is nationally controlled, what is the gross tonnage nationally controlled by existing Irish shipping companies and what is the gross tonnage registered under our flag, not controlled actually by Irish shipping companies. What is the estimated tonnage required to transport to us the commodities of which we are in need?  Information on these matters might help us to some appreciation of the extent of our shipping resources and might give us a picture of the extent to which these shipping resources may be used to supply our requirements.  I can quite understand, of course, that all the shipping at our disposal is not of a kind suitable for transatlantic trade and that quite probably some of it is only suitable for coastwise trade.  I would like to know from the Minister the tonnage of shipping available to us for this purpose.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will understand that the first problem is to make the ships seaworthy.  Some of them are quite seaworthy, while others will need to undergo certain repairs and overhaul, to adapt them for the trade in which they are to engage.  The next problem is to get crews to them and the Deputy will appreciate that that is by far the most serious part of the problem.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Bearing in mind all the risks, and taking some credit for possible good luck, when are we likely to have these ships in our possession, having regard to the fact that they have to be made seaworthy, probably repaired, and crews secured for them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not attempt to form an estimate.</P>

    <Col N="2374" />
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there is a great deal of nonsense talked about this mercantile business.  There are a lot of people in this country who think that all you have to do is to go out and buy ships, say &ldquo;whoopee,&rdquo; and off they sail and you have an Irish mercantile marine.  That is all &ldquo;cod.&rdquo; If you want a mercantile marine here, even in peace time, not to mind under war conditions, you have to go into competition with countries that are prepared to subsidise shipping.  The United States of America are prepared to pay all the expenses of a steamer on its outward and inward journeys.  That is only one country that subsidises shipping and the only country not subsidising shipping is Great Britain, so far as I am aware.</P>
      <P>If we were to maintain a mercantile marine here which would not go bankrupt in five years, it would cost £1,000,000 a year to keep our flag on the seven seas.  Even if we had a mercantile marine which was capable of bringing in a substantial proportion of what we annually consume, it would cost us nearly £5,000,000 a year.  That is the sum that would go out of our Exchequer just to have the glorious, warm feeling that the flag of Ireland is flying on the seven seas.  If that is considered good business, even in peace time, I think it is daft.</P>
      <P>Suppose every ship coming to this country had our flag flying on it, we would have facing us the problem of return cargoes.  A ship would discharge its cargo at the North Wall or Cork and then would probably have to leave this country in ballast to look for a return cargo elsewhere.</P>
      <P>Occasionally it might get a quarter or a half cargo here, but in all probability it would have to go on tramp. There are three or four men in England who are experts in the tramp-steamer trade and, unless you are an old and wary hand at the business, you do not willingly go into the tramp trade, because if you do not know all the tricks you are liable to be left, and badly left.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, as to the activities of the Shipping Company, it seems clear from what Deputy Norton says that he feels at this hour in the emergency that all you have to do is to go out and buy <Col N="2375" /> ships, the ships start emitting smoke from their funnels, and then they plough the ocean.  Unfortunately, ships do not travel without crews.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>That is surely a revelation to me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I think what I am going to tell the Deputy will be a revelation to him.  What astonishes me is that the Deputy prances into a discussion like this without making some inquiries beforehand.  It is quite possible to get crews.  I have no doubt we have plenty of sailors to man all the ships that could sail into or out of Irish ports, but the main difficulty is to get engineers, competent engineers.  If the Deputy could get a competent engine-room staff to run these ships, I am sure the Government would be deeply in his debt.  Then, having got his engineers, if they are sober and sane engineers, perhaps the Deputy could devise some plan which will prevent some other shipping company paying a higher price for the services of those sane and sober engineers than our company would be in a position to pay.  If he can do that he is a more ingenious man than I think he is.  My information is that if you can get a sane and sober ship's engineer, let his name and the colour of his hair come to the knowledge of shipping authorities in New York or Great Britain and they will be prepared to give him 50 per cent. above any figure the Irish Shipping Company will offer.</P>

      <P>I wonder how successful the Deputy would be if he went out to find engineers.  I doubt if he could find them.  Has the Minister experienced any difficulty in regard to that matter?  I think it is one of the principal difficulties&mdash;that is, getting an engine-room staff.  These men are highly skilled, and every shipping company is clamouring for them, not only for the merchant service but for ordinary naval purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to approach this question <Col N="2376" /> from the point of view of members of the Labour Party, who suggest that the Government have been remiss in regard to providing these shipping facilities.  I do not think they have.  It is very easy to make the case that we should get these ships. I suggest that it is all &ldquo;cod&rdquo;, and yet it is considered good enough for the cross-roads by some Deputies.  I know very well that the fellows down at home will swallow that flying, and they cannot see why the Government should not get 50 ships.  If you present the difficulties to them, they will merely shrug their shoulders and say, &ldquo;Oh, well.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Even if you have the ships, what is the position?  Adolf Hitler has told us that he will sink any ship of ours that he can lay his claws on within 60 miles of the coast of Ireland.  He is a resourceful gentleman, and apparently we are concerned to maintain his good will.  When his airmen dropped bombs on the North Strand he made it the occasion to say that the relations between Germany and ourselves are so excellent that he is prepared to pay for the damage caused by bombs his airmen never dropped.  Hitler has said that if any ship comes within 60 miles of our coast he will sink it, if he can get his claws on it.  I put it to Deputies on the Labour Benches, is it true or untrue that Hitler will sink our ships if they come within 60 miles of our shores?  Does anyone challenge that?  There is not a yap out of the whole lot of you.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there are certain things that might not be discussed in the cause of national defence, but that might be discussed in a democratic country in the interests of truth.  I am <Col N="2379" /> told that one of the boats we have acquired is the &ldquo;Vassilios Destonnus&rdquo; and that some time in the early stages of the war a syndicate of Southern Europeans made a practice of buying old hulks, insuring these hulks for large sums with insurance companies and sending them on the Lisbon run. In due course the crew would arrive beaming at Lisbon and say that they had been torpedoed.  Lloyd's then paid up.  Eventually, one fine morning the boys arrived in Lisbon in a rowing boat and told of a terrible disaster to the &ldquo;Vassilios Destonnus,&rdquo; the bottom having been blown out of the ship, and that they just escaped with their lives. There was great sympathy for them and they went to bed but, on getting up the following morning, what did they find had arrived in Lisbon but the &ldquo;Vassilios Destonnus&rdquo; which it was discovered had been abandoned. Lloyd's men went aboard and discovered that the sea cocks were open, but being rusty the water could not get in, and the boys had not the wisdom to wait to see if the &ldquo;Vassilios Destonnus&rdquo; would sink, past experience having told them that if the sea cocks were opened a ship filled up and went down.  However, they did not know the qualities of the &ldquo;Vassilios Destonnus.&rdquo; She lay for a considerable time in Lisbon but was ultimately bought by the boys.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the story as reported to me.  If it is incorrect no harm has been done in bringing false rumours to an end so that the responsible Minister can tell us the true story. When I heard that story I began to get uneasy about an Irish mercantile marine.  If we want to have a ship called &ldquo;Kathleen Ní Houlihan&rdquo; under our flag I was afraid she might sink ignominiously in Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>If you pay me that compliment, I would not think she would sink so ignominiously.  I believe we <Col N="2380" /> have also acquired the &ldquo;Leda&rdquo;, a ship that is Panama registered.  My information in regard to that ship of 7,200 tons is that we paid £200,000 for it.  I am told that it was built in Sunderland in 1910, and that the day she left the slip she was sold for £60,000.  Of course, we must remember that you cannot buy a ship in the middle of a war at the price that was paid for it in the piping times of peace in 1910.  Having made a reasonable allowance for depreciation on a ship that has had 32 years' service, and for inflation as a result of the world war, £200,000 for a 32-year-old ship seems high and unjustifiable.  I should like to be told by the Minister if, after investigation, he was satisfied too much was not paid for the &ldquo;Leda&rdquo;.  I am going to adduce evidence and to suggest that too much was paid for that ship.  I suggest that we bought a third ship, the name of which I do not know, for £85,000.  I understand that she was offered to another man in Dublin for £75,000, and that that man took steps to acquaint the shipping company that the boat had been offered at that price.  Then there is the &ldquo;Atlantic&rdquo;, a ship of 8,100 tons, built in America in 1919.  I am told that we offered 900,000 U.S. dollars for that ship, whereas an officer of the shipping company was advised that if a lesser sum was offered it was likely to be accepted.  It is well that we should discuss this matter to find out the circumstances.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not saying that.  I say that the officer was not induced to make the statement through any corrupt motive, but I think the judgment was wrong.  It is quite likely that a civil servant, acting as secretary of the company, might find serious difficulty in regard to such a highly technical matter, or that the three gentlemen who were engaged exclusively in the Irish shipping company were not entirely competent to handle ocean-going boats.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

      <P>It would be possible to understand if the Minister stated that he was told to offer 80,000 dollars, as he knew that there was an offer of 75,000 dollars.  Let us come to the point: when the insurance of these bottoms came to be negotiated the procedure at Lloyd's is that it is put through an insurance broker to get the best figure he can.  I am going to suggest to the House that the insurance of these bottoms was effected at 20 per cent, and that a person who desired to be made the insurance broker for this company and was prepared to get the bottoms operating for this company insured from 15 to 17½ per cent. was turned down.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy is trying to pretend that he is quoting from a different letter from that which I received, all I can say is that there has been an extraordinary coincidence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Facts are facts, and no matter how often they are committed to paper they remain the same.  I have had no contacts, direct or indirect, with any insurance broker in this city.  I am not interested in any insurance broker in this city, and I have no doubt that, when the Minister comes to reply, he will say the same.  I am going to allege, further, that an insurance broker on the floor at Lloyd's was offered a slice of the insurance of those bottoms at 20 per cent. after he had been prepared to effect the insurance at from 15 to 17½ per cent.  Now is that true?  You <Col N="2382" /> have a group of marine insurance brokers, who are members of Lloyd's, and do business on the floor of Lloyd's. You have other brokers in the city who will have no contact at all with Lloyd's.</P>
      <P>The latter go into the business of marine insurance, for the first time in their lives, because they think there is something to be made out of it, and through their inexperience they will be sold a pup on the floor of Lloyd's and will become a by-word on the floor of Lloyd's.  They will be induced to offer Lloyd's 20 per cent. for insurance that an experienced broker had expressed his willingness to take at 15 or 17 per cent.  The difference between 15 and 20 per cent. for the insurance of one of these bottoms is £1,000 a week.  That is a lot of money, bearing in mind the value of the bottom and the cargo. Deputies will recognise at once that the rates I am quoting are abnormally high, but they are war rates against war-risk insurance.  I want to know from the Minister if this is true: that, when we quoted the value of these ships, Lloyd's brokers would not cover them to the full value that we put upon them because they did not think them worth it.  We found it impossible to get cover for the total value of these ships.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a contradiction of the Deputy's earlier statement when he said that we could have got cover for them at 17½ per cent. and paid 20 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The rate is one thing and the amount of cover is another.  The Minister might be able to insure his house, with any company, for £1,000, but if he went into that same company and asked it to insure his house for £25,000 it would say no, and point out that the figure was absolutely in excess of the value of the house.  What I am suggesting is that when we asked, at the 20 per cent. rate, to insure an Irish ship for £100,000, in the event of total loss, Lloyd's appraiser said &ldquo;no.&rdquo;  He said the maximum amount for which they would be prepared to insure the ship, in the event of total loss, was £60,000, because, he said, that is all she is worth.  He said that if we paid £100,000 for her that was our business, <Col N="2383" /> but that all they would be prepared to pay, in the event of total loss, was £60,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the circumstantial evidence that I adduce to support the contention that I made earlier&mdash;that the price we paid for the &ldquo;Leda&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Vassilious Destonnus&rdquo; was more than ought to have been paid for them, bearing in mind all the special difficulties in which they were taken over.  The Minister, I know, is desirous of suggesting that I want to make some reflection on the personal integrity of those men.  I do not want to do anything of the sort.  What I do suggest is, that if you are going into the market to purchase shipping at any time, and more especially in a time of acute difficulty such as we are in now, what you require for that task is a reliable British expert, or a reliable United States expert&mdash;men who are in the habit of conducting negotiations of that character.  I do not believe there is any shipping man in this country who has ever dealt in ships of a greater burden than 4,000 or 5,000 tons.  We are now combing the ports of the world for ships of far larger tonnage and of extremely doubtful antecedents, ships that have sown their wild oats in every port in the world, and that carry on their bottoms the scars which only the expert eye can correctly interpret.  If my information is correct, the shipping world is a world of rumour and talk, and if you once go into that business you have got to know your way around; you have got to know where you can touch somebody who knows what the true history of a particular ship is.  For instance, how could we ever check up on the history of the &ldquo;Vassilious Destonnus&rdquo; before we bought her?  We had our men sitting here in Dublin.  I am sure they would have been very glad to go to Lisbon and see the ships, but it was physically impossible for them to do that.  Did anyone from here go out on our behalf to see her before we bought her?  I do not believe there did.  How could they get there?  Did anyone go to inspect the &ldquo;Leda&rdquo;?  That was through no fault of the gentlemen here.  They had no means of getting there.  It took us <Col N="2384" /> three weeks to find room for the Minister for the Co-ordination of Defensive Measures when he was going to America.  Now we are trying to get him home as quickly as we can.  While we are prepared to give the vast expanse of Foynes harbour to the British and United States Governments, we are not able to get the small space required for Frank Aiken's posterior to bring him home.  In these circumstances, it was difficult for us to send out anyone to inspect the ships before we bought them, and I do not believe that was done.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that any ships that are being bought at the present time are subjected to an independent investigation on behalf of this State. Assuming that we wanted to do that, will any Deputy tell me how it could be done?  But, if you wanted to buy a boiler, you would first go to an insurance company and ask them to go over it and see if it was in perfect condition. You would say to them: &ldquo;Let the test of your verdict be, are you prepared to insure it for the full price that I am being asked to pay for it?&rdquo; If the boiler expert said that he was not prepared to insure it at that price, would you be prepared to pay that price for it?  Of course not.  Has that precaution been taken in respect to these ships?  Did any independent expert, acting for us, inspect their condition before we bought them?  Is there a certificate from any independent expert that the price asked bears any relation to a reasonable war-time price for the ships in question?  What certificate can be put before this House to show that we are taking reasonable precautions to see that for the money laid out, we are buying ships and not scrap iron? How could the gentlemen who constitute the board of this company have taken these precautions when it was not physically possible for them to reach the ports where these ships were lying when they were offered to us?</P>
    <P>I urge on the Minister that, instead of meeting these inquiries in a spirit of petulant resentment, he should face them, and give the House the facts.  He is asking the Legislature to put up a sum of approximately £3,000,000 on a blank cheque.  We have the right and <Col N="2385" /> duty to take reasonable precautions to ensure that, bearing in mind all the special difficulties of the situation, reasonable value is being got for the people's money.  I cited specific cases. I have made positive allegations and I want to reiterate that into no part of the context of what I have said may there be read any reflection on the integrity or personal honour of any member of the board.  What I am suggesting is that, in the circumstances in which they find themselves, both technically and from the point of view of their inability to travel freely, it is not possible for them to exercise the surveillance necessary to ensure that we get good value for our money.  The Minister should now be in a position to say that independent experts will be employed forthwith to furnish him with a certificate that the ships purchased with public money are reasonable value for the money, albeit somewhat dear owing to the emergency in which we are living.</P>

      <P>Deputy Dillon seems to think that this company cannot possibly succeed unless the directors and, I presume, the Minister, call in experts of British or American citizenship for the purpose of giving the best possible advice.  That is the unfortunate view which seems to prevail amongst a number of people in this country&mdash;that you cannot get a transport manager, a shipping manager, an insurance manager or the manager of any big commercial institution from amongst our own people.  Unfortunately, that view has been acted upon. Does Deputy Dillon know that some of the best men on ships to-day in every part of the world are Irish-born citizens?

      <P>I listened with a certain amount of surprise to the statement by the Minister regarding the proposals for the management of Irish Shipping, Limited.  I was surprised to hear&mdash;I had heard it within the last few days&mdash;that the three small constitutent companies that now make up Irish Shipping, Limited, are to be allowed to manage their own domestic affairs and that there is to be no central administrative machine for the purpose of spending the money which the Minister is asking this House and the taxpayers to guarantee.  Of the total authorised capital of Irish Shipping, Limited, the three constituent companies subscribed £7,500.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>The three constituent companies stand to lose only £7,500. That is the statement made by the Minister, as I understood it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The sum is £10,500&mdash; £3,500 each.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will agree that that is a small part of the total authorised capital compared with the risk involved to the taxpayers, Grain Importers, Limited, and others who may subscribe part of the share capital.  I was honestly surprised to hear from the Minister&mdash;I heard it for the first time&mdash;that the only official employed by the company is a part-time secretary.  Surely, the Minister and his advisers have more faith in the future of Irish Shipping, Limited, than is indicated by the employment of a part-time secretary?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>To do what?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>To watch the operations of the constituent companies, if nothing else.  The constituent companies <Col N="2387" /> will be more concerned with the successful running of their own domestic side of Irish Shipping, Limited, than they will be with making a success of Irish Shipping, Limited.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>We must allow them to run the ships before we begin to watch them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>From a limited knowledge of shipping activities, I would say that you could find very useful work for a full-time secretary to a company with such capital from the very commencement of its operations.  I hope that the idea of employing a part-time secretary will be got rid of as quickly as possible.  The secretary would have a full-time task in attending to the future working of the undertaking, which I trust will be successful.  The Minister said that the cost of the five ships already purchased was £567,000. That is a fairly heavy figure for ships of their average tonnage.  If the Minister had been wise enough to adopt the suggestion of this Party shortly after the outbreak of the war, he would, probably, have secured these ships at less than half that cost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>No member of the Labour Party mentioned the word &ldquo;ship&rdquo; here from the 1st September, 1939, to the end of September, 1940.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>We shall have to ask the Head of the Government to produce the minutes of a certain meeting which took place between representatives of this Party and the Government shortly after the outbreak of war.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I said that they did not mention it in the Dáil and the records of the Dáil are always available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>The meeting to which I am referring took place between representatives of this Party and representatives of the Ministry.  I am not referring to a meeting of the House.  The Minister will not challenge my assertion that if he had been wise enough to adopt the suggestion made not only by <Col N="2388" /> the Labour Party but by the Federation of Irish Industries and other people interested in the carrying on of overseas trade, a good deal of money would have been saved to the taxpayers. Better late than never.  I hope to see this company succeed.  To succeed, it will have to commence on the right lines.  I believe that it is imperative that there be a central administrative machine in control of the constituent companies and in complete control of whatever ships are now at the disposal of the company.  If you are to get the best value from the point of view of the tonnage now under the control of Irish shipping, somebody will have to be at the centre for the purpose of allocating the areas to which these ships will come and go.  I agree with Deputy Dillon that, if the company is to be worked economically and on a sound commercial basis, the people in control will have to do their best to find return cargoes for the ships.  That is the one thing that counts in the successful working of any shipping company, whether cross-channel or overseas.  It is essential, if shipping companies are to be worked on a profit-making basis, that they be sure of return cargoes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Deputy suggest that we should not bring in the ships unless we have return cargoes?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not subscribe to that because I realise that it is imperative to have ships in order to get certain supplies from other countries which are not available to us here. Even if we are to lose on the transaction, we must get these essential supplies in the interest of the community. We must be prepared to accept any loss involved in having one-way traffic in order to ensure that we get those supplies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to hear from the Minister, in reply to the question which was put by Deputy Dillon, whether the directors acting for the Government, which is guaranteeing the amount of capital of the shipping company, actually employed an independent valuer for the ships already purchased.  As far as I know, none of the directors of Irish Shipping, Ltd., <Col N="2389" /> are technical men, from the engineering point of view.  Some of the directors who are in the constituent shipping companies are managers with commercial knowledge of running shipping companies, but they are not experienced from the point of view of being able to assess the real value of a ship.  A captain of one of our biggest shipping companies may have, and I am sure has, a good knowledge of the value of his own ship, but I should not like to depend solely on a captain of a ship without any engineering qualifications whatever, in fixing the price of the ships purchased for Irish Shipping, Limited.  Although I have a limited knowledge of shipping activities in cross-Channel services, I have no information whatever in regard to the names, the tonnage, or the actual value of the ships already purchased; but I think it would be helpful to the Minister, in securing the passage of this Estimate through the House, and it would inspire confidence amongst the taxpayers who have to find this money, if the Minister could say that an independent valuer had been employed by the Government for the purpose of advising him whether the ships purchased at a price of £567,000 are, in the opinion of the independent valuer, worth the money in present circumstances.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Where would you get that independent valuer?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not say, but Deputy Dillon will agree that a commercially-minded person, or some of the leading civil servants who are members of the board, would not themselves presume to say that they should have the last word with regard to the value of these ships.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggested that you should get an expert in London or New York, and the Deputy said that was an unpatriotic suggestion.  Where can you get him if not in London or New York?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I have personal knowledge, and I am sure Deputy Dillon will confirm my statement, that some of the best men engaged on the bridges of the largest ships in the world are Irishmen.  If you engage <Col N="2390" /> one of these men as an independent valuer, I am sure you would get him without going for so-called experts to London or New York.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Are not these men also in London or New York?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>After listening to Deputy Dillon, one need not be surprised that we have not got sufficient shipping in this country.  He made a great point of the fact that ships leaving this country generally left without cargo.  My experience of shipping in Cork is that all the Atlantic ships generally left Cork without cargo.  I know that for nine months of 1939 we paid £823,000 for bringing grain alone into Cork, and during that time there were 19 ships, with a total tonnage of 800,000 tons, sold in New York for £963,000.  If this country bought half a dozen of these ships, would it not have been a sound investment for the nation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Would you send them back to New York in ballast?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>I would say that we should be as successful with our shipping as any other country.  Norway had 4,000,000 tons of shipping before the war, but this country, even though it was an island, could not lay claim to even 1,000,000 tons.  As far as seamen for the ships are concerned, I am satisfied that engineers employed by foreign countries would be prepared to come here to man our ships if the ships were there.  When I recall the efforts made by certain interested parties in the past ten or 15 years to start a shipping company here, I think it is a sad reflection both on this Government and on the last Government that we had practically no ships of our own when the war broke out.  There were ships lined up in Cobh Harbour&mdash;and Deputy Corry can bear me out in this &mdash;for the last six or seven years because there was not room for them in the English ports, and they were being offered at £2, £3 and £4 per ton. Here we are now paying £567,000 for five ships.  Is it any wonder that we have serious-minded people in the country who despair of our ever getting sense?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2391" /> Even though we have started at this late hour of the day, I am surprised that we have not a central authority governing the operation of these ships. I should like to see on this board some of the people who were prepared to put down money to start shipping companies in years past.  I know from my own personal knowledge that on three different occasions certain people here in Dublin who tried to start shipping companies were crushed out by the combines and by the vested interests. Notwithstanding that, there are men in this country whom I know who have been successful in getting shipping direct to the City of Cork in face of definite opposition.</P>
    <P>I have known of the combines to pay a man two days' wages to go out to spot shipping going to certain ports to find out what cargo they had and where they were getting that cargo. The men who faced opposition of that kind are men I should like to see on this shipping board.  I would be opposed to any suggestion that any one of these ships would be given to any particular director to work for his own particular area.  I would suggest that we should have the ships under the direct control of the board, and managed in such a way that no single director could have them operating in his own area.  I am rather surprised that Deputy Dillon should have so little confidence in the Irish people as to think they cannot run ships of their own successfully.  Is it not a terrible thing that we are dependent on the ships of every other nation to bring us supplies, even though we cannot provide them with return cargoes?  Notwithstanding all that the Deputy said about the uselessness of flying the Irish flag, I am quite confident that we should have quite as good a chance as any other country in the world of running shipping services.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>That is true, but the man who lives in Berlin may not think so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not going to draw any distinction regarding dangers to our shipping as between one country <Col N="2392" /> and another.  I would suggest to the Minister that he should put men on this board who made very serious and honest efforts in the past to establish decent shipping services in this country.  I think, furthermore, that the ships should be under the control of a central authority, and should be managed in such a way that no particular area will get a preference.  The ships should be sent to Cork, Limerick, Waterford, or any other port where they can be operated to the best advantage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnLymbrickEsmonde" hpid="Mr. Esmonde Mr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like for myself to wish this company good luck. I have come to the conclusion that the establishment of the company fills a long-felt want in our national life.  For years past I have been of opinion that we should have an Irish mercantile marine.  It is unfortunate that we should be setting up that mercantile marine at a time when the promoters must experience all the disadvantages attendant upon the present international situation.  It is perfectly obvious to anyone who takes the trouble to look into the circumstances of this country that this is a country eminently suitable to run a mercantile marine.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have here a note of the number of ships and their tonnage owned by different countries.  The Deputy who has just sat down referred to the tonnage and the number of ships owned by Norway.  I have taken the figures from the Shipping World Year Book for 1938 and they show that, in 1938, Norway had 560 ships of a total tonnage of 3,505,000 odd, and I say that what Norway can do, we certainly can, and should, do.  Sweden had 113 ships of a total tonnage of 670,000, while another small country, Denmark, had 93 ships of a total tonnage of 544,000. The most remarkable country of the lot, a country upon whose shipping we drew before they became involved in the European War, Greece, with a population slightly over twice our population, had 358 ships of a total tonnage of 1,640,000.  These figures will be better appreciated if I give the relevant figures for Great Britain who, everybody knows, leads the world in the matter of shipping.  Great Britain, <Col N="2393" /> in 1938, had 2,081 ships, of a total tonnage of 14,250,000.  What those small countries can do, we should be able to do.</P>
    <P>I am sorry that we start now under the disadvantages of the present time, but this is an island country and I represent a constituency which has a seaboard both on the Irish Sea and on the Atlantic, a constituency from which some of the finest sailors and sea-going engineers have come.  There was sunk recently one of the largest liners in the world, the chief engineer of which bore the excellent name of Redmond.  He was a native of Wexford and, I think, a brother of a Fianna Fáil candidate for a seat in this House. If an Irishman can rise to the distinction of being chief engineer of one of the leading liners in the world, it is quite obvious that we have the material for building up any sort of technical operators necessary for ships. I think we require only a little encouragement for that purpose.  I do not agree that we should go outside our own nationals to get too much advice in connection with a matter of this kind.  What, in peace-time, would operate against our making the flotation of a mercantile marine a success would be commercial competition by chose already in the saddle, so to speak, by those who have control of the shipping routes of the world and of the port facilities and customs, and if we are to build up a satisfactory mercantile marine, we must build it up by our own energies and with our own brains and intelligence, as countries like Greece, Norway or any other country did in the past.</P>
    <P>There is the question, which is, of course, the real problem in this matter, of the empty bottom.  We have our coastwise shipping companies, which have always operated and, I understand, successfully, but the difficulty of the ocean-going mercantile marine is that while we have plenty of imports to bring from foreign ports, in the normal course of events we have very few exports to send to the other side of the world.  That, however, is exactly the position which faces a number of other countries with a number of ships and large tonnage.  Those countries share in the carrying trade of the <Col N="2394" /> world, and, while their shipping companies may bring essential imports to their own countries, they then go to some neighbouring country and enter into competition with other companies for the transport of exports from there to the other side of the world.  Owing to the situation in Europe, which has resulted in the closing of most of the harbours, that is not possible at present, but it is a matter which, I think, would merit consideration when peace is restored to the world.</P>
    <P>I do not know how the matter came into a debate on shipping, but, as an individual member of this House and this Party&mdash;I am glad Deputy Dillon has come in, because I intend to disagree with something he said&mdash;I wish to say that anything he said to-day with regard to the reply given by Germany to the protest in respect of the recent bombings does not meet with my approval and does not represent my views.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I made no reference to any reply by Germany, except that Hitler has sunk our ships, as he said he would.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Like other Deputies, I congratulate the Minister on doing something, even at this late stage, to provide shipping for this country.  It is rather late in the day, and I think the Minister will admit that, as far back as 18 months ago, it was suggested, especially from these benches, that something should be done to provide shipping for this country.  The Minister will also admit that it would have been infinitely easier for him to procure ships then.  The Minister may say, as he said in the course of the debate on the Supplies Estimate, that it is easy to be wise after the event, and he will probably tell us that he could not foresee what was going to happen.  Apart altogether from the fact that the Ministry made no effort during the last two years to procure shipping, I blame both this and the last Government for standing idly by when efforts were made during the past ten or 15 years by Irishmen to establish Irish shipping companies.  It was apparent to everybody that these people started off under a terrible <Col N="2395" /> handicap, because the shipping combines immediately stepped in and took such action as to squeeze these people out of business or to compel them to go into the shipping combine.  I have in mind the cases of two merchants from the town in which I was born and in which I now live, Wexford, who made efforts to start a mercantile marine.</P>
      <P>They purchased ships and ran them for a time, but, owing to the squeezing-out efforts of the shipping combines which operate between England and this country, these people had eventually to join the combine.  One of them, I am glad to see, is now a member of the board established by the Government in connection with the starting of a mercantile marine here.</P>
      <P>I am surprised by Deputy Dillon's suggestion that we should get somebody from outside Eire to &ldquo;vet&rdquo; any ships we propose to purchase.  We have people in this country who are very competent to do anything in that connection. As Deputy Esmonde has pointed out, all over the world are to be found Irishmen in charge of ships or in charge of the engine-rooms of ships.  I have in mind a good number of men from the town from which I come who are in very high positions in the mercantile marine of England and of other countries and I think I can safely say that, so far as the lightship service is concerned, that town has practically manned the service all around the coast.  I am perfectly satisfied that we can get people here absolutely competent to decide whether a ship is value for money or not.  Of course, at the present moment it is not altogether a question of value.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I might be permitted to suggest a point to the Deputy.  These ships that we are in a position to purchase are scattered all over the world.  They may be in South American ports, they may be in New York, or they may be in Lisbon.  Now, it is not physically possible to get any man from Ireland to go out to the ports where these ships lie, and therefore we must get somebody who is in a place whence he can reach the ship, <Col N="2396" /> and the only place at present where you could get such a man is New York or, in some cases, London.  My point is that an Irishman cannot get out to see the ships, and all I want is to get some fellow, with no connection with the venture, to go out and see the ship <i>in situ.</i>  Is not that a reasonable proposal?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose it is, but I suggest it would be very hard to get any independent person in any part of the world who, along with being competent, would be fair and impartial.  I believe, however, that it would be possible to get people representative of this country in any part of the world where there are ships.  It is possible that I may have misunderstood Deputy Dillon.  I thought that he meant sending men from England to South America.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Again, coming back to my own town, I want to say this.  The Minister has appointed a gentleman, Mr Stafford, from Wexford&mdash;of J. J. Stafford &amp; Sons, Limited, Coal Merchants&mdash;on this board.  That gentleman, even though not a sailor, is as competent a man as you could get anywhere, because he started life with the Wexford Dockyard Company, has ships of his own at the present moment, and is importing more coal than any other merchant in Ireland, supplying the South and other parts of the country, as I think the Minister is aware.  In my opinion, the Minister is lucky to get hold of such a man as Mr. Stafford and, although I have differed on many occasions with Mr. Stafford, I want to say that I am satisfied of his ability to serve with distinction on the board to which the Minister has appointed him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JeremiahHurley" hpid="Mr. Hurley Mr. Hurley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hurley</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make a few suggestions in connection with this shipping business.  I am very glad that the Government has taken this step, and I want to emphasise what Deputy Davin has said already, to the effect that this Party were keenly anxious that this step should have been taken earlier&mdash;at least when the war broke out.  It was for that purpose that <Col N="2397" /> Deputy Hickey who, I think, has had experience of, and close contact with, shipping circles in Cork, raised the matter continually at our Party meetings. A deputation was appointed to see the Taoiseach in connection with the matter and prevail on him to take steps then, but nothing was done.  I want to emphasise what Deputy Davin said: that this Party at any rate were alive to the necessity for taking this step.  As Deputy Hickey stated, it is a fact that the Greeks, before they got into this war, made fortunes in the carrying trade of this country.  We were well aware of all these things in Cork and we tried to make the case to the Government, but unfortunately we did not get very far with it then.  On one occasion, the Minister for Co-ordination of Defensive Measures made a very interesting remark in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>He did, and the Taoiseach had to come along and explain it afterwards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JeremiahHurley" hpid="Mr. Hurley Mr. Hurley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hurley</NameTxt>
      <P>That remark was drawn from the Minister as a result of something that was said by Deputy Hickey. As I have said, I am pleased that the Government has taken this step.  I think the Minister said, in connection with the docking and repairing of these ships, that they were to be docked and repaired at the Liffey Dockyard and the Ringsend Dockyard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I said they were capable of being docked and repaired there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JeremiahHurley" hpid="Mr. Hurley Mr. Hurley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hurley</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, I am not quite clear about that.  I have not the information that Deputy Dillon had about gauges, sizes, and so on, but my information is that some of these ships are of such large tonnage that they could not be docked in these yards.  I do not want to disparage these dockyards, but there is a dockyard in Cork Harbour which is second only to Harland and Wolff's in Belfast.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I should be very glad to see one of these ships being repaired in Rushbrooke, provided that Rushbrooke is able to repair it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JeremiahHurley" hpid="Mr. Hurley Mr. Hurley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hurley</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, as Deputy Corry <Col N="2398" /> is aware, that matter has been put before the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  The dockyard at Rushbrooke has not been working for some time back, but with very little expense it could be put in a condition to be utilised.  The basin there for dry docking of ships is second only to Belfast.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JeremiahHurley" hpid="Mr. Hurley Mr. Hurley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hurley</NameTxt>
      <P>Rushbrooke is available, and I ask that that information be passed on to the shipping company. As Deputy Corry and myself have tried to interest the Minister with regard to affairs down in that harbour area, I could not let this opportunity pass without saying something.  Cork Harbour, undoubtedly, is one of the finest harbours in the world&mdash;no doubt about that&mdash;and there are facilities there that you cannot get in any other port in this country.  Then, again, I do not know the conditions under which these ships will operate, but I take it they will operate on the Atlantic route, and I imagine that Cork Harbour would be one of the most suitable in that connection.</P>

      <P>Well, during the last war, it was a very important port and harbour.  It was one of the most important in the world then, and I do not think its importance has lessened very much since.  However, I want to make this point in all seriousness to the Minister: that whatever difficulties they may have with regard to docking in Ringsend or the Liffey dockyards&mdash; I am not conversant with the facilities in these yards&mdash;the facilities are there in Rushbrooke docks to overcome these difficulties.  I am conversant with the facilities at Rushbrooke, and that is why I am speaking in favour of it.  The docking of these ships is a difficult matter, and I am told&mdash;the Minister can take me up on this if I am wrong&mdash; that the facilities are not available in the Dublin dockyard, whereas they are certainly available in Rushbrooke. This may be a chance to bring back <Col N="2399" /> some little prosperity to that harbour area which is one of the most distressed areas in this country at the moment.</P>
      <P>Now, as I said at the beginning, I am pleased with the steps taken, and I hope that the few words I have said with regard to Rushbrooke will be taken seriously by the Minister and by the shipping board.  We do not suggest that all the repairs should be done there, but possibly some could be sent to Rushbrooke, and if the Minister has any influence with the shipping board I suggest that he should see that, when some of these ships are in need of repairs, they should be sent along to Rushbrooke docks.</P>

      <P>After Deputy Hurley's statement about Rushbrooke docks there is very little left for me to say, except that I think it would be a waste of time for the Minister to spend money trying to fit out a mud-hole like the Liffey in order to make a decent dockyard there when he has a decent dockyard in Rushbrooke where there is no necessity to take the mud out of the way.</P>

      <P>Of course, I must admit that there was a certain amount of damage done to Rushbrooke, and some of the shipping was taken out of it. What I wish to say is that not alone has the Minister Rushbrooke dockyard there in good order, but he also has the skilled hands in Cobh, ready and willing to do the work.  Men who did such work on some of the biggest ships afloat in other days are still there and to the good, and any repairs that are required can be carried out perfectly there.  I think it is our duty to say &ldquo;Good luck and God speed&rdquo; to our mercantile marine in its future career, and I should also like to say: Thank God they will not be under the control of the Dáil, because I have heard enough during the last hour and a half, in connection with them, to convince me that they would have to make 365 parts of themselves in order to please everybody concerned.  I <Col N="2400" /> would also suggest that the headquarters of the mercantile marine should be Cobh and Cork Harbour.</P>

      <P>I am very pleased to know we have established in Ireland an Irish shipping company at last.  As the Minister is already aware, Waterford is not behind the door as far as having a good harbour is concerned. Some Deputy has spoken of the use of different ports and harbours in the last war.  My only wish is that Waterford could be half as good now as it was in the last war.  At that time the harbour was a live wire in every sense of the word.  Now, unfortunately, there is nothing but decay.  That is the experience of the people there who are connected with shipping.  Therefore, when the company does start, my earnest wish is that Waterford will not be forgotten, as I am afraid it has been in recent years.  There is no need for me to explain the magnificence of the harbour.  It has every possible facility. The only regret I had at the time of the setting up of this shipping company was that there was not on it a representative from Waterford City, but I have the Minister's assurance that that does not count against it, that the registered shipping people, the Government and the grain growers, if I remember rightly, were the main sponsors of this company, and that there is no slur on the Harbour Commissioners of Waterford in not being included in the company.  I understand that there is no desire to have them outside the Pale, as it were, when shipping takes place, that the fact that it is not represented <Col N="2401" /> on the board does not count against Waterford.  I ask the Minister to remember that it is there, and has every facility, just as the other ports have that have been mentioned to-day.</P>

      <P>I wish to say a few words on the Estimate introduced by the Minister.  I do not intend to follow the members of the Labour Party and the other Deputies who spoke to the effect that we are going to have a grand marine company over-night, that we are going to have lovely ships sailing the sea, and that everything in the garden will be lovely. Most of the speeches that were delivered remind me of the man who was foolish enough to count the chickens before they were hatched.  Deputy Corry speaks from the point of view of giving some work in the shipyards down South, where the men are idle. He does not seem to care three straws if the setting up of this company costs £10,000,000 or £20,000,000 so long as he gets a few men employed there.  I sympathise with the Minister in introducing this Estimate for this reason, that there has been a wave of enthusiasm for ships in this country in the past year or so owing to the fact that we could not get supplies of raw materials because we had no ships.  I advise the Minister to be very careful in regard to the spending of money on the purchasing of ships at the present time, ships which must sail the seas of the world.  Deputy Esmonde made comparisons between what Norway did and what Greece did not what Denmark did, and he stated that what these countries could do this little country could also do.  I should like to tell Deputy Esmonde and the members of the Labour Party that they should be honest enough to tell this House the relative cost of running a Greek ship and running an Irish ship.  Then we would know the true value of the comparison.  There is no use in Deputies talking about Greek ships and Norwegian ships.  Do Deputies know the conditions under which many of these Greek ships, Norwegian ships and Danish ships are run?  Do they know the wages paid, in the first instance?</P>

      <P>I can tell Deputy Hickey or any member of the Labour Party that you will never build this country by talking enthusiastically about what we could do if certain things happened and if the Government did certain things. It reminds me of all the flapdoodle I heard here in 1933 or 1934 about making this country self-sufficient and establishing Irish industries.  At the first ill wind that blows there is a tendency for the whole thing to topple over over-night.  I do not wish that. Do not think that I am glad of it.  No. But I do not want to be bamboozled into the same thing again.  The Minister has been put in this position because the Labour Party and the people of this country said we should have ships simply because we were short of raw materials owing to the world war, forgetting that when this war is over the whole situation will change again over-night and there will be ships to burn.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>There will be keen competition between the owners of ships, not alone here but all over the world. There will be ships for half nothing to carry things to this country.  Remember that aspect of the situation. We are not a rich country that can afford to have all this grand service. The Minister wants £200,000, 51 per cent., as far as I understand, of which will be subscribed, and is subscribed already, by the Minister for Finance. Is that right?  I think £87,000 is being subscribed by Grain Importers. Limited, and £3,000 or £4,000 each by the three shipping companies.  In the course of his statement the Minister said that this company had already spent over £500,000 on the purchase of five ships.  I, as a member of this House, knew nothing about that.  We <Col N="2403" /> heard very little about that from the members of the Labour Party or from Deputy Esmonde.  Although I am only a back bencher on this side of the House, I want to know who gave those men authority to spend £500,000 on those five ships?  As far as I can learn, the matter has not been brought before the House here.  The first I heard about it was when the Minister made the statement here.  Without going into any details in regard to what Deputy Dillon has said, if Deputies in this House are honest with themselves they must believe that you are not going to buy the best ships under present circumstances; but the fact remains that £500,000 was spent without the authority of this House, and this other £102,000 is to be subscribed by the Minister for Finance, while those other companies put in £3,000 or £4,000 each.</P>
      <P>If the Minister is honest he will agree with me when I say that he ought to go about this in a very careful way.  I would put it to the Minister now that the money which will have to be spent on the purchase of those ships&mdash;assuming that he gets them, and even that they will be able to trade under the most favourable circumstances, which is very doubtful&mdash;will not be very far short of from £2,000,000 to £3,000,000. I would seriously put this suggestion to the Minister, and to the members of the Labour Party as well: would not the Minister get better value for the expenditure of that £2,000,000 or £3,000,000 within the country at the present time in the production of things which can be got here, and which ought to be got before the approach of winter&mdash;turf, for instance? If I had to choose between spending £2,000,000 or £3,000,000 on the purchase of ships&mdash;assuming that I could get those ships, and I am not at all sure that I could get them&mdash;or on ensuring that the people of this country would have sufficient turf for next year, I would not have the least hesitation in putting that money into turf.</P>

      <P>You cannot do it this year, and there are men working on the production of turf under conditions which, to say the least of them, the people of this country should not ask them to endure.  That is the way I am looking at this proposition which has been put before the House here this evening.  I can appreciate the Minister's position; as I said before, he has been driven into this by the fact that we had no ships, and that everybody comes along and says: &ldquo;We must get ships.&rdquo;  I would ask the Minister and the Government not to walk blindly into this, simply because some people think that if we got ships everything in the garden would be lovely.  I am not of that opinion.  I happen to be one of the Deputies in this House who never called upon the Government to provide ships.  I never lamented the fact that this country did not possess ships.  I knew they possessed some, and I also knew that many of the Irish companies which owned ships were put out by Irishmen themselves and not by foreigners.  Is Deputy Hickey prepared to debate that point?  Let us have the truth as to the reasons why many of the Irish companies went out of existence.</P>

      <P>I am prepared to debate that point with Deputy Hickey. I want to urge on the Minister that he ought to go very slowly in regard to this venture.  As far as I am concerned I wish him the height of success, but I know sufficient about shipping and the conditions under which shipping is carried on to know that, even in normal times, the provision of shipping for this country would be a very costly affair, not to speak of the abnormal times through which we are passing. Let us assume for the purposes of argument that the Minister had 50 ships to-morrow morning.  Could he guarantee to the House or to the people of this <Col N="2405" /> country that he could get cargoes for those ships, and, if he got those cargoes, could he guarantee that those cargoes would be brought safely into harbour?</P>

      <P>Deputy Hickey said that one belligerent is as likely to interfere with our shipping as the other.  I wonder does he believe that, or is he afraid to say in public what he thinks in private?  Deputy Hickey knows very well that only one of the belligerents would interfere with our shipping, and he should have the courage to get up and say it, instead of criticising Deputy Dillon who had the moral courage to get up and say which of the belligerents is interfering with our ships.</P>

      <P>I notice that we have got to be such peace-loving people here that certain of us would even surrender our principles lest we should offend certain people who, at the moment, are engaged in the war.  I have stated my views in regard to this matter, and I should like to put them very definitely before the Minister, as I am prepared to put them in any part of this country &mdash;that we would want to be very careful in regard to the purchase of ships at the present time, considering our financial resources, and also considering the fact that we have ample opportunities for expending a couple of million pounds within the country, where we are sure that we will get value for it.  I am saying that, fortified by the belief that there is no fear of this country starving, because we have within the country sufficient to keep the people alive and to give them fuel not alone for next winter but for the next three, four or five winters.  For that reason, I hope the Minister will go slowly in regard to the purchase of those ships.  As to the manning of them, it is very easy to say that Irishmen are as good sailors and engineers as the sailors and engineers of any other part of the world, but there is a difficulty at the moment, and Deputy Dillon was quite right in saying what <Col N="2406" /> he did say here this evening.  He did not decry in any way the qualifications of Irish engineers, nautical or otherwise; what he did say was that it would be very hard to get them.</P>
      <P>He also said that it would be wise on the part of the Government to have an independent valuer before they purchased these ships.  I am not going to follow Deputy Dillon in the information he gave as regards the type of ship bought.  I know nothing about that, but I would not be at all surprised if the facts disclosed by Deputy Dillon proved substantially correct.  The Minister will be replying now and, of course, he possibly has a good deal of information in his possession that he did not impart to the House in his opening statement.  Again, I say we would need to be very careful here at the present time in going into this thing in a rather blind sort of way simply because we can get up and say that we have a mercantile marine and that we are a great nation.  It seems to me that the cost of doing that is something which we should weigh very well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think we should discuss now whether it would have been practicable to have established an Irish mercantile marine before the war or whether it will be possible to have one after the war.  This company was not established for any other purpose than to provide an emergency shipping service to meet the needs of the present time.  That fact should be understood. I do not want the establishment of this company to be taken as prejudicing a final decision as to what is practicable in normal conditions in regard to conducting an ocean-going marine service owned in this country. I feel certain that the operation of such a service in time of peace is not nearly as simple as Deputy Hickey has suggested, and I am equally certain that it would not be half as difficult as Deputy Dillon pretends.  We need not discuss that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We set out to buy ships because we could not charter them, and set out to buy under conditions which were absolutely abnormal.  There are so few ships available and so many people <Col N="2407" /> wishing to buy that this talk of sending an independent valuer to look at the ships before we buy seems to me to come from people who must be living on the moon.  How are we to value the ships, and on what basis?  The price this company has paid for ships bears no relation to their pre-war value.  If we are to send a valuer out to value ships before we take them, we certainly will get none, as somebody else will have bought them first.  What instructions could we give?</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>If we send out a valuer, are we to tell him to have regard to the normal commercial value before the war?  If so, he will need to multiply his figure considerably before he arrives at a price that the sellers will accept.  Is he to value them on the basis of the price which might be paid in some country remote from the area of conflict, or the price which might be given by a willing buyer to a willing seller.  The value of these ships is what they are worth to us, and what they are worth is the price we can get them at, having regard to our urgent need to bring in supplies.</P>

      <P>The position is constantly changing for the worse.  The price is going up.  Deputy Dillon talked about ships having been offered to individuals here at a lower price than was paid for them subsequently.  Of course that might happen.  One can visualise the board of this company sitting down with limited resources&mdash; the amount of dollars put at their disposal, and which represents all we <Col N="2408" /> have, is very limited&mdash;and taking a list of the ships available for sale, and picking out those which they think would be best, having regard to their resources.  It is no good making an offer to buy ships that cannot be paid for, and consequently, there must be a limit to those available within their means.  They may get none.  By the time they make an offer, the ships may not be available, and then they may have to come back again and go over a second list of ships available, and by the time they would have made another offer the price may have gone up.  That can happen time and again.  We are buying in a rising market, in which there are scarcely any ships available at all.</P>
      <P>It is mainly due to the efforts of this company that we have the five which we have to-day.  I will not say that I know the previous history of all these ships.  Deputy Dillon was very facetious here about a ship that was purchased, not in Lisbon as he said, but in a port in Spain.  Obviously he was concerned to make an attack on the board of this company.  It is unfair that the privileges of this House should be used to attack people who are not here to answer for themselves. We set up this company&mdash;the Dáil can refuse to set it up if they wish.  We asked independent business people to act upon the board of this company, and there came on the board of Irish Shipping, Limited, businessmen who are giving almost the whole of their time without pay in the national interest.  I think they should be immune from the type of attack in which Deputy Dillon has indulged.  I feel we will not get responsible businessmen to do national service if, when they have offered themselves for national service, they are subjected to that kind of attack.</P>

      <P>Now Deputy O'Higgins is at it.  The board had to cover up what was already done?  He represents a group of business men, acting in an independent way, as doing something underhand and discreditable.  I think there should be, on the part of Deputies in this House, a sense of responsibility. This reckless use of the privileges of the House to attack people who are giving useful service in the national interest should stop.  There was a time when it would not be allowed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is time this should stop.  You may attack me as much as you like, but to use your weapons against people in this country who are not here to defend themselves, is not fair.  I ask the responsible people in the Party opposite to put a gag upon <Col N="2410" /> those who cannot control themselves, for they will do this nation a bad service.  We bought a ship in Spain. It was unfortunate that Deputy Dillon took that one as an example.  I mentioned that some of the ships could have been sold within a week or two at a substantial profit.  That ship, the &ldquo;Vassilios Destonnus&rdquo; was bought in Spain.  We could sell it now at a profit of 100,000 dollars, as there has been offered more than the company paid for it to the extent of 100,000 dollars.  Deputy Dillon may become as funny as he likes, but let him go to the North Wall when that ship arrives and make his speech there, and it may not sound as funny then.  Another ship, the &ldquo;Leda,&rdquo; which was purchased in New York could, he said, have been purchased at a substantially lower figure.  That is not true.</P>
      <P>Let us take the question of insurance. Deputy Dillon said that we were paying a 20 per cent. insurance, which could have been obtained for 17½ per cent.  Will he get somebody prepared to do the insurance at 20 per cent.? The premiums which will be required to effect insurance on these ships amount to 80 per cent.  per annum on the value of the ships, and there is considerable difficulty in placing insurance at that rate.  Deputy Dillon says that some broker in Dublin is prepared to do it at 17½ per cent.  Will he name him?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>You do not insure ships per trip.  The suggestion is made here that some broker in Dublin is in a position to place an insurance upon those ships at a lower price than the company is paying.  We are entitled to ask who it is.  Deputy Dillon says he does not know.  The company is employing as its insurance brokers one of the most reputable firms of London brokers, a firm of the highest standing. That firm is exploring the market for the purpose of insuring these ships, and it is finding considerable difficulty in insuring them.  I am sure Deputies will appreciate how difficult it is to effect insurance of ships in existing circumstances.  That firm of brokers wants to know who is this other broker whom Deputy Dillon has in mind, to <Col N="2411" /> whom he referred before&mdash;the broker who can effect insurance at a lower rate.  If we can locate that broker, we will be very glad to avail of his services.</P>
      <P>Why must Deputy Dillon make these charges here?  He can go to any of the directors of the company and he can have any of these rumours which he mentioned investigated by a director of the company.  The position is that the Deputy is prepared to walk in here and refer to any cock-and-bull story that is told to him by some half-baked lunatic outside.  Must the people who come to advise Deputy Dillon have straws in their hair before he will not believe them?  Surely the deputy leader of the Opposition Party should have some sense of responsibility, and he should at least make some effort to check his information before he gives it publicity.  Is it that he is just utterly reckless, or are the members of his Party utterly reckless to allow him to do and say those things?</P>
      <P>When we were in Opposition no Front Bench member of our Party would be allowed to make statements of that kind until he had checked and doubly checked their accuracy and was fully conscious that his information was correct.  That is why we are here and that is why Opposition Deputies are where they are, and they will be there through all eternity so long as they let Deputy Dillon lead them by the nose and act with such reckless irresponsibility.  These ships will be operated under Irish Shipping, Limited, which will, in turn, act under the direction of the Government.  The Government will decide what the ships will carry and where they will go. The operating companies will employ the crews and will buy the stores and do all the work of a ship's manager. It is far more economical to do it that way than to endeavour to set up a new organisation under existing conditions. If that system does not operate satisfactorily, we can change it, but it seems to me to be the most intelligent way of doing things.</P>

      <P>I said the company was now employing a part-time secretary. Why should they employ anyone else until the ships are on the seas?  That is the plan of operation.  Irish Shipping, Ltd., buys the ships and gives them to the existing companies to operate.  It decides where the ships will go, the goods they will carry, and the freights they will charge, and it will leave the detailed management to those who know the business of management, endeavouring to ensure that the freights will be sufficient to involve no loss in operation, and hoping to recover some of the cost of depreciation as well as the cost of operation, but always facing the possibility that it may not succeed in that and, consequently, may have to come to the Dáil to ask to be assisted by subsidy, just as every other Government has to subsidise shipping under present conditions.  Deputy Norton asked us when we will stop buying ships.  We will stop buying when we cannot get any more.  We will buy as many as we can get.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That the Dáil hereby approve of the Gárda Síochána Pensions Order, 1941, made on the 13th day of June, 1941, by the Minister for Justice, with the sanction of the Minister for Finance, under Section 13 of the Police Forces Amalgamation Act, 1925, and laid before the Dáil on the 17th day of June, 1941.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This order, as the House is aware, is accompanied by another document which has been placed on the Table, and in respect of which Deputy Norton has an annulment motion.  This order is designed to provide pensions for officers and men of the Gárda who have been found to be inefficient.  The matter was mentioned here during the discussion on the Estimate for my Department, and I agreed that there were certain senior officers in the Gárda who were unfit for their positions.  I <Col N="2414" /> said on that occasion that it would be necessary to introduce these two orders to deal with the situation.</P>
    <P>I should like to say at the beginning that some of the rumours that have reached me, and that are current throughout the country, as to disloyalty and unrest amongst the Guards are absolutely unfounded.  There was never any suggestion at any time that that was the case.  The position simply is that some officers have shown themselves unsuited for their posts.  The vast majority of the officers and men have been all that could have been expected. I tried to make that clear when dealing with the matter on the Estimate, but unfortunately the scare headings given to other matters in the newspapers so overshadowed it, that the impression got abroad that there was a grave state of unrest and general inefficiency in the service.  I should like to correct that impression now.  At the same time I must say that some senior members of the force have shown themselves to be unfit to remain in their positions.</P>
    <P>It is to deal with that situation that this order has been made: providing that they shall be pensioned at the rate to which they would be entitled under the regulations which provide for the retirement of people who are incapacitated by ill-health.  They will be entitled to a gratuity only of one-twelfth of the salary for eight years' service. In the case of those entitled to pensions, those with over ten years' service will get at the rate of one-sixtieth of each year's service.  For any officer or man having 20 years' service or more each year after 20 years will count as double.  I do not think we have any officer with more than 20 years' service, so that the order will mean that those retiring will do so on a pension of one-third of the present salary.  I am not quite sure how many it is proposed to retire.  In the retirement order the Commissioner must certify that in his opinion certain officers are inefficient, and that it would be in the public interest, as well as for efficiency in the Gárda that they should be retired. That certificate will be sent to the Government, which may order the retirement of the officers concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I am anticipating Deputy Norton moving his motion, as it may put the debate on a more realistic basis if I say what I intend to say now.  As the order stands at present if the Commissioner certifies in the case of any member of the Gárda &mdash;who is not an officer&mdash;that it would be in the interests of the force that he should be retired the Commissioner may order his retirement.  I understand that exception has been taken to that, and that the point Deputy Norton is interested in is that it means that one person can order retirement without an appeal to any tribunal or to anybody else.  There is some force in that argument, but when dealing with the police force the overriding consideration ought to be the discipline and efficiency of the force rather than the comfort of the people making up that force.  It will be generally accepted that that ought to be the over-riding consideration.  The principle on which the Commissioner is appointed is that he should be directly responsible for discipline in the Gárda Síochána.  That is a very good principle. In this order I might point out that there is an amelioration of the procedure regarding the disciplinary code, under which the Commissioner may dismiss any man who is not an officer&mdash;the Government dismisses an officer&mdash;after inquiry by a disciplinary court.  In this case it is not a case of dismissal but of retirement on pension.  I understand from the Commissioner that there are some men whom he has been reluctant, on compassionate grounds, to discharge, and as a result the force is suffering. This order will make that easy, and will make for a better feeling in the force generally, when the Commissioner is able to retire men on small pensions.  I know that there is a feeling in our Party and in the Labour Party&mdash;I do not know about the <Col N="2416" /> Opposition&mdash;that there should be some overriding authority as well as the Commissioner.  I am prepared to amend Section 4, clause 2:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(2)  Whenever the Commissioner is of opinion that it is in the interests of the efficiency of the Gárda Síochána that any member of the Gárda Síochána to whom this regulation applies should retire, the Commissioner may order the retirement of such member.</P>
      <P>If it would meet the objections raised I am prepared to issue an amending order and to insert after the word &ldquo;Commissioner&rdquo; the words &ldquo;with the consent of the Minister&rdquo;.  I hope that will meet the objections which have been raised.  In a matter of this kind I would be most anxious that we should have general consent.  It would be bad if there was going to be opposition later by any Party or by any considerable body of the House.  It would be very undesirable.  The police force is there for the whole country, and as servants of the State it is desirable that there should be general agreement about the matter, as Deputy Mulcahy pointed out when he referred to it. There should be general support in this matter, as action will only be taken for the better management of the police force.  That is the only motive that operates in the minds of the Commissioner or of the Government, and to meet any objections I propose to make the amending order.  I hope that will be more acceptable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>This order which the Minister for Justice has made seems to me to be a very drastic one, and is putting into the hands of the Commissioner a power which it was not deemed desirable to give him when the parent Act was passed by the House. We are now in an emergency situation, and because of some recent difficulties which have manifested themselves, we decided to give very wide powers to the Commissioner, powers which we did not think it desirable to give on any previous occasion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know that the set of circumstances which exists at the moment justifies the giving of such wide powers to the Commissioner.  I have no complaint against the Commissioner.  He may be a very admirable man, conscientious and faithful in the performance of his duties.  He may have all the virtues required for the high office which he fills.  I am not concerned with the occupant of the office, now or in the future, but I am concerned with the wide powers which we are putting into his hands.  I am concerned with those powers in particular in so far as they affect the ordinary rank and file of the Gárda Síochána.  Folk who are chief superintendents or superintendents are usually well able to look after themselves, and are not wholly helpless in the matter of discovering friends to plead their case.  I am concerned with the ordinary rank and file in ensuring that they do not get a raw deal simply because some folk in high places have, in the view of the <Col N="2418" /> Minister, misconducted themselves.  I ask Deputies to notice the contrast there is in these regulations as conceived by the Minister.  In sub-section (2) of paragraph 3, it is provided:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Whenever the Commissioner certifies in writing that, in his opinion, it is in the interests of the efficiency of the Gárda Síochána that any member of the Gárda Síochána to whom this regulation applies should retire, the Government may order the retirement of such member.</P>
    <P>In that case a certificate is required from the Commissioner, but it will be observed that the over-riding decision as to whether a member of the Gárda Síochána should retire or not rests with the Government.  That deals with the case of high officers in the Gárda, and it is quite likely that the Government will not be anxious to act capriciously in dismissing a man.  But when we come to paragraph 4 of the regulations, the difference between the two grades is very obvious.  Sub-section (2) of this paragraph provides:</P>
    <P>Whenever the Commissioner is of opinion that it is in the interests of the efficiency of the Gárda Síochána that any member of the Gárda Síochána to whom this regulation applies should retire, the Commissioner may order the retirement of such member.</P>
    <P>It is clear that the authors of these regulations consider that, in the case of the officer, there ought to be a review of his case by the Government, but that, in the case of a sergeant or an ordinary Guard, he is simply to get his walking papers from the Commissioner. That seems to me to be a very unfair discrimination against the rank and file.  I do not think that it is going to be put right by the offer the Minister has just made, to introduce an amending regulation.</P>
    <P>Let us see what we are doing under these regulations.  The Commissioner is getting power to say that, on his own volition, he has decided to retire, let us say, Guard Murphy.  He gives a certificate that it is in the interests of the efficiency of the force that the Guard should be retired, whereupon he <Col N="2419" /> goes.  Under the existing regulations, if that Guard were charged with an offence he would be obliged to get a disciplinary inquiry.  He would have to be found guilty before being dismissed. A long procedure would have to be gone through, in compliance with the regulations laid down under the Act, before it would be possible to dismiss him.  Under this regulation, there will be no need to do that.  The old procedure is being short-circuited.</P>
    <P>The Commissioner simply decides that he is going to retire a Guard.  No charge has been preferred against him. All that will be necessary is that the Commissioner should certify that the Guard should go out of the police force, whereupon he goes.  No charge, as I I have said, is made.  The Guard gets no trial, and there is no inquiry of any kind.  There is no verdict given in his case by any impartial third party.</P>
    <P>I may be told by the Minister that, under the present regulations, if a person is charged with a very serious offence and found guilty, he may be dismissed from the force.  But why should a person, whose offence is not such that you could bring him before a disciplinary court, not be given at least as fair a trial as the one whose misconduct is such that you do bring him before a disciplinary court?  If at present a Guard is guilty of an offence which merits dismissal, normally, and that his conduct is so reprehensible as to justify dismissal, well and good, there is a definite procedure laid down for dealing with him.  But, if you cannot bring a man before a tribunal, from which you might secure a verdict of dismissal, why not give him at least the rights that you give to the person who has committed a much graver offence? In these regulations you say to the man, against whom you cannot frame a charge likely to lead to his conviction and dismissal&mdash;because his offence is not sufficiently grave&mdash;that he is not to get as fair a trial as the person who may be dismissed.  In these regulations, the Commissioner for the time being is given the power to say to a man with short service, five or ten years' service, or it may be to a man with a wife and large family: &ldquo;In my view <Col N="2420" /> it is not desirable that you should remain in the Guards,&rdquo; whereupon that man's service is terminated.  He will get a very small pension under the Act. He is thrown out and will then have to fend as best he can for his wife and family.  He will be given no reason as to why he was thrown out.  No charge will be made against him and no trial held.  He will be merely told that he is to get out of the Guards, because the Commissioner thinks it is desirable that he should go.  Therefore, he will be obliged to go and take a miserable pittance.</P>
    <P>His reputation will be destroyed. Everyone will know that he had to come out, after a short service, on a small pension because the Commissioner certified that it was better that he should be out of the force than in it.  With that sort of certificate in his pocket, he is not likely to get much to enable him to maintain his wife and family.  How is he going to find employment in a country that is already glutted with unemployed people?</P>
    <P>I do not allege, and it is no part of my case to suggest, that the Commissioner would abuse the powers given to him under these regulations.  At the same time, I know that despots are made by giving despotic powers. When people get despotic powers they are more likely to be despotic than if they had not such powers.  My object in moving for the annulment of this regulation is to secure that a man will get a fair trial.  No matter what offence a person may commit in this country we provide courts of justice for his trial, and if there is any reflection on the integrity of any member of the Gárda Síochána he ought to get a trial.  At present you can try a man for two types of offences which, on conviction, may lead to disciplinary action or dismissal.  Why not give a man whose offence does not justify you in invoking that type of machinery against him the right to a trial before you dismiss him?  Let the man know the charge made against him, give him an opportunity of defending himself, and let some impartial body pass a verdict on the facts as presented against the man and as urged on his behalf.  I suggest to the Minister that <Col N="2421" /> this matter is quite easy of solution, if it is his desire to help to bring about a solution.  If it be thought that there are cases in which it is desirable in the interests of the efficiency of the Gárda Síochána, that a Guard should be retired, what is the difficulty in serving notice on such a man that it is proposed to superannuate him on a certain date in accordance with the other regulations, at the same time giving him the right to appeal against that proposal?  What is the difficulty in constituting a tribunal of representatives of the Department of Justice and of the Gárdaí themselves which would be presided over by some independent person, to review the facts of each case?  If the tribunal agreed with the proposal to retire a Guard, then his retirement could take place in accordance with the pension regulations.  A man should at least know what he is charged with.  He should at least have the opportunity of putting forward some defence to the charge made against him, and he should be sure all the time that he will get a fair trial and an impartial verdict.  He should be assured that his career, his future, his honour and his reputation will not just be the plaything of any person who cares to fill in a certificate authorising his removal from the force.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister might very well reconsider this whole matter and try to provide some right of appeal for a person whose future and whose livelihood are in jeopardy and the future of whose family may well be put in still greater jeopardy by the despotic or injudicious use of the powers with which we are arming the Commissioner under the order which has been placed on the Table.  I urge the Minister, therefore, to amend his order so as to provide for trial of the person concerned, so that he will know the charges made against him and be given an opportunity of meeting them and so that a fair verdict can be given.  Having got a verdict that the person concerned should be retired in the interest of the efficiency of the Gárda, that person should go.  If the person concerned elects, of his own choice, to go when he hears the proposal, let him do so. If he contests the justification for pushing him out of the force, he should <Col N="2422" /> be given an opportunity of meeting the charge made against him and getting a fair verdict.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will see his way to amend the order much more extensively than he has proposed to do.  If he does, I think he will undo some of the mischief which, I am satisfied, has been done to the Gárda force by the statements made recently.  I do not think that anybody can come in contact with any member of the Gárda without learning that the members were gravely perturbed by the statements made on June 4th.  The Minister said on that occasion: &ldquo;In raising it (the conduct of certain officers of the Gárda) I consider that Deputy Mulcahy made a very useful contribution concerning the safety and the security of the State, generally.&rdquo;  I, for one, do not believe that the safety or security of the State was in any way endangered by the Gárda Síochána.  I do not believe for a moment that the difficulties were of such a character as to justify the use of the phrase &ldquo;safety and security of the State&rdquo;. It may be true&mdash;it probably is true; I do not doubt the accuracy of the statement&mdash;that certain persons in the Gárda were not doing their duty in the efficient manner we were entitled to expect, or that some persons in the Gárda had not shown the responsibility associated with their rank.  While that may be so in respect of a handful of persons, we must remember that there are 7,000 persons in the Gárda, that there is universal admiration for the force and that we do a grave disservice to that force and are calculated to undermine public respect for it if we indulge in language suggesting that the safety and security of the State are endangered when a handful of people have shown that they could not adhere to the high traditions and the excellent standard of efficiency and loyalty which have characterised the Gárda force.</P>
    <P>I hope that the Minister, when replying, will go even further than he has gone already and say on behalf of the Government, as I say on behalf of those I represent, that he believes the Gárda force, as a force, will be loyal to any Government elected in this country, that it will serve the State to the best of its ability and that it has <Col N="2423" /> shown in the various vicissitudes through which we have passed but one concern&mdash;to serve the best interests of the State.  If we make statements reflecting on the conduct of the Gárda as a force or, in our desire to censure certain members of the Gárda, make statements calculated to refer to the force as a whole, we do a very big disservice to a very valuable body of public servants&mdash;a body which, during the past 20 years, has, certainly, given service to the nation which entitles it to the admiration and respect of all the citizens.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the motion. Since this State was established, it has passed through a very troubled time. During the period that has elapsed since the establishment of the Gárda, the Chief Commissioner has been changed, or retired, on four or five occasions.  Notwithstanding the troubled times through which we passed, the overwhelming majority of the people have absolute confidence in the efficiency and honesty of the general body of Gárdaí.  During that time also&mdash;the Minister has more information on this than anybody else&mdash; large numbers of officers and men have been either retired or dismissed without any of the ceremonious and rather sensational statements of the type made here by the Minister when we were discussing the Estimate of the Ministry of Justice.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the headlines given to the statement made by the Minister in the papers misrepresented what was in the Minister's mind.  So far as I can learn, they have badly shaken the confidence of the people as a whole in the efficiency of the Gárda Síochána.  There has been no time in the history of this country since the Gárda was established when it was more necessary that the Gárdaí should have the confidence of the people as a whole than the present time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The good conduct of the Gárdaí, and their efficiency as a police force, are very closely associated with the defence of this country, both internal and external.  Personally, I think that the <Col N="2424" /> bringing in of this order might have been discussed either with members of the Defence Conference or representatives of the different Parties before action was taken, and before the recent statement was made by the Minister for Justice.  We all know that there are many busybodies in the country anxious to manufacture stories which will suit their point of view in present circumstances.  It is the busybodies&mdash; the fifth columnists and the sixth columnists&mdash;who are responsible for misrepresenting the mind of the Minister in connection with this whole matter.  If five or six or fewer officers of the Gárda have been certified by the Commissioner as unfit to occupy their positions because of misconduct, they should be retired from the Gárda without long discussion or ceremonious statements which would cast a slur on the whole body during these very difficult and dangerous days.</P>
    <P>This is a matter on which the less said the better under present circumstances. I appeal to the Minister to accept the very good advice given him by Deputy Norton, and to make it quite clear in his concluding statement that the sins of the few officers or members of the force will not be made a reason for casting a reflection on the Gárda, as a whole, and thus undermining the confidence of the people in a body which should enjoy the highest possible confidence in present circumstances.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyJMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two features of the Minister's proposal about which I want to speak very briefly.  With regard to the small number of people among the higher officers who are concerned in the Minister's proposal, I think that the proposal to give them an increased pension allowance is peculiarly strange.  I see no reason why this House should be asked to give its approval to putting a premium on inefficiency.  I think if this matter is investigated&mdash;and I think it should be fully investigated&mdash;ordinary methods of dealing with matters of the kind could be discovered, and that special treatment in cases of this kind is hardly called for and can hardly be justified.  That is not the particular <Col N="2425" /> point that I want to discuss as much as the rather drastic powers that are sought in the Retirement Order over members of the Gárda Síochána.  I object, as one member of the House, to giving the powers that are asked there to anybody.  I do not care how impartial a Commissioner of the Gárda is, and I do not mind how fair a Minister may be&mdash;and the present Minister is a typical example of one who can be fair and generous&mdash;I object to giving powers of that kind summarily into the hands of one or both together.  I think it is asking too much.  It is laying down, because it is going to be part of our permanent code, a precedent which can be most unscrupulously and dangerously worked in future.  I object to it for that reason.  I do not think that any single person, or any two persons, in authority should get this power.</P>
      <P>I agree, from a general knowledge of the country, that the number of things that could come within the scope of an investigation of this kind would be likely to be few, and I want to say with regret that, if there is any decline in the morale of the Guards throughout the country, the reasons for it are fairly evident.  We had a situation not too long ago when everybody in authority in every parish in this country felt that he had the power of life and death over the Gárda force. Such people felt that a letter to a certain place would have the result either of transferring a Guard or dismissing a Guard, and the discontent, restlessness and uncertainty that were created by political interference and the political terrorism of that kind have had a bad result.  I do not say that for the purpose of embarrassing the Minister in any way.  I disassociate him entirely from anything like that, but it is a regrettable fact that things of that kind went on, that men were moved and that men were put in a position of being looked upon unfavourably because certain political influences were used against them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to know who is going to be the judge in this matter of inefficiency. Inefficiency is a term that can be very vaguely and very widely used and it might have not the same meaning for <Col N="2426" /> different people.  I suggest to the Minister that in looking for powers of this kind that are sought to be permanently embodied in the code that will govern the administration of the Gárdaí in future, he ought to set up, as Deputy Norton has suggested, a committee of representatives of the Department of Justice and representatives of the Gárda, appointed through their representative body, who will have the power of review in this matter and of submitting, if necessary, their findings to the Department or to the Minister for Justice.</P>
    <P>I am glad that the Minister has made it perfectly clear that the scare stories which spread so rapidly throughout the country recently had no foundation in fact.  I appreciate the Minister's desire in matters of this kind, as in all other matters for which he is responsible, to be fair but I think he will remove a good deal of reason for apprehension and doubt in future if he is able to lay before the House proposals that will ensure that nobody in authority, either now or in the future, will have the power, the wide and extreme power, of being able to dismiss Guards at a moment's notice and without giving any reason whatever.  I think the Minister would do very well to go further into the question of amendments to this order so as to set completely at rest the fear that the powers that are now sought may be used unfairly or unscrupulously in future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to see that the Minister has signified his intention of improving the order by leaving the members of the Gárda a further appeal to himself, so that the decision to retire any member of the Gárda can be reviewed by the Minister.  That is a definite improvement in my opinion. I should like respectfully to suggest to the Minister that he should take the further step of providing that when a report is about to be made upon an officer, an N.C.O. or an ordinary member of the Gárda to the effect that he is inefficient, that member of the force would be sent for by his immediately senior officer, that the report which is going to be made about him <Col N="2427" /> should be read out to him, as happens under an Army regulation, that the accused member of the force would then sign the report, admitting that it had been read to him but not necessarily admitting the facts of the statement contained therein, and that he would have 48 hours to prepare a defence or a reply to that report.  It might further provide that there was an obligation upon the Commissioner, upon the superintendent in the case of a sergeant or inspector, or upon the sergeant in the case of a Gárda, to transmit the defence to the person who is going to make the decision so that the Government would have the full grounds for the proposed retirement and the person affected would know that he had some chance of putting forward a defence.</P>
      <P>As the order stands, I am afraid of it, not that I think it will be abused or anything of the sort but, as it stands, human nature being what it is, the danger is that an officer may be charged, tried and convicted behind his back, and may not hear a word about it until he is simply told to &ldquo;get&rdquo;.  Similarly with a member of the force.  I do not suggest that that is the intention but, as it stands, that is possible, and in the interests of the force and of the State that should not be the position.  I am satisfied&mdash;and I wish to pay this tribute to the Gárda Síochána&mdash;that through no action of theirs was the State ever in danger in any way but that, on the contrary, they are the most loyal servants that ever existed in any country.  The proof of their loyalty is to be found in the fact that this Government time after time has paid tribute to them when, some short years ago, they were not so sure that they would be so loyal.  It is, therefore, essential that the Minister should improve the order by making provision for the protection of the force.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It appears as if this were a regulation made to meet a situation which has arisen.  Let us hope it is only a situation of a temporary nature, in which four, five or six people&mdash;I hope not more&mdash;are involved.  This is going <Col N="2428" /> to be held as a sword over the heads of the Guards for the years of their natural existence because of defects in three or four people at the moment.  I think there should be some method of either reviewing or terminating this regulation, and I suggest that it be given effect for six or 12 months and then, if after the lapse of some time it is found to be either useful or to have served its purpose, it can be reintroduced or allowed to lapse.</P>
    <P>There is one point in support of the contention I have made and, in speaking of it, I trust I will not be regarded as being offensive to anybody.  A section was inserted in the Defence Forces Act designed to grant benefits to members of the forces, that is, the half-pay section.  In reality, it was intended as a means of giving members of the forces an opportunity of finishing their education.  It was inserted as a privilege, so that if a member of the force were studying law or medicine, he had 12 months in which to complete his studies and could then be reemployed by the Minister.  It was inserted in the administrative part of the Act as a privilege, as an advantage, to members of the Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>By reason of some peculiar interpretation that privilege section has been turned into a penal section, and anything which it is possible to do in any Act or in regulations to the disadvantage of servants of the State should be guarded against, and we should not make it possible for something to happen which none of us intends should happen.  I suggest that it and when this order is considered necessary, these amendments be incorporated in it.  In that manner I think we will go a long way towards satisfying members of the Gárda and the public generally that justice and fair play are being given, and that there is an appreciation of the services of the force, and also that the Government intend to see that no injustice is done to any member of the Gárda, but that each member of the force will get what he is entitled to, and that the people will get from the Gárda the service they are entitled to get from them.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not think that I would have to say any more on this matter, but I should like to recall that when I raised this matter on the Justice Estimate I said, at col. 1278 of the Official Reports of 28th May last:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;There are certain districts in the country where, in my opinion, and in the opinion of others, there are senior Gárda officers who are not fit for their responsibilities there, who have discredited themselves in the eyes of the local people, and who are no longer held in any respect at all.  That is not a matter that has occurred since the emergency, but the fact is that, at the moment, to go back no further than that, there are districts in the country where there are senior officers of the Guards who should not be in the position in which they are, and whose presence in that position is a blow to the institutions of the State.  Their character is such that they are not only not able to attend to their business, but they are disedifying, and their administration is partial.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Later on I said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;At the same time, men who are working in the Guards ought not to be asked to work in circumstances in which, through the lack of character and the weaknesses of their superior officers, they and their corps are in danger.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I entirely support the Minister's action in bringing forward the order in regard to officers and I entirely support him in his feeling that, when doing that, he has to strengthen his hand in regard to dealing with the ordinary members of the Guards, because, as some Deputies have pointed out, there are 7,000 men in the Guards, and incapacity or unsuitability of officers can damage the whole force and can be unjust to the whole force as well as being unjust to the State.  I also conceive it possible that unsuitability of ordinary Guards may be a danger to the officers above them, or to the men who are their colleagues, and the Minister was simply dealing with the matter completely and effectively when he <Col N="2430" /> brought forward the order as dealing with the Guards as well.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether some of the criticisms made here were made because the Minister did not outline when introducing the order what steps would be taken inside the Guards themselves by way of charge and reply, but I cannot conceive of any action being taken with regard to an officer in which the case against him would not be plainly stated to him and in which he would not have an opportunity of stating his case.  As the order contemplated suggests, there is no way in which the Government could judge a matter at issue on a report from the Commissioner unless they had a statement of the charges against the officer and the officer's reply.  I feel sure that the Minister should be able to satisfy the House on that point.  I cannot conceive either how the new proposal, that any intention to dispense with the services of a Guard will have to go to the Minister, could get to the Minister without the charges having been put to the Guard, and without his being given an opportunity of answering, and the whole case then put before the Minister.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that a Guard should have an appeal to a tribunal, but I do not think that anybody who considers the responsibilities of the Minister and of the Commissioner, with regard to a police force, could suggest that there could be erected in any way a tribunal that would dictate to the Minister and the Commissioner combined that a man should be kept in the Guards when the Minister and the Commissioner, having reviewed what is to be said against him and what he has to say for himself, had decided that he should go.  I think the position of the Minister and the Commissioner would be utterly impossible, if, in relation to a force like a police force, there was to be set up, independent of them, any tribunal which could dictate that they should keep a man in the force who they both considered should not be in it.  I think any Minister with any sense of his responsibility would have to resign, and any Commissioner with any sense of his responsibility would have to resign, if, against their <Col N="2431" /> judgement, a man was kept in a disciplined force who they thought was not a suitable person for the force.  I am glad that the Minister is able to meet the objections, or some of the objections at any rate, to the original draft of the order.  Although in present circumstances it might not be necessary to hold the Commissioner completely responsible, I think that in particular circumstances it might not be unreasonable to throw complete responsibility on him.</P>
    <P>The two orders that are being made seem to me to be a protection to both officers and men rather than anything else.  I do not know how the situation that has been complained of has been allowed to arise, but I do say that while it is quite easy to get up and say that the Guards are respected from one end of the country to the other, there are districts in this country where the Guards have not that respect, districts where the individual members of the Guards and officers of the Guards know that they cannot hold up their heads because they know&mdash;to deal with superior officers alone&mdash;that there are higher officers among them who are a disgrace to their cloth, in the first instance, and who are a danger to the position, to the happiness, and to the honour of the men under them.</P>
    <P>What the Minister is asking is that where, in particular circumstances, a man is found not to be suitable for the kind of force that a Gárda force is, they shall have power to remove him, and power to remove him without penalising him in respect of the services he has given.  I think that anybody who has been a member of the police in recent years is entitled, in the absence of any definite crime that can be charged against him, to have taken into consideration the earned increment which has been withheld from him during those years towards his pension.  I do not think anybody should object seriously to men who, for reasons of their non-suitability, have to be removed from the Guards, being paid whatever quota of pension was earned as a result of the number of years' service they have already given. I do not know of any other way of dealing with the situation that is in <Col N="2432" /> front of us than by giving the responsibility to the Commissioner and the Government&mdash;the Commissioner in dealing with officers, and the Minister in dealing with Guards.</P>
    <P>Injustices have been done to officers and men in the past, I believe, as a result of the laxity that has grown up. I doubt if injustices are going to be done under these orders, but even if they should occur, they could only be a fraction of the injustices that have been done to men in the past as a result of this particular laxity.  If injustices should be done, then both the Minister, and the Commissioner through the Minister, are responsible to this House.  To those who have objections of one kind or another, such as to the absence of any kind of clause in the order with regard to inquiry and so on, I would appeal that, if the position is that the Minister assures us that all officers and men would be heard, and that the men's case and the officers' case would be heard, either by the Minister or the Government, respectively, the powers that the Minister is seeking for should be given, because there is a particular, if a small, situation to be cleaned up, and I think it would be unfortunate if, in the cleaning up of that situation, the Minister would not have the full support of the House.  I believe that he has, and I think that everybody who has spoken appreciates that the Minister is a man who will deal with this matter in a purely detached way.  I feel, on the other hand, that the Minister will be able to assure every Party in the House that no man is going to run the risk of suffering an injustice under any of these orders, but that he will be fully heard so far as anything he has to say is concerned.  I do not think that anybody should be kept in the Guards at the present moment who both the Commissioner and the Minister say is unsuitable for it.</P>
    <P>When I spoke on the last occasion I mentioned the possible effect, not only on the people around, but on the Local Defence Force, the Local Security Force and the other forces that have been organised for the protection of the State in these areas where there is this laxity.  I imagine it was these <Col N="2433" /> remarks of mine that made the Minister use the words that were complained about to-day by Deputy Norton.  I know of nothing, in any part of the country, connected with the Guards that would suggest that they were disloyal to the State.  I should be sorry to think so, and it was not because of any disloyalty of that particular kind that this matter was raised.  It was raised simply from what can be read in the terms in which I mentioned it here.  There is, however, a serious situation in the country, which requires the fullest possible confidence and the fullest possible discipline in the Guards.</P>

      <P>The serious situation is the situation arising out of which we have had to raise an army of 40,000 or 50,000, to organise 100,000 men in the Local Defence Force and the Local Security Force, to organise people in the Air Raid Precautions and Red Cross, and similar organisations&mdash; the situation of which these things are the signs and the indication.  In circumstances in which we have to throw up that organisation, in which we have to spend that money and call on our people to join in all kinds of protective organisations, the police should be a body standing rigidly to attention with perfect discipline and confidence in themselves&mdash;the men in the officers, and the officers in the Commissioner&mdash; and they should have sufficient confidence in us here to know that we are not going to see any injustice done.  I think we can only act through the Minister and the Commissioner, and I think the Minister will be able to give these assurances that have been asked for here.</P>

      <P>Deputy Mulcahy opened his remarks by indicating that he thought it would be difficult, if not impossible, to have justice done to a Gárda officer without having reference made to the Minister or having an opportunity of allowing the officer to present his side of the case in the charges made against him.  Deputy Mulcahy then proceeded to reiterate <Col N="2434" /> the very wild statements which he made previously and which he quoted to-night.  From my knowledge of the country, I can only characterise these statements as wild, unwise and intemperate. The Deputy may have had some individual experience of the kind of laxity he speaks of, but from my experience in my own part of the country I can say that the statements made by Deputy Mulcahy and the reception they got from the Minister, who congratulated him, so to speak, on his patriotic action, have caused more distress in the minds of the public generally in regard to the administration of the Gárda force than anything actually existing would warrant or justify.</P>
      <P>Deputy Mulcahy proceeded to-night to repeat his statement about people being a disgrace to their cloth, unworthy and unfit.  I think it is perfectly unworthy of a gentleman who has held a responsible position in this State to make those charges against a force that deserves the very best from this Government, from the previous Government, and from the country generally.  The history of the Gárda Síochána is a matter for pride, and if there have been some lapses it is only what might be expected from any member of the human family.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think Deputy Mulcahy has been very seriously led astray.  I believe he has done much more harm than the good he seeks to achieve.  I am sure his intentions are the very best, to try to restore confidence in the Gárda. A responsible Deputy would not be expected to make these statements, if he had not very good ground.  He seeks to pillory the whole Gárda force without any evidence.  He asks that the officer should produce evidence to defend himself against a charge, but he condemns the Gárda force without producing any proof to the House in support of some rumours or whisperings he has heard.  He has no better opportunity for hearing things than any Deputy of this House.  As far as I am concerned, and I move through the country as much as any other Deputy, I have not seen anything to warrant this strong language, but I have got evidence of the disturbed state of public feeling that has been <Col N="2435" /> aroused by the statement of Deputy Mulcahy, and this order is attributed in the public mind to Deputy Mulcahy's utterances, and from the order it would seem that his statements are accepted <i>in toto.</i>  Under the order there is the right to dismiss Gárda by the officer in charge without any inquiry of any sort or kind, the right of the superintendent to dismiss an officer of the Gárda by making representations to the Government, which must be accepted.  That means you are setting up a dictator, completely and entirely.  Whoever he is, any man is capable of erring. Deputy Mulcahy has stated that, prior to now, injustices have been done to Gárdaí and to officers.  He should know.  He was in the Government for long enough in this country.  I wonder if the proper steps are being taken to secure that injustice will not be done in future.  I suggest that when all these powers are vested in any individual, let him be the most worthy individual who could be selected, he is capable of abusing these powers.  The right of dismissal should not be vested in any individual.  Responsible as is the function of the Gárdaí and the superintendents, they still ought to have a right as individuals to some form of trial.  As I said earlier on, the history of the force is one to inspire confidence. This seed of distrust that has been sown is likely to create disturbance.  I think that is a most unfortunate position. Deputy Mulcahy in his last remarks did withdraw that he had any evidence of disloyalty.</P>

      <P>Dealing with the Gárda Síochána as a whole, I do not think, apart from the question of disloyalty, they should have epithets hurled at them by certain sections in this country, or that it should be suggested that they are completely out of control or under the control of those who are a disgrace to the force.  No individual is mentioned and each county is asking: &ldquo;Is it my Gárda Superintendent who is in trouble, and how many of them are involved?&rdquo; The thing is growing like a snowball.  It would be well for the country and the Gárda force as a whole if an early opportunity were taken to disclose the names of the individuals and the number who have in any way incurred the displeasure of the Commissioner.  It would be preferable to having this kind of rumour which is undermining the confidence of the people in the Gárda force.  I hope the Minister will not allow this atmosphere to lead him into taking steps that will be too drastic, that he will see justice is done and that those men who have given good service will not be lightly cast aside by giving powers to some individual who, <Col N="2437" /> because of bias or heat or passion at some particular time, may mar the life and finish the career of a man who had given and was prepared to give good service, and who might have been guilty of some breach or alleged breach of discipline.  I think that power should not be given to any individual. There ought to be a tribunal, as has been suggested.  The officers and the men are entitled to get an opportunity to defend themselves.  I think that is only bare justice, the minimum this House ought to give to a force that, individually and collectively, has given good service to the country.</P>

      <P>I approached consideration of this motion with great regret, and a decision on it with reluctance. There are two forces in this country which must be disciplined, which were disciplined when this Government took over office, which were worthy of the confidence of the people, which were efficient.  It is, in consequence, a matter of very great regret that the years should not have added to their efficiency, and should not have made them even more disciplined than they were.  It is not, in my view, the fault of the Gárda Síochána that it has become a cause for consideration here and the subject for disciplinary action by the Commissioner of the Guards together with the Minister. There is no doubt whatever that the moment this proposal was first brought before the people of the country there was considerable uneasiness. In my view there is scarcely a real cause for that uneasiness.  It would have helped very considerably in connection with the discussion of this motion if the Minister had given us an approximate estimate of the number of the officers and men whom he had in mind who would fall to be dealt with under these two resolutions.  In the normal course, the administration under these two orders calls for very considerable ability, not only that, but for confidence on the part of the public and of the Gárda.  If I were asked from what sources I would have selected a Commissioner of the Guards I would have said right off that one of the last places I would seek for him would be in the Civil Service.  I think <Col N="2438" /> the House is prepared, and the country is prepared to take the Minister's approval in appointing the present Commissioner.  The House and the country are prepared to take that, but it is a very big responsibility.  It is a responsibility that ought not to have been put upon him.  There are many capable men, many men of ability, who are not competent in the control of men, and this particular new duty that is going to fall upon the Minister is perhaps the most onerous that could possibly be put upon a man.</P>
      <P>In view of the unusual character of this order, there ought to be a time limit on its operation.  I would not regard the putting of a time limit upon it as any concession on the part of the Minister.  It would be in the interests not only of the Gárda but of the people and of the Commissioner. In all the circumstances, and in view of the Ministry's responsibility for this situation having arisen, in my view, an officer or a man ought to get a final chance if he makes a case for it. In my view also, an officer or a man should get an opportunity of tendering his resignation, if he so desires, instead of being retired.  If we are to look for an efficient, competent and disciplined force, we must give them the maximum security regarding their permanency in any office that they may occupy, from the latest recruit up to the office of Commissioner.  There should be at some time or other a statement from the Ministry that there will not be political interference with the Guards.  On a previous occasion, when I put that to the Minister, he thought it was an offensive proposition. I want to assure the Minister of this: he knows I have no friends in the Ministry&mdash;none.  Other than the Minister himself, there is possibly one other Minister to whom I would give those powers&mdash;only one.  This is a disciplinary code, a very severe disciplinary code.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The suggestions which have been made here for dealing with this situation do not commend themselves to me.  You cannot run either a police force or an army on the lines on which you would run any other service or <Col N="2439" /> any other business.  They have a discipline of their own and a code of their own.  As it is a very severe disciplinary code, one must ensure that the greatest possible security will be afforded to the members of both those services regarding their permanency. There must be no interference with them.  It is quite clear that that has not been the case during those last few years.  It is unfortunate that that is so, and the fact that we are now faced with the necessity for an order of this kind is perhaps the best reminder to us that that situation has been allowed to develop.  An efficient and disciplined police force is an almost priceless possession in any country, and this country has been particularly well served from the earliest days by the Gárda Síochána. It can continue to give this service only if it be a strictly disciplined force.</P>
    <P>It can continue to give it only if it gets the support of the Ministry, a support which to my mind has been lacking in recent years.  We are satisfied that the Minister, since he took up office, has endeavoured to improve the situation which was allowed to go on for so long.  In the course of the administration of this very large body, there had been during the time of the previous Government regular and systematic inspections of stations. Would the Minister tell us, towards the conclusion of the proceedings here to-night, whether that policy is still in operation?  If not, it is rather unfortunate that it has been allowed to pass into disuse.</P>
    <P>No efficient and disciplined member of this force, in my opinion, need have any apprehensions regarding his position after this motion has been passed.  As matters stand at the moment, the Commissioner and the Government have very great powers in dealing with either the officers or men. Under this particular order, it may be put into fewer words, but the power was there, and is not very much affected by this particular order.  In this case, where the Minister comes before us and tells us that the second most important body in the country&mdash;<Col N="2440" /> if it were not for the present emergency it would be the most important body&mdash;requires an extra disciplinary code, we have no option, in the interests of the country and in the interests of the Gárda force itself, but to give him those powers.  Any apprehensions we have in regard to it are bound up with the manner in which those powers will be exercised.  In the exercise of them we want something more than mere blunt honesty.  We want ability, experience in dealing with men, a proper sense of judgment in assessing what is efficiency, and a capacity to take into consideration all the circumstances of the case.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made here by one Deputy to the fact that the country will be faced with the necessity for paying pensions now under those peculiar circumstances.  That is quite true; that is one of the prices we have to pay for what is by some people called &ldquo;democracy&rdquo;. If you have a democratic system which allows abuses to occur, which allows indiscipline to meander its way all along the line, you have to pay for it, and make up your mind whether or not you have been a contributing factor to those abuses.  The amount involved will not be very considerable, I should say, although we have no direct information from the Minister with regard to it.</P>
    <P>If it increases the efficiency of the Guards, and if ultimately it gives the Guards themselves a greater degree of security&mdash;which in my opinion it ought to give, and will give if it is properly administered &mdash; then, notwithstanding the fact that it has all the appearance of a surgeon's knife which is not particularly sharp, it may do well.  At any rate, I am supporting this, as I say, with great reluctance because of the circumstances.  I believe it to be my duty to do so.  If a Minister of State comes here and makes a case for an order such as this, to enable him to assure the public that they are going to have an efficient and competent service, I can see no reason why he should not get my support for it.  I only regret that the occasion ever has arisen when an application of that sort should have been made to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFrancisOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>In a time of real <Col N="2441" /> emergency, uncertainty and danger, I personally cannot subscribe to any motion to withhold temporarily or permanently from whatever group of people happen to be the Government any powers, no matter how drastic they may be, in order to bring about higher efficiency or more discipline in any of the services of the State.  I say that with particular reference to the uniformed services of the State.  If the only choice before a Deputy in this House is to take a clean-cut vote either for the order as it stands without the alteration of a single comma, or the motion to annul the order and leave the normal unwieldy delaying procedure to be used within the uniformed services in the face of real uncertainty and grave emergency, then I would have no hesitation in voting for the order without the alteration of a comma.</P>
      <P>There has been a certain amount of exaggeration, in my opinion, in association with this debate.  The suggestion is that there is something unjust within this order, that in some way or other the force is being victimised or may be victimised.  I have great respect for the Gárda Síochána and great regard for the Army, and I wish that a few of the tears shed here this evening could have been reserved for the Army. If the ordinary soldier or officer in the Army got conditions half as good as the Guards will enjoy under this so-called unjust order, they would give their eyes for it.  Remember, I would throw a brick as often as a bouquet, and I meet a brick as often as a bouquet.  I do not see any particular reason why, if ever there is a debate affecting or relating in any way to the Gárda, everybody should be competing with one another in paying compliments, but if it is the Civil Service or the Army we are debating, nobody feels obliged to pay compliments.  They are all Irish services and they have all been efficient, loyal and satisfactory, and all equally so.  There are conditions now being applied to the Guards, described as harsh and brutal, which I would like to see secured for the Army to-morrow. Every officer of the Army would like that, too.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is not an officer or a soldier <Col N="2442" /> who cannot be retired at the order of the Minister, without knowing why, and there is no elaborate machinery to ensure that that man is at least entitled to a pension for the years of service that have gone by.  Somewhat similar powers are being taken within this order to retire Gárda officers and to retire members of the Gárda, but every precaution is taken to ensure that they get the full pension for every month, week and day served.  What would the Army officer not give to be in that privileged position?  Is there any reason why you should particularly discriminate against the Army officer? I believe that the population of this country is so small that what is fair for one is fair for the other.  If you accept that the Army has been groaning under appalling injustice for the last 21 years, and that they have got a fair measure of justice now, that measure of justice plus a substantial bit extra is being applied to the Gárda Síochána&mdash;and we are wailing about it. If the wails are sincere, I want to see the roof pulled down off this building the next time we have a discussion on the Army here.</P>
    <P>I did raise one or two questions of this kind in association with the Army on one or two occasions and no one got weary counting the number of votes that accompanied me through the Lobby.  What is the position?  Members of the public and Deputies were disturbed, mentally excited, because a statement was made to the effect that the Minister wanted powers to deal with high officers in the Gárda Síochána, in order to increase the security and protect the safety of this State.  Let us take our minds away from the cities.  In fact, the whole question of the safety and security of life and property in the average county hangs like a shroud from the shoulders of the chief superintendent of the Gárda.  I do not care whether it turns out ultimately to be a military job or not; the eyes, the ears, the agents of the State, who must be on the alert and on their toes all the time during this emergency, are the members of the Gárda Síochána.  If there is any flop there, if there is any flabbiness, any laziness or leaning back&mdash;no matter <Col N="2443" /> through what cause, whether through insobriety, through laziness, through absence or through slackness&mdash;unquestionably the stability and security of this State are threatened and undermined.</P>
    <P>We are living in times when, perhaps, our sense of values must change from day to day, just as was outlined in the last debate regarding the day-to-day change in the value of ships.  I believe that from month to month there is an increase in the value of vigilance, alertness, reliability and all those factors that go to make up security.  That value is increasing as one day passes another, and things we could afford to ignore in normal times cannot be ignored without danger in times such as there.  Everyone of us is soft-hearted, everyone of us is human and has the normal weaknesses of a human being.  We do not like to see any man getting into trouble or losing his job, and in normal times, perhaps, many of us would say that these men have given good service for 16 or 17 years, and that one should be lenient with them now.  It is just like an army in war time.  Things to which one would not give a thought in times of peace justify the penalty of death in times of war, because the lives of so many may depend on one simple private soldier letting up on his job. We are not living in times just now when we can view with any degree of easy mind any State official, but particularly any uniformed official, any uniformed member of a disciplined force, letting down on his job.  That is so true that the weak links have to be severed in the interests of the State.</P>
    <P>What is being done here?  Yesterday you had no choice but to fire every-one of those men without a pension, without a gratuity.  In the Civic Guard Pensions Regulations a man, I believe, could only get his pension having served his full service or if he went out on medical grounds.  If he went out for any other reason, for inefficiency, misconduct or by way of resignation, he was not entitled to a pension.  Steps are being taken here to ensure that a man will get whatever pension or gratuity is due him according to his years of service.  That is a very reasonable <Col N="2444" /> thing.  Arguments have been advanced here: &ldquo;Why not let the man go before the court?  Why not let him either get the charge proved or clear his character?&rdquo; I wonder who is the best friend of the people who may be affected by this order?  Supposing the Minister says: &ldquo;Done; we will send the whole lot of them before a disciplinary court.&rdquo;  Even if, in half the cases, the charges were proved, there is no power either in this order or in the previous order to give these men, with the large families that Deputy Norton spoke about, a halfpenny a year as a pension.  They go out disgraced, discredited men without a halfpenny a year of a pension after their many years of service.  That would be the result of tying up the Minister's hands so that he must, willy-nilly, send them before a disciplinary court.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I may not have a good ear for music, but I have a good tongue for words.  If the Minister is left in this position that, conscious of his responsibility and conscious of the possible dangers that we are facing, he must eradicate any weaknesses in that force, even what might be regarded as minor misconduct three years ago, it must be taken up promptly and, if he has not the machinery that is proposed here, then he has no other way of strengthening that force but to try the men and, if there is sufficient evidence to dismiss them from the Guards for misconduct, for gross inefficiency, he cannot give them a pension.  Would any of us like to see any of the men <Col N="2445" /> going out on those conditions?  Many of us may have our weaknesses.  Many of us may have given ten, or 15 years' good service and then break down other than in health&mdash;go over the rails.  None of us wants the service of past years wiped out and merely the crime or misconduct recorded and tagged round a man's neck for the rest of his life.</P>
      <P>This order is a reasonable order and a modest order under conditions such as exist now.  The two orders, taken together, one being the complement of the other, show certainly a very reasonable effort to ensure efficiency, discipline and vigilance, and at the same time be as reasonably fair as the taxpayers can afford to the person whose services you are dispensing with.  In an emergency situation this order is a reasonable order.  I am not so sure and I am not so very trusting that it is wise to make an order of this kind for all time.  We have no intention at the moment.  The Minister has a certain intention, but only one intention.  The Commissioner has only one object in view, to increase the soundness of the force, to increase the respect the general public has for the force, to increase the amount of confidence that people have in the force.  We will have many more Ministers and many more Commissioners.  You may have a Minister or a Commissioner who takes a petty view of affairs and who would dispense with the services of an officer or Guard for some really minor offence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If those powers are to last for all time, I would not be so enthusiastic in supporting them.  I strongly urge the Minister, in the interests of the force and not as a person in any way opposing these proposals, but in order to get the greatest volume of support behind the proposals inside and outside of the Gárda, to consider that aspect.  I do not believe there is a member of the Gárda who would object to these proposals if they were war-time proposals.  The ordinary soldier does not object to run the risk of being shot for a minute's absence from his post during time of war.  It would not be reasonable to hold such threats over a soldier's head in times <Col N="2446" /> of peace.  We are in something like a war situation.  No officer and no member of the Gárda would object to those powers having life as long as the emergency lasts, and after that being renewable every 12 months.  I believe the longer we experience these powers the more we will begin to see the justice of this new arrangement, and the less we will be afraid of injustice. Therefore, I ask the Minister to consider the advisability of giving for this order's first span of life a life like other emergency measures&mdash;for the duration &mdash;and after that give it a life like our Army has, existence from year to year. If there are any injustices, then they can be discussed here from year to year and the powers withdrawn, if necessary. If the order is proceeding along perfectly satisfactory lines, as I hope and believe it will, then I think the sound commonsense of the Dáil will see that there is no good in bringing this forward every year, and it will be passed as a final measure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnLymbrickEsmonde" hpid="Mr. Esmonde Mr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder if it would be possible for the Minister to give the House some information, approximately, of the number of members of the Civic Guard involved and, in addition, to indicate generally, consistent with the necessity of the situation and with discipline, what type of offences are intended to be dealt with.  Since this matter was first mentioned in the Dáil, considerable public attention has been focussed on it, and questions have been directed to Deputies inquiring what is wrong in the Guards.  Some people have offered opinions on what they thought could be wrong, but if it is possible for the Minister to indicate what the offences are it would allay public disquiet.  Possibly the Minister realises that that would be the right thing to do, but it is for him to use his own discretion.  It would be of some assistance if he made a statement. Since the present situation has arisen it has been found necessary to issue orders which are complementary. Under the Police Force Amalgamation Act, 1925, which is the Act dealing with discipline in the Guards, and under which terms of service and allowances are fixed, there are two <Col N="2447" /> sets of orders prescribed, one under Section 13 dealing with pay and retired allowances and one under Section 14 dealing with discipline.  The order made under Section 14 of the Act is a very extensive one and is a complete code for dealing with offences.  It sets out, first of all, what offences are contrary to discipline, and the other one sets out what the authorities can do to deal with breaches of discipline.  One of the things they can do is to dismiss an officer but, so far as I can find, there is no provision made for retiring an officer or member of the Guards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, in the opinion of the Minister, a situation has apparently arisen in which he and his advisers think it necessary that towards certain members of the Guards steps should be adopted which are half-way between dismissal and half-way between voluntary retirement.  If the first order granting a superannuation allowance or a pension under circumstances unprovided for in the existing code is passed, obviously there must be another order. It is in connection with the second order that the difficulty has arisen.  I suggest to the Minister that he should try to meet the propositions put forward practically by every Deputy who has spoken, by limiting the time that the order for retirement will be in operation, and also to give the person concerned some warning that he is going to be charged with an offence under which he will be retired.  As far as I can see, what might happen is that any member of the Guards might become a victim of this order.  I am not suggesting that there should be a court of inquiry, but it is right that a man should know before the actual decision upon what grounds he is to be retired. He should know definitely in writing that he is the person that it is contemplated should be retired, and a reason should be given for such retirement, in order to give him an opportunity of explaining his position.  If he were unheard, it might be that grave injustice might be done.  If the person concerned had an opportunity to explain his case, it might be quite satisfactory. That would safeguard the individual <Col N="2448" /> concerned.  If there was a time limit on the order for retirement, and an opportunity given for explanation, I would not quarrel in any way with the order.  It seems to me that the whole situation with regard to these two orders has arisen out of kindheartedness on the part of the authorities, and the wish not to have to invoke the drastic penal powers they have to get rid of any member of the Guards under the regulations, but to adopt an alternative method which, although the person involved is guilty of an offence, does not deprive him of a right to some superannuation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>As an independent Deputy I wish to support the appeal made by the Leaders of the other Parties for a time limit on the operation of the order.  On the whole the order is not unjust to some members of the Gárda, inasmuch as under the existing law Guards found guilty of grave offences are liable to dismissal without any chance of obtaining pensions. While this order is necessary in the present emergency, it definitely contains an element of danger if made permanent, inasmuch as that might, in the hands of a less impartial Minister, or a less impartial Commissioner, be too freely used against a member of the force.  It contains another element of danger, as it might be used to the disadvantage of the taxpayers in many cases.  The order might in some cases become a danger both to members of the force and be unjust to the taxpayers. I can visualise circumstances in which a commissioner faced with two alternatives, either to dismiss a man who has been guilty of a serious offence, or to take disciplinary action against him, dismisses him and then he would not be entitled to any pension. If the offence was a serious one that would be a proper decision, but where the Minister has an alternative of availing of this order he might be tempted to inflict an injustice on the taxpayers by allowing the man a pension out of kindness of heart.  The taxpayers' interests should be considered in addition to the interests of the Guards, and for that reason it is desirable <Col N="2449" /> that this order should be confined to the period of the emergency.</P>
      <P>Having regard to the fact that the Minister has agreed to amend the order, so as to take the power to dismiss members of the rank and file out of the hands of the Commissioner, without his approval, I think the House should be unanimous in support of the order.  It is a matter of the utmost importance that the efficiency of the Gárda should be maintained at the highest possible standard.  This is not only a question of preserving peace and order, because we have also to rely on the Gárda to take measures that affect the economic life of the country, by ensuring the operation of any emergency measures that concern our essential supplies.</P>
      <P>We also have to rely on the Gárda to make effective the various economic measures adopted.  In a period of great emergency it is absolutely necessary that we should have a most efficient force.  Therefore I think that no member with any sense of responsibility would be anxious to oppose the Minister in obtaining the powers that he is now seeking.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened with great care to what Deputy Mulcahy had to say on a previous occasion in regard to this motion, and to what he had to say to-day.  I adopt every word he said.  I do not think he overstated the case, and I do not think he understated it.  I think he stated the case as it ought to be stated, and as it required to be stated in the circumstances. The discharge of a public duty of this character is never pleasant for the Minister responsible, nor for any member of the Opposition who has to approve of it.  That should not deter any man who deems he has a duty to discharge to go ahead, and Deputy Mulcahy did what I expected he would do.  The attitude of the Labour Party is that they are all concerned for paper safeguards, but no paper safeguards will save the situation. If we envisage a situation in which the Commissioner and the Minister are going to enter into a conspiracy to victimise a Guard, the paper safeguards will not save him. <Col N="2450" /> As I see the situation, any member of the Gárda Síochána who is called upon to resign under these regulations must ultimately be called upon to do so by the Minister, acting as a sort of court of appeal.  The Minister knows that the decision he gives in that capacity is liable to be called up for review in Dáil Eireann.</P>
      <P>What better tribunal does a Guard in this State want for the security of his position than the Commissioner to begin, the Minister to follow, and finishing up with Dáil Éireann, a tribunal which no ordinary litigant in the State has access to?  None of us can review, or call into question, the decision of a judicial tribunal, but every time this particular tribunal functions its decision can be called into question.  The Minister can be called upon in Dáil Éireann to answer for its decisions.  Similarly, the Minister for Justice, or the Taoiseach himself, may be called upon to answer for the Government's decision in regard to an officer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my opinion, the concession which the Minister is prepared to make to the order is a prudent concession.  It removes from my mind the last apprehension I had in regard to the way in which this order might be administered now or in the future.  Deputy Murphy referred to some possible causes of present dissatisfaction, or, perhaps, I should say, of present unsatisfactory conduct in the ranks of the Gárda.  I think that the moderate terms that he employed could not be improved upon, beyond saying that I think they accurately describe the true source of our present difficulties.  I do not propose to elaborate them further.  There is always the difficulty in this country, and particularly in this House, that if you have occasion to refer to any shortcomings in an individual national school-teacher in this country, somebody gets up and charges you with denouncing all the national school teachers in Ireland.  If you refer to the impropriety of a comparatively rich citizen fraudulently collecting the dole, you are denounced as the mortal enemy of the unemployed, and so it is suggested that the terms in which the inefficient officers and men who do <Col N="2451" /> exist in the Gárda force at the present time have been described, amount, in the words of Deputy Keyes, I think, to a denunciation of the Gárda Síochána, and to the employment of reckless language to destroy the reputation of that force.  Far from Deputy Mulcahy using reckless language, I suggest that it was Deputy Keyes who allowed himself that indulgence this evening. There is no question of anybody attacking the men of the Gárda Síochána.</P>
    <P>I say quite deliberately that I consider the Gárda Síochána to be one of the finest police forces in the world. I say deliberately that, in my home town, if any young man asked me by whom he might safely take example, I would recommend him to model himself on the members of the Gárda Síochána serving in that town at the present time, and that if he did so I would rest perfectly sure that he would come to be a good citizen and a decent man.  But it is the very fact that the force is so satisfactory and deserves so well of this country that should make us solicitous to discharge our duty by that force.  When we entered public life we undertook the obligation to do the dirty jobs as well as to collect the fruits of office, if they ever came to us.  It is not the job of a Gárda down the country to discipline his own officer, though it may be well known to a Gárda that much of what is unsatisfactory in the area where he serves is due to the shortcomings of his officer.  If we sit idly by, or prevent the Minister from doing his duty in order to remove abuses, then, far from doing an individual Gárda or the Gárda Síochána a service, we are betraying them, and making it impossible for them to maintain the high standards which hitherto have reflected credit upon them.</P>
    <P>I do not know why we are all so chary, building up in this House a sort of awful mystery about what we understand to be the shortcomings which require to be dealt with.  Some people charge me, I know, with being indiscreet. I do not believe it is ever right to hide the truth from the people.  So far as I am aware, there are some senior officers in the Gárda and they <Col N="2452" /> have got into the habit of going on &ldquo;the better&rdquo;.  Now that is a thing that any of us might do&mdash;go on &ldquo;the batter&rdquo;&mdash;if only we would come off it. That is plain talk.  When you have gone to a man time and again and said: &ldquo;Look here, this must not occur again, it is giving scandal to the men under you, it is bringing disgrace on your uniform and is making your position in the community where you are a senior servant of the State impossible,&rdquo; and it goes on occurring, what are you to do?  You must do one of two things.</P>
    <P>You can sack him or get him to retire on superannuation.  Here is a decent fellow who gave yeoman service to the State in dangerous times, who stood fast and held his men together. He was as good a man as one could possibly meet, but he suddenly developed what a venerable parish priest of my acquaintance once described as &ldquo;a good man's fault&rdquo; and he cannot cure it.  Now, having exercised patience and forbearance with that man, you know that if the Gárda Síochána in his area is to be kept together, you have got to get him out.  How are you going to do it?  Do Deputies want that man to be kicked out and to be disgraced?  I do not.  I welcome the terms of this order which enable the Commissioner to go to him and say:-&ldquo;If you have not got sense enough to resign, we will resign you.&rdquo; If that does not succeed in knocking sense into that man's head, nothing will.  That course of action will give him an opportunity of sobering himself, of pulling himself together and of becoming a credit to himself and his family.  This order contains the only hope of salvation for such a man. As I have said, he is a really decent man.  His shortcomings may be due to weaknesses he developed when he was a much younger man&mdash;during a period when he gave yeoman service to the State.  I do not think it is wrong to the people to tell the people that.</P>
    <P>I believe there is another abuse.  I am not speaking with any special information. I did not ask the Minister or the Commissioner for any information, and I do not know anything of the inner secrets of the Gárda force. <Col N="2453" /> I think that there is another abuse and that it is no harm to mention it.  I think that a practice has grown up in which certain weak men have allowed themselves to be imposed upon by unscrupulous persons who desired to lend them money and get them into their power.  Having got themselves into that position, these men are unable to extricate themselves and, though cautioned and checked on previous occasions, have allowed themselves to fall into similar traps again.  Such men are not fitted to discharge the duties which they are liable to be called upon to discharge at any moment as officers of the Gárda Síochána.  I am profoundly convinced that the men guilty of these offences constitute but a microscopic minority of the general body of the Gárda.  But if these abuses were allowed to become a daily fact of Gárda life, if such conduct were to be tolerated in the uniformed forces of this State, then, unless the Gárdaí were angels, you would find that sort of demoralisation spreading out through the force and men would say: &ldquo;What is the use of conducting yourself with restraint and setting an example higher than that required of the secular community when the fellow who fails to do so has as good a chance as you?&rdquo; What we have to do is remind the Gárdaí that, though not always passing encomiums on them or throwing bouquets at them, we appreciate the fact that the vast majority of them have established, and maintained, a splendid standard, that any falling away from this standard on the part of a few individuals has to be noticed and action taken effectively and promptly, and that we are not afraid of the responsibility of doing that. It is our confidence that prompt handling of this situation will restore the high traditions and morale of the Gárda Síochána, which encourages us to face this duty, disagreeable as it may be.</P>
    <P>I do not think that any reasonable man in the country interpreted Deputy Mulcahy's remarks or the Minister's comment as meaning that the Gárda were &ldquo;rotten.&rdquo;  They knew what was going on and hundreds of them said: &ldquo;Thanks be to God because I used to <Col N="2454" /> ask myself whether the Minister could have known some of the things I knew and had tolerated them.&rdquo;  Citizens will come to know now that these facts were known, carefully excogitated and that the position was handled by the Minister as they would be by any prudent man.  It would have been easy for the Minister to lose his head and to call on the Commissioner to dismiss this, that and the other man.  I think that he showed forbearance and prudence in saying: &ldquo;This news is disagreeable but let us not rivet our attention on these fellows' failings.  Knowing their failings, intolerable as they are, let us think of their past service and see if we cannot devise a plan to remedy the evil in the Guards and still not lean too heavily on the men whose weakness has brought them into this position.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I shall vote for these two orders but I think it would help everybody to support him if the Minister would accept Deputy MacEoin's proposal&mdash;that is to say, that where a Gárda or an officer is to be reported to the Commissioner and his case is to be subsequently reviewed by the Minister or the Government, as the case might be, he would be afforded an opportunity, on terms analogous to those obtaining in the Army, to set down his answer to the charge, so that he would feel that the Commissioner and the Minister would see the allegation against him and his answer to it at the same time&mdash;that the Minister, on appeal, would not be prejudiced before he had time to tell his tale.  We are all human and, if somebody makes a report against us, and if we get in with our story only 48 hours later, we feel that authority's mind has become rigid and prejudiced against us and that our tale is looked upon with suspicion.</P>
    <P>If the charge sheet and the answer go up together, the Commissioner sees both, and the Minister reads both, no reasonable man can urge that his case has not been fairly stated.  Unless a member of the Gárda is prepared to go forward and say that he believes that the Government, the Minister, and the Commissioner are actuated by corrupt motives, he cannot believe that substantial injustice has been done him by <Col N="2455" /> compulsorily resigning him and giving him a pension which he would not be able to get but for the passing of these two regulations.</P>
    <P>I do not want to conclude without reaffirming what I believe all Deputies, without exception, feel&mdash;that the Gárda Síochána, taken as a body, are as fine a body of police as there is in the world.  It is that knowledge, and an appreciation of that fact, that enable most of us to do our duty so as to ensure that there will not remain in its ranks men whose conduct might ultimately result in the demoralisation of the entire force.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>The actual order before the House is not that which is referred to in the motion by Deputies Norton and Davin, but is the order enabling the Minister to grant a pension, in certain circumstances, to members of the Gárda.  I should like, for my own information and guidance as to my attitude on this order and on the motion by Deputy Norton, to know whether sub-section (2) of Section 13 of the Police Forces (Amagalmation) Act, 1935, was complied with before this order was made.  Sub-section (2) of that order is, curiously enough, not recited in the pensions order before the House.  That sub-section provides that, before making such an order as we are now considering, the draft of the order should be given to the bodies representing the several ranks and grades of the force to be affected, and that the Minister should consider the representations, if any, made to him in respect of that draft order.  I thought it was rather peculiar&mdash;there may be nothing in the point&mdash;that, in the order itself, there is no recital that the statutory provision was carried out.  I thought it might have been an oversight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>It was carried out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>It struck me as peculiar that compliance with the statutory requirements had not been referred to in the order.  Assuming that it has been carried out, I should like to get information from the Minister as to what <Col N="2456" /> representations, if any, were made by the representative bodies of the officers and men affected by this order because my attitude towards this order and the order referred to in Deputy Norton's motion would be largely, if not entirely, influenced by the representations made by the representative bodies of the various ranks affected by the order. The Minister did not say, in his opening statement, whether or not the order had been given to the representative bodies but he now says it was given.  I should like him to tell us what they thought of it, if he is at liberty to do so.</P>
      <P>On one aspect of these orders, an additional safeguard is being given to the officers and men affected by the provision that, in case of compulsory retirement, a pension is secured to them.  It may be that officers and men of the Gárda were satisfied with that position.  It may be that they asked for additional safeguards under this order or that they objected to it in its entirety.  I think that the House is entitled to know what representations were made by these men, if the Minister is at liberty to give that information. It would have some little effect on my mind to be assured that full opportunity was afforded to the representatives of the officers and men of the Gárda to consider these two orders and make representations.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dillon stole a phrase which he saw on the back of my papers and I have a grievance against him on that account.  He said he had not any use for &ldquo;paper safeguards,&rdquo; which was my phrase.  I have no use for paper safeguards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The safeguard that is offered by the Minister here is paper, and flimsy paper at that.  It is hardly paper at all, because the Minister says that he will provide an additional safeguard in the order to the effect that the Commissioner can certify only with the consent of the Minister.  When I consider the remarks of the speakers who have preceded me as to how the position of the men would be improved or disimproved by that addition, so far as I have been able to come to any clear decision on the matter, <Col N="2457" /> owing to my entire disbelief in paper safeguards, I have come to the conclusion that it would be disimproved rather than improved.  I appreciate the fact that the offer was made in an effort to allay misgivings that are felt in all parts of the House as to the drastic nature of the order and the way in which it may be administered. On the whole, I should prefer a Commissioner in whom I could have confidence, a man who would be independent in the exercise of his functions either of the Government or of the Minister, and who would be prepared to mete out impartial treatment in the interests of the public to all sections of the force.  I would prefer to trust him rather than to have on top of him the political influence of a Minister.</P>
    <P>I want to repeat what has been said by my colleagues, that I trust the present Minister.  I am not at all sure that I would go so far as my leader in saying that I would trust one other Minister, but, at most, there is only about one other that I would trust.  I have confidence in the Minister, but that does not decide the principle in this matter.  In fact, the alleged safeguard offered by the Minister causes me rather more misgivings over this order, because once you introduce the principle that the Minister can interfere with the discretion or the exercise of the powers of the Commissioner, then you introduce a method by which all the political clubs in the country can bring pressure to bear in the matter.  You will then have the Guards brought to a state in which they will believe that if they are going to avoid compulsory superannuation or resignation they must have certain political tags, ties or affiliations so that they can, if necessary, bring certain influences to bear to override the decision of the Commissioner. That is the danger in giving the Minister control.</P>
    <P>It may give the Gárda a safeguard against a dictatorial Commissioner. But when you come to work out how it is going to operate, you inevitably reach the conclusion that, no matter what safeguards you provide in an order or in a statute to preserve the <Col N="2458" /> individual rights of officers and men, unless an order of this kind is fairly administered, no safeguard, even in a statute, is of any use.  We had an instance of that in connection with the Magazine Fort where the officers had certain rights under statute and we know that the case of these men was prejudged before they got an opportunity of arguing their case.  Yet they were supposed to have certain safeguards. When I heard the Minister making this suggestion that the consent of the Minister should be necessary before any order for retirement or resignation became effective, the case in connection with the Magazine Fort came to my mind and I came to the conclusion that the Minister's safeguard was not worth the paper it was written on.</P>
    <P>Deputy Norton asked for an inquiry as provided for in the Act of 1925.  That would appeal to me personally as a far better safeguard than the one offered by the Minister, but again it is only a paper safeguard.  If you have a dictatorial commissioner who wants to get rid of a certain officer or man, he can rig up a disciplinary body who will obey his dictates.  They will be his subordinates and he will be in a position to browbeat and intimidate them into bringing in the findings that he is seeking.  Therefore, I reach the conclusion that paper safeguards are of no use whatever.  I can make only one suggestion and that is, that the order should expire annually, that it should not have life for more than one year and that, at the end of that time, if it is necessary to renew it, we should be entitled to consider the administration of the order for the previous 12 months.</P>
    <P>Deputy Norton directed most of his remarks to the rank and file of the force.  He was apparently satisfied with the position as regards the officers.  I am not at all satisfied with the position as regards the officers any more than I am with the position of the men.  The officers cannot be removed except by the Government.  The first speech I made in this House, I may recall, was a protest against the action of the Government in removing a commissioner of the Guards.  The <Col N="2459" /> Government sat in judgment on the highest officer of the force years ago, and all the present trials and tribulations of the Guards are traceable to the action of the Government at that time.  Deputy Mulcahy has, however, stated that a certain situation exists amongst certain sections of the officer personnel of the Guards that calls for some sort of power such as this order provides.  So far as I am concerned I accept, and would accept at all times, anything Deputy Mulcahy says in that respect unhesitatingly.  Such a statement would not be made by him unless he had the strongest ground for it. The charge, if it can be called a charge, made by Deputy Mulcahy the public will believe, as I believe it, unhesitatingly and unquestioningly, and he would not have brought the matter to the notice of the Minister if he had not very serious grounds for his action. I accept what Deputy Mulcahy has said as being absolutely and entirely true, and I agree that it calls for some such action as the making of this order. I think, however, there should be a time limit to the order or that it should be necessary to renew it every year.  I think that that is the best safeguard that this House can give to the officers and men of the Guards, that orders of this kind will not be abused.  I do not think any sort of paper safeguards is worth anything. They are hardly worth the paper they are written on.  The only safeguard which the officers and men can have against a politically-minded Government or Minister or a subservient commissioner is that action taken under the order can be reviewed in public in this Dáil when the order is being renewed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I have only one or two questions to ask, and I think there is not likely to be any other speaker before the Minister concludes.  I want to know whether the Minister can, in <Col N="2460" /> this order, take power to himself to deal with cases that have occurred during the last 12 months in which men have been dismissed or called upon to resign without pension, and who feel that an injustice has been done to them?  There are at least three cases in Dublin in which men believe that an injustice has been done to them.  Take a case, for instance, where it might be said a man did an injustice to himself.  A man with a service of from 20 to 22 years, owing to family trouble and in a fit of pique, refused to go into the office to do his work, and he was dismissed.  I should like to know whether the Minister has power to deal with cases of that kind. That unfortunate man, as I say, had from 20 to 22 years' service.  He stayed out from his work and was discharged. He is now perhaps a little bit sorry.  I have also a case I mentioned here a week ago, of a Guard to whom his friends, who investigated his case, feel that a terrible injustice has been done. If his case were reviewed he would get at least a small pension, after 16 years' service, which would enable him to justify his position.  He would be able to get employment, and the small pension will enable him to keep his wife and family, and save him from going on the rates.  There are only three cases in the city that I know of, and I ask the Minister to take power in this order to reconsider these cases, which are causing trouble to a good many Deputies.  I saw these same men talking to three Deputies in the last week here.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make two points before the Minister speaks.  I propose to give the Minister my personal support in this matter, but with the great trepidation and reluctance which Deputy Cosgrave has already expressed.  That support will be somewhat influenced by the answers he gives to these points.  I want to know whether the situation which has developed, and which calls for this particular enactment is a sudden emergency, whether it is a case of people with a good record suddenly succumbing to some unexpected temptation, or unexpectedly breaking down as a rein <Col N="2461" /> sult of some peculiar circumstances, or is it a second situation which may have developed, representing an observable and observed deterioration over a period of years, or whether it is even a third situation representing the natural and inevitable outcome of bad appointments and promotions.  If it is the first, I cannot conceive of any big number being involved.  I, therefore, think the situation must have developed out of the second or third position, and, if that is so, I should expect the Minister to tell us, with a certain amount of penitence, that he has a certain share of Parliamentary responsibility with regard to what has come about, and, if he would reveal himself in an honest and frank way, as we expect from him, he would get the sympathy of the House, in regard to this emergency which has arisen, whether over a period or suddenly.</P>
      <P>I do not agree with Deputy O'Higgins that it is an emergency of a war type.  I do not think it has anything to do with the war.  It may be aggravated by the war situation, but what has been suggested here would be intolerable even in the piping times of peace.  I suggest that instead of having suggestions about an annual Act, the Minister take this power to deal with the situation and, when it is finished, wipe out these regulations.  I do not believe in this matter of allowing the Minister to slide people easily, on the grounds of so-called inefficiency, into a pension position.  It would be better for the House, for the Minister and for the Guards themselves, and make for better promotions and better supervision by the Minister over the Guards, if he took the position of facing up to the harsh and Spartan treatment of sacking a man without a pension and having to give reasons to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the matter be a question of alcoholic excess, as referred to by Deputy Dillon, I am not in favour of allowing people to drink themselves to an easy pension and that might be the result of having this regulation adopted in perpetuity.  I suggest to the Minister that he accept the view that he should deal with this situation under these regulations, then tell us that it is <Col N="2462" /> finished and let us get back to the old situation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>To deal, first, with the point made by Deputy McGilligan, and which was made by several speakers, as to the duration of this order, I am impressed by the case made for its being an annual order to deal with a situation which exists now.  I hope we shall not have to deal with any more such situations, and I consent to limit the duration of the order to 12 months. One danger that I see in doing what Deputy McGilligan suggests, that is, of dealing here and now with the situation which exists, is that there may be men on the borderline and the Commissioner may think that a little time might get them to pull up.  I think we should give them at least 12 months in the hope that there will be an improvement.  I undertake, however, to limit its operation to this year.  If necessary, and I hope it will not be necessary, it can be brought in again, and, if not, it can be allowed to lapse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As to how this situation came about, whether it was sudden, or observed over a period, whether people were allowed to deteriorate, or whether it was the result of bad appointments, I cannot say whether it was the result of the latter factor.  It may have been, and, if men have proved unsuitable, I dare say it must have been.  It has been observed for some time, and has been allowed to go on, and I dare say that if we had not an emergency here, it might have been tolerated longer. Although the Commissioner is as good as it is possible to get, he is a human being, too, and when one man has the task of carrying out a dirty job of this kind, he naturally dislikes to throw on the street a man who has given good service when he finds he has become inefficient, if he can avoid it; but things came to such a pass with some officers &mdash;senior officers, men in charge of divisions, some of them being chief superintendents&mdash;that the position would have become so intolerable that he would have put them out.  It might be, and possibly would be, difficult, however, to get a disciplinary court to <Col N="2464" /> recommend dismissals to the Commissioner. It might have been impossible, if a court were set up under the regulations, to get them to agree.  In addition, he did not want to throw them out.  I might as well say that.  It is all very well to say that he should have done it, but we must put ourselves in the position of the Commissioner who has to face the job.  What he has to do is very big, and I could not expect him to be 100 per cent. efficient in the matter, to have no consideration for anything but efficiency, regardless of the results to the individual.  This is a way out, and the greatest pension the man with the longest service will get is one-third.  That is a very serious matter indeed for the man concerned.</P>
    <P>Even if the situation has been allowed to develop to its present state, it was only natural that it should be, in view of the fact that there was a disinclination to dismiss a man, unless he had become really unfit for duty and would be found guilty by a disciplinary court, and there was no alternative to this pension scheme.  I should like to draw the attention of Deputies to the existing regulation.  I am proposing to bring in the Minister, but reluctantly.  I agree with Deputy Costello that the order is better as it stands.  I think it would be much better to leave it all to the Commissioner, and I am reluctant to bring the Minister into it at all, but I have agreed to do so as I saw that there was a demand for it from all sides of the House.  I know that my own Party, at its meeting to-day, wanted it, and something like it is wanted by the Labour Party and, I think, by the majority who spoke on the Opposition side, but, personally, I agree with Deputy Costello that it would be much better, in respect of a disciplined force, to leave the matter entirely in the hands of the Commissioner, so far as the men are concerned.</P>
    <P>I should like to remind Deputies that, with the Minister in, as he will be when the order is amended, it will simply make it a little bit easier on the Guards than is their position under a regulation already existing.  I refer to the Gárda Síochána (Discipline) <Col N="2465" /> Regulations, 1926, paragraph 24 of which says:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Commissioner shall have power, without recourse to the procedure described in paragraphs 7 or 8 of these regulations&rdquo;&mdash;</P>
    <P>that is, the disciplinary court&mdash;</P>
    <P>&mdash;&ldquo;to dismiss from the force any member (not being an officer) whom he considers unfit for retention in the force: provided, however, that he shall not, without the prior consent of the Minister, exercise this power in the case of any member who has completed his period of probation.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In other words, the Commissioner can dismiss a man who is on probation without going near the Minister. Under the present regulations he can dismiss a man, with the consent of the Minister, without any court, and all we are asking is power to grant the man a pension.  So that this is actually a concession.  At any rate, it has come to this: I am quite satisfied that, in this emergency, I was right in saying that the security of the State was likely to be affected if we were going to allow men in such an important position as that of a chief superintendent of the Guards to be lax in their duty.  As one Deputy suggested, there are some things that might be overlooked, either in the Army or in the police force, in ordinary times of peace, which could not possibly be overlooked in times of emergency.</P>
    <P>At the present time, when we have all sections of the people rallying to the defence of the State and rallying, in most parts of the country, around the chief superintendent of the Guards, because in most places down the country it is on the chief superintendent that the activities of the Local Security Force&mdash;and even the Local Defence Force, although they are now under the control of the Army&mdash;the Air-Raid Precautions and other similar organisations, centre.  The administration of these bodies hinges on the chief superintendent of the district concerned, and if he is not satisfactory, then the whole thing is in danger, and to that extent, the State is in danger. I do not think I exaggerate the position when I say so.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2466" /> I say again, however, that the vast majority of the Guards, both officers and men, have been magnificent.  I said that when I was speaking on the Estimate, and I said it again to-day. What I am afraid of is that, as a result of the general discussion on this matter, that statement may be snowed under and not given due prominence, and the impression may get around that there is a suggestion of disloyalty to the State on the part of the Guards. It would be most unfortunate if such an impression should be created.  I never had any such suggestion in mind. I did agree that, from what I had heard from the Commissioner, Deputy Mulcahy's statement of the position was absolutely correct, but there was no suggestion of disloyalty on the part of the Guards.  Deputy Cosgrave wanted to know the number involved. I understand that there are less than a dozen concerned in this, and when it is remembered that there are 27 chief superintendents and 132 superintendents, it will be realised that that is a small number&mdash;less than a dozen of the total.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Oh, now, I shall not say that, because that would be coming too near, but out of 27 chief superintendents and 132 superintendents there are less than one dozen involved, and none of them will be dismissed without the certificate of the Commissioner that, in his opinion, it is in the interests of the efficiency of the force that the man concerned should be removed from office.  As to what Deputy Byrne suggested, that cannot be dealt with. These things are gone, and if I attempted to do what he suggests, the door would be opened to all sorts of claims and there would be applications, on behalf of every man who has been dismissed in the past for reinstatement. I could not consider that at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was a suggestion of adopting a similar procedure to that adopted in the Army.  I do not know whether that can be done or not.  I think that the <Col N="2467" /> present method is really the best one that can be got.  In the case of officers the Government will have to be satisfied that the recommendation made by the Commissioner is justified, and I am quite sure they will satisfy themselves of that before they will go so far as to remove an officer.  So far as the Minister is concerned, that will certainly be the case.  Surely, the Commissioner is not going to tell the Minister that a certain man must go, without giving a reason for it?  I cannot say what the procedure is going to be exactly, but I am quite satisfied that it will be satisfactory as far as the presentation of the case is concerned, and that a man will be told by the Commissioner that he proposes to apply the terms of this order to him, and the man will get an opportunity of making his case, and the Government will reconsider it&mdash;that is, in the case of an officer&mdash;and where it is the case of a man, the Minister will be consulted also.  I do not think I have anything more to say now considering the time, and in view of the fact that Deputy Norton wishes to reply.</P>

      <P>That the Dáil hereby approve of the Gárda Síochána Pensions Order, 1941, made on the 13th day of June, 1941, by the Minister for Justice, with the sanction of the Minister for Finance, under Section 13 of the Police Forces Amalgamation Act, 1925, and laid before the Dáil on the 17th day of June, 1941.</P>

      <P>Now, on item No. 5, a motion by Deputy Norton&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That the Gárda Síochána (Retirement) Regulations, 1941, made by the Minister for Justice on June 13th, 1941, be and are hereby annulled,&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I move No. 5.  In the few minutes at my disposal I want to dissipate the impression sought to be created from the Fine Gael Benches that we were somewhat in favour of a relaxation of the discipline of the Guards.  As far as we are concerned we want to see the discipline of the Guards maintained at the highest possible standard. We do not think that that is a matter for any Party but that it is a matter for the whole nation that that standard should be maintained.</P>
      <P>We want to see the Guards made into the most efficient police force that we can make them.  We do not stand for any weakening in the discipline of the Guards or for any soft treatment in the case of obvious indiscipline, but the Minister confessed this evening that this breakdown in the morale or discipline of the Guards&mdash;for a breakdown it apparently is&mdash;has not been of recent growth, but that there has been a steady deterioration going on for some time.  What can we think of a Gárda administration which permitted such a state of affairs to arise to such an extent that the Minister can now suggest, as he has, that the matter is constituting a menace to the safety and security of the State?  What can one think of a person who allows such a condition to arise and who has not the courage to deal with it?</P>
      <P>Deputy Cosgrave said that he would rather not have to come in and vote on this order, but he forgot the day on which he came in here to cry and howl about the injustice of the Government in removing a Commissioner of the Guards.  We are told now that the Commissioner and the ordinary Guard must trust the Government, but the Deputy forgets the time when the trust in a Government of a Commissioner was utilised in one case for the removal of the Commissioner without any explanation, and in another case for the removal of a Gárda officer, also without any explanation.  Yet, in face of that experience&mdash;a painful one for Deputy Cosgrave both then and subsequently&mdash;we are told to trust the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no reason to give these autocratic powers to the Commissioner, <Col N="2469" /> whoever he may be.  There is nothing to justify us in giving these powers to a Commissioner or to the Minister, and it is because the greatest criminal in the land can get a fair trial and is entitled to know the charges against him, that a Gárda should also know in black and white on what grounds he is being put out of the force with an attenuated pension, and should have a chance of having his case tried on its merits by some impartial body, and get a verdict accordingly.  He is not getting that under this order.  The Minister will not indicate his procedure or give an assurance that the man will get a fair trial.  All that the Minister stands over is the certificate of the Commissioner that a man should be cashiered from the force on a small pension, and the only thing that man has is a small <Col N="2470" /> pension on the one hand and a dishonoured name on the other hand&mdash;a dishonoured name not proved to be dishonoured&mdash;all, perhaps, on the hasty action of a Commissioner&mdash;and we are supposed to accept that in some sort of passionate belief that the Government will not do wrong.  I do not believe it. We are opposed to this order because it is tyrannical, and because it gives power to a Commissioner, which should not be given, to dismiss an unfortunate individual, and because we believe that this House should stand for the rights of a single individual against the powers of the Commissioner or of the Minister.</P>
