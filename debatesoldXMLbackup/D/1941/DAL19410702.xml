      <P>asked the Minister for Supplies if, in view of the fact that he has now made provision to meet some of our shipping requirements, he will immediately examine the possibility of getting cargoes of superphosphate and potassic manures either in America or elsewhere for next season's requirements.</P>

      <P>The matter to which the Deputy refers was examined a considerable time ago, but, in view of the pressing demand on the limited tonnage available for grain imports and of the extent of our requirement for superphosphate and potassic manures, I see no immediate prospect of being able to arrange that shipping space will be allocated for the import of these commodities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will state (a) the output of raw phosphate rock mined in County Clare and used for this season's requirements; (b) its solubility for manufacture into superphosphate as compared with North African rock; (c) the present weekly output of raw phosphate rock in County Clare; (d) the total estimated output to meet our agricultural requirements for next season.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>The greater part of the known reserves of phosphate rock <Col N="714" /> in Co. Clare is in the possession of private interests.  The deposits at present worked are mainly held under a State lease, and the last statutory return shows that from the deposits covered by the State lease the lessee extracted 3,218 tons in the six months' period ended 31st March, 1941.  It is understood that the fertiliser manufacturers had made a contract for the supply of about 300 tons per week.  I am not in a position to state the precise quantities from the Clare deposits used for this season's requirements, or the production from that part of the deposits not held under a State lease.</P>
      <P>The importation of phosphate rock in pre-war years was about 80,000-90,000 tons per annum.  On this basis, a greater quantity would be needed now in view of increased tillage.  The Clare rock is lower in phosphatic content, and is less suitable for conversion into superphosphate than the rock usually imported.  For these reasons, if no material comes from abroad, it has been estimated that as much as 150,000 to 200,000 tons of rock from County Clare may be needed to meet our agricultural requirements fully for next season.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether the Minister realises the importance of this matter and I should like to know what is being done at present.  Is there a progressive increase in the output here?  The summer is rapidly passing and, if something is not done, we shall be without artificial manures next year.  Does the Minister realise the importance of artificial manure to agricultural production?  Does he realise that, if we have to increase our tillage operations next year and if we are short of artificial manures, the results will be very bad?  Does he not realise the necessity of having this matter pushed ahead and of getting the maximum output before it is too late?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGovern</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture if he can give an estimate of the total loss to date sustained by stock owners in this country due to the ban on the export of stock as a result of the foot-and-mouth disease outbreak; if, further, he will say what factors have contributed to prevent his Department to date from stamping out the disease.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not possible to give a reliable estimate of the losses sustained by stockowners owing to the cessation of exports on account of the existence of foot-and mouth disease.  The disease is under control in all areas except Counties Kilkenny, Carlow and Tipperary (South Riding), but the efforts of the Department's veterinary inspectors to prevent the spread of infection have been hampered in a number of instances by the failure of farmers (in spite of repeated warnings in the Press and elsewhere) to give immediate notice of outbreaks amongst their stock, and also to avoid contacts with neighbouring herds.  In many cases persons who failed to report outbreaks promptly have been prosecuted and heavily fined.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMoylan" hpid="Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Defence (Mr. Moylan) Seán Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Defence (Mr. Moylan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take questions Nos. 7 and 8 together.</P>
      <P>I am not aware of any instances in which persons voluntarily organising fire-watching and fire-fighting schemes have not met with the co-operation necessary to the success of those schemes.  I have, in fact, been lately considering the question of making fire-watching and fire-fighting compulsory in business and industrial premises in certain areas.  My Department has had various discussions with the representatives of numerous business interests in Dublin and as a result a scheme of organisation has been devised which will provide for the needful co-ordination of individual effort and the necessary control of the fire-watching and fire-fighting services. It is proposed that these services shall be organised within Air Raid Precaution areas, under the immediate control of the area officers and under the ultimate control of the chief officer of the fire brigade.  Quite a good deal of progress has been made by many individual firms in Dublin City and the warden service have been very active in their efforts to develop this service. They, too, have made much progress in the matter but unfortunately their efforts have been met with a good deal of apathy on the part of the public and with a certain amount of antagonism. This apathy and antagonism have been factors that have led me to the consideration of resorting to compulsory measures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="718" /> I have under consideration the question of the issue of some form of identification to members of organisations of fire-watchers and fire-fighters so as to facilitate the holders in passing through cordons en route to or from the premises or area in which they are engaged in fire-watching.  For this purpose I propose to issue an identification card to each member of any such organisation and to issue badges and armlets to individual firms for the use of their employees actually on duty as fire-watchers and fire-fighters.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to issue protective helmets or other equipment to such persons.  It is the duty of every member of the State to take all such steps and to obtain all such equipment as he possibly can for the protection of his home and business premises.  It is hoped that firms who are suppliers of fire-fighting equipment will, in the very near future, be able to put on sale all the protective helmets needed.  The State has already supplied extensive fire-fighting equipment to the Dublin Corporation and other local authorities to enable them to cope with major fires. In addition, the State has provided in Dublin at each Warden's Post small but effective fire-fighting appliances with which incendiary bombs and minor local fires can be dealt with.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Lands, if he will state (a) the total amount of land on the hands of the Land Commission acquired for the purposes of division; (b) the total amount of this land at present under cultivation; (c) the average amount realised per acre for such land let for tillage by conacre this year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Minister for Lands (Mr. Derrig) Thomas Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Lands (Mr. Derrig)</NameTxt>
      <P>The amount of land on the hands of the Land Commission varies from day to day, according as acquired lands are divided and new lands acquired, and it is not practicable to give precise figures.  Round about 90,000 acres probably represents the area acquired under the Land Acts, 1923-39 at present in hands for division, of which about two-thirds would consist of mountain, moor and turbary, difficult to dispose of and most of it carried over from year to year.  The balance would be arable and pasture land, and of this less than half would be classed as arable.</P>
      <P>The latest available figures of tillage lettings (made up a few months ago) show that out of an arable area of about 14,000 acres some 5,200 acres had been let for tillage, or about 37 per cent.</P>
      <P>The average amount realised per acre for conacre lettings is not readily available and the rents vary so widely according to the quality and situation of the land that such an average would have no real significance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the Minister's reply, can he give us any idea at all of the amount realised?  Can he give an approximate figure?</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid not.  If the Deputy has any particular case in mind in which he is interested, I should be glad if he would communicate with me, but owing to shortage of staff in the Land Commission I am afraid I cannot detail staff to make up those figures generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>What I want to find out is the amount generally realised from land set for conacre by the Land Commission.  I do not want an accurate figure; I want an approximate figure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid it would take too much official time to compile the <Col N="720" /> figure, and I do not see what value it would be.  The Deputy must realise that the figure for land of poor quality in certain areas would be very low, and for land of excellent quality in the midland counties would be fairly high.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">

      <P>asked the Minister for Defence if he is aware that floating mines in Tramore Bay have been a source of great danger to visitors during the holiday season, and that their destruction has been delayed for a considerable period thus causing great inconvenience to the residents and visitors in not being allowed to use the promenade and strand, and if steps will be taken by his Department, without delay, to have these mines destroyed.</P>

      <P>Owing to the growth in intensity of the present naval warfare, the number of mines floating inside our territorial waters and driven on our coast has increased considerably.  No doubt inconvenience is caused by reason of the fact that people are prohibited from access to areas in which mines are located.  I can assure the Deputy that the special staff engaged in disposing of mines has worked day and night and spared no effort in dealing with them as quickly as possible.  It must be borne in mind that the dismantling or destruction of mines is a highly technical and dangerous operation and can be carried out only by specialist personnel.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Defence if he is aware that Private James Twomey, E 410422, of Grenagh, Blarney, County Cork, received on March 15th, 1941, a certificate of discharge which purports to show that his discharge from the Defence Forces was effected at Tralee on June 12th, 1940; whether he is aware that Mr. Twomey offered his services as a Volunteer and was attested in Collins Barracks, Cork, on June 12th, 1940, and that subsequent to that date he was never called up for service, that he was not put into uniform and was not at any time in Tralee where his discharge is alleged to have been effected on the day on which he attested in Cork; whether he will now state the reasons for this man's discharge, the reason why he was not called up after attestation and the cause of the delay in issuing to him the certificate of discharge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed that Mr. James Twomey of Grenagh, Blarney, County Cork, completed a National <Col N="722" /> Service Enrolment Form on the 8th June, 1940, and was called to Cork and attested there on the 12th idem.  The question of calling him up for service did not arise in view of the fact that, on being attested, Mr. Twomey there and then became a member of the Forces under contract to serve for the duration of the present emergency. For training purposes he was posted to the 15th Infantry Battalion then stationed at Tralee, but owing to the considerable influx of recruits at that period it was not observed until some time afterwards that Mr. Twomey, instead of serving with his battalion, had in fact returned home after attestation, thereby rendering himself an absentee.</P>
      <P>In these circumstances it was decided to discharge him with effect as from the date of enlistment, viz., the 12th June, 1940.</P>
      <P>The discharge certificate was forwarded to the commanding officer of his battalion for subsequent transmission to him, and I understand that the delay in issuing the certificate was due to the number of recruits being dealt with during the period in question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JeremiahHurley" hpid="Mr. Hurley Mr. Hurley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hurley</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that Mr. Twomey attended on l2th June, 1940, at Collins Barracks, Cork, that he was interviewed by the commanding officer, and was told that there was a question of a commission for him owing to his services in the I.R.A. and also to the fact that he was a mechanic by trade?  It was suggested by the commanding officer that he would not hear the result of this matter about the commission for ten days, and that he could go home in the meantime.  The next thing he heard was on 15th March, when he received a letter dated l4th March discharging him from the Army.  Does not the Minister think that there is something very peculiar about the attestation of Mr. Twomey?  As a matter of fact he was not a day in the Army, and a certificate of his discharge was given from Tralee where he was never in residence, and it was certified that he was improperly enlisted.  I think the Minister should look into the <Col N="723" /> question again, because there seems to be something peculiarly wrong with the way in which Mr. Twomey has been treated in this matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make it quite clear that there could be no question of Mr. Twomey or anybody else coming to a recruiting post and expecting to be regarded as a commissioned officer.  That is not possible, and I think that the fact that he went there and attested implies that he was quite prepared to serve as a private soldier and take whatever chance there might be of getting promotion to officer's rank.  As to the other matter about which the Deputy has inquired, I cannot say at the moment.</P>

      <P>I do not think there is any necessity for inquiry into the manner of Mr. Twomey's enlistment, but I shall inquire into the question of how it came about that he was sent out as being improperly enlisted.  As a matter of fact, he was an absentee, and he could have been, and, in my opinion, should have been, dealt with under that category.</P>

The same suggestions are embodied really in amendments Nos. 31, 42 and 43, and I do not think anybody is bothering very much about which one of these suggestions is adopted.  I expect that the Minister will not adopt any of them, but will bring in an amendment of his own embodying the principle.  I think that amendments Nos. 41 and 42 ought to have been moved together, and if the Minister is prepared to accept amendment No. 43, I am prepared to withdraw amendment 42.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to have a little further discussion on this matter.  There are rather different principles embodied in each of these amendments.  In the Bill, as it stands, there is a proposal which would fix the personnel of the tribunal, once it has been appointed.  In so far as the ordinary members of the tribunal are concerned, they would hold their appointments and continue to <Col N="727" /> hold them under sub-section (3) of the section.  Of the amendments which have been put down on the Order Paper, amendment No. 42 would seem, if I interpret it correctly, to accept that principle of a fixed personnel for the tribunal, preserving, however, to the masters' trade unions on the one part, and to the workers' trade unions on the other part, the right to nominate, each on its own behalf, one ordinary member to the tribunal. Amendments Nos. 41 and 43, on the other hand, proceed upon a different principle.  They would propose that the ordinary members of the tribunal should be selected from two panels: one to be submitted by the authorised trade unions of masters, on the one part, and the other to be submitted by the authorised trade unions of workers, on the other part, leaving to the Minister the right to select from these panels one ordinary member to represent the masters' trade unions, and one ordinary member to represent the workers' trade unions, and to select ordinary members <i>ad hoc</i> in relation to each particular application which would come before the tribunal.</P>
      <P>There is still a third way in which this tribunal could be constituted.  You could, first of all, accept the principle that, in the case of an application coming before the tribunal on behalf, say, of a trade union of masters, the ordinary members of the trade union would be representative of the masters' trade union only and would be selected from a panel of persons nominated by such trade unions; and that, in the case of an application coming before the tribunal from a trade union of workers, the ordinary members would be selected from a panel of persons nominated or suggested by the workers' trade unions to sit as ordinary members in that case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart altogether from the way which has been proposed in the section of the Bill as it stands, it will be seen that there are at least three ways in which this tribunal could be constituted. Unfortunately, I suppose we are debarred from discussing the way which was proposed in amendment No. <Col N="728" /> 40 because, for some reason or other, that amendment and amendments Nos. 45 and 46, which would be consequential upon it, have not been moved, and I presume that discussion could not take place on the merits of that particular suggestion or way of constituting the tribunal, and that, accordingly, we would be confined in the discussion to considering the method proposed in the Bill or the method proposed in amendments Nos. 41 and 42.</P>
    <P>I think there is something to be said, on the whole, for having a fixed personnel on the tribunal because, as I have said, it seems to me that, provided we can get the right persons, the tribunal, when constituted in that way, would be more remote and aloof from the ordinary internal politics which naturally exist within federated organisations or within a movement like the trade union movement, and that if we had a fixed personnel on the tribunal it would then become more and more a judicial body.  At the same time, there is a great deal to be said for keeping close contact between the ordinary members of the tribunal and the respective interests which they represent. I should like to say in that connection that employers have an interest in this question just the same as workers have; that industry and employment have often been dislocated because of differences of opinion between two unions as to who should have the right to organise the employees in one particular industry, or even in one particular concern, and that if a matter were to be determined by the sort of arbitration that is here suggested there is a great deal to be said for having the opposite sides represented on the tribunal.</P>
    <P>These are matters which I had hoped would be discussed on this section.  As I have said, I am not wedded to the particular proposals contained in the Bill, and I would have liked to have heard the merits of the other amendments discussed and would have been prepared to consider them with an open mind.  It has now been suggested, however, by Deputy Cosgrave that an amendment on the lines of amendment No. 43 would meet the <Col N="729" /> point of view of those who have put down amendments to the Bill and are prepared to discuss them.  In the light of that fact, I am prepared to accept one or other of these amendments in principle and, if the House agrees, to put down an amendment which may be on the lines of amendment No. 43, and to give the House an opportunity of discussing this matter further on the Report Stage of the Bill.</P>

      <P>The Minister's proposal that he should bring in an amendment of his own on the Report Stage would be perfectly satisfactory to me so far as amendments Nos. 43 and 44 are concerned.  At the same time, I think the Minister seems to see something in amendment No. 43 that I am not so sure is there.  He seems to think that for every separate case the panel of employers or workers, whichever it happened to be, would want to make a fresh nomination and that the Minister would have to change the personnel, so that it would be continually changing.  In framing amendment No. 43, the idea was that the employer's representative, and I presume the worker's representative, should at any rate have this qualification, that he should be intimately acquainted with all the intricacies of the matters likely to come before the tribunal.  I do not see why that member or those members should not remain on the tribunal for a long time.  That is why I am suggesting that the Minister seems to see something in amendment No. 43 that I am not sure was intended.  In any case, as between amendments Nos. 41, 42, 43 and 44, the whole matter really depends on the details as to how it is worked out.  If suitable nominations are made, the whole thing is easy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Any objection I might have had in constituting the tribunal in the way suggested in amendment No. 43 has been removed by what Deputy Dockrell has said, and I will bring in an amendment which will make it clear that the Minister is to appoint members of the tribunal from the panels of persons submitted to him by the masters' trade union, on the one hand, and by the workers' trade unions, on the other, and that, once the Minister has made the appointments, those persons will continue to function as members of that tribunal until such time as, either by lapse of time or for some other reason, it is clear that a change should be made.</P>
      <P>There is another aspect of this matter which those who wish to have an amendment along the lines set out in amendments Nos. 41 and 43 should consider.  I think both these amendments adumbrate a federation of masters' trade unions on the one hand and a federation of the workers' trade unions on the other.  We know such federations exist.  There is the Irish Trade Union Congress, representing the general body of the workers' trade union movement, and there is the Federated Employers and the Federation of Irish Manufacturers, representing what might be described as the masters.  But not all trade unions are affiliated to the Irish Trade Union Congress, and I do not think all the masters' organisations are affiliated to the Federated Employers or the Federation of Irish Manufacturers.  A question might arise in these circumstances whether we should not have to give some consideration to the possibility that an application might come before the tribunal which would affect the interests of a workers' trade union which is not affiliated to the Irish Trade Union Congress or the interests of a masters' trade union which is not affiliated to the Federated Employers or the Federation of Irish Manufacturers. That is an aspect of the problem which can be discussed, perhaps when my amendment is submitted on Report Stage.</P>

      <P>The amendment moved by Deputy Dockrell seems to indicate <Col N="731" /> nominations for this panel by individual organisations.  You may, of course, have a situation in which a large number of organisations will be affiliated to one central body.  These organisations may well prefer the central body to speak for them on certain matters. Does the Minister contemplate, in his advertence to Deputy Dockrell's amendment, that a body such as that would be entitled to make nominations on its own behalf, or on behalf of those organisations which are affiliated to it? The Trade Union Congress is a case in point.  It speaks for a quarter of a million trade unionists.  The employers' organisation is in a position to speak for a large number of employers.  Does the Minister contemplate that an organisation of that kind will be permitted to make nominations under the amendment, if he is considering the one proposed by Deputy Dockrell?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>

I do not think I would be entitled to exclude the right of authorised trade unions which might not be affiliated with these federations, to make suggestions for the panel. That is apparently a matter which we can consider more fully when we come to debate the amendment.  My present intention is to put down an amendment which will permit bodies like the Trade Union Congress to nominate persons for the panel, and bodies like the Federated Employers and the Federation of Irish Manufacturers to do likewise.</P>

      <P>It may happen that the Minister's amendment will meet the wishes of the House.  On the other hand, the Report Stage is the last stage on which alterations may be made and the House may desire to make alterations and may find it difficult to do so on that stage.  In the circumstances, it might be as well to have this matter dealt with now.  I agree it is desirable if you can deal with a representative body, but I should like to take the Trade Union Congress as an example.  It is conceivable that an important trade union, even a very big one representing a large number of workmen, might cease to be affiliated to the Trade Union Congress for any reason you like. Some matter affecting that trade union particularly might come up and it is desirable that a man thoroughly conversant with their particular point of view should be on the panel.  While I am anxious to see that the Trade Union Congress as far as possible would have the nomination, on the other hand we should be sure that we have necessary safeguards in respect to other organisations that might not be affiliated with the Trade Union Congress.  I can conceive many reasons why a trade union would cease to be affiliated with the Trade Union Congress.  It has happened before.</P>

      <P>I am very glad that the Minister is listening sympathetically to another point of view.  If the Minister had any knowledge of the working of the Agricultural Wages Board he would realise that certain bodies were packed by political nominees of the Government Party and he would see then, as a man who wants to act&mdash;and I believe him when he says he wants to act&mdash;impartially, the necessity for <Col N="733" /> altering his point of view from what he originally intended by the section. I know of cases where nominations were invited from organised bodies for seats on the area wages board.  I am not sure that I could say it applies to the national body, but I know that nominations submitted by the properly organised bodies were ignored and persons with a definite political view favourable to the Government were put there as against the nominations submitted by the representatives of the organised workers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Frankly, I could not give a precise figure.  A good deal will depend on the amount of work the tribunal will have to do.  I expect that in the earlier stages, until the procedure has been shaped, and until its value has been recognised by the trade unions generally, the honorarium or the fee to be paid to each member of the tribunal will be very moderate.  I would say, speaking offhand, that the tribunal ought not to cost more than £500 to £700 a year if it is necessary even to pay so much.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not able to answer that question authoritatively. As the Deputy will see, sub-section (4) provides that: &ldquo;Every member of the Tribunal shall be paid such fees or other remuneration as the Minister for Finance determines.&rdquo;  If the Deputy wants to know the view that I would put, it would be this: that it would be better to pay each member a fixed sum, a retainer, rather than proceed to pay him <i>per diem</i> for the days on which the Tribunal sat.  I know it might be said, if there was a prolonged hearing, that the proceedings were being stretched out in order that fees might be earned. I am not suggesting that there would be anything in that, but it is a suggestion which is sometimes made, and I think, in matters of this sort, it is desirable to take precautions to ensure that such suggestions will not be made. Therefore, my view would be that it would be better to pay each of these members a lump sum as a retainer so that they might do the work of the Tribunal as and when called upon to do it.</P>

      <P>The section, as I have said, is a very important one, and I suggest to the Minister that the position should be cleared up.  First of all, the chairman is to be a practising barrister.  I take it that he will deal <Col N="736" /> with the work of the Tribunal in his spare time, and will be free to take up other work when it is not sitting. With regard to the other two members, I gathered from what the Minister said on the last amendment, that he has in mind selecting one from the employers' side and one from the workers' side, and that they are to be&mdash;I want to say this without meaning any disrespect to either of them&mdash;elderly members of those different bodies, people who are aloof from the actual work of the bodies they are drawn from.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hurley</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know.  The Minister stated that.  The Minister is not able to give the House any definite information with regard to the remuneration those people are to receive for their work.  Will the two ordinary members be paid for each sitting of the Tribunal they attend?  The chairman, I take it, is in a different category. The ordinary members of the Tribunal are to be, I suppose, a kind of retired members of their different bodies.  They will, probably, have made some provision for their old age, and are now going to be called upon in their old age to act on this Tribunal.  That is my interpretation of the Minister's statement.  Are those two members to be paid for each sitting they attend, or are they, as the Minister said, to have a fixed salary, no matter what work they have to do?  I can imagine that they may have very little work to do. Would the Minister say what he has in mind with regard to their remuneration? Sub-section (4) provides that they shall be paid such remuneration as the Minister for Finance determines.  Will that determination take place on the advice of the Minister for Industry and Commerce or will the Minister for Finance determine their remuneration, salary or fees, or whatever payment they are to get on his own initiative?</P>

The type of man that he would probably require might be engaged as an employee on some particular job, and it might not be possible for him to get away for a prolonged period.  The Minister should bear that in mind when considering the basis on which payment will be made to the two ordinary members of the tribunal.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree.  If all the people concerned with the working of this <Col N="738" /> measure recognise it and bow to the Minister's wishes in the matter, the chairman would be a very busy man, and a man who could make plenty of trouble in respect of the decisions of the body of which he was chairman. Somebody asked the Minister whether a practising barrister would be a person with a good practice at the Bar.  It has been suggested&mdash;I could not swear that it is correct&mdash;that the chairman of one of the commissions appointed by the Government never went any further than the library in the Four Courts, and that he never actually practised at the Bar.  I hope that will not be so in the case of the man whom the Minister has in mind for this position. If the Minister wants a man who will obviate a good deal of trouble, he should be a man of considerable experience of work in the trade nnion movement, and should have some inside knowledge of and sympathy with its objects.  If he is a person with a history of hostility to the trade onion movement, the Minister may be certain that he will create plenty of trouble from the very beginning.  From that point of view, as well as the point of view mentioned by Deputy Cosgrave. he would become a full-time man, and be entitled to whatever would be the appropriate yearly salary for the work.</P>
      <P>I am not the only member of the House who has heard the names of people mentioned for this position.  I have heard the name of one man who does not practise at the Bar, but who gets a good deal of work from the Government in other branches of Governmental administration.  I hope the Minister has in mind for the position a man who is, in reality, a practising barrister who has had some association with the trade union movement and the work carried on by it over a long period.  Under present circumstances, I foresee a time when most of those concerned with the coming into operation of the measure would not bother their heads about it, and I want to see the taxpayers safeguarded against the payment in such a case of a high yearly salary to a man who might have a very easy time, and might not have an opportunity of earning it.</P>

      <P>I do not quite agree with Deputy Davin on that.  My information may be completely wrong, but I think there are certain unions which are going to take advantage of the Bill when it becomes law.  That is one of the fears I have in relation to the passing of the Bill.  I do not know whether I should use the plural form and say &ldquo;certain unions,&rdquo; but certainly Sections 21, 22 and 23 will, very probably, unless I am very wrongly informed, be used, and if they are used to the full, not only will they provide full-time work, but overtime, for any tribunal set up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyJMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I oppose the section, and, while I have always heard Deputy Davin described as a very honest man, he is a much more innocent man than I take him to be if he believes the chairman of this tribunal will have either sympathy with or understanding of the trade union movement.  I consider that there is no necessity for the section, and, even if the Bill is to become an Act, I do not see any more necessity for the appointment of a chairman on a full-time basis than I do for the position of chairman of a court of referees in relation to unemployment assistance and unemployment insurance being made whole-time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is, of course, a skilful method of providing jobs which has always been lurking behind legislation passed for the last seven or eight years. Every bit of amalgamation and centralisation carried through the House for the past five, six or eight years has had this bait skilfully concealed under innocent phrases and legal jargon for the purpose of providing jobs, and the hungry army of jobless people who have been hanging on to this Government for the purpose of getting jobs of this kind are looking forward to seeing whose turn it is to be this time.  This Bill proposes to interfere with the trade union movement, to restrict its freedom and to deny its rights, and if Deputy Davin believes that there is going to be any system of impartiality, fair play or reason, in the constitution of the tribunal&mdash;and more especially in view of the possibility of the appointment <Col N="740" /> of the type of briefless barrister who has always been found accommodating to whatever Government is in power, with a lively expectation of favours to come, which can happen in this case&mdash;it seems to me to make Deputy Davin an extremely innocent man indeed.</P>
    <P>He cited the example of the Agricultural Wages Board, where the area committees were constituted after a number of formal inquiries had been made, but were constituted in a certain very definite and positive way.  Men with no connection with either agricultural labour or any labour organisation sit on the area committees for the purpose of covering up certain things in connection with the operations of the board and for the purpose of giving a pretence of representation to working-class people.  I see no reason, and I anticipate no prolonged work, for this tribunal.  I see no reason why the Minister should, if the tribunal is ever set up, have any doubts that the authority to be consulted is the central trade union organisation.  The Minister's views on that point, of course, are indefinite yet, because it is quite possible that under this scheme there could be repeated the position we had in respect of one election to the eanad and of the Agricultural Wages Board, where a non-existent body called the Ballingarry Cottage Tenants' Association put forward their nominees and actually got them elected.  I heard many years ago of an organisation of three tailors in Tooley Street in London who described themselves as the people of England.  The claim of the so-called Ballingarry Cottage Tenants' Association to represent anything was as impudent as that claim.  I view this section with suspicion, and I want to register my protest against this method of filling positions and interfering with the trade union movement for the purpose of accommodating Party hangers-on and of providing jobs which are unnecessary.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>A good deal has been said as to the qualifications of the chairman of the tribunal.  Section 19 speaks of &ldquo;two ordinary members.&rdquo; Who are the two ordinary members to <Col N="741" /> be, or what qualifications will they need in order to be nominated?  From what class will they be drawn?  Will it be from the unskilled class, from the tradesmen class or from the professional classes?  Will unskilled men be put on the tribunal to deal with applications coming from skilled craftsmen in certain unions?  Those are points which will have to be considered, and I think ought to be spoken of in this House, so that when something comes before the tribunal the parties concerned will not say that the tribunal, the jury, knew nothing about their business and had no right to be there. I should like the Minister to give us some idea about the qualifications of the other two members of the tribunal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a couple of points with which I should like to deal.  I dealt fairly exhaustively, I think, with the points which have been made by Deputy Alfred Byrne, when we opened the debate on this section this evening, but I should like to state with particular reference to what was said by Deputy Davin that I certainly have no particular person in mind for chairmanship of this tribunal.  I agree with what he has said that the person to be appointed chairman should be one who could command general confidence, a person of experience and high standing, and that is the sort of person I am going to look for.  In that connection, naturally, I cannot bind myself.  A suggestion has been made here that I should give a firm figure of the cost of the tribunal.  We will have to pay that man whatever we think he is worth, and I cannot at this stage go further than to say this: that I anticipate, in view of things which have been said, that perhaps it may take some time for the value of this tribunal to be recognised in the trade union movement generally, so that the work of the tribunal in the early stages may be comparatively light, and naturally that fact would be taken into consideration in fixing the retainer which would have to be paid to the chairman in those circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The next thing I should like to say <Col N="742" /> is that, so far as the ordinary members of the tribunal are concerned, again I fully recognise the fact that they must be people who would command general confidence, and who would be acceptable to all classes of unions which might at one time or another make an application to this tribunal, or who might be affected by a determination of the tribunal.  These are considerations and factors which I will keep in mind.  As I have already said to the House, I do think it would be better if there were not people who were actively engaged in organisations of the type which they would represent on the tribunal.  I think there is a great deal to be said for having on the tribunal elderly men, men of ripe wisdom and great experience, who do know the difficulties with which this problem is bristling, and who have themselves had experience of the evils to which it has given rise.  I should also like to say, with reference to what was said by Deputy Morrissey, that I am not aware as to what line will be taken by any trade union in regard to this tribunal or in regard to this Bill, but I am hopeful that, when the Bill is enacted and when it is considered free from the heat and prejudice which has been created against it, its value will be recognised, and that it will be seen that the Bill represents an earnest attempt on the part of the Government to bring order out of chaos, and to rid the working class trade union movement in this country of the abuses which have been a source of weakness to it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>This section deals with the establishment of a trade union tribunal, and the Minister has told us that the chairman of it is to be a practising barrister of at least ten years' standing, or a practising solicitor of like standing.  I do not know why barristers and solicitors are being selected as the class from which the chairman of this tribunal must be drawn.  It does not seem to me that the functions of the chairman of such a tribunal are of a kind which necessitates <Col N="743" /> any legal qualifications at all. There is no question of law involved in any application which may be likely to come before the tribunal.  Anybody with ten years' common sense might properly serve as chairman of this tribunal as well as a practising barrister or a practising solicitor.  Unless I do not know the trade union movement&mdash;and I believe I do&mdash;I do not see any work at all for this tribunal.  The trade union movement itself does not know if it is going to avail of or implement Section 19 of this Bill.  It is suggested in this Bill that a trade union can go to the tribunal, and there endeavour, with the assistance of a practising barrister or a practising solicitor, and with the concurrence, probably, of an employers' representative, make an application to have transferred to it the right to organise workers in another industry.  That seems to me to be a contemptible thing for one trade union to do against another.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The tribunal has power, the barrister or the solicitor has power with the aid of the employers' representative, to say to the trade union: &ldquo;You cannot organise any future members of a particular class,&rdquo; whereupon the union against which a decision of that kind has been made does not go out of existence; it proceeds to carry on with its existing members, but it is made an offence for the union to organise any new workers in respect of that industry.  You will have a position, therefore, where a union may in fact have 2,000 members, let us say, organised in a particular organisation, but the right to continue organising such workers is to be transferred to another organisation.  If anybody imagines that the kind of craziness which is left after a decision of that kind has been given is going to make for greater amalgamation in the trade union movement, that person is suffering from illusions which will justify detention in a mental institute.  But I hope the trade unions will not take any notice of Section 19 just as I hope they will not take any notice of this Bill at all.  I hope at any rate that there will be sufficient comradeship left amongst <Col N="744" /> Irish trade unions to ensure that they will not go to this tribunal in a competition for members to be got in the kind of way envisaged in this particular section.  I am one of those people who have always deplored the poaching by one union of the members of another union.  I believe in the right of a worker to have free choice as to what organisation he will be a member of, but what we are doing in this section here is appealing to the lowest type of cupidity and avarice when we ask people to go to this tribunal and endeavour, through the medium of that tribunal, to get transferred to one organisation or to more than one organisation the right to organise particular workers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The point I am making is that the members of trade unions normally have to fight together for their common interests, and that has been the traditional outlook of trade unions, but now they are being encouraged to get at one another's throats and make an application to this tribunal, the chairman of which will be a practising solicitor or a practising barrister who, probably, was never a member of a trade union in his life. In addition, if the amendment that has been suggested by the Minister is adopted, then one other person on that tribunal may be a representative of the employers.  Does the Minister expect to get any class of workers or their representatives to act on a tribunal constituted in such a way as that?  If he does, I think he will be disappointed, and I hope that the trade unions and their representatives will have the decency and the manliness to stand up against an application of that kind, because it only means legalised poaching, which is a thing that trade unions have always been against.  I hope that a halfpenny will not be spent on Section 19, because I do not believe any union will go there and make an application under that section.</P>

      <P>It might save a lot of time and, perhaps, save the intervention of two Deputies in the debate where one would suffice, if I indicated the reasons why I am prepared to accept the amendment.  As Section 20 <Col N="748" /> is drafted, it might be held that it left it open to a trade union, other than an authorised trade union, to go before this tribunal.  As has been pointed out in the course of the debate, this Bill makes a distinction between trade unions which are registered for a number of purposes under the Trade Union Acts, 1871 to 1935, and bodies which combine for the purpose of fixing wages and conditions of employment.  Under this Bill henceforward those bodies will have to be authorised trade unions.  It has been suggested to me that Section 20, as worded, would allow a trade union other than an authorised trade union to make a claim to lodge an application with the tribunal.  I want to make it quite clear that only authorised trade unions will have the right to go to that tribunal and, accordingly, I am accepting Deputy Dockrell's amendment which makes that clear beyond yea or nay.</P>
      <P>Amendment put and agreed to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 48:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (1), page 9, to insert in line 18 before the words &ldquo;a majority&rdquo; the words &ldquo;for the purpose of the carrying on of negotiations for the fixing of wages and other conditions of employment&rdquo;, to insert in line 20 before the word &ldquo;organise&rdquo; the word &ldquo;so&rdquo;, and to insert in line 28 before the word &ldquo;organise&rdquo; the word &ldquo;so&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Similarly, as the section was originally drafted, it might be argued that, when a trade union obtains a determination to organise masters or workers of a particular class, trade unions which deal with matters other than wages and conditions of employment would, under the section as introduced, be estopped from organising that particular class of masters or workers.  This amendment protects the position of such trade unions and makes it quite clear that they may pursue their other activities as benevolent organisations or societies of that sort.  I should mention that the amendment should be read in conjunction with amendments Nos. 54 and 79 which are similar in principle.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 51:&mdash;To delete sub-section (3). This amendment should be read in conjunction with amendments Nos 67 and 68.  Perhaps I ought to refer to these amendments.  The new sections which it is proposed to insert by amendments Nos. 67 and 68 are designed to deal with a question which Deputy McGilligan raised in relation to Section 20, and which has been re-cast accordingly.  Amendment No. 68 provides that where a determination is granted and where a previous determination exists, the first-mentioned determination is automatically revoked. It also provides that, where one trade union alone has the right to organise workers or masters and its negotiation licence lapses, the lapsing of the licence automatically revokes the determination, so that we should not have a position in which, notwithstanding the fact that the union concerned could not, by reason of the fact that its negotiation licence had lapsed, negotiate for the fixing of wages, we had a determination saying that that union, in conjunction with, perhaps, some others, would alone be entitled to enter into such negotiations.  Similarly, where a determination is granted to <Col N="750" /> two or more trade unions, and subsequently both or all the negotiation licences become revoked, the determinations are revoked automatically by the collapse of each licence in turn.  That is the purpose of amendment No. 68.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 67 provides that, where two or more unions have been granted a determination, no application shall be considered from such unions until at least 12 months after the granting of the first determination.  The object of this amendment is to prevent undue haste on the part of one of the holding unions to press for a revision. Where a determination is granted to one trade union alone, or two or more trade unions to have the right to organise masters or workman, it is further provided that no application should be made to the tribunal by any trade union in relation to masters or workers of that class until five years after the granting of the first determination, or until the determination has become revoked.  These two amendments are really the amendments which have necessitated the introduction of amendment No. 51, which seeks to delete sub-section (3) as being no longer necessary, on the assumption that amendments Nos. 67 and 68 will be accepted by the House.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 51 agreed to.</P>
      <P>The following amendment was agreed to:&mdash;</P>
      <P>52.  To add at the end of the section a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(4) For the purposes of this section masters may be classified by reference to a class to which they belong, by reference to an area in which they carry on trade, or by reference to such a class and such an area, and the word &lsquo;class&rsquo; shall be construed in this section accordingly.&rdquo; (Aire Tionnscail agus Tráchtála.)</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>This is not a section that will commend itself to the sympathy of anybody who has due regard for the conditions under which we live.  It deals with the type of people who are called &ldquo;masters&rdquo; and it brings down to 1941 that objectionable feature of <Col N="751" /> ancient legislation while at the same time the good features which were secured through the old Acts of 1871 and 1906 are conveniently deleted in certain sections dealing with the workers.  We find carried on, without any attempt at alteration, the very objectionable feature of masters as against workmen.  For many years it has been the established practice to recognise the two sections as employers and employees.  The word &ldquo;master&rdquo; is held to be irreverent in certain senses by thinking people, but we find our Government preserving this old link with a very objectionable period.</P>
      <P>We have the master class perpetuated in this Bill.  That may truly reflect the mind of the Minister, but it does not reflect the minds of thinking people, of some of the people behind him.  I wonder if many Fianna Fáil Deputies desire to perpetuate that objectionable word.  I have a rooted objection to the continuance of it.  I do not think the employing classes of the present day would object to be designated as employers.  I certainly do not think there are many in the community who favour the perpetuation of the master class.  The phrasing of this section does not appeal to anybody on this side of the House as having much merit in it and it actually constitutes itself a blot sufficient to call for the deletion of the section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is nothing in the section to indicate that workers will not be called from the panel to deal with differences between these alleged masters or employers. I suggest that whether they are called masters and employers and any friction comes between them, they should be allowed to solve their own difficulties.  Whether they are to be called masters or employers it should be their job to settle their differences in their own way.  I object to this section, and I think it is regrettable that in legislation introduced in 1941 this objectionable feature should be brought down as the only relic from the past, the Minister taking care to delete the good points which were won in the workers' favour as a result of their struggle over the years.  We have the master class brought down, but <Col N="752" /> the benefits of previous legislation from the worker's point of view are taken from him.</P>

      <P>One of the objections I have to this Bill is that it is so evident that it is purely class legislation. I remember a discussion I had with an employer in regard to one of his employees, and I have treasured one of the expressions I got from him. He called his employee a &ldquo;hand.&rdquo;  He went on to explain to me what &ldquo;hands&rdquo; were in his concern, and he suggested that it would be well if I informed his &ldquo;hands&rdquo; what security they had in his employment.  We are asked to pass a section, here which deals with the masters as a class.  I think I can well claim that this legislation is purely of a class nature.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnLymbrickEsmonde" hpid="Mr. Esmonde Mr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I consider that the matters left for the consideration of the tribunal are too general.  In paragraph (c) of this section, which covers the functions of the tribunal in relation to trade unions of masters, the tribunal shall, if satisfied that there are reasonable grounds in the public interest for so doing, determine that two or more specified trade unions alone shall have the right to organise masters of that class.</P>
      <P>I have to refer, in passing, to the Constitution.  When we are passing legislation of this kind we find ourselves more or less in a strait-jacket, if I may use that expression, because we are continually coming up against the rigid terms of the Constitution.  I submit that if this particular part of the section does not offend the letter of the Constitution&mdash;that is a matter to be decided elsewhere&mdash;it does offend the spirit of the Constitution.  Under Article 40 the State guarantees liberty for the exercise of the following rights, subject to public order and morality:&mdash;</P>
      <P>iii.  The right of the citizens to form associations and unions.  Laws, however, may be enacted for the regulation and control in the public interest of the exercise of the foregoing right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not going to venture any view as to whether there is interference with the letter of the Constitution, but the spirit of the Constitution is interfered with in this way.  Laws are to be <Col N="753" /> enacted for the regulation and control in the public interest of the exercise of the right of the citizens to form associations and unions.  We are not doing that here.  We are passing that on to another body.  I think it is being deliberately passed on in this section; the actual words that appear in the Constitution are passed on as part of the functions of the tribunal.</P>
    <P>In passing legislation here we should satisfy ourselves that certain matters are in the public interest, but we have left that decision to this tribunal, and in that respect the tribunal will be making laws and usurping our functions. Whether the point has any validity in law.  I will venture no opinion, but I certainly think that this is definitely against the spirit of the Constitution.  It may be got over by elaborating the functions of the tribunal.  I anticipate that there will be a considerable number of queries arising, possibly in the form of litigation, and possibly the jurisdiction of the tribunal will be impugned at some future date.  If a guide is laid down by the legislative body for the tribunal as to the basis on which it is to proceed then possibly the gaps in the spirit of the Constitution can be filled in.  As far as we are concerned this seems to be a lazy way to do it: that we should pass on to the tribunal the right to determine whether or not, under certain circumstances, it is reasonable that citizens may form associations and unions.  The second point which I want to refer to is also connected with the generality of the phraseology of sub-section (2).  That sub-section reads:</P>
    <P>When considering an application under this section, the tribunal shall hear every person who wishes to be heard and appears to have an interest in such application and shall receive any evidence tendered by such person.</P>
    <P>I think it would be better if this section were more explicit and defined the classes of persons who should be heard and who have an interest, because it can very rightly be argued that, under the general clause as it stands, almost any person would be entitled to go there and say that he had an interest and the right to be heard.  I think if <Col N="754" /> some guide were laid down for the tribunal in a matter of this kind, as to what class or sort of persons should be heard, it would certainly be of great assistance to the tribunal, and would, I think, be of benefit generally.</P>
    <P>The remarks I have made in connection with Section 20 are also intended to apply, without distinction, to Section 21.  It seems to me that the proposal here is to give very extensive functions to the tribunal.  We are giving to it a very extended jurisdiction indeed.  One may almost say that the life and death of trade unions at the present time will depend on the decisions of this tribunal.  Even where courts of limited jurisdiction are set up under the laws of this land, their jurisdiction is very specifically defined in certain matters.  My whole criticism of the section, apart from the particular instances I have given, is that we are giving too much general authority to the tribunal to decide the various matters that come before it.  I think that the tribunal should be tied up in certain ways, and should receive a direction from the law-making body as to what exactly its functions are, and within what ambit it is to operate in making decisions.</P>

      <P>In connection with Section 20, would the Minister say whether he has in mind that the tribunal should be given any principles upon which to act?  As the section stands, it would appear as though the Minister should be empowered to give them some basis on which to act.  The tribunal has to decide whether a certain trade union should have the right to organise masters in a particular class.  On what basis is it to decide that?  Is it to decide it on its own information, or according to certain fixed rules that the Minister may make?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened to what Deputy Esmonde has said.  I think he himself would not be prepared to press the view that the section, as it <Col N="755" /> stands, is in any way in conflict with the Constitution as it is written.  The Deputy spoke of the spirit of the Constitution. I do not think this section is in conflict with the spirit of the Constitution at all.  I do not think there is any question of our right&mdash;in certain circumstances it would be our duty&mdash; of entrusting to a competent tribunal to determine what would be in the public interest.</P>
      <P>With regard to the other point which he has made, that the right of audience before this tribunal as set out in sub-section (2) is too comprehensive, there, again, I think we are up against a practical difficulty.  Supposing a person comes along and says: &ldquo;I know of matters which render it imperative that I should be heard before the tribunal should take this decision or that decision in regard to an application before it so that it may see what is in the public interest to do.&rdquo;  I do not see how we could limit the right of any person, who claimed that he had an interest in an application before the tribunal, to be heard before it.  I assume that the tribunal would not look with favour upon vexatious applications, and would probably find a way of dealing with such applications if they came before it.  It need not necessarily spend much time considering them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the question raised by Deputy Childers, I think we have put down there succinctly the guiding principle upon which the tribunal must act if it proposes to make a determination that two or more specified trade unions alone shall have the right to organise masters of any particular class on the grounds that it is in the public interest to do so.  I cannot see that, in considering an application on the part of one trade union to have alone the right to organise masters of that class, the tribunal would leave out of consideration the public interest altogether.  I take it that, in making this determination whether in respect of one trade union or more, the public interest would have to be the predominant factor: If it be felt necessary, I will look into that aspect of the matter with a view to making certain that the <Col N="756" /> public interest will be considered by the tribunal in all applications which come before it.</P>
    <P>I cannot attach very much importance to the view which has been expressed by Deputy Corry.  If the need for having, in relation to certain trade unions, a tribunal of this sort were not agreed to by practically every section of the working class trade union movement, it would not be necessary to have a provision of this sort in the Bill.  However, that is a matter which will arise more correctly on the following section.</P>

The Minister may be assured that the Town Hall will be fairly filled to hear him explain why this Bill is regarded as a matter of urgent public importance, and particularly why he introduces this wording into the section. I say, in all seriousness, that some of us on this side, in both opposition Parties, have as good advice as to the meaning of the words in this and other sections as the Minister has. The Minister certainly has big people in the legal profession, including the Attorney-General, behind him, and he says that every section can be justified and related to the letter and to the spirit of the Constitution.  We say definitely that there are words in the section which conflict with the Constitution. Time will tell whether that is <Col N="758" /> correct or not, and the opportunity may be taken to challenge the opinion of the.

      <P>The only way the Deputy has recognised it is by interruptions which are not always intelligent and which require a little more explanation than the few words which Deputy Brady throws in from time to time, while he remains seated.  I ask the Minister to say whether it is possible under the section, if the Bill becomes law in its present form, for an applicant union to be refused by the tribunal the powers asked for.  The section reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  Subject to the provisions of this, section, where application is made to the tribunal by a trade union which claims to have organised a majority of masters of a particular class for a determination that such trade union alone shall have the right to organise masters of that class, the tribunal, after hearing such application and having considered all the circumstances of the case, shall either&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  grant such determination, or</P>
      <P>(b)  refuse to grant such determination, or</P>
      <P>(c)  if satisfied that there are reasonable grounds in the public interest for so doing, determine that two or more specified trade unions alone shall have the right to organise masters of that class.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is it possible that the applicant union would not be one of the two or more unions granted a determination by the tribunal under that section?  If it is, it appears to be ridiculous, to use the word used by the Minister, to make it possible.  The Minister admitted on a previous occasion that certain wording, not carefully considered by him or his legal advisers, appeared to be ridiculous, having heard the interpretation that could be put on the words by <Col N="759" /> people with a better understanding of the English language than I have. The same difference of interpretation applies to every section, but the Minister will not admit that, because he says this is a good Bill.  Deputy Corry, however, rightly says that the wording of some of the sections, such as this, brings us back to the slave age.</P>

      <P>Deputy Esmonde has rightly called the attention of the Minister to the very loose wording of sub-section (2), which says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>When considering an application under this section, the tribunal shall hear every person&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>inside and outside our asylums, I suppose.</P>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;who wishes to be beard and appears to have an interest in such application and shall receive any evidence tendered by such person.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to know the reason for the insertion of &ldquo;every penon&rdquo;, and why the Minister should make it possible for every Tom, Dick and Harry to take up the time of the tribunal, privately and publicly, in making his case to be heard before that body.  I cannot imagine that anybody other than a master&mdash;I use the words of the slave age referred to by Deputy Corry &mdash;or a member of a trade union could have any deep interest in the work of this tribunal and, therefore, should like to hear why the Minister or his advisers allow this latitude to anybody and everybody.  No doubt a good deal of time will be wasted by the tribunal in hearing every nosy-parker who comes along in an attempt to prove that he is interested in the proceedings of the tribunal.  I do not think that is desirable, but if you want to make a mockery of a rotten Bill of this kind, this is the right way to do it. The sub-section does not even say that &ldquo;every person&rdquo; should be an Irish national, and some of the people from Whitechapel or Timbuctoo can waste the time of the tribunal in trying to prove that they have an interest in the case to be heard by the tribunal. Does the Minister mean that &ldquo;every person&rdquo; shall be confined to persons who are members of the master class, <Col N="761" /> as defined in the section, or members of a trade union recognised by the section, or does he mean that every citizen of the State, or every Tom, Dick or Harry inside or outside the State, can come before the tiibunal and waste its time, while the taxpayers have to pay for it?</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Objection, I think, has quite rightly been taken to the use of the phrase &ldquo;organise masters of that class.&rdquo;  The only justification for the continuance of the phrase is apparently a suggestion that similar terminology has been used in relation to earlier Acts of Parliament dealing with the subject of trade union organisation, but I think it is not impossible for us in 1941 to find phraseology which more closely represents the train of progressive thought in 1941.  It seems to me that even in a Bill of this kind it should not be impossible to describe a trade union organisation of employers as an &ldquo;employers' trade union&rdquo; or a &ldquo;trade union of employers&rdquo; instead of getting back to the phraseology which has distinguished trade union legislation of 100 years ago.  For instance, in the Trade Union Act, 1906, while the phrase &ldquo;trade union whether of workmen or masters&rdquo; is used, the same Act nevertheless, when it is referring to industrial disputes, uses the words &ldquo;employers&rdquo; or &ldquo;firm&rdquo; where the firm is not an individual employer. What is the difficulty either in this section or in other sections in using the term &ldquo;employers' trade union&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;trade union of masters,&rdquo; to describe our train of thought in 1941?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Davin has raised the point&mdash; which I think is of considerable interest &mdash;that it may be possible for a trade union of masters, as it is called here, to make an application for the right to organise employers in a particular industry or in a particular area, and it seems to me that under this section it is possible for the tribunal in that case to make a determination not related to the application of the employers' trade union, but may in fact come to a decision regulating what type of employers' trade unions may organise <Col N="762" /> certain classes of employers.  It may very well happen under Section 20 as it is now drawn that a trade union of employers which makes an application to this tribunal may find that, far from having its own application conceded or merely rejected, the tribunal may, simply because the matter has been brought to its notice, come to a decision on that application recommending the employers' trade unions into which certain classes of employers will be organised.  I should like the Minister to tell us whether it is possible for that to happen under Section 20, as it is drafted at the moment.  It seems to me that it is possible for it to happen, and if employers are to go to a tribunal of this kind the tribunal ought to be compelled to limit its decision to the application before it, and not have power to lay down the type of employers' trade unions which would organise employers, whether in a particular industry or in a particular territorial area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the point which has been made by Deputy Davin and by Deputy Norton is quite correct.  Any person who goes before this tribunal will have to accept the risks of the determination which the tribunal makes.  I think that is a very useful and salutary safeguard, so that people will not go vexatiously to this tribunal asking for the right to organise employers or employees as the case may be in any section unless they can make a good case.  One of the reasons why every interest must be heard is that other people can come along, once the issue is raised before the tribunal, and can show perhaps that they have a better case for securing the determination which is asked. I do not think there is anything contrary to public interest in leaving the tribunal, once the facts are before it, to make the determination which is best in the public interest.  It may be that the determination which would be best in the public interest is the one to which Deputies Davin and Norton have referred&mdash;that not the originating trade unions but another trade union which had made a better case should have the right which it asked for.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister now confirms the suggestion that it is possible for an organisation to go before this tribunal and have its application either rejected or acceded to, or have an entirely new determination made by the tribunal.  The effect of the determination may be that the organisation which might seek an increase in its area of operations would, by a decision which it is possible for the tribunal to give under sub-section (1) (c), find itself wiped out in the course of time, inasmuch as the tribunal might decide that not only would it not accede to its application but would give another group the right to organise this particular class of employers.  The Minister said that that is a kind of salutary lesson to people not to go to this tribunal without some good reason.  In this section, which is dealing with the functions of the tribunal in relation to employers' unions, we are giving this tribunal very wide powers.  It is apparently possible for the tribunal to come to a decision that it is satisfied that in the public interest there are reasonable grounds for doing certain things.  But this is a lay tribunal.  Some barrister may just manage to scrape in and become the chairman&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>We know the kind of tests which have been applied to practising barristers before.  A few fellows have been put into good jobs on that phraseology before.  This will not be the last vehicle which will wheel another one of them in.  It seems to me there ought to be a right of appeal to the courts against the determination of the tribunal on a matter of this kind.  We may find for instance a craft organisation, with a long and honourable record, which will go before the tribunal making an application for the purpose of extending the area of its activities.  When it goes to the tribunal, the tribunal may reject the application, and instead may say to <Col N="764" /> that organisation: &ldquo;Look here, not only are we not going to accede to your application, but we have in fact come to a decision which will entirely put you out of the scope of operations in respect of the future recruitment of members.&rdquo;  Then, this organisation, which has been in existence for a long number of years, and which may have built up certain assets on behalf of its members, will find its source of recruitment cut off in the future.  That decision is apparently to be completely in the hands of this tribunal.  I think if we are giving the tribunal such wide powers as this the minimum we ought to do is to give the right of appeal to the courts against a judgment of the tribunal on such a matter.  I do not know on what grounds the Minister can justify a refusal to give an appeal to the courts against the determination of the tribunal on a matter of that kind.  It may be one of tremendous importance to the organisation concerned, and the tribunal should not be allowed to arrive at a final decision.  It ought therefore, to be possible for the case to be re-heard by the courts, so that a tribunal of this kind would not wield those wide powers in any arbitrary way.  I should like to know what the Minister has to say on the question of permitting an appeal from the tribunal's determination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course.  I am in a great difficulty in regard to this matter since I have no amendment before me that would enable me to address ray mind to that particular proposal.  If an amendment of that kind had been put down, I might have been able to discuss it in greater detail and with more exactitude.  However, I can see difficulties in the way of an appeal to the court.  Where is it going to stop? Where will the appeal stop?  Will it have to be carried to the Supreme Court?  That is one of the questions that must arise.  If this tribunal is not to be regarded as a final arbiter in connection with disputes in our industrial system, would that not be the beginning of prolonged litigation and, of course, tremendous expense to the trade unions concerned?  If we were to grant an unrestricted right of appeal in a matter of this sort, it would be quite <Col N="765" /> possible for a wealthy organisation to initiate proceedings before the tribunal, carry the matter to the Supreme Court and, in that way, defeat the aims of the competing organisations.  I am quite prepared to consider this suggestion with an open mind&mdash;the suggestion that the tribunal should not be the last word in the matter.  It might be possible, let us say, for the findings of the tribunal to be subject to confirmation by the Minister.  My attitude, however, is that once we have provided legislation and laid down the lines upon which the matter must be dealt with, it is better that it should be solved entirely by the parties concerned themselves.  As I say, therefore, I should fear, or at least hesitate, to make the findings of the tribunal subject to confirmation by the Minister, although the question of whether there might be some further appeal tribunal or board to consider the findings of this tribunal and confirm them, reject them, or revise them, is perhaps a question which I might examine.  It is clear, however, that once proceedings of this sort are initiated it is in the interests of all concerned that they should be brought to a speedy and, if possible, of course, an acceptable conclusion.  I think it would be admitted that there is little to be gained by affording certain interested parties the excuse or the opportunity of such machinery for dragging out proceedings.</P>
      <P>As I have said, I am at a great disadvantage so far as what Deputy Norton has been advocating in connection with this section is concerned, because I have no precise formulation before me of the ideas which he wishes to have considered.  I shall think of what the Deputy has said and it may be possible that, on the Report Stage, I might be able to give the House an opportunity of considering whether the findings or determinations of this tribunal should be final or not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>That is evident from what he has just now said, and, <Col N="766" /> apparently, the argument used by Deputy Norton has influenced the Minister to go so far as to say that be thinks that he will be able to consider, between now and the Report Stage, the advisability of inserting some amendment which would give the right of appeal from the decision of this tribunal to some other persons or some other body.  For the same reasons&mdash; some of which were given, I think, in connection with Section 16&mdash;I suggest that the Minister may make up his mind that neither he nor any other Minister can be regarded as a person who could give the last word in a matter of this kind, and have it accepted willingly by the parties concerned, who might like to have an appeal from the decision of the tribunal.  I do not think that the right of appeal to the Minister, whoever he might be, in a case of this kind could be regarded as satisfactory, and I think the Minister would be well advised to make up his mind as to that.  If, as he says, he is going to give consideration to the question of appeal from the decisions of this tribunal, then I think it would be better to give the persons concerned the right to go before a court, such as the High Court, or some other competent body that would be regarded as likely to give an impartial judgment in such cases.  I asked the Minister already about the words &ldquo;every person&rdquo;, and I want to know why he insists on these words being left in.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very simple.  The phraseology used here is used to ensure that any person, who claims to have a right to be heard, or who has an interest in the application, shall be heard by the tribunal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not asking the Minister to amend this Bill.  I do not care whether this Bill is amended or not, because I think it is a vicious Bill in its conception, and I believe it will be still more vicious if the Minister is allowed to operate it.  In Section 20, however, the spirit of the whole Bill is manifest.  As the Bill is drafted, we provide for the setting up of a tribunal to be appointed by the Minister, and we give this tribunal powers to <Col N="767" /> determine whether an organisation is to exist or not, and provide no appeal against the judgment or determination of that tribunal.  I am wondering why that was left out.  The Minister's Department was responsible for the enactment of the Railways Act, 1924, Section 22 of which provided for appeals in certain cases, against decisions of the Railway Tribunal, to the Supreme Court, and I think it will be remembered that that particular section was availed of in an action between the <i>Independent and the Irish Press.</i>  In any case, it was felt desirable there, that even the Railway Tribunal&mdash; although it had been given very wide powers&mdash;could not finally decide the matter, and there was a direct appeal to the Supreme Court in questions of law.  You have a similar provision in the Unemployment Insurance Act of 1920, Section 10 of which provides that <Col N="768" /> any aggreived person may appeal to the High Court, and it is not confined to questions of law.  During recent years there has been a number of cases of re-hearing by the High Court, and there have been cases where the High Court over-ruled the insurance officer who had been confirmed on the facts. It seems rather strange, therefore, that with this well-beaten track before us, and with the knowledge that we alredy have, we should deliberately prohibit appeal against the findings or determinations of this tribunal.  I think that no tribunal set up in this way to discharge the functions allocated to this tribunal should be given those wide powers and that we ought still to preserve the right of appeal to our own courts in order to ensure that there may be a fairer determination secured than could be secured before a tribunal selected in this fashion.</P>

      <P>The section, which this amendment seeks to amend, provides:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Subject to the provisions of this section, where application is made to the tribunal by a trade union which claims to have organised a majority of workmen of any particular class for a determination that such trade union alone shall have the right to organise workmen of that class, the tribunal, after hearing such application and having considered all the circumstances of the case...&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>may do a number of things.  It seems clear to me that the organisation of workers in a union such as that referred to there is organisation for the purpose of carrying on negotiations for the fixing of wages and other conditions of employment.  In what other sense would the trade union exist?  It is true, of course, that you could get seven people to form a trade union <Col N="773" /> heretofore.  That is not possible now because the seven people forming the organisation must be able to deposit a cheque for £2,000.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>There is nothing in this Bill which prescribes that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The bank manager will do the prescribing.  The present position is that any seven persons could form a trade union.  As I said on an earlier section, they need not even be workers to do that.  In fact, they might be united by a covenant to the effect that they were never going to work.  Yet, they could register as a trade union.  The Minister says there is nothing in this Bill which prohibits that.  There is this much of a prohibition, that the organisation proposing to do that now must lodge a cheque for £2,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, or be a house union or an excepted body.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>They need not be any of these things.  All the amendment <Col N="774" /> proposes is that they be organised &ldquo;for the purpose of the carrying on of negotiations for the fixing of wages and other conditions of employment&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the purpose of a trade union, to fix wages and other conditions of employment.  If any seven persons want to form an organisation now they must make a deposit of £2,000 unless they are going to be a house union&mdash;that is, where they all work for the one employer, not being a local authority&mdash;or an excepted body. Only a small number of persons come into that category.  I do not see the purpose which this amendment seeks to achieve.  I could understand its meaning in respect to a trade union of employers, but in respect to a trade union of workers I cannot understand it.  The only reason why it is being made to this section is, apparently because a similar amendment was made to Section 20.  The circumstances, however, in relation to both organisations are entirely dissimilar.</P>

Will the Minister tell us why he drafts a Bill, putting in provision for review of a case after 12 months, and then, shortly after the Bill has been drafted and circulated, slips in five years instead of 12 months? What set of circumstances induced the Minister to believe that it is now necessary to have a decision endure for five years instead of 12 months, as originally contemplated by him?</P>

      <P>I know, but that is what he is claiming.  He apparently considers that that is a quite proper and correct procedure, and that it is the proper way to treat this House and this Bill.  He refuses to give any explanation of amendments Nos. 67 and 68 in the place where it should be given.  He asks the House to take out a sub-section specifying 12 months, and refuses to give the House any reason or reasons, if there are any, as to why it should be taken out.  He refuses to give the House, before it decides to take it out, if it does decide to take it out, any reason why five years should be put in its place, or can the House take this out altogether and refuse to put in amendments Nos. 67 and 68?  That is the only line we can take&mdash; to agree to the Minister's amendment now before the House, and refuse to agree to amendments Nos. 67 and 68.</P>

      <P>Is this the only explanation we are to get from the Minister, Sir, with regard to this very important amendment?  Really, I suggest that it is not even an attempt at an explanation.  Deputy Childers was complaining a while ago that there was not another section in connection with Section 20, which would give some direction to the tribunal in dealing with employers.  There is no doubt whatever that they will be given a direction, under this amendment, to deal with workingmen.  For the purposes of this section workingmen may be classified</P>
      <P>&ldquo;by reference to a class to which they belong, by reference to an area in which they work, or by reference to such a class and such an area.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>And then the sub-section goes on to say that the word &ldquo;class&rdquo; shall be construed in this section accordingly&mdash; whatever that means.  The Minister did not think it worth his while to enlighten the House, but apparently he is quite satisfied now, formally, to move each amendment, have the votes registered in the lobbies, and carry them.  There are many things that I could say with regard to this amendment but probably it would be better if I left them over for the discussion on the section where we shall have a wider scope for discussion.</P>

      <P>As Deputy Morrissey says, this is a very definite provision. There are very many things that would arise on the discussion of <Col N="782" /> this section, and perhaps it might be well for the Minister, if he has any explanation to give with regard to this matter of the class or area to which workmen belong, to give that explanation now, because it would enable the discussion on the section itself to be more informative and more declaration of the other points that require to be considered.  Would the Minister give us any idea of the particular classes he has in mind that would be distinct classes under this sub-section?  I take it that, in regard to particular classes, whether a class of working men is related to an area would be more or less dependent on whether the class is a very numerous one or not in the area, and of course that might vary.  However, if the Minister would give us some idea of the division of the particular classes, and then give us some idea as to the particular classes that might also be linked up with certain areas, that would help the House to understand these proposals.</P>

      <P>It seems to me that the purpose of this amendment and of this section is patent on the face of it. For instance, we talk of &ldquo;Dublin bakers&rdquo;, because there is a class of workers in that trade related to an area such as Dublin City.  In the same way we talk of &ldquo;Cork bricklayers&rdquo;, because certain workers there in that trade are related to the City of Cork.  The purpose of this amendment is to enable the tribunal, if it should prove to be necessary, to consider an application coming from an organisation claiming to have organised all the workmen in a particular class in one area, say, an area where, for instance, their organisation has been operating over a long period and where no other organisation has come in.  Whatever may be the deficiencies or defects of comprehension of some Deputies, I think it is ridiculous to ask me to explain the purpose of that amendment to the intelligent members of this House.</P>

At any rate, will the Minister take us into his confidence and say from what source he got the advice to insert an amendment of this kind already agreed to by a majority of the House in the case of the previous section?  I wish to remind him again, even if he does not want to explain the meaning of this amendment or of the various sections of the Bill, that it is desirable that he should have his views on record for the guidance of the tribunal and of whatever body he may set up as an appeal court from any decisions that may be given by the tribunal.</P>

      <P>I suggest that there is no relevance in the Minister's point that he has made a similar provision in the <Col N="784" /> previous section.  When relating to masters, it is one thing; when relating to workmen, it is quite a distinct thing. Will the Minister say what is his interpretation of the word &ldquo;class&rdquo;?  If you take a particular industry, in that industry you may have 20 different classes.  How is it to be decided by the tribunal that they have organised a majority of a class?  There are all sorts of classes in the flour-milling industry besides flour millers.  The same thing applies to the bacon industry and the transport industry.  What particular section will be the dominating one?  If some union says that they have organised a majority of the stationary engine drivers in a particular industry, will it be sufficient for the tribunal to grant a determination on that basis? I suggest that it would be impossible for the tribunal to interpret this section which, I confess, I have sympathy with the Minister in trying to interpret. What is meant by &ldquo;class&rdquo; in this instance?</P>
      <P>I suggest that the House has no right to pass legislation like this and to ask tribunal, whether composed of lay persons or legal persons, to interpret something which we cannot interpret ourselves.  I suggest that the Minister does not know what is meant by this, and that he ought to say frankly that he does not know how it will be interpreted. There are so many classes of workers in each of the different industries that we know there will be rival claims made by the different unions that cater for this section or that section.  How can the tribunal determine what is meant by a majority of any class as contemplated in this section? If the word is ambiguous, as it is, should the Minister not try to lay down some plain common-sense course which will enable the tribunal to function and carry out the important duties entrusted to them?  I suggest that no tribunal can interpret that sub-section. If the Minister is able to do it.  I ask him to do it.  I have sympathy with him in trying to give a definition of what is conveyed in this jumble of words.  It is not fair to the tribunal, and they cannot possibly interpret it.</P>

      <P>The Minister did <Col N="785" /> make some attempt to give a picture to the House in connection with this new proposed sub-section when he mentioned the Dublin bakers and the Cork bakers as examples of a particular class in a particular area which might be associated together.  I do not know whether or not we are to gather from the Minister's remarks that, under the operation of this section, he contemplates having an authorised union representing the Cork bakers and an authorised union representing the Dublin bakers, and that they stand out as the kind of class that would be treated as being associated with an area.  When we come to consider the Bill as a whole and the general position of such classes, we find that in the Cork County Borough under the heading of bakers, there are pastry cooks and biscuit makers.  When we take the biscuit makers and the pastry cooks and add them to the bakers, there are only 298 persons, 267 of them being men and 31 women, who come under that particular class.  So that, if they are a separate trade union, which I understand from the Minister's remarks they are at the present time, those 298 persons would have to find £2,000 between them before they could be recognised as a class or a group. If we take the County Borough of Dublin and the County Borough of Dun Laoghaire, again adding the biscuit makers and the pastry cooks to the bakers, we get a total of 1,620 persons, 1,171 being men and 449 women, and that group again would have to pay £2,000.</P>

      <P>No, but what does arise is the number of authorised unions that we are likely to have, and the number of persons, under the section as a whole, we are likely to have as persons who get a determination that they are the union for that particular class or area, and who will have a monopoly of the right to organise workers.  In giving us a picture of the Dublin bakers and the Cork bakers, I submit to the Minister that he does not lead us very far in understanding the <Col N="786" /> situation, that it only makes confusion more confused, and the position and its possibilities more kaleidoscopic than ever.  I think he ought to add a little more detail to the picture.  It is not sufficient to refer to the Dublin bakers or the Cork bakers, because that only makes it more difficult to understand.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JeremiahHurley" hpid="Mr. Hurley Mr. Hurley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hurley</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that there is a reason, as Deputy Keyes pointed out, to define or construe the word &ldquo;class&rdquo;. Are we to take it that it would be the function of the tribunal to put their own interpretation on the word? There is no definition in this Bill of the meaning of the word.  The common interpretation of the word &ldquo;class&rdquo; is the working class or the master class, but for any sub-divisions of these classes there is no common interpretation.  I think the Minister should lay down exactly what is his interpretation and what will be accepted by the House as an interpretation of the word &ldquo;class&rdquo;. Otherwise the interpretation of it will be the function of the tribunal, and that tribunal, from its very constitution, will not be in a position to interpret the meaning of the word &ldquo;class&rdquo;.  It is going to cause very great confusion if and when this Bill comes into operation, and if and when the tribunal will be called upon to decide on the interpretation of the word &ldquo;class&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One instance comes to my mind. Take distributive workers.  People in that group&mdash;I do not know whether the word &ldquo;group&rdquo; is a better one to use than &ldquo;class&rdquo;&mdash;could be put into various classes.  But that is not going to solve the problem or make things easier for the tribunal.  I am sure the House will welcome a definition or interpretation of what is meant by &ldquo;class&rdquo;.  The amendment and the whole of Section 21 turn on that definition. We are told in the section that workmen may be classified by a reference to the class to which they belong. Does that mean the working class or the master class?  The new sub-section sets out that workmen may be classified by reference to an area in which they work or to such a class and such an area, and the word &ldquo;class&rdquo; shall be construed accordingly.  There is nothing in the Bill which would help <Col N="787" /> to construe the word &ldquo;class&rdquo;.  The Minister should give us an interpretation which will be on record for the tribunal when it is faced with interpreting the word.</P>

On page 6, as part of table 2&mdash;Occupations of persons 14 years of age and over in Saorstát Eireann on 26th April, 1936, with comparative figures for 1926&mdash;we find bakers, pastry cooks and biscuit makers as a class.  Not to mind anything that goes before that, but merely to follow on, we find other classes, such as grain millers, sugar, sweet, and jam boilers, creamery  workers, bacon curers, maltsters, skilled workers in the tobacco and snuff industry, and, under textile works, we have spinners, weavers, knitters, hand-lace workers, dyers and assistant carpet workers, boot and shoe makers, tailors' cutters&mdash;&mdash;</P>

In dealing with serious matters, are we going to be submitted to the type of interruption which the Minister has inveighed in?  I am speaking under certain difficulties, and as you can understand I do not want to elaborate why.  But I am not going to have it said that I neglected any part of what I consider to be my duty in trying to find out what the likely effects of this section are going to be.</P>
      <P>If Deputies will take the Census of Production for 1936, Vol. 2, and look at pages 4 to 15, see the various classes of workers that are recorded there, and then refer to the Minister's remarks with regard to bakers and area with regard to Dublin and Cork &mdash;if they will go through that, and see the way in which classes like smiths, motor mechanics, brush-makers are distributed through the country, I would ask them to tell the House, if the Minister cannot do so, what they think the result of this sub-section is going to be.

      <P>It seems to me that the language of this is of a most ambiguous character.  I can imagine quite a considerable amount of litigation arising out of the interpretation of this sub-section.  This amendment was not embodied in the Bill when circulated. We got it as an afterthought. <Col N="793" /> Quite obviously the amendment han been drafted with the utmost indifference. It purports to describe what class is, and it says that classes may be classified, that workmen may be classified by reference to the classes to which they belong.  Does that mean vocational classes?  Does it mean that carpenters are to be classified as tarpenters, or that they can be classified as building trade workers or constructional workers?</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I move the adjournment of the House.  The debate went on fairly late last night and the House was under the impression that more time should be given to the reply than was then available.  There were various matters which Deputies wanted to have discussed which would have had to be treated with too great compression and, for that reason, special time has been arranged for it.  Various points were raised in the discussion, of which perhaps the most important was that raised by Deputy Broderick at the end, and by Deputy Murphy before him. They wanted an explicit statement of exactly how the county councils stood. I am rather surprised that a very responsible member like the chairman of the Cork County Council should be in any doubt as to the position.  The actual position is that, on 26th March of this year, the Department of Local Government sent a circular letter to all the county councils, drawing attention to the fuel position and informing them of Emergency Powers Order No. 73, empowering them to produce turf. That was an order which enabled the county councils to take over bogs, and on those bogs to produce turf for their own use, and, in addition, to take over bogs for the use of any other local body or like association for the purpose of cutting turf.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 3rd April, a further circular was sent, stressing the urgency of turf production and giving the strong advice to the county councils that their power to take over bogs and to work bogs should be delegated to their chief engineering officers.  On 10th April, the county surveyors were further informed by the Department that the Minister had made an order under Section 73 of the Local Government Act, 1925, consenting to the delegation to the county surveyors of the <Col N="795" /> other functions which were given to the county councils originally under Order No. 73, with the exception of the powers to raise rates for the purposes of the Turf Order, to borrow money for the purposes of the Turf Order, or to pay compensation payable under the provisions of the Turf Order.  In other words, certain powers were given to the county councils, if they chose to exercise them, and certain powers of delegation of those powers, if they chose to exercise them, were also given.  No orders of any kinds were given in the matter.</P>
    <P>A later order was made amending Order No. 73 in certain places in which there were gaps, because the first order did not, in fact, curiously enough, give to the county councils all the powers which the county councils were in a position to delegate to other authorities and the county councils were authorised, if they saw fit, to hand over these powers to their county surveyors. In practically every case, without limitation, the county councils showed their appreciation of that power being given to them by fully exercising it in handing it over to the county surveyors. Therefore, technically, the position at the present moment is that everything a county council has done in relation to turf it has done in the full and voluntary exercise of powers given to it.  It has had a complete option to exercise these powers or not to exercise them, and, in certain very few cases, county councils have not handed over the full powers to the county surveyors.  I am now dealing, however, merely with the very proper question put by the chairman of the Cork County Council, Deputy Broderick, on whose re-election to that chairmanship I should like, if I may, to congratulate him.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Broderick Mr. Broderick">

    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>That, technically, is the position.  Everything that has been done&mdash;every sod of turf cut, every man employed, and every expense incurred &mdash;has been done in the voluntary exercises of powers given to the county councils.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Broderick Mr. Broderick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broderick</NameTxt>
      <P>I am fully conversant with all the Parliamentary Secrtetary has said about these orders and amending orders.  It is my duty to be conversant with them.  It is quite clear that we in Cork county have cooperated as much as, and possibly more intensely than anywhere else.  We have supplied all the requirements of our own institutions, as I pointed out last night.  We have now reached the end of that position and we have already paid out £16,000 on turf.  We are anxious in the national interest to continue but, in doing so, we are providing not for ourselves but for the State, and, in all probability, the turf will be taken over by the State for distribution to other interests which are not directly ours, and there is one vital question which I put last night and the answer to which I and my county would like to know.  It is: where does the responsibility for finance come in in that matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>In other, words, the Deputy wants to know where he stands now, having exercised his powers up to a certain position.  He stands in exactly the same position as all the other counties, a great number of which have exercised that power of providing money, for the purpose of turf production, to a very much larger extent&mdash;in some cases to a hugely larger extent, relative to their resources and to their responsibilities&mdash;than the Cork County Council.  They have not stopped immediately they thought that they had fulfilled their immediate obligations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Broderick Mr. Broderick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broderick</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware that we have stopped either.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The difficulty is that it was suggested that a county surveyor had in fact stopped.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Broderick Mr. Broderick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broderick</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, he got instructions to continue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>He reported that he had in fact stopped, and that he had stopped on this particular ground, and the figures which I have here for the previous week and for last week show that last week there were more men employed by the Cork County Council, <Col N="797" /> and more turf cut by the Cork County Council, than in any previous weel. That is all to their credit.  I accept fully and freely the assurance given by the chainnan of the Cork County Council that they are anxious to continue in the public interest, that they regard themselves as the servants of the public, the servants of the State in this matter, and that what they want to do is to have certain anxieties and doubts which are in their minds removed.  All I am concerned with is to find how far we can go to meet the Deputy.  Deputy Cogan asked that, under no circumstances should a county council be involved in loss by its continuance.  That is an assurance which I am not prepared to give, and that is an assurance which I am perfectly certain Deputy Broderick does not desire.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Broderick Mr. Broderick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broderick</NameTxt>
      <P>No.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>But, just as I gave an assurance to the county surveyors, when they were sent out to do this work, that, in regard to any act of theirs which was shown to be in good faith and in the exercise of reasonable judgment, I would stand over it and take responsibility, in exactly the same sense the Government recognises that the county councils are their servants in this matter, and the servants of the cause which is common to them, and, except in the case of default, except in the case of something which could not be defended, except in some case where it would be quite obvious to the people that there had been abuse of those powers, they will be held blameless and clear.  We do not believe for one moment that there is going to be a loss in those matters, nor are we asking any county council, when it comes to clear up its accounts, to have bold its turf at such a price as will leave it with a deficit.  Take the case of Cork County as an example.  It was a border-line case.  It is neither a turf county nor a coal county.  It might have been scheduled as either, but, having regard to the fact that its total production is not adequate to its fuel consumption, it has up to the present been left as a coal county.  But, when we come to share out the inadequate total coal resources in the winter, <Col N="798" /> every county will have to account to itself, to its own conscience, and to the country, as to how far it has gone to exhaust the possibilities of meeting its own needs out of turf.  It is for that reason that I think the Cork County Council should be very slow even to contemplate the shutting down of its production of turf one moment earlier than is imperative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Broderick Mr. Broderick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broderick</NameTxt>
      <P>We have no intention of doing so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>At the moment the position is that the county surveyor cannot continue to cut turf as all the spreading grounds are full, and no further bogs are available except in one case, where he has cut away a road near Dunmanway.  In about ten days' time, when he has some operating grounds clear, he will start again in that area.  Now, I hope that the Cork County Council, as soon as an opportunity does arise, will again, to the fullest capacity, get on to providing turf for itself, because the total amount of turf which it has provided up to the present means that it is going to be a liability on the fuel pool instead of an asset, and I am quite sure that Cork does not want that to be the case if we are in a critical position in relation to fuel in the winter.  I accept, without any hesitation or reserve, the assurance which has been given both by the chairman and other members of the council that they are only too anxious to use the fullest resources of the council for the purpose of carrying on the good work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. D. Morrissey Mr. D. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Parliamentary Secretary, before he leaves that point, allow me to ask him a question? I should like to have the matter explained, because I understand that it has caused a certain amount of uneasiness in several towns.  It is in reference to the county councils cutting turf for their own requirements.  I think it would be a good thing if the matter were clarified, because a number of town and parish councils have been made rather uneasy owing to the fact that they have been informed that until such time as the county councils have fully provided for their own requirements no turf cut under this new <Col N="799" /> scheme headed by the county surveyors will be made available for the ordinary consumer.  I want to have it made clear that that does not mean&mdash;at least I hope it does not&mdash;that every engine run or worked by the county council will have to be fed and kept going with turf, whilst the ordinary consumer, the poor, will be left short.  I think everybody will agree that the first claim on our supplies would be that of our hospitals and institutions under the county board of health, but after that, before any, shall I say, mechanical feeding would be done, the next claim would be that of the people who need turf for domestic use, particularly the poor.  I do not know whether I have made my point clear, but it has caused a certain amount of anxiety.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has made it perfectly clear.  With the principle which the Deputy has in his mind I am in entire agreement, our conduct in bringing that principle to a head may be different.  The first work which the county councils had to do, and which they were authorised to do out of their existing fuel account, was to cut alternative supplies of fuel for their machinery.  There is no greater service which they could perform for the community than to make sure that that is done, because a great deal of the employment which they might want to give on roads and things of that kind might depend on the functioning of that machinery.  However, the total amount, in that particular case, which is required for that particular purpose, is relatively small, but the first amount that has been cut has been for the purpose of enabling the available work on road repairing, road maintenance, and so on, to continue.  The second thing is the maintenance of local hospitals, boards of health, and such other institutions as the Deputy has mentioned. It is intended to be expressed that the first call on that turf would be for public services and for social services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. D. Morrissey Mr. D. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I would prefer if the Parliamentary Secretary were to use the phrase &ldquo;for human needs&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>But human needs may be <Col N="800" /> best served by enabling a traction engine or a crusher, or something of that kind, to work.  At any rate, the proportion devoted to that purpose is relatively small in comparison with the total.  It would be absolutely negligible in counties such as Mayo, Donegal, Cork, and so on, while in the smaller counties it might be greater. Now, the next question which arose was the question of whether we were to depend, and to what extent we could depend, on sources other than the county surveyors for the purpose of cutting turf.  Here, again, there has been a difference, and a legitimate difference, of opinion&mdash;sometimes, I am afraid, expressed, probably, became men were talking <i>extempore</i> and without giving consideration to the impression that might be left.  I shall take Deputy Brennan's case as an example. He said that the Taoiseach did not understand the turf position&mdash;that, in districts such as his own, men could not cut that turf because they only had a small bank.  On being pressed a little further, the Deputy said, in effect: &ldquo;Well, they do cut a certain amount of turf, but when they have to do their ordinary harvesting, they do not feel inclined to go any further in the matter of cutting turf.&rdquo;  What I am inclined to think is that people will have to go a great deal further than they are inclined to go, and that legitimate leisure may have to be invaded for purposes of this character.  Take the case of a farmer who faces January and February with an empty grate and a famished family because he has no turf since he could not steal any more time, either from his husbandry or his leisure, for the purpose of getting that turf.  Contemplating that new condition, when his family was without fuel, his outlook upon that leisure, and his objection to stealing that time from his harvesting operations, might be different.  He might say that he wished that he had put himself to a very great deal more trouble during that particular time so that, in January and February, his wife and his family should not be cold for want of fuel.  The prosperous farmer, however, in districts such as Deputy Brennan has spoken of, will not be <Col N="801" /> cold, and neither will his family be famished with the cold during the winter for the lack of turf which he did not rut, but some other family may be, and what I want is that those who are in the position, by the sacrifice of their leisure and by going to a very great deal of trouble, if necessary, to cut another harvest of turf, should do so in order that some other man's family may not be cold.  I hope that those who are in a position to do so will do it, and thereby, give a good example to many hundreds of others.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no doubt, as Deputy Crowley said, that the people in the West&mdash;the people in the &ldquo;black&rdquo; areas, the people who know what cold is and what hunger is, who have lived in these areas and have experience of hunger and cold&mdash;will follow the advice and the call that has been given to them, at any risk and at any sacrifice to continue to cut, and cut, and cut, until they are sure that the last sod which can be saved before next April has been cut.  I am sure that other tens of thousands of men are going to follow that advice and that lead, and I want Deputy Brennan, as representing areas which do not know those necessities&mdash; areas which are not themselves pressed exiguously and hard into the necessity for cutting this harvest&mdash;to impress on everybody the necessity to follow the lead of the people in the &ldquo;black&rdquo; areas, so that every one of these people, when January and February come, can have it to say, with a good, honest conscience, that by some special effort and by doing something more than might have been reasonably expected of them, they have ensured to some other man and his wife and family freedom from the hardships which they themselves have escaped.  I am satisfied that there are thousands of places in which an extra harvest of turf could be cut.  I am satisfied that if in every place where it is possible to cut turf, the people who can do it will now do it to the extent of providing us with the second certain, and the third risky, harvest, the difference between hardship for a lot of people in this country and comparative comfort will be made up bv their efforts, and I <Col N="802" /> am asking, in the spirit of co-operation which has been shown by all Parties and by all sections of the community in relation to this campaign, that those who are more fortunate than others should go out and organise those who are better off with a view to seeing that that is done.</P>
    <P>Various Deputies have raised the question of the conditions of employment and of wages, and while I think, broadly speaking, that the House is satisfied that a reasonable and a proper wage is, in fact, being paid for this work over the whole country, there was a suggestion in certain quarters that some hardship&mdash;and possibly even some hardship without that consideration which should be given that hardship&mdash;was being caused.  Deputy Everett was very strong on that point, and so was Deputy Murphy.  They were very specially strong on the question of piece-rates.  Deputy Everett said that there were 100 men on strike in Wicklow on account of piece-rates&mdash; that they had been refused 32/-, that they were on strike for that reason, and that if somebody at headquarters was not full of red tape and regulations and did not interfere with the discretion of the county surveyors, things would have been all right.  Well, I told the House yesterday that the figure for employment would be about 30,000, as we had estimated it this week.  The figure is 29,719, and there are 100 men on strike.  Looked at objectively, those two figures rather suggest that, however irregular and however various and different have been the rates of wages and the methods of payment and employment, on the whole a satisfied employer is in presence of a very large body of satisfied employees.</P>
    <P>In order, however, to clear up the position completely, I will deal with the 100 men who are on strike against piece rates, having been refused 32/-because the discretion of the local surveyor had been interfered with from headquarters.  This is a letter which was issued on the 21st June in relation to this matter by the chief engineering adviser:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;To all County Surveyors.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is very desirable that some effort should be made during the <Col N="803" /> season to introduce in each county a trial of the piece work system of turf production.  Accordingly, I would be glad if you would arrange for a few gangs of men to undertake turf production on piece rates as in operation under the Turf Development Board. Copies of these rates have already been sent, to you.  If you have any difficulty in arranging for this, you could, if you wish, guarantee the workers on this trial the ordinary weekly wages.  They could then have for their week's work either their ordinary weekly wages or their earnings on a piece-work basis, whichever was higher.  I would suggest that the men selected for the work might be some of your regular county council workers who might be likely to give the system a fair trial. As the end of the season is approaching, I would be glad if you would introduce such a trial as soon as possible.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I do not think that the sense of the House will agree that a strike has been caused in Wicklow by the imposition, through interference with the discretion of the local officers, of a piece rate and by a refusal to pay the ordinary time rate.  In other words, we have a perfectly clean sheet of 30,000 employees who have been treated fairly, and who so regard it.</P>
    <P>The second point put up is the iniquity, apparently, of piece rates. There were some strong expressions of opinion on that subject.  I am going to quote from one of the strongest attackers of that system something with which I agree.  Deputy Murphy strongly dissented from an attempt to change the system of a weekly wage to a piece-rate system; bog work was not easy; it required efficient men in a good state of health; men will give of their best and profit by experience if treated with sympathy and understanding. I think that whatever system is adopted must be adopted with a recognition of the physical condition and capacity of the men when they go on to the bog, and with the intention of treating them fairly.  It has been suggested, however, that there is something intrinsically wrong and intrinsically <Col N="804" /> unjust in a peice-rate system; that there is something being imposed upon men who, if they could come out from under that tyranny, would give willingly.  That certainly is not borne out by the facts.  The position at the moment is that, in the three counties in which piece rates are being paid, more turf is being produced per man, and a lot more money is being paid per man, and the people who are working under it would not change from it for anyone.</P>

      <P>Will the Deputy stay quiet for a few minutes?  I will give you the actual result of a piece system in operation in a county which is employing between 3,000 and 4,000 persons. As you know, saving turf on a bog consists in cutting it, spreading it, footing it, and in dragging it out, to use the word of that particular county, or shifting it off the bog.  I have not got the figures for that at the moment, because that process is only being initiated in Donegal at the present moment.  But I have them for cutting, turning and footing for the past fortnight.  An average gang of 317 men worked 2,823 days.  They received £3,553 8s. 4d., or on an average 18/1 per day.  Their fortnightly wages varied from £8 to £14 per head.  That was on cutting and spreading.  The second process is the process of turning. Another sample lot of 210 persons worked for 559 days.  They received £209 6s. 2d., or an average of 7/6 per day, 60 per cent. of them being women and children.  At footing 198 persons worked 713 days.  They received in payment £473 16s. 11d., or an average of 13/3 per day, and from 40 to 50 per cent. of the total were women and children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Whatever else may be said for or against the piece rate system had better be said to those people, had better be said to them on the bog, had better be said in the form of a <Col N="805" /> statement that, in their interest and in the interest of the State, for the purpose of reducing the output per head and for the purpose of reducing their wages to the normal wages of a daily payment, the piece rate will be abolished in Donegal.</P>

      <P>I have not interrupted the Deputy, and I would rather that he would stay quiet.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>These are pood enough facts.  Now the Deputy is interrupting again.  I have been on a bog in Tipperary and I have picked up a timeSheet and I found that men were earning 16/- and l7/- a day.  I have been on five bogs in Mayo, where men were working piece rate, and that was the kind of rate of wages they were receiving. I know what their opinion would be of me or anybody else who would stretch a hand between them and the right to earn that money if they chose to earn it in the national service cutting turf.</P>
      <P>Let us recognise that there are all sorts of conditions of affairs in bogs and that approximations and variations and changes will have to be made to meet them.  There are some places in which it would be easy to earn good money.  In other cases it would be difficult.  I have been on half a dozen bogs in which, due to the condition under which the men were working, variations had been made in the rate in order to meet those difficulties.  So long as there is an understanding between the employer and the employee that good faith will be exercised in the application of a piece-rate system to varying conditions, there is in practice no difficulty in doing so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am deliberately giving those figures of the possibility of what a man can <Col N="806" /> earn if he is allowed to do it, what he can produce if he is allowed to produce it and, to the extent to which men desire to take advantage of that opportunity in this year or next year, that opportunity will be at their disposal.</P>
    <P>Various people fell foul, from different points of view, with the railway company in relation to their wagons. Some had seen the wagons empty and others had seen the wagons lying in demurrage.  The only thing that did strike me as remarkable was the amazing reaction of Deputy Davin to the suggestion that the sacrosanct design and structure of a railway wagon should be altered.  The suggestion that a nine-inch plank, or indeed anything, should be put up to destroy its perfect symmetry, seemed in some way to be outrageous.  Whether or not there is involved in this some high point of labour policy&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>Indeed, there is not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Then I do not understand, because I have always considered Deputy Davin a moderately intelligent man.  Let us now turn to the actual merits of the case.  If the railway company are in the position that they will not modernise their railway wagons for the purpose of dealing with turf, that they will not provide the large cubic capacity which is required to contain any real calorific value, then the railway company would be entirely wrong, whatever Deputy Davin thinks.  But we have no evidence that they are.  The whole of the evidence is to the contrary.  The Great Southern Railway Company has already increased the capacity of 50 trucks by adding to the height of the sides and , they are considering the similar adaptation of more according to a paper which I have no doubt Deputy Davin has heard of but never read.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>No, the <i>Irish Times.</i>  On the 27th May there was a photograph in that paper of this actual wagon in which they have, in my opinion, ingeniously and creditably attempted to meet the difficulties.  They have brought <Col N="807" /> the sides right up to the limit which it is possible to do, having regard to overhead gauges and tunnels and the like, by means of expanded wire.  But it stopped there because they ran out of expanded wire.  That is typical of a good many of the things that we were going to do.  We carry things up to a point and then we find the specific material we want is not there.  At the same time, they have increased the cubic capacity of a great many of their wagons and, as far as I know, they are prepared to modernise portion of their plant so as to make economically available the section devoted to that purpose. The ballast wagons with low sides, which were being used for turf and which caused so much horror to the two Deputies concerned&mdash;Deputy Morrissey and another&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I am not, and I think Deputy Morrissey would be very annoyed if I did.  I am not expressing any opinion between you.  These particular wagons were being utilised by the railway company to transport turf for the benefit of their employees. These wagons are usually in use for permanent way maintenance and they would otherwise be returning empty from the points where the ballast is deposited.  On this showing, so far as I can see, the railway company come out with a clean sheet.  The other suggestion is, that they have a grievance in the matter of demurrage on railway trucks.  All charges of that kind have to be added to the consumer; every lorry which has to wait to be loaded, every wagon which has to wait to be unloaded, adds to the cost to the community of the product which it carries.  It is the duty of every one of us to co-operate and watch right through the whole process to see that everyone of those wastes is eliminated. To any extent to which we can co-operate in doing that, it will be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some wild fit of imagination or inspiration&mdash;I do not know which&mdash;let loose Deputy Everett and Deputy Murphy with the statement that there never had been an enterprise in which <Col N="808" /> there was more red tape, more statistics or more of that type of complication than in this particular one.  I can only put against those two gentlemen, Deputy Morrissey and Brennan, who have asserted that there was none.  I am calling attention deliberately to the suggestion that has been made to the there have been obstruction and red tape in this matter.  I am speaking for the benefit of those who have had experience.  The county surveyors have done great work and given great service.  They have worked very hard. They are entitled to a good laugh, and a good laugh they will get when they are told that in this matter they? have experienced any red tape or any obstruction.  They have never functioned more freely in any activity in their lives than they did in this activity, into which they were called as a body.</P>

They will be able to act freely, and in those circumstances men are liable to make mistakes.  You can spend a whole lot of time securing yourself against the possibility of mistake.  So long as those who are working in this matter act in the exercise of reasonable judgment, we are responsible for their mistakes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>One other matter was raised by Deputy Mulcahy in a speech which, I think, was one of high value, and one which may mark even a landmark in the administration of this country.  Apart from whatever opinion one may have of systems of government, one may have hopes that a better, a more direct, a more flexible aad fluid administrative system could be adopted.  His ideal was one in which the man who is in charge would be, apparently, uncontrolled.  He did what, he liked without any regard to <Col N="809" /> interference by anybody.  In fact, Deputy Mulcahy went the absolute limit in claiming administrative independence for myself or anyone who might be in my position.  That is a system which might be evolved, but it is not something that can be injected overnight into the existing system.  I think that we want, in relation to this matter and to all matters in which you want work done at once, the highest possible responsibility and freedom of action in the hands of the man who is charged with the job, but, besides that in the actual practice of administration, you must have the most complete and fluid co-operation from all those other Departments with which he is in contact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, envisage this particular scheme for a moment.  We have to go to the Minister for Finance for finance, we have to go to the Minister for Industry and Commerce in relation to all questions of employment.  Trade Acts, and things of that kind.  Everything that we do is done in intimate contact with the administration system of the Department of Local Government and Public Health.  For anything we do we have to be in contact with the Department of Supplies.  It is obviously impossible that anyone could administer a turf rationing, control and distribution scheme and ignore the fact that the Minister for Supplies has exactly the same function in relation to coal.  We go on to hundreds of Land Commission bogs.  I have a letter from the Land Commission at the present moment pointing out to me the destruction which I am going to do over roads of a particular character and standard which they have set up for development, and asking me how we are both going to co-operate in getting that work done.  What I am pointing out is that, however ideal it may be that the man in charge of a job of this kind should be able to be absolute, clear, free and independent, it simply is not possible, in fact, as we are at present organised, and, therefore, what we must have is a combination between that personal responsibility of the head of the job and fluid and intimate co-operation with the other Departments. The process of evolution is going on, <Col N="810" /> of which this effort is one.  All that I can say is&mdash;and I have some experience now of the difficulties in matters of this kind&mdash;that I have never come across a case remotely approaching this in which those difficult co-operations have been so fully given.  It was a pleasure to go to another department to get their help.  It was given <i>can amore.</i>  The finances under which we are working, which left those little doubts and difficulties in the mind of Deputy Broderick: those improvisations and things of that kind, would only have been possible if the Ministry of Finance had been as fluid and as flexible in the provision of money for this purpose as it was conceivably possible to be.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am wondering ought I to interrupt the Deputy.  The last question that was raised by Deputy Mulcahy was in relation to Dublin and the supply of fuel for it.  He wanted to know who was responsible for calculating how much turf would have to go to Dublin.  That seems to me to be an inversion of the position.  This country has normally been supplied in its fuel necessities by coal and turf.  The turf areas have been asked to sacrifice the whole of their claim upon domestic coal in the interests of the eastern and non-turf counties.  That is the outstanding fact, that the turf counties up to the present have been asked to make and in my opinion have been prepared, from a sense of justice, to make that sacrifice.  There is no domestic coal available at the present moment in the turf areas, and those who have imposed that deprivation upon the turf areas have a corresponding obligation, an obligation to see that to the extent to which the turf areas are prepared to put their backs into it and to increase <Col N="812" /> their turf supplies, they shall, in the end, find themselves with a reasonable quantity of fuel.  What we have to estimate is what amount of turf is available, over the reasonable requirements of the turf areas, which will be available for the non-turf areas, in addition to the whole of the coal coming into the country for domestic purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. D. Morrissey Mr. D. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Mulcahy's question was based on the statement made here that it was probable th&amp;t there would be no domestic coal available, even for the City of Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite possible that that may be.  As the House knows, I am not trying to score any point in relation to this matter, and I certainly am not trying to put any gloss on what Deputy Mulcahy said.  I am getting gradually into the position in which I think there will be agreement.  It will, I think, be agreed that up to the present the turf areas have made a sacrifice, and that to the extent to which they can be legitimately safeguarded from the unfair consequences of that sacrifice, they are entitled to be safeguarded, and, therefore, it is not simply a question of calculating what the eastern counties must have, but what can be spared.  Assuming, however, that we did reach the position in which there was no fuel, or that the amount of fuel coming into the eastern counties were reduced to a very low level, in which the amount of fuel capable of being supplied was below a proper and reasonable limit, then the eastern areas, as part of the country, in the brotherhood which exists between the different parts of the country, would be entitled to go to those who had more fuel than they had, and ask them for a fair division.  Under these circumstances, that is what would be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not a prophet, and I do not know what is going to be the position in relation to fuel in January and February next.  At the moment I am not trying to bring turf into Dublin for sale.  Some turf for sale in Dublin will come in, but June, July and August are not the months in which the obligation rests upon me to take out of the exiguous pool any stated quantity for consumption.  We know the counties <Col N="813" /> now which are going to have a surplus over their reasonable requirements in the west and already an iron ration, and only an iron ration at the moment, is on its way.  It is on its way here for storage, so that it will be available at a time of necessity, and in order that we may ascertain, by practical test, the capacity of the transport system to take it, that we may find out what difficulties there may be in transporting larger quantities to cover, over a long period, the amount of turf which has to come.  In the end, I have no doubt that there will be a fair division, dependent upon the actual amount of alternative non-home-produced fuel available in eastern districts.</P>
    <P>My business is to be an honest broker in this matter.  I am entitled to see to it that one shall not stuff nor the other starve.  Our business is to see to it that, by taking time by the forelock, by making arrangements in advance, by estimating what both our resources and our necessities are, and trying to use the facilities we have, we may mitigate the hardship which I think, in spite of every effort, will still in some degree exist.  It is in that spirit that I say it is not the question of who is responsible for calculating how much Dublin needs that matters.  The matter first to be ascertained is how much Dublin can have, and I am quite sure that the turf areas will be as generous to Dublin and the eastern counties, to the boroughs and the congested districts of urban life, as it is possible for them to be.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not one of the analogies by which I should like it to be judged.  Deputy Crowley alleged that schemes for certain bog roads or roads for the development of bogs, which had come up from Kerry had been turned down.  The arrangement is that county surveyors, in relation to any application for drainage, roads or transport facilities into a bog, shall get the evidence of the use going to be made of these facilities, of the likely product as a result of them, and shall certify to the chief engineering adviser the cost of the road or drain and its probable productive consequences in <Col N="814" /> this year or next year.  The county surveyors are taken as acting as men with knowledge and with probity, practically automatically the grants are made, subject to the fact that there shall be an investigation to see that the money is properly spent, and that on the average those results are obtained.  I have been over a considerable number of the applications, and, from moving about the country and from my acquaintance with these districts, I have a very intimate knowledge of a great many of the cases coming up.  I am satisfied that, with the utmost promptitude and with great liberality, these demands are being met.  All I am prepared to do in relation to matters of that kind&mdash;the issue of petrol licences, the issue of transport licences, the provision of drains and roads&mdash;is to satisfy myself that the principle of administration in relation to the respective Departments is a sound principle, and then I am prepared to back the knowledge, the probity and the intelligence of the officers whom I have charged with that responsibility.  I am now giving formal notice that I am not going personally to examine the merits of particular applications.  I am going to satisfy myself that the principle upon which those things are being done is right and fair; otherwise the whole machine would be glued up.  I am satisfied at the moment that the administration is perfectly fair, that it is upon a sound and open principle in all those matters, and I am content.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I just want to finish on the only important note in this matter.  The obligation rests upon us, as your agents, exercising your authority and carrying out your will, to see that every possible preparation is made from now until next April for a campaign which will produce an amount of turf that will be, if possible, commensurate with the needs of next year.  But there is one portion of the work which we cannot do but which every one of you in co-operation can be enormously effective in doing, that is the work of getting this year, between now and the end of the first cutting season, and after that until the end of the third cutting season, <Col N="815" /> the highest possible production.  Let every man who has cut one harvest of turf regard it as a solemn obligation in honour to the people who are otherwise going to be cold, to the people who are otherwise going to be uncomfortable this winter, to see to it that by some means or other two or three harvests are cut for the people before April of next year.  There is no active defence of this country which is more effective.  When the Defence Forces came out to the bogs to cut turf they were doing defence work of the highest and most practical character.  You are called to the same duty.  You are called to go down into your own districts to organise everybody who has a bog face that is clear, to cut it, to organise everybody who has drying ground which is covered to clear it, to organise everybody who has an opportunity of contributing to the production of more fuel to make that contribution, not necessarily because he will want the fuel himself, not necessarily because he himself or his family might be cold, but because by so doing he may safeguard from that hardship the family of some other man</P>

      <P>While I will not say that the Parliamentary Secretary has deliberately misrepresented what I said last night, certainly the motives which inspired me to say what I did say last night must have been entirely misunderstood by him.  I did not say last night that an injustice was being imposed upon people such as farmers who were cutting their own turf in asking them to cut further turf, or that they ought not to be asked to cut further turf, or that they ought not to be asked to take time from their crops or from their leisure to do so.  What I did endeavour to point out was that in my opinion there were insurmountable obstacles in the way, that if the Parliamentary Secretary or the Taoiseach pinned his fate to that particular way of getting turf he would be depending upon a broken reed, and that if there were other ways open we ought to divert our entire strength to those other ways.  That was my point of <Col N="816" /> view.  I am all out with the Parliamentary Secretary in getting everybody to cut a second or third crop as far as they can do it, but I am afraid if we are depending upon that we are depending upon a broken reed.  By all means do it as far as you can.  I am with you in both ways.  Do not put me down as saying something which would discourage people from cutting two or three crops, but you will find when the returns come in that I am right.</P>

On our side, we promise that everything which organisation of a major character can do will be done, but we are satisfied that an enormous amount of work can be done by multiplying the possible efforts of men who might quite reasonably not do it.  We want people to be unreasonable in the sacrifices they will make not merely in cutting their own turf, but in organising everybody else in the same position.

      <P>On the question of the piece rates to which the Parliamentary Secretary referred, my colleagues and myself would like to get full particulars of the cases quoted by the Minister, and to examine them on their merits. Will the Parliamentary Secretary give us the full information which I know he has in connection with the cases he has quoted in Donegal and Mayo? I asked, for instance, for the number of hours per week worked in those cases, and the Parliamentary Secretary did not quote them.  If he is anxious, as I am sure he is, to get this system examined on its merits and applied in other areas, I am sure he will give the full particulars.</P>

What I am prepared to do for the Deputy is this: I am prepared to arrange for him or any of his colleagues to go to Donegal, and we will put him in contact with all the men who are working there, and let him get all the particulars from them.  Then he will see whether what I am saying is true&mdash; that those men are satisfied, that those men desire to continue, that those men would regard it as an outrage and a wrong if he or I were to attempt to interfere with their liberty to earn that money in that way, doing work for the benefit of the community.</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 62.</P>
    <P>To add at the end of the section a new sub-section as follows:</P>
    <P>(6) For the purposes of this section workmen may be classified by reference to a class to which they belong, by reference to an area in which they work, or by reference to such a class and such an area, and the word &ldquo;class&rdquo; shall be construed in this section accordingly.&mdash;(Minister for Industry and Commerce.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnLymbrickEsmonde" hpid="Mr. Esmonde Mr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment is a very important one from the point of <Col N="818" /> view of the interpretation of the whole section.  It is very important by reason of the vast powers which are to be given to this tribunal.  The word &ldquo;class&rdquo; appears, I think, in five different places in the section.  It always appears in the same context with the word &ldquo;particular&rdquo;.  Where the word &ldquo;class&rdquo; appears, there is always a reference to a &ldquo;particular class&rdquo;.  I think I can see what is behind or what is intended to be conveyed by it, but as it stands at present it is certainly very confusing, and I think it would be better, having regard to the large powers which this tribunal will have, and having regard to the fact that the word &ldquo;class&rdquo; is being more or less defined in this section, that there should be a definition of the words &ldquo;particular class&rdquo;.  I have written out here what I think the Minister intends to convey in this amendment, and if my interpretation of what I think he means is correct, then it would be better to have something like this, because the amendment, as it stands, is confusing.  I suggest that a sub-section something like the following would meet the case:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;In this section reference to a particular class of workmen shall be taken as including such particular class in general or the members of any such particular class working in a particular area.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I take it that that is the intention which the Minister has in mind in this sub-section, and that what he intends is that if there is a contest before the tribunal, that contest can take place between the members of any particular class of workmen in two different districts or even between the workmen of a particular class of workmen in one district, or that class of workmen in various districts.  I agree with a great deal of what has been put forward, to the effect that the proposed sub-section, as it stands, is extremely confusing. I think I know what the Minister has in mind, but it is very hard to define the word &ldquo;class&rdquo;.  I have looked it up in various dictionaries since this discussion started, and I find that there are many things to which the word might apply.  I find that one definition is that of a category&mdash;<Col N="819" /> being a class, or division, in any general scheme of classification.  I think it would be well if the Minister would adopt the suggestion I have made, because the proposed sub-section, as it stands, is very confusing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid that I cannot accept Deputy Esmonde's view of the proposed sub-section.  The sub-section is merely a machinery section, the purpose of which is to enable the tribunal to make a precise definition. It relates to the reference to a particular class in sub-section (1) and to the fact that the tribunal may make a determination in relation to workmen of a particular class under paragraph (c).  There is no difficulty, so far as the English language is apprehended in this House, in understanding what the word &ldquo;class&rdquo; means.  It means, briefly, a plurality of entities, whether persons, animals, things or ideas which have at least one characteristic in common.  Whatever be the classification, or whatever synonyms may be used, such as categories and so on, there must be one characteristic common to the whole group.  No matter what other difference there may be in the persons, ideas or entities, if they have at least one characteristic in common they constitute a class.  That is the basic definition of a class.  I think that is apprehended by all who understand the English language, and I am perfectly certain that the members of the tribunal would have no difficulty in apprehending what is meant by the section, even if some members of this House have a difficulty in apprehending what is meant by the word &ldquo;class&rdquo;.  I have said that the class or group or category&mdash;that congregation of persons, ideas or entities&mdash;must have at least one characteristic in common.  They may be red-headed men, or black-headed men,&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash; they may be tall men or short men, but they will all come under the heading of one particular class if they have one thing in common, such as belonging to one occupation or living in one particular <Col N="820" /> district.  But the definition of the word &ldquo;class&rdquo; should be obvious.  In the case of the human race, of course, it might be that there would be a difference to the extent that some men wore clothes, which would distinguish them from people who did not wear clothes and went around naked&mdash;like savages, in other words&mdash;but they all belong to the human race.  It seemed to me, Sir, that it should not be necessary to explain to some members of this House what we all apprehend by the conception of the word &ldquo;class&rdquo;.  As I said, when I intervened, prior to the adjournment of the debate, I find it hard to believe that it should be necessary to explain to members of this House what is commonly apprehended by the concept of a class. I found it almost impossible to believe that members who wasted so much of the time of this House were really talking seriously: that Deputy Mulcahy, for instance, was as dense as he pretended to be, or that Deputy Hurley, who happens to be a schoolmaster, could not appreciate what was meant by the word &ldquo;class&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All that this amendment proposes to do is to enable the tribunal, in making its determination, to state that determination with preciseness&mdash;to enable them to say that, if the facts which are adduced in the course of the application should satisfy them that it would be in the public interest to recognise the right of organised workingmen to follow a particular occupation, by reference, not merely to the occupation which they follow, but to the district in which they follow that occupation, it will be within the competence of the tribunal so to frame their determination upon the application before them that there will be no doubt that when they say, for instance, that a particular society alone has the right, or is going to have the right, in common, perhaps, with other organisations of organised workingmen following a particular vocation in Dublin to organise such workmen, their right to state that will not be challenged. That is all that this section proposes to do, and all these questions as to groups and classes are so many redherrings dragged in simply to prolong the debate.  There may be a society calling <Col N="821" /> itself the Cork Bakers' Society or the Dublin Bakers' Society, and the purpose of this section is to enable the tribunal to state, with the utmost possible preciseness, or at least with the necessary preciseness, what its determination is, so that there shall be little or no ground for challenging that determination afterwards.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. D. Morrissey Mr. D. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister claim that he is the only person who has the right to speak about the meaning of the English language?  It would not surprise me if he did make that claim.  Of course, the Minister says that no member of this House has a right to look at the Minister himself in connection with a Bill of which he is in charge.  A member of the Opposition dare not look at the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  The Minister is allowed to lecture us and to clarify our minds.  All I hope is that this tribunal, when it is set up, if it ever, and I am sure it will, wants to seek for some light as to the meaning of this proposed amendment, will not be unfortunate enough to come across the Minister's explanation of it.  The Minister used a lot of big words.  He talked about the fundamental definition of &ldquo;class&rdquo;; but he took very good care not to attempt to tell us what was the fundamental definition of &ldquo;class&rdquo;.  It is quite clear that the Minister himself has not the foggiest idea of what this amendment means. He has not the faintest notion of how or in what manner it will be interpreted, or can be interpreted, or in fact whether it can be interpreted in any sort of sensible way at all.  The only thing to be said for it is that it is on a par with every other section in the Bill and with most of the amendments introduced by the Minister.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>In connection with this amendment, I think I can speak on behalf of the average supporter of the Government in this House, and we have no difficulty in understanding this definition of the word &ldquo;class&rdquo;.  It is quite obvious that the word &ldquo;class&rdquo; must have, to some degree, a consequential meaning.  It cannot be too strictly defined, because, until the Bill operates, and until a merger of unions takes place, including those as a result of the deposit fee, it is impossible to tell in advance how unions are going to merge, whether by large classifications or small classifications; whether they will tend to divide up into area groups or remain as national groups, or become national groups from area groups.  There is so much latitude allowed by the Minister in this Bill as to the manner in which the trade union movement may act as a result of its operation, that it is obviously impossible to give a limited, strict definition of the word &ldquo;class&rdquo;.  In other words, this sub-section gives power to the tribunal to decide whether, for example, as a result of representations made in connection with industries dealing with the treatment of grain generally, and after hearing all the evidence, they will make a special class for grain milling, or whether they will merge grain milling with baking; whether, again, they will have a Dublin area for grain milling, a Dublin area for bakers, and a rest of Ireland area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The whole basis of the sub-section is that the effect of the Bill has to be watched by the tribunal, both in respect to the evidence given to them, as a result of applications by certain trade unions for representation, and also the evidence they will gain in watching the Bill operating as regards the limitations on trade unions arising from the payment of the deposit, and a careful study of the situation.  They will have to make up their mind how to arrange these classifications.  Having studied in the International Labour Office journals for the past five or six years, the legislation of this type which has taken place in about 14 non-totalitarian countries, with, apparently, the consent and general approval of the population of those countries, I do not <Col N="823" /> think there is any need to be quite sanguine that this Bill, when passed, will not require further amendment.  So far as I can make out from studying those journals, inevitably, because it is part of a human problem, changes are bound to be necessary.</P>
    <P>It may be that at a certain point this sub-section will have to be defined more definitely.  The Minister may find, in 1944, for example, after the tribunal has been in operation for a certain time, after the deposit limitations have their effect on the grouping of trade unions, that certain anomalies will have arisen, that there may have been certain classifications created that perhaps are not in the interest of the State; that there may be a certain amount of unfairness, not through the malevolent action of any tribunal, but because legislation dealing with human groupings may be faulty at times, and the Minister may come in with a number of amending Bills to correct certain things which have arisen.  To my mind, as the definition of &ldquo;class&rdquo; must be a consequential one, the tribunal must use their best judgment as to how to group those unions.  I think it is clear to members on this side of the House what the Minister is aiming at.</P>

      <P>There is no doubt that, both before the adjournment of the Committee Stage and since, there has been a deliberate endeavour to bait the Minister, to put it frankly.  I have examined both the section and the amendment.  They are throwing a difficult job on the tribunal, but they are doing that because the Trade Union Congress themselves failed to do the job.  They endeavoured to classify the unions, and they could not get agreement amongst themselves.  It is because they could not get agreement amongst themselves that this Bill has to be brought in and this particular section and the amendment to it put in, and nobody knows that better than the Deputies who have spoken here. I have it here in the 45th annual report of the Irish Trade Union Congross.</P>

They considered that was absolutely necessary and yet, when we try to do it here by means of a tribunal, Deputies want to know what is the meaning of &ldquo;classification&rdquo; and what is the meaning of &ldquo;class&rdquo;.  If Deputies wish to carry on the game of holding up business here, I will not prevent them.</P>

      <P>I am sure the House is very gratified, and on these benches we are particularly, to receive such a very timely lecture from such an order-loving member of this House, one who has the dignity of the House so near his heart on all occasions.  Now that we have benefited by that lecture and, presumably, are duly chastened, we might return again to the question of getting some definition of that very peculiar word &ldquo;class&rdquo; in this section.  The Minister spoke, and I am not sure that we would not have been better off if, on this particular matter at least, he was silent, because it seemed to me that anything the Minister said did not make the position a bit clearer; indeed, he seemed all the time to make the position much more vague and indefinite. The Minister was ponderous and profound on this matter, but in the end he was delightfully vague and indefinite.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think Deputy Childers unwittingly, as on former occasions, let the cat out of the bag because, if I sum up his statement correctly, it was that the question of defining &ldquo;class&rdquo; must be left to the tribunal; in other words, we are not going to know and we will not be permitted to decide what we are putting into this Bill.  We are merely putting in a vague term that is to be interpreted and directed in any way that a tribunal not yet appointed may <Col N="827" /> decide.  The appointment of the tribunal is entirely in the hands of the Minister.  It seems to me that this section makes it clear that the purpose is to regiment the organised workers. It makes it very clear that the official viewpoint is that they have to be watched, and this section will make sure, so far as possible, that when the Bill is in operation, if it ever is in this country, the workers are going to be as effectively shackled as the Minister and the tribunal can arrange.</P>

      <P>I have not taken part in the debate on this Bill since it was considered on Second Reading.  I objected to the principle of the Bill then, and I have taken very little interest in it since.  I should like to emphasise, however, that this amendment to Section 21, and the explanations of the Minister, make the position more confused.  The mere fact that the Minister found it necessary to introduce this amendment is clear proof that the section originally was not to his satisfaction.  I have a vivid recollection of certain words that occurred in, I think, the Shops (Conditions of Employment) Act and, when that measure was being considered, if a Deputy asked whether or not a bread-cart was a shop, he would be laughed at, yet the judges on circuit and some judges of the High Court expressed different opinions on the point whether or not a bread-cart was a shop.  It involved great expense and meant considerable inconvenience to the people engaged in that particular business.</P>

    <P>This word &ldquo;class&rdquo; may give rise to similar differences of opinion.  I am ruled more by common sense than by Acts of Parliament.  I am ruled more by the old saying that the best form of education is observation, and my common sense tells me that there can be great difference of opinion as to the real meaning of the word &ldquo;class&rdquo;.  I know perfectly well that until this Bill is in operation neither the Minister nor any member of the House can give a proper definition of the word &ldquo;class&rdquo;. It has been alluded to by Deputy Childers because, under certain sections, before members of a union can appear as a class they must fulfil certain <Col N="828" /> conditions.  Possibly many of those unions that come under the heading of a class will be wiped out, and to that extent it may be easy to define what a class really is; but at the moment I would like to put a proposition to the Minister.  Take the members of the Building Trades Federation, which is comprised of carpenters, bricklayers, plasterers, plumbers and all the other people who earn their living through building.  Which of those would come within a common class?  As I see it, if that trade union was set up to-morrow it is one of those particular classes that could appear before the tribunal and say that it was the class that must cater for the building trade.  Unskilled labourers could come along and say that they were numerous enough to cater for carpenters and bricklayers.  You would have a fine position then.  How is the tribunal to put a proper interpretation on the word that is in this section?  Is it to do that when all the trade unions have been wiped out, and when you have only one big union in Dublin? The big union will then possibly determine that question.  I have great difficulty in knowing what is the meaning of this word &ldquo;class&rdquo;.  The tribunal might say, before it considered an application from a particular class, that a certain number belonging to that class should have red hair and some other number brown hair. This word could be interpreted in many directions.  Neither the Minister's explanation nor, if I may say so without offence, the explanations given by some of the Deputies, have satisfied me as to what this word may mean.  Every Deputy knows how difficult the interpretation of words in the section of an Act can become.  Take the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; in the Dance Halls Act, and think of all the litigation it has been responsible for. It may be said that M.P's. in the old days, just as Deputies to-day, wasted their time in discussing these things, but yet judges in the High and Supreme Courts have had to spend days and days trying to come to a decision on the meaning of words in Acts of Parliament, and after all their deliberations their decisions might not <Col N="829" /> be unanimous.  There might be three for and two against, so that with a majority decision the position was left unsatisfactory.  The discussion on this has been rather prolonged, but after it all I am still not convinced that a proper definition of the word &ldquo;class&rdquo; has been given to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make the point that I endeavoured to make on an earlier section.  It seems to me that the Minister has been particularly clumsy in the drafting of this amendment because it is phrased in such a way as to cause every possible kind of doubt.  We are giving the tribunal wide powers to decide what is a class for the purpose of trade union organisation in the country.  I can foresee considerable litigation arising out of the clumsy way in which an attempt is being made in this amendment to define that word.</P>
      <P>The tribunal may decide, for instance, in respect of the Province of Connacht, that certain people organised in one of the counties there are a class for the purposes of this section, but, in the case of Munster, it may decide that it takes all that type of worker in the whole province to be a class.  In regard to Leinster, the tribunal may give one meaning to &ldquo;class&rdquo; in respect to Dublin City, another in respect to the County Dublin, and yet another in respect to the Province of Leinster as a whole.  I am not concerned with whether the Minister does this efficiently or not, but if he wants to do it efficiently, he ought not to leave this in its present unsatisfactory position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Corry insists on referring to the memoranda which were prepared by members of the special Trade Union Congress.  The position in that connection was that 12 people were constituted a commission by the Trade Union Congress to report whether a reorganisation in the trade union movement was necessary.  Of the 12 members appointed, 11 signed reports.  Five signed one memorandum, five signed another, and one signed another. Memorandum I, which the Minister quoted from, had not the support of the majority of the members of that commission.  I, personally, disagreed with the reorientation of the trade <Col N="830" /> union movement as envisaged in Memorandum I, because I felt that the folk who signed it were getting too far ahead of the procession, and that when you do that you very often lose your procession.  I felt on that particular occasion that they were taking big steps that other folk were not prepared to take.  I felt that, in that way, they would get completely out of touch with the movement, and not be able to bring about the reorganisation that I desired to see.  Anyway, no matter what may be said against Memorandum I, there was obviously some foresight in it which is not visible in this Bill. When the authors of Memorandum I decided on a reorganisation of the trade union movement, they suggested, for instance, the creation of industrial organisations.  They suggested a type of organisation under which the entire trade union movement would be grouped into ten groupings, but they did not go on to define &ldquo;class&rdquo; for the purpose of getting into those groups.  They simply took the unions which were already there in certain occupations, and said the members of these unions were to amalgamate.  They did not go out on the foolish expedition that we are starting on in this amendment, to define in this vague way what &ldquo;class&rdquo; is for the purpose of its grouping a particular organisation.  It found a certain number of unions and, having examined their structure, said they were to be put into different categories, each category then to be amalgamated.  We are not doing that. We are creating here the muddiest possible definition of what &ldquo;class&rdquo; is. It will be possible under this for the tribunal to give one definition of &ldquo;class&rdquo; for Dublin, and another for Cork and Waterford, with dissimilar features about &ldquo;class&rdquo; generally.</P>
    <P>I object to the tribunal being given power, without any check over it, to do that.  I object in particular to the tribunal getting power to decide a matter of that kind without first indicating to it the general principles which Parliament thinks it ought to follow.  We are not giving the tribunal any directions on this matter at all. We are merely putting in a vague definition of class so that the tribunal will have all the power it wishes to exercise <Col N="831" /> in coming to any judgment it likes as to what in its opinion constitutes a class.  This, in my opinion, is a very bad amendment.  I venture to say that if, arising out of this legislation, there <Col N="832" /> is ever an appeal to the courts, the interpretation of this particular amendment is one on which a good deal of money, and a good deal of energy, will be needlessly expended.</P>

    <P>Amendment declared carried.</P>
    <P>Question proposed : &ldquo;That Section 21, as amended, stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>This section opens with the statement:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Subject to the provisions of this section, where application is made to the tribunal by a trade union which claims to have organised a majority of workmen of any particular class for a determination that such trade union alone shall have the right to organise workmen of that class, the tribunal, after hearing such application and having considered all the circumstances of the case, shall do certain things.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="833" /> The phrase &ldquo;by a trade union which claims to have organised a majority of workmen&rdquo; seems to me very peculiar, because nowhere in the section or in the Bill is any provision made for testing the claim of an organisation that it has in fact organised a majority of the workers.  It is possible presumably under this section for a trade union to make an application to the tribunal, basing its application solely on the grounds that it claims to represent the majority of the workmen in that particular class.  There is no machinery in the section or in the Bill by which its claim in that respect can be tested. Therefore, I take it that it is possible for an organisation to submit an application based upon that claim, without having previously furnished any evidence to the tribunal or having obtained a certificate from anybody, that it does in fact represent the majority of the workers of the particular class in the organisation, of which it seeks to have a monopoly.  I should like if the Minister would clear up that aspect of the matter, and say whether he has ever thought of conceiving some type of machinery by which a test of that kind might be applied.  In subsection (2) of Section 21 it is provided that:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Before granting under this section a determination that a particular trade union shall alone have the right to organise workmen of a particular class, the tribunal may, if it thinks proper, require such trade union to satisfy the tribunal that the grant of such determination will not affect adversely any rights or claims to benefits enjoyed for the time being by any of such workmen as members of a trade union.</P>
    <P>The authors of this Bill apparently felt that, before granting a determination, the trade union which made the application should satisfy the tribunal that the making of a determination would not adversely affect the claims of members of that union or another union to certain types of benefit in which they had perhaps accrued vested interests, but, instead of putting that obligation definitely on the tribunal, the words used in the section are that <Col N="834" />&ldquo;the tribunal may, if it thinks proper, require such trade union&rdquo; to produce evidence.  If it is desirable that there should be no adverse effects upon the rights of trade unionists to benefits which they had previously enjoyed, surely it is desirable that there should be a definite obligation put upon the tribunal to require the trade union to show, before getting a determination, that in fact the making of the determination would not adversely affect the welfare of other trade unions over which the applicant trade union was seeking to secure a monopoly.  I think the Minister might tell us why he has felt it desirable to give this tribunal a discretion in the matter of making that requirement.  He might tell us why there is not a definite obligation on the tribunal to ensure that that test is imposed on the trade union and satisfied by the trade union.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. D. Morrissey Mr. D. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Second Reading of this Bill I described it as a dangerous Bill, a Bill which in my opinion was bound to bring not peace in industry or peace in the trade union movement itself, but was bound to bring trouble in both.  Of all the dangerous sections of the Bill from that point of view this section now before the House is the most dangerous. We are told that the object of the Bill is to prevent inter-union disputes, to secure peace and harmony amongst trade unions, and in that way to secure peace and harmony in industry in the country.  This section, if it were deliberately framed for the purpose, could not be more effective in setting trade unions at each other's throats.  A union may go before the tribunal and ask for a determination that it is the only union which has the right to organise certain classes of workers.  Let me give an example.  The dockers or the port workers here in the City of Dublin are organised, I think, in four different unions&mdash;the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union, the Amalgamated Transport and General Workers' Union, the Workers' Union of Ireland, and the Seamen and Port Workers' Union.  I do not know which of the four unions has the majority of the dockers or the port workers, and <Col N="835" /> for the purposes of my argument it does not matter, but one of them goes before this tribunal and gets a determination that it, or if you like, two of them, are the only unions that have the right to organise the dockers.  Does anyone in his senses who knows anything about conditions in this country, who knows anything about trade union or labour conditions, think that is going to lead to harmony?</P>
      <P>Does not anybody who knows anything whatever about actual conditions know that it is going to lead to an immediate fight?  I have consistently opposed this Bill for one reason &mdash;because I am absolutely convinced that it is going to bring about more turmoil, more disunity and more bitterness in the trade union movement, and, as a consequence, in the industrial organisation of the country, than was ever thought of by the Minister. It could have no other effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister, of course, is assuming, and other members of the House, including Deputy Childers, have assumed with him, that whatever inter-union rivalries there were, whatever disputes were caused and continue as a result of inter-union rivalry, were caused exclusively by the small unions.  That is not all in accordance with the facts, as anybody who has any knowledge whatever of the trade union world knows; but what the Minister is going to do by that deposit system and by this section is to set up two large armies in this country.  I can see the position which will arise.  I can see the reason behind the Bill.  I am not accusing the Minister of being responsible for this, but I can see, lined up on one side, the people outside who are sponsoring this Bill quietly if not vocally, who are strongly behind the Bill, who want the Bill.  I can see those men on one side.  I can see every union that is going to be wiped out when this Bill becomes law, and many members of other unions, rallying behind another trade union leader.  Then we have all the elements for a first class battle.  The Minister and employers, either inside this House or outside it, who are foolish enough to think that <Col N="836" /> this Bill&mdash;and particularly the operations of this section&mdash;is going to bring peace or harmony are living in a fool's paradise.  By passing this section they are not only doing a grave injustice to the vast majority of the workers of this country, but a grave injustice to the country itself.  We have been accused of deliberate obstruction and of delaying time.  As far as I am concerned. I deny that absolutely.  We tried in the most reasonable way possible to help matters in the beginning by suggesting reasoned amendments on the Second Stage of the Bill.  By every means at our disposal within the orders of the House we have tried to convince the Minister that he was on the wrong road.  We have tried, to the best of our ability, to make the Bill less dangerous, but the Minister has refused to listen to reason.  If the House passes this section of the Bill it will lead not to unity but to disunity, not to peace but to discord, and instead of wiping out whatever bitterness and hatreds that may exist, you are going to accentuate them and bring on, not only a battle, but a series of battles and fights&mdash;not of worker against employer, but of trade union against trade union and worker against worker.  That is a state of affairs that would be deplorable in any circumstances, but that it should occur in the present period of emergency is something that we should shudder at.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, this Bill has been introduced by a Minister who is absolutely wedded to it, who will not listen to reason or accept suggestions from anybody, and who, apparently, has made up his mind that those who do not see eye to eye with him are dishonest in their views.  It is because some of us see what the reactions to this Bill are going to be, because we see, or foresee, if you like, the consequences that will flow from the passage of this Bill, that we have contested every section of the Bill.  It is many years since a Bill was contested in this House in the way in which this Bill has been contested, and that, in itself, should give the Minister cause to think. Why have members of this House adopted that attitude on this Bill and, <Col N="837" /> particularly, on this section?  It is because we are afraid of it and of its consequences and because we see clearly&mdash; far more clearly than the Minister does, apparently&mdash;that, far from bringing the peace that he expects the Bill will bring, it is going to bring turmoil and strife.</P>

      <P>One would think&mdash; and in saying this I do not wish to cast any reflection on the sincerity of the Deputy who has just spoken&mdash;one would think, from what he said, that hitherto all had been peace and harmony in the Irish trade union movement.</P>

      <P>I am saying that it is only on that hypothesis that there could be any validity in the arguments submitted by the Deputy to the House. This, however, is not a case where we find co-operation, good feeling and harmony prevailing among trade unions or where we are now, deliberately and without forethought, endeavouring to disturb it.  On the contrary, we find a position in the Irish trade union movement which is deplored by every member of that movement and which is deplored by the organisation which can speak for the movement as a whole. That is admitted.  I have here the Forty-first Annual Report of the Irish Trade Union Congress.  It is the report for 1934-35, and in paragraph 151 of that report the responsible executive, controlling this congress of the trade union movement in Ireland, which is the congress to which not only our Irish trade unions are affiliated but to which other trade unions, having their headquarters in Great Britain, are affiliated, we find this considered and deliberate expression of opinion as to the condition of affairs which then existed and which still exists in the Irish trade union movement.  I am quoting from paragraph 151 of the report to which I have referred, which is as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;In the opinion of the National Executive the time has arrived when a more orderly state of affairs should be called into existence among the existing trade unions to prevent any <Col N="838" /> further disruption into warring competitive sections.  Disintegration must lead to demoralisation and invite an attack by the employers on wages and conditions of employment.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The National Executive feel a duty devolves on them to call attention to the disintegrating circumstances which are manifesting themselves in the trade union movement throughout the country leading to an absence of harmony and unity, and, hence, they are anxious to promote understandings where similar and competitive unions exist.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>They go on then to recommend that a body should be set up under the aegis of the Irish Trade Union Congress itself which should consider, among other matters, the action which should be taken &ldquo;in relation to the inception of a new union or member thereof within the industry whose existence is, or is calculated to injure or prejudice an existing recognised union&rdquo;.  The report then goes on to say:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The National Executive are very definitely of the opinion that some type of machinery of the above character is essential to bring into existence those ordered conditions of movement so vitally necessary to the successful prosecution of advances and resistance to attacks in the industrial struggle; the advantage of expert industrial group advice will bring co-ordination to the councils of the several union executives enabling them to present to the united industrially organised employers a solid unified union front.</P>
    <P>The prevention of the rise of undisciplined so-called trade unions at the instigation of every individual who considers he has a grievance against an existing union will not be the least useful effect of the machinery proposed above.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In consequence of that, the National Executive of the Irish Trade Union Congress called a special conference on the 25th April, 1936, and the Commission of Inquiry, which has been referred to in the course of the discussions on this Bill, was set up, and in confirming the action of the special <Col N="839" /> conference in setting up that Commission of Inquiry, the National Executive of the Irish Trade Union Congress, in their report for 1935-36, made the following comments:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The trade union movement has now secured an important and responsible position in the economic life of the country&mdash;a position which tends to develop in responsibility yearly.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is a statement in which I concur without any reservation.  The National Executive then goes on to say:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;A complete stocktaking is desirable and the decision of the special conference is a happy indication that newer and better methods are required, and that when they are promulgated as a result of the inquiries of the commission, they will secure endorsement, and be translated as soon as possible into concrete realisation.  If this work is carried through successfully, we shall have much for which to be thankful; we shall have lightened our burden when we have left behind us those corroding domestic quarrels which vitiate our energies and dissipate our means, and with confidence in our new strength we shall reach much higher attainments than those that have already crowned our efforts.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The evidence, the testimony, of the National Executive of the Irish Trade Union Congress was confirmed by the proceedings of the Commission of Inquiry.  One of the memoranda, or as in Parliamentary parlance we would, perhaps, more properly describe it, one of the reports which emanated from this Commission of Inquiry stated:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Furthermore, it must be remembered that the internecine quarrelling of the trade unions weakens them, not alone physically, but it also vitiates them morally.  This great evil can never be eradicated while the organic existence of the trade unions is confined to and dictated by the accidental divisions of trade, commerce or occupation.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I have quoted that simply to show, because I think it does show, that even <Col N="840" /> in the year 1938-39 the condition of affairs which was described in the 42nd Report of the Trade Union Congress still persisted.  There is a further confirmation of its existence to be found in the other memoranda or reports which emanated from that commission. We have, for instance, the report of the leader of the Labour Party, Deputy Norton himself, who stated:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I would welcome a reorganisation of the unions with a view to avoiding the wasteful overlapping and baneful jealousy and rivalry which exist to-day.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I have quoted the passage which substantiates my statement that there is not and has not been for a considerable number of years that peace and harmony which is the only logical basis for the argument which Deputy Morrissey addressed to the House.  He has proceeded, I think, on the assumption that this tribunal would have a disturbing influence on the trade union movement; that it would intensify those animosities; that it would increase the bitternesses, and that it would promote the internecine strife which experienced members of the trade union movement have themselves admitted to exist already.</P>
      <P>But what was the remedy for this deplorable condition of affairs which responsible trade unionists themselves recommended?  What was the recommendation in the memorandum, which, I think, was signed by five persons who were representatives of trade unions having their headquarters in this country, trade unions which might be concisely and popularly described as Irish trade unions on the Commission of Inquiry?  Those gentlemen, all of them holding responsible positions in the trade union movement, all of them with national records of which any of us might be proud, recommended:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;There shall be established by the National Executive an Industrial Court of seven members, of which three shall form a court at any time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;In appointing the court the National Executive shall, as far as <Col N="841" /> possible, select only members who, by their training, previous experience and general ability, are considered suitable to perform the duties with which the court may be charged.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It shall be the duty of the court to deal with and adjudicate in matters connected with inter-union disputes.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Where two or more unions cater for similar groups of workers in the same concern, no union shall present a demand regarding rates of pay, hours of duty or conditions of service without first informing the other unions directly affected.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I am not quoting this verbatim; I am quoting extracts from it.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Industrial Court shall not order any union to call its members out on strike although it may make a recommendation to that effect.  It may decide that a demand made by a particular union in an industry in which other unions are involved is anreasonable or impracticable and recommend that no strike in support of such demand should take place.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Where disputes in connection with a question of demarcation arise, no general stoppage of work may take place until after discussion between the unions concerned and, failing agreement, submission of the question in issue to the Industrial Court.  The finding of the court shall be binding on all concerned.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Complaints regarding &lsquo;poaching&rsquo; or &lsquo;transference of members&rsquo; shall, in the first instance, be dealt with between the unions concerned, and, failing agreement, submitted for the consideration of the court.  The acceptance of members shall remain in abeyance until the court has issued its decision.  In arriving at a decision the court shall have regard to all the circumstances, and particularly to the ability of the respective unions to cater effectively for the workers in question.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The court may decide that, on and from a given date, particular groups of workers in concerns where competition between unions exists <Col N="842" /> shall be recruited (as far as new members are concerned) only by a particular union or unions, always having regard to the ability of the selected union or unions to cater effectively for the workers involved.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Affiliated unions for which special services are performed by the court shall be charged such fees for same as may be fixed by the court, with the approval of the National Executive.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The National Executive, with the approval of Congress, shall prescribe the penalties, including cancellation of affiliation, which may be imposed for failure to abide by or give effect to decisions or findings of the court.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Where a trade dispute, either actual or prospective, is likely to affect directly or indirectly a union or unions primarly involved in such dispute, the Industrial Court may call for a statement of all the facts and order or recommend such action as may be considered necessary in the circumstances, subject to the provisions of section (f).&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I have cited all the matters which the memorandum recommended should be dealt with by the Industrial Court which it suggested should be set up by the Executive of the Irish Trade Union Congress.  I think I have quoted sufficient to suggest that this was a practical, patriotic, and statesmanlike document. In that connection I should like to emphasise that among the other matters which it was specifically recommended this court should deal with was this problem of the organisation of workers in overlapping unions, and that the report recommended that the court, in relation to that problem, should be given power to decide that.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;...on and from a given date, particular groups of workers in concerns where competition between unions existed shall be recruited (as far as new members are concerned), only by a particular union or unions, always having regard to the ability of the selected union or unions to cater effectively for the workers involved.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is precisely what is proposed in <Col N="843" /> Section 21 of the Bill.  We are striving to give effect to a recommendation which was made in a report submitted to the Irish Trade Union Congress by the representatives of the Irish trade unions.</P>

      <P>I am glad that the Deputy reminded me&mdash;in fact, this memorandum was not turned down by the congress.  But the congress was jockeyed by the vested interests which are concerned to thwart and defeat any attempt to reorganise the Irish trade union movement into a position where the memorandum was never submitted to a vote of the special conference called to consider the report of the Commission of Inquiry.</P>

That report will be found in the Library, and the proceedings at that conference can be studied by every member of the House.  I am certain that when Deputies consider the proceedings, and realise how this earnest and sincere attempt to cure the abuses which exist within the Irish trade union movement was defeated, they will give short shrift to those who <Col N="844" /> have taken up an obstructive and vexatious attitude towards this Bill.</P>

For Mr. Marchbank's resolution there were 85,211 votes cast, and against the resolution there were 70,836 votes cast.  That is to say, there were 21 unions for the motion and 18 against.  Here is an extract from the official report of the proceedings of this special conference:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Chairman: I declare the motion carried.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Mr. W. J. Whelan (D.T.P.S.): As a further resolution I move: That the principle of amalgamation or grouping as set out in Memorandum I be approved by this conference.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Chairman: I cannot accept that.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Mr. W. O'Brien: You gave me an undertaking that such a motion would be taken.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>There is an echo of an historic controversy in what follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Chairman: The vote was between Document No. 1 and 2.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Mr. O'Brien's rejoinder to that was &ldquo;No&rdquo;, and the report proceeds:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Chairman: I gave the assurance that the vote would be between Memorandum I and II.  The vote we took was the substitution of one document for another.  The proposal was that we should approve of the proposals set out in Memorandum II to the extent that they referred to Item (1) of the terms of reference. My interpretation is that Document <Col N="846" /> No. 2 is substituted for No. 1 to the extent set out in the resolution.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Mr. O'Brien: I want to state definitely that I only took part in the vote on the distinct understanding that there would be a second vote on Memorandum I.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Chairman: The motion substituting one document for another was voted on.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Mr. O'Brien: As a protest against your ruling, I withdraw from this meeting.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Mr. O'Brien then left the hall accompanied by some other delegates.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Mr. Marchbank having asserted the control of the English trade unions over this special conference of the Irish trade union movement, then, Sir, no less than four other resolutions from this conference were adopted.</P>

The English trade unions with, as I have said, the vested interests which have been battening upon the Irish trade union movement, succeeded in defeating this attempt on the part of the Irish trade union movement to cure abuses.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I have indicated that these abuses are generally admitted to <Col N="847" /> exist within the Irish trade union movement.  I have told the House of the recommendations which the Irish trade unions made as to the method by which these abuses might be remedied. Now, there might have been some difference of opinion in the Irish trade union movement, and at this special conference, as to the extent of the reorganisation which was necessary if the abuses were to be cured, but there was no difference of opinion as to what steps were necessary to deal with this question of overlapping and internecine jealousy: there was no difference of opinion that it was essential, if these abuses were to be remedied, that some sort of a tribunal should be set up. Even the English trade unions, who submitted Memorandum No. II, indicated agreement with the proposal contained in Memorandum No. I, covering item 2&mdash;that is the provision of arbitration machinery for inter-union disputes, and even Deputy Norton, whose report is a splendid exhibition of political tight-rope walking, was constrained to say that he was in general agreement with the recommendation on the subject of machinery for the settlement of inter-union disputes.  He said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;These disputes, where they result in strikes in which wages and working conditions are not at issue, do serious damage to the trade union movement.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I suppose, in view of that statement &mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The resolution was, in fact, to throw over Memorandum I.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>What was that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I prefer to concentrate upon this question of the tribunal. <Col N="848" /> I have indicated that even Deputy Norton was constrained to agree with the recommendation that machinery for the settlement of inter-union disputes should be established, and he went on to add&mdash;pointing the moral to adorn the tale:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;These disputes when they result in strikes in which wages and working conditions are not at issue do serious damage to the trade union movement.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I presume, in view of that statement, that Deputy Norton will not be prepared to challenge my assertion that in fact inter-union disputes arising not out of questions of wages or conditions of employment have taken place and resulted in strikes which have seriously dislocated some of the major industries of this country.  But, in any event, we have here this position that, following these attempts of the Irish trade union movement to set its house in order, following the universal admission that inter-union disputes do grave and serious damage, not only to the trade union movement but to the country as a whole, the attempt to secure that reorganisation was defeated by the English trade unions, headed by the big guns or big lions or big noises, or whatever you like to call them, the brass hats, who came over here to ensure that the Irish trade union movement would continue to be organised as they wanted it.  Because of the fact that they succeeded in thwarting what I have described as the patriotic efforts of honest Irishmen concerned for the welfare of their country and for the welfare of their class to secure this reorganisation, we find that the trade union movement is to-day without this tribunal, or a tribunal of any kind, which they all admit to be necessary if peace and harmony are eventually to be brought about inside the movement. I have the responsibility on me of trying to secure peace and harmony in industry in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I have found, in the short period in which I have been Minister for Industry and Commerce, <Col N="849" /> that this inter-union strife is a frequent source of grave danger to our whole industrial economy.  Since the trade union movement has shown itself unwilling to tackle this problem, I am constrained, by a sence of my responsibility to Parliament and to the country as a whole, to provide a tribunal which will do as the Irish report submitted to the special conference suggested:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That on and from a given date particular groups of workers in concerns where competition between unions exists shall be recruited (as far as new members are concerned) only by a particular union or unions, always having regard to the ability of the selected union or unions to cater effectively for the workers involved.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I am proposing here to set up a tribunal which will be, I think, a fair tribunal, a judicial tribunal, a tribunal representing all the interests involved, to allow any authorised trade union, and no other interest or party which claims to present the demands of Irish workers in relation to the fixing of wages and conditions of employment, to apply to it for a determination that, if necessary, &ldquo;on and from a given date&rdquo; that particular trade union will be entitled to organise the workers in a particular class and in, perhaps, a particular area in this country. Because the Irish trade union movement has failed to do it itself, I am giving effect to this constructive proposal which was submitted to the special conference of the Irish Trade Union Congress.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, there has been a suggestion here that in some way or other I am legalising the English trade unions under this Bill.  Well, I have no apology to make for the action which I am asking the House to take in relation to these particular trade unions. I have no apology to make to the House, because what I am doing is to bring these trade unions, with headquarters outside this country, within the ambit of our law.  At the present moment, these trade unions are over and above our law; these trade unions are outside our law; these trade unions, <Col N="850" /> some of them, have been responsible for strikes and disputes, not arising upon rates of wages or conditions of employment, but upon the right of an Irish tradesman to secure employment in his own city at his own trade.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>They did not hold them up&mdash;Irishmen in them did.  I am speaking of what has happened in this country in recent years.  Not so very long ago, three or four years ago, a dispute arose in a certain Irish city as to whether an Irishman, a carpenter, trying to get a job, would be employed on a certain contract, if he belonged to an Irish trade union.  The contract happened to be work of military importance&mdash;a contract to provide accommodation which would be of great value to this country in the circumstances in which we find ourselves now.  This dispute dragged on and at last, at the request of the Department of Defence, the Department of Industry and Commerce intervened and ultimately a court of inquiry was set up.  The terms of reference of this court were the consideration of the causes and circumstances of the trade dispute between the Amalgamated Society of Woodworkers and the Irish National Union of Woodworkers, in respect of the employment of certain persons in Cork and any matters connected therewith or relevant thereto. It is perhaps not without significance that the leader of this agitation in Dublin against the Trade Union Bill is also a member of the Amalgamated Society of Woodworkers, so that we had Mr. Marchbank at the special conference and we have Deputy Keyes and Deputy Davin of the National Union of Railwaymen in the House.</P>

The court further added that the problem of the multiplication of trade unions might be immediately considered by a body appointed for the purpose.  The report of this court of inquiry was tabled on 14th November, 1937.  On 10th November, 1937, a copy of the report was sent to the disputant parties, and, in a covering letter, the Minister for Industry and Commerce urged that the recommendations of the court should be accepted and stated that he would be glad to be so informed.  On the 18th November, the National Union of Woodworkers, the Irish union, wrote accepting the report.

On 13th November, the <Col N="853" /> Amalgamated Society of Woodworkers, the English union, wrote acknowledging receipt of the letter of 10th idem, stating that the recommendations would have the consideration of the Executive Council and that its decision would be sent in due course.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>No satisfactory communication was forthcoming, and eventually the Minister wrote a letter stating that he could not accept certain suggestions made by the Amalgamated Society of Woodworkers, since he was satisfied that the Amalgamated Society of Woodworkers were the prime movers in the dispute and were the cause of its continuance.  On 24th December, 1937, the Amalgamated Society of Woodworkers sent back a reply, which I can only describe as impertinent, but which I propose to read to the House, in order that not merely the House but Irish trade unionists and the country in general may understand the attitude towards an Irish Government which lies behind this agitation against the present Bill. The letter is addressed from the Amalgamated Society of Woodworkers, 131 Wilmslow Road, Withington, Manchester, and dated 24th December, 1937.  It is addressed to the Secretary, Department of Industry and Commerce, Upper Merrion Street, and reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Sir, I have to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 22nd December, and to state with all due respect to the findings of the arbitrator that my Executive Council is not prepared to accept that our society is responsible for the position at Cork,&rdquo;</P>
      <P>&mdash;that society, I presume, from the fact that it appeared before the court, had accepted the jurisdiction of the court&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;and it again affirms that the dispute is between the unions affiliated to the Cork branch of the Irish National Federation of Building Trades Operatives and the Cork employers, and the Minister for Industry must seek a solution with the bodies referred to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="854" /> I would remind the Minister of Industry that my executive council did not receive direct from your Department notice of the inquiry to be held at Cork, neither was it asked as an executive council representing the Amalgamated Society of Woodworkers to send representatives to the inquiry.  Therefore, it (my council) resents the attempts of the Minister of Industry to compel it, by threat, to accept the findings of an arbitrator with whom it does not agree, and at which inquiry it was not invited to be represented.</P>
    <P>The Amalgamated Society of Woodworkers represents all its members irrespective as to the countries (or the Governments of those countries) in which they may be employed, and it will continue so to act, and protect and safeguard the interests of its members as it thinks best, and according to the general rules of our organisation.</P>
    <P>If, as stated, the Minister of Industry will have to take steps to deal with the position, then it may also be necessary for this society to take steps, through the British trade union movement&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>&mdash;we have them all united here in this country against this Bill, the National Union of Railwaymen, the Railway Clerks' Association, the Amalgamated Woodworkers' Association, and all the rest of them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The letter continues:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;If, as stated, the Minister of Industry will have to take steps to deal with the position, then it may also be necessary for this society to take steps, through the British Trade Union movement, to see that a trade union has the right, in whichever country its members may be employed to protect their interests against any other union that may seek to destroy it simply because its headquarters are not in a particular country.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="855" /> Now, mark what was the issue referred to this particular Court of Inquiry&mdash;that an Irish carpenter, a member of an Irish union, should be allowed to work on a Government job in the City of Cork, and that is misrepresented in the form which I have read to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The letter goes on to say:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It is the considered opinion of my Executive Council that the Irish National Union of Woodworkers was formed with the deliberate intention of preventing this society from continuing to operate in the Irish Free State, and it is our Irish Free State membership that has refused to leave the Amalgamated Society of Woodworkers to join up with the Irish National Union of Woodworkers. My society will not, and has never, prevented any of its members in any country from forming a union limited to that country, but if such union is to be formed it must not be brought about by force by outside bodies, but must be by the free will of the members concerned.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Mark this concluding paragraph:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;My society will not, and has never prevented any of its members in any country from forming a union limited to that country...&rdquo;</P>
      <P>But, if Irish carpenters did dare to form an Irish union of carpenters in this country, the only thing that this British society will do will be to ensure that the Irishmen do not get a job in the City of Cork.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I have read that <Col N="856" /> letter, and I have read it to show the attitude which the English trade unions have, up to this, been free to take in regard to the employment of Irishmen in their own country.  I have read that letter because a question was raised as to what I was doing in this Bill in relation to the English trade unions.  I am not depriving any Irishman of his right to belong to a trade union with its headquarters in Great Britain if he has belonged to that trade union and wishes to continue in membership.  But what I am doing is this, and it is an important step and ought to be remembered: I am, for the first time since the ending of the Act of Union in this country, bringing the British trade unions within the ambit of Irish law.  If they wish to continue in this country, they will henceforward have to conform to our laws in the manner prescribed in this Bill&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I think when I have done that, it will be impossible for any foreign union to defy the findings of an Irish Court of Inquiry, to defy a Minister of an Irish Government, to defy the State as a whole in the manner in which the Amalgamated Society of Woodworkers did defy it in the letter which I have read.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and I am perfectly certain that he can answer that question of his very fully and very precisely. We have heard a great deal of what the proposals contained in this Bill are going to do in relation to the Irish trade union movement.  It cannot do anything worse than has already been done by certain trade unions operating in this country.  It certainly will not deny to an Irishman the right to work at his own trade, perhaps in the city in which he was born, simply because he happened to be a member of a trade union registered under the Acts of this country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill remedies that situation by setting up machinery similar to that which was recommended by the Irishmen who submitted a constructive report to the Irish Trade Union Congress, a report which was defeated at a special conference called to consider it, through the machinations of the English trade unions&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Now, I hope that when I have pointed out what is going to be the real position of British trade unions under the law of this country we shall hear nothing about this Bill putting the English trade unions in a special position.  For the first time, I think, they are going to be made realise that the Government of this country is going to be supreme in this country, and that in relation to any matters occurring in this country it is the law <Col N="858" /> of this country that is going to run, and not that of another country, and the sooner that fact is realised by those who are their agents in this agitation the better it will be for all concerned, whether these agents represent one English union or another.  The need to secure a reorganisation, and a farreaching reorganisation, of the Irish trade union movement has been recognised by Irishmen.  It has been admitted by all Irishmen that that need exists, and the purpose of this Bill is to see that that reorganisation is carried through.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister started off on this Bill by telling us that he wanted to keep an open and impartial mind in respect of the trade union organisation in this country.  We have just listened to, probably, one of the most desperately reckless speeches that any Minister could be guilty of in a discussion of such an important piece of legislation as this is.  Every kind of deception and false argument was mobilised by the Minister in defence of this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us take the case that has been so distorted by the Minister in his account of it, the case of the carpenter who, apparently, worked on some job in Cork and to whom objection was made because he was working there.  By whom was the objection made?  Was it by anybody in Manchester, or was it by some of the Minister's friends in Whitechapel? No; the objection was made by workers in Cork, men who were born in Cork.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">

    <Col N="859" />
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The objection in this case came from Cork carpenters, working in Cork, and they objected to this man being a member of the other union whilst working on that job.  If that particular carpenter was likely to lose his employment, it was not because of objections by Englishmen, Scotsmen or anybody else outside this country: he was losing it, and would lose it, by reason of an objection from his own fellow-workers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielORourke" hpid="Mr. O'Rourke Mr. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Rourke</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  The Minister gave the impression that this particular Irish carpenter lost his employment because of instructions issued by a union with headquarters in Great Britain.  No such thing happened.  He lost his employment because his own fellow-workers in Cork would not work with him.  That is the position.  Let us try to see what will now happen to the Cork carpenter who has lost his job.  Under this section the Amalgamated Society of Woodworkers can go to the tribunal and make an application to the tribunal that the members of the Irish National Union of Woodworkers should be transferred to the Amalgamated Society of Woodworkers. Everybody knows that the membership of the Amalgamated Society of Woodworkers is probably ten or 20 times the membership of the Irish National Union of Woodworkers. One organisation has a membership of 7,000 or 8,000 while the other organisation has a membership of only about 700 or 800.  The tribunal will now decide these cases.  One organisation&mdash;the organisation with headquarters across-Channel&mdash;has tens of thousands of pounds, and the putting up of a deposit of £2,000 means nothing to them, but the small union, the Irish National Union of Woodworkers, cannot raise £2,000, and what is going to happen is that the Minister, in his alleged efforts to lash the English unions into line, use his little whip and have another round with Britain, is going to see the English union registered in this country, with its £2,000 deposit in our courts at 4 <Col N="860" /> per cent. interest, while the Irish union&mdash;the one that he talked about in this House so much for the purpose of getting sympathy from people who do not understand this Bill&mdash;is going to be completely wiped out overnight because of the fact that it cannot raise £2,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Not at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister ought to know that.  Certainly, Deputies sitthing behind him know it, and yet he comes in here with a speech reeking with deception, and tries to give the impression that he is standing in this crisis for the small Irish union as against the large English union.  The fact of the matter is that if I were asked whether this Bill is good for the Irish union or for the English union, I would say to the Irish union: &ldquo;This Bill is your death warrant.&rdquo;  I would point out that it simply means that the large English union with tens of thousands of pounds at its disposal will transfer £2,000 of its money, which is now invested in some other trustee stock or some other institution, over to this country while we pay the interest on the money.  That is being done, we are told in the name of nationalism and patriotism; that it is being done in the name&mdash;if it is not an offence to use the word&mdash;of republicanism.  What is being done is that the English unions are being more strongly entrenched under our legislation than they ever were before, simply because of the fact that a sum of £2,000 means nothing to them, while the small Irish union, which came into existence in the years between 1916 and 1921, as a result of the national struggle, will be wiped out of existence.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>They will not be allowed to organise now, not to speak of not being allowed to work.  They must become members of the English union whom the Minister is going to &ldquo;larn&rdquo; under this Bill.  Now, let us move to some other aspects of this matter.  The Minister talked about the Amalgamated <Col N="861" /> Society of Woodworkers being an English organisation.  It is true that they have their headquarters in England, but it is also true that they have membership in the United States, in New Zealand, in Canada, in Australia; but this much must be said: that, when you call that organisation an English union, every one of the carpenters in that union are there by their own choice.  They are Irishmen, and the members of the A.S.W. who signed that Memorandum No. 2 signed it, not as Englishmen but as Irishmen, and they have just as good records in the national movement of this country as the men who signed the other thing.  I do not know what trade unionist is supposed <Col N="862" /> to be advising the Minister on this matter, but I can say certainly that he is getting a lot of misleading and untruthful advice on these matters. He has already been misled by the report.</P>
