      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health whether he is aware that Mrs. Catherine Kean, St. Patrick's Terrace, Kilrush, County Clare, requested permission from the local authority to cultivate the plot which, last year, was cultivated by her husband, Stephen Kean, and was informed that she will be required to pay a rent of £3 for the allotment, although it was rented to her husband in the previous year at 1/-, and whether he will represent to the local authority that this woman, whose husband has joined the Defence Forces and who has a family of eight depending on her, is not in a position to pay a rental of £3.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if he will state whether agreement has <Col N="1154" /> yet been arrived at between the County Carlow and County Wexford Boards of Health regarding the provision of a water supply at Carrigduff, County Carlow, and, if so, when the supply of water is likely to be provided.</P>

      <P>It is understood that the negotiations between the Carlow and Wexford Boards of Health and Public Assistance in regard to the taking of a water supply for Carrigduff from the pipe-line serving Bunclody are approaching completion.  It is expected that an agreement in the matter will be reached shortly.  The supply for Carrigduff should be available once agreement is reached.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if he is aware of the fact that the acting dispensary doctor at Robertstown, County Kildare, resides at Naas and that considerable hardship is thereby caused to local persons who require the services of the doctor in urgent cases; whether it is proposed to fill the vacancy for a medical officer which exists in the dispensary district, and, if so, when the appointment will be made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>The reply to the first part of the question is in the negative, as regards place of residence and complaints of hardship.  The information in my Department indicates that the temporary medical officer resides within the dispensary district, but I will cause further inquiries to be made. The making of a recommendation for the permanent post is at present receiving attention by the Local Appointments Commissioners.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Parliamentary Secretary not aware of the fact that the medical officer in question, who is acting as <i>locum tenens</i> at Robertstown, resides in Naas, which is eight miles away?  Will the Parliamentary Secretary say when the Local Appointments <Col N="1155" /> Commissioners are likely to recommend an officer to fill this post, especially in view of the hardships occasioned to local persons consequent upon their not being able to get in touch with the doctor, who resides eight miles from the village of Robertstown?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot say when the Local Appointments Commissioners will make a recommendation for the filling of the post, but, as I have already stated, from the information at my disposal the temporary medical officer resides in the dispensary district. However, as there seems to be some doubt as to the accuracy of that information, further inquiries are being made.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if he is now in a position to say whether a decision has been arrived at on the question of providing additional benefits for insured persons under the National Health Insurance Acts and, if a decision has not been arrived at, whether he can give an assurance that one will be expedited so as to ensure that the additional benefits provided will be made available as at the commencement of next benefit year on July 7th, 1941.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>The proposal involves additional charges upon the Exchequer and its examination from that standpoint has not yet been concluded. The only assurance I can give at present is that a decision will be expedited.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Parliamentary Secretary not appreciate the desirability of that decision being arrived at <Col N="1156" /> before the new benefit year commences on the 7th July?  Am I to assume that no additional benefits will now be payable before the new benefit year commences?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Tadhg O Murchadha</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if he is aware that the Cottage Hospital at Schull, County Cork, has been completed for several months, that it is still unstaffed and unoccupied, that proposals by the West Cork Board of Health and Public Assistance for the adequate staffing of the hospital have not been agreed to by his Department and that a request by the board for a conference with an inspector of his Department on the subject has not been acceded to, or the amended proposals of the board for a suitable staff answered, and if he will state what steps he has taken to end this most unsatisfactory position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that the hospital was completed about July, 1940.  In August, 1940, the board of health and public assistance submitted the following staffing proposals:&mdash;one medical officer, one head nurse (nun), one day nurse (nun), one lay nurse with midwifery qualifications, one wardsmaid, one cook, one wardsman and general man.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the 6th November, 1940, the Department suggested that a smaller staff should suffice for a 12 bed hospital.  It was contemplated that <Col N="1157" /> the duties of the medical officer of the hospital might be entrusted to the dispensary medical officer in consideration of a small addition of, say, £50 to his salary and it was intended to reconsider the whole matter when more definite information would be available as to the nature of the work which would be done in the hospital and the extent of the duties.  It was also contemplated that the services of the local dispensary midwife would be availed of, when necessary, to attend maternity cases at a fee per case.  All these considerations were set out in the Department's letter of the 6th November, 1940, and it was also intimated that the approved plans for the hospital did not provide accommodation for nuns.</P>
    <P>Following consideration of the Department's letter by the board, a request was made on the 20th November, 1940, that one of the Department's inspectors attend the next meeting of the board to discuss the question, but the Department in reply (18th December, 1940) intimated that any further representations which the board might desire to make at that stage might be conveyed to the Department in writing.</P>
    <P>The matter was further considered by the board at a meeting on the 20th January, 1941, when they submitted the following amended proposals for staff:&mdash;one medical officer (post to be offered to the dispensary doctor at £50 per year), one head nurse (nun), one lay nurse with midwifery qualifications, one wardsmaid, one cook (nun), one wardsman.</P>
    <P>Where nuns are employed it is usual to have a community of at least three in the staff.  The Department's view is that the Schull Cottage Hospital should not be so elaborately staffed.</P>
    <P>It is proposed to send a medical inspector to Schull to discuss the matter with the representatives of the hoard at an early date.</P>

      <P>(1) The average monthly c.i.f. values per ton of coal imported in each of the years 1939 and 1940 will be circulated in the Official Report.</P>
      <P>The remaining information requested in the question is not available in my Department.  For some time prior to the arrangements now in operation for the supply of coal to bellmen from central dumps the types of coal supplied by the various merchants to their bellmen were not necessarily uniform in quality or in price.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been informed that it was anticipated that petrol supplies equal to about 50 per cent. of pre-war consumption would be available for this country in the near future months, but it was made quite clear that no guarantee would be given to maintain supplies on any particular level.</P>
      <P>During the 12 months ended 30th September, 1939 (that is to say the year immediately preceding the introduction of rationing) net imports of petrol to this country were 44,292,000 gallons.  In addition, Cork Harbour Oil Wharves Ltd. produced in the same year approximately 2,000,000 gallons and our industrial alcohol factories 787,000 gallons.  This makes a total of over 47,000,000 gallons for the year.  The corresponding figure for the year ended 31st December, 1940, was 34,083,000 gallons or 73 per cent. of the figure for the year ended 30th September, 1939.</P>
      <P>There has been no production of home-refined spirit since early last year as no supplies of crude oil were made available for the refinery at Haulbowline and production of industrial alcohol has also ceased.  The imports of petrol for the first three months of this year amounted to 3,926,000 gallons, which represented only about 34 per cent. or a quarter of our consumption in the period immediately preceding the war.  Every effort has been made and is being made to obtain larger supplies, but so far without success.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For the last three months, the quantity of petrol available has not made it possible to distribute any petrol to owners of private cars with the exception of clergymen, doctors, veterinary surgeons; nurses and a limited number of officials of the Government and of local authorities.  All commercial vehicles are granted an allowance equivalent to half the basic allowance granted up to the end of last year. Additional allowances are being granted to some classes of commercial vehicle owners, including public transport concerns, licensed hauliers, milk collectors and lorries used for conveying sand to building sites.  Hackney vehicle owners get a graduated scale of <Col N="1162" /> allowances not exceeding the basic allowance of 40 gallons.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that, with the inadequate supplies of petrol available, the present distribution is as equitable as possible.  Any system of distribution will be considered unsatisfactory by persons who receive no or insufficient supplies.  The categories of vehicle-users to whom allowances are made, and the allowances in respect of each category, have been prepared after the fullest consideration of all relevant factors, and absorb the total quantity of petrol available for distribution in each month.  While supplies remain inadequate no system of distribution will achieve general satisfaction.</P>

      <P>Arising out of the latter part of the Minister's reply, assuming that the categories he has fixed are the best he can do with the supplies at his disposal, has he considered the desirability of reviewing the distribution within those categories?  For instance, clergymen are receiving an allowance of petrol without regard to their duties. Would he consider increasing, within the clergymen's category, the allocation to a parochial priest who is doing parochial work, and possibly reducing that of a clergyman who is not engaged on parochial work?  Within the doctors' category, where a doctor is a doctor to an institution, and does not normally travel outside on his duties, would he consider reducing that doctor's allocation and increasing the allocation to the doctor in a backward dispensary district so that his difficulties might be relieved?  Would the Minister consider doing that, not at once, of course, but as expeditiously as circumstances would permit that review to be made?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I can only say that no amount of consideration by me will increase the quantity of petrol available. The quantity of petrol distributed to lorry owners represents the maximum <Col N="1164" /> they can get under the present system of distribution while supplies are inadequate. In reply to Deputy Morrissey's question, speaking from recollection, I was informed some time during the month of January that the petrol companies hoped to be able to deliver 50 per cent. of our normal requirements in this year.  As to when they are going to start doing so I cannot say; they have not started yet, judging by the figures I gave in the House this afternoon.  With regard to Deputy Dillon's question, I may say that I am prepared to consider the reallocation of petrol amongst persons in various classes, but it is not practicable to have that reallocation made by the officers of my Department.  I am not prepared to undertake myself to determine whether one clergyman should get more petrol than another, or one doctor more petrol than another.  I have told the medical association that, if they themselves are prepared to redistribute amongst the members of their association the total quantity of petrol now available for doctors, I will be prepared to act on their recommendations in the issuing of licences.  I think something similar might be done in relation to the churches.  If any organisation of that kind, the medical association or the veterinary association, or any of the churches, are themselves prepared to consider the reallocation amongst their members of the total quantity of petrol available for all their members, then I would be very glad to discuss the matter with them.</P>

The total amount estimated to be received in fees is £15,000, and it is anticipated that the expenditure on administration, which will continue so long as the tea rationing scheme is in force, will be considerably in excess of that amount.  Expenditure will be incurred in respect of staff; accommodation, including heating and lighting; postal, telephone, etc., services; and printing, stationery and advertising.

An application for a licence to export plaster boards had been received from this firm and refused by me, as I was not satisfied that the position in respect of supplies of a raw material required for the production of these goods was such as to justify the granting of such licence. Subsequently an undertaking was received from the firm in question relating to the maintenance of a minimum stock of this raw material, and a licence to export a fixed quantity of plaster boards was issued.</P>

      <P>I am aware that fares on omnibus services operating in County Galway were subjected to an increase, as from the 19th of last <Col N="1175" /> month, in common with fares on the remainder of the Great Southern Railways Company's passenger road services throughout the country, except their Cork City services and those operated jointly with the Great Northern Railway (Ireland).</P>
      <P>The Great Southern Railways Company states that the increases were necessary to avoid a very substantial loss in the operation of its present limited services&mdash;which were radically reduced as from 10th February last as a result of the petrol shortage&mdash;owing to the continuous increase in the cost of maintaining and operating these services, and this whole matter is at present the subject of examination by my Department.

      <P>I am aware that the restrictions on the movement of live stock in the affected areas are causing hardship and inconvenience to stock owners.  These restrictions are, however, a very essential part of the precautionary measures against the spread of infection and, owing to the uncertainty of the disease position, I cannot see my way to modify them until I am satisfied that no risk would be involved.

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister advert to the fact that if he allowed the stock of pigs virtually to disappear it would be quite impossible to build up a fresh stock when the feeding situation is easier after the harvest is gathered?  Would it not be worth while at this time temporarily to subsidise the price of pigs in order to persuade the rapidly dwindling number of producers to keep in the pig business?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a big question.  Pigs which are finishing now were for a considerable portion of the time fed at a much lower price.  If we were to base the price of pigs on the price of feeding stuffs, we would certainly put the price out of reach of any consumer, not to speak of the poorer consumer, because I suppose it would be 200/- per cwt.  As to the other question raised by Deputy Dillon, the future production of pigs is being kept in mind and we must do the best we can.</P>

      <P>Bonham porkers were sold in Leitrim last week at 4/- apiece because the people had not got the food to keep them and they either had to get rid of them or kill them.  If that spreads through the country, hundreds of people will simply jettison their bonhams and the breeding stock will disappear.  What I am suggesting is that the subsidy should be maintained to keep the people in pigs until the harvest comes in, and then let everybody do the best he can.  I press the Minister strongly to inquire into the situation before it reaches a stage beyond remedy, and there is that danger now.</P>

In accordance with this arrangement the great bulk of the beet pulp was purchased from the company by the beet growers either directly or through the Beet Growers' Association.

      <P>Copies of the book referred to consigned to Dublin booksellers have been detained in the course of postal censorship and returned to the senders in pursuance of Article 17 of the Emergency Powers Order, 1939.  The book, which is by an anonymous author, is merely propaganda directed against one of the belligerents in the European war.  It is considered that it would not be in the public interest to permit a publication of the kind to be placed on sale here.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister say why there is this discrimination by the Post Office; why publications of this particular kind are stopped while there is allowed to be passed through the Post Office daily publications making the charge that there is an Anglo-American threat to Ireland; containing insults to the President of the United States; and charges that the British Air Force are bombing hospital ships and that the British Government are starving French children?  Why is there this discrimination by the Post Office which allows Italian propaganda daily to circulate stuff like that through the post?</P>

Tá dhá Airteagal sa Bhunreacht a bhaineann le ceist an Bunreacht féin do leasú&mdash;Airteagal a sé is dachad agus Airteagal a haon déag is dachad.  De bhuadh Airteagail a sé is dachad, is cead foráileamh ar bith den Bhunreacht do leasú ar mhodh áirithe.  Gach togra chun leasú <Col N="1201" /> a dhéanamh fén Airteagal san, ní foláir é chur fé bhreith an phobail le Reifreann.  Ach socruítear le hAirteagal a haon déag is dachad go dtig leis an Oireachtas, fé réir nithe áirithe, leasuithe do dhéanamh gan Reifreann taobh istigh de thrí bliana tar éis an lae a chuaidh an chéad Uachtarán i gcúram a oifige.  Chuaidh an tUachtarán i gcúram a oifige an cúigiú lá fichead de Mheitheamh, sa bhliain míle naoi gcéad a hocht déag is fiche agus is cead, dá bhrí sin, leasuithe a dhéanamh le hachtú an Oireachtais go dtí an ceathrú lá fichead de Mhí an Mheithimh seo chughainn.  Tá taithí againn ar oibriú an Bhunreachta le breis is trí bliana anois agus is léir, de thoradh na taithí sin, gur gá, nó gur mhaith an rud, leasuithe áirithe do dhéanamh.  Scrúduíodh an Bunreacht go cúramach sna Ranna Stáit, ag féachaint don taithí a bhí again, agus do bhreithnigh an Riaghaltas molta na Roinn.  Chuaidh an Riaghaltas i gcomhairle leis an Ard-Aighne agus socruíodh sa deire na leasuithe atá sa Sceideal a ghabhann leis an mBille seo do chur fé bhráid an Oireachtais.  Ocht leasuithe is fiche, ar fad, atá sa Sceideal.  Ach an chuid is mó dhíobh níl siad ro-thábhachtach. Tá atharú á dhéanamh ar abairt anso agus ansúd i dtreo go mbeidh an chiall níos soiléire ná bhí.  Trí no ceithre cinn díobh tá siad tábhachtach go leor. Maidir leis an chuid is mó de na leasuithe, táim beagnach cinnte nach mbeidh mórán deifríochta eadrainn ach is dócha go mbeidh díospóireacht againn ar trí no ceithre cinn díobh&mdash; uimhir a 21, uimhir a 25 agus uimhir a 28, cuir i gcás.

Baineann leasú eile le ceist <i>habeas corpus</i> agus ceann eile le halt 56, a bhaineas leis an Stát-Sheirbhís. Níl mórán le rá ar an mBille seo ar an Dara Céim.

      <P>I am sure there are a number of Deputies who want to have what I have just said, said also in English.  What</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1202" /> I have said is this: that, within three years from the first day on which the President took office, it is permissible for the Oireachtas by a Bill, without reference to the people, to amend the Constitution.  The three years are now nearly up, and, if we are to take advantage of the permission that is given to make changes without reference to the people, we must do it within that period.  The period was purposely given, in order to enable an examination to be made in practice of the working out of the Constitution, with a view to determining whether there were any changes of a minor character which might be necessary, or any other changes which it was considered important should be made. That examination has taken place in the various Departments of State over the past three years.  The officers of the Department were asked particularly to note, in the working over three years, whether there were any particular Articles in the Constitution, in so far as it bore on their Departments, which seemed to merit a change. Their recommendations were sent to us.  They were examined by the Government; we took the advice of the Attorney-General in regard to them, and this Bill is the result.  We decided finally that those amendments which are mentioned should be considered and enacted before the period has passed in which we can, by simple enactment, make the change.</P>
    <P>The majority of those amendments are not of fundamental importance. They are intended for the most part to clarify the text, and in one or two cases to remedy certain errors in the text which seem to have crept in.  For example, in one case, when there was an amendment made here in the House, the amendment was made in English, and in the Irish version a phrase which had reference to a previous text, a previous draft, was allowed to remain. I quote that as an example.  There are, however, two or three amendments which are of a more important type. Again, they are intended in the main rather to clarify the existing position than to introduce something which is fundamentally new.  Those are, first of <Col N="1203" /> all, No. 21.  No. 21 relates to the Article under which in times of war or armed rebellion the action which would be taken by the State is not governed by the Constitution; that is the Constitution cannot be invoked against Acts which would be passed by the Oireachtas under such circumstances. Deputies will remember that at the beginning of the war we brought in an amendment under which &ldquo;time of war&rdquo; would cover a situation such as that in which we are at the moment. In considering that matter since, it was thought that the time of war should also cover a period after the war is over.  First of all, it is difficult to say exactly at what point of time the conflict would have finished.  Apart from that, there is also the obvious desirability of keeping those powers for some while longer, because there is no doubt that immediately after the war you do not quite get back to a position of peace; you do not get back to the position in which you were immediately before the war.  The point of time then, instead of being determined in some absolute way in words, has to be determined by resolution of the two Houses, just as in the case of the amendment which we brought in some time ago, that is the condition being such that the time of war would cover it has to be determined by means of a resolution of both Houses.</P>
    <P>The next important amendment is that relating to the <i>habeas corpus</i> provisions, that is amendment 25. There, some changes are made from the existing text, but the proposal in the main is to continue what was regarded as the usual practice in the case of <i>habeas corpus.</i>  The principal point is that now when a conditional order is given it is taken before one or three judges, that to be determined by the President of the High Court. It is also made clear that, if a question is raised as to the validity of a law, the question will have to be tried by the Supreme Court, which is the court which has always been envisaged in the Constitution as the court finally to try questions on the validity of laws. Finally, there is amendment 28, which might be regarded as having relation <Col N="1204" /> to transferred officers.  When Article 56 of the Constitution was being passed, a question was raised here with regard to its bearing on the transferred officers, and an amendment was brought in to the effect that, notwithstanding the Article in the Constitution, we should make it definite in the Constitution that the rights which transferred officers have under the 1929 Act, which resulted as Deputies will remember from Article 10 of the Treaty of 1922, should be safeguarded by the Constitution itself.  It was felt at the time that the Article in the Constitution seemed not to do that.</P>
    <P>The House rejected that amendment. I think it was moved by Deputy Rice on behalf of Deputies Costello and McGilligan.  I pointed out that the intention was not to give new or added security to anybody; the purpose of the Article as it stood was to make certain that the change-over from one position to the other, caused by the introduction and the passing of the new Constitution, did not of itself interfere with any rights that existed on the part of officers of the State.  It was suggested at the time that they had a Constitutional guarantee as it stood.  We pointed out that their rights were really in an Act of Parliament, and that the Constitution, inasmuch as it could be changed by legislation, did not give any added security; that it would be a very different matter if we had a Constitution&mdash;like the present Constitution will be after June next&mdash;which could not be changed by Act of the Oireachtas, but could only be changed after reference to the people.  I rejected the amendment and the Article passed in the form in which it now stands.  A doubt has been expressed as to whether the Article might not possibly be read to have the meaning which was sought to be introduced, the meaning which it was sought to give effect to by means of the amendment which was moved by Deputy Rice.  The purpose of the present amendment is to make sure that that opinion which has been expressed will not hold; in other words, to make sure that the intention which was the intention <Col N="1205" /> when the Constitution was passed should be given full effect to, and that the intention of those who wanted to have an amendment for that purpose would not be read into it.</P>
    <P>That covers the Bill as a whole. From its nature it is rather a Commitee Stage measure and each amendment will have to be dealt with separately in Committee.  I think I have covered the ground generally.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is almost impossible to believe, when we are asked to consider this Second Amendment of the Constitution Bill, that the world is in the state that it is in at the moment.  We are asked to take seriously the series of amendments that have been dealt with by the Taoiseach.  There are one or two, one particularly, that may give rise to discussion and difference of opinion.  I refer to the provision that a state of war shall be held to continue in this country for an indefinite period after the war has ceased&mdash;that is practically what the amendment comes to.  Apart from that, except for the rather amusing light thrown on certain mischances and misadventures of the Constitution, I cannot see any great importance in these proposals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill is much more interesting from the point of view of what it omits in the way of amendments to the Constitution rather than in what it contains. Technically, we have before us a Constitution in the Irish language. There is appended a translation into English.  That, at least, is the theory, and members of this House, the bulk of whom do not understand the Irish text, solemnly assumed that and took the Taoiseach's word for it.  There was a suspicion at the time that the process had been the other way round, namely, that the Constitution had been drawn up in English, and translated into Irish.  I ask Deputies to look at the amendments in this extraordinary schedule and they will be convinced of the truth that lay behind that suspicion; in other words, in a number of cases the Irish text is amended and there is no corresponding amendment of the English text.  It does suggest <Col N="1206" /> to the Taoiseach, I put it, that the translation took place the other way round, not in the way we are given to understand.  In some cases I doubt whether there were not substantial differences between the Irish and the English texts.  Yet in future, in case there is a conflict between the two texts, the text of the Constitution that everybody in the House understands and the text that a limited number in the House and in the Seanad understands, the text shall prevail which, unfortunately, the majority of the people, the majority of the members of this House and the Seanad, do not understand.</P>
    <P>The whole method of procedure is extraordinary.  Until a certain editing is done by three people of whom one is the Taoiseach and another the Chief Justice, what shall we have?  An Act, and a schedule contradicting the main Act until the editing is done. Furthermore, so that the House cannot lay hands on the sacred text of the Constitution, the final form of that Constitution is to be published and, as it is to be effective in law, it will be the text which the House will not have seen before it is issued. The only people to see it will be the Taoiseach and some people outside the House&mdash;the Chief Justice and somebody else.  I do not object to that as regards the Constitution, but I hope that will not be followed when we are dealing with important legislation.  It would be a bad precedent if the final text of a Bill became law without the House seeing it, without the House seeing what editing had taken place.  Dealing with important legislation, that might be a bad precedent, but I am not inclined to be gravely upset about it when we are dealing only with the Constitution.</P>
    <P>There is in these amendments, on the part of the Taoiseach, a vein of rather unconscious humour&mdash;possibly he did not intend it&mdash;and what I might call a face-saving that is almost oriental in its degree.  I can understand the parental affection, almost amounting to nepotism, that the Taoiseach has for the Constitution.  If he made up his mind from the start that the Constitution was really a document that ought <Col N="1207" /> to be amended from time to time, as the circumstances allow, I think in the end he would have a more workable Constitution.  I think it is a pity, in what professes to be a fundamental document governing both the Government and the legislative powers of this House, that there is such a tying down in the way it is done here.  It was recognised, in the original Constitution, that a certain amount of experience was necessary in order to give those interested an opportunity of seeing whether, in a reasonable way, amendments could not be made to it. That is the reason a certain period was fixed in which amendments could be made without going through all the ceremony&mdash;I prefer to call it the almost obstructive rigmarole&mdash;of a referendum. It would have been well if that period had been a great deal longer. Supposing the war had not occurred until next June, we were in a position here that we could not have passed that important amendment of the Constitution that we passed in September, 1939. For the future our hands are to be tied and we may find them tied in a time of considerable turmoil and chaos.</P>
    <P>To remove the time-limitation would have been a much more reasonable amendment, and, as the Constitution requires a referendum in this case, the only useful purpose I can see that the referendum might serve might be to get rid of that particular limitation of the three years, because I cannot believe that there will not be other experiences which may require quick enactment of amendments of the Constitution. I think we have made it quite clear in the last 18 months that we have never hesitated to give the Government any power they were anxious to get and which they held was necessary for the safety of this country against enemies, external or internal.  The Taoiseach, however, has not taken that course.  He gives a number of amendments here, most of which are due largely to the pretence that a certain process was undergone, as I said already, in a direction opposite to what really took place.</P>
    <P>Let us take the three amendments <Col N="1208" /> which the Taoiseach, quite rightly, fixes as being the important amendments. I leave out of account&mdash;it is a comparatively small matter&mdash;the proviso which insists that, in future, on a matter of Constitutional importance tried by the courts, only the decision of the majority shall be given and that there shall be no indication as to whether or not there was a division of opinion amongst the judges. From a purely Departmental point of view, I can see certain reasons for that proposal, but I can also see objections.  At all times&mdash;and it is not something of which we should be unduly proud&mdash;there was considerable apathy about the whole Constitution and Constitutional questions in this country.  The only time the people ever got a certain amount of interest flogged up was when there were cases in court, and although you want the people of this country to be really interested in the Constitution, you are taking away from them one of the real spurs to that interest.  A division of opinion, with the Constitutional grounds stated by judges, would stimulate some interest in constitutional matters which is entirely absent at present.  However, I leave that aside.</P>
    <P>It is rather a serious matter to propose&mdash;I presume on the ground of the abnormality that may arise&mdash;that this country shall be treated as being in a state of war, even though there is no war in the country and though the war may have ceased on the Continent&mdash; and that for an indefinite period.  I presume the period will be that which the Taoiseach and the majority of the House may consider to be abnormal, but we have no indication, and nobody could have any indication at present, as to the length of time for which that abnormality may continue.  Either the Constitution is meant to be protective, or it is not.  I can see that it is exceedingly important to preserve the life of a nation, and that is particularly so in the case of war, even though war does not immediately affect this country; but, because the situation is abnormal, I do not think that all the guarantees of the Constitution, so far <Col N="1209" /> as private liberty is concerned, should be swept away.  That, of all amendments before us, is by far the most important, and it is the amendment about which, I think, there would be the greatest difference of opinion.</P>
    <P>Last September 12 months, we passed here an amendment of the Constitution of very far-reaching importance.  Now it is proposed that it should become&mdash;I cannot say that it will become a permanent provision of the Constitution&mdash;a provision for an indefinite period, not even terminated by the indefinite period of the war, but for an indefinite period afterwards. There is no guarantee that, within any reasonable time, we shall return to normality in that case, and if there is not a state of war in Europe, surely the powers which this House unhesitatingly gave to the Government to deal with internal trouble were sufficiently wide, without making almost permanent this formal wiping-away of what is left of Constitutional guarantees for personal liberty.  That is undoubtedly the most serious of the amendments.  I should like to have an opportunity of examining further the amendment which deals with what I may call <i>habeas corpus</i>, because the provisions are extremely complicated. At present I gather that one judge, when the writ is returned, could deal with the writ and decide whether or not an individual was being kept in custody.  Now, apparently, according to the decision of the President of the High Court, three may do it.  Apart from the desirability or undesirability of that, it does undoubtedly further interfere with the chances of the individual going free.  It is not merely a verbal amendment; it is not merely a clarification of the present situation. It is a considerable changing of it.</P>
    <P>The third amendment to which the Taoiseach referred, I have unfortunately not been able to consider, for the reason that I bought what I call the official text of the Constitution, and, owing to the subtlety of the Taoiseach, a number of the provisions of the Constitution do not appear in it.</P>

However, the fact that it could be got in the cheaper edition is a sign of the democratic leanings of the Government. I have, therefore, only the Taoiseach's explanation to rely on.  Do I understand that all that is intended here is that any rights under law which transferred civil servants&mdash;let us admit that it deals with them&mdash;have stand, but that they are not Constitutionally guaranteed?  That is what I understood.  It does not indicate any desire on the part of the Government to repudiate any arrangements with these people?</P>

      <P>I asked the Taoiseach, and he shook his head to indicate that there was no such desire. All he said was that he does not want to give them a Constitutional basis to act upon.  When it will become a desire on the part of the Government is another thing, but at present there is no such desire.  Anyhow, as time goes on, I put it that the temptation to any Government to interfere with these rights will grow less and less, because comparatively few people indeed will be affected, and they will grow fewer from year to year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we heard several months ago that there were amendments to the Constitution and that they numbered 18, 19, 23, 26, or whatever they were, we expected that the Constitution would be really amended.  We were very simple because we thought that important blocks in the Constitution would be amended.  In the long title of the Bill, we find the words &ldquo;whereas experience has shown that certain amendments of the Constitution are desirable.&rdquo;  I admit that experience showed that certain amendments were desirable&mdash;and very desirable. But they are not in this Bill. Apart from this matter of extending the first amendment to the Constitution beyond the indefinite period <Col N="1211" /> already provided for, my main objection to the Bill is in respect to what is not in it.  Here was an opportunity to introduce important amendments.  The Taoiseach may say that that might mean a referendum.  When I see the amendment which was passed in September, 1939, and accepted by the President without the necessity for a referendum, I can think of no effective Article of the Constitution that could not be amended without a referendum within the three years.  I am not at all criticising the action of the President. I approve of the action of the President in taking that particular view but I draw the inference that there is no effective clause of this Constitution that could not be amended by ordinary legislation within the three years, following the precedent.</P>
    <P>Take a matter which may give satisfaction to the Taoiseach&mdash;that Government Departments may have found nothing to object to in the Constitution and that the Attorney-General may have found it all right from the legal point of view.  I doubt, however, if the country or many people in this House are satisfied with the provisions of the Constitution regarding the Seanad.  Why tie yourself down in respect of that matter in the Constitution before you have really any experience? Why tie your hands as regards the number of members in the Seanad?  That was a matter that could be amended.  Why tie your hands as to the vocational character of a second House when you have a commission sitting on the whole question of vocationalism? Surely, that was a case in which amendment was required much more urgently than it was in respect of the matters with which 22 of the 26 amendments we have before us deal.</P>
    <P>Let us take the question of a referendum. Have we any experience of that? So far as I can see, our desire has been to avoid anything of the kind.  I remember that, when certain emergency laws of different kinds were being debated in this House, one of the objections to amending the Constitution was that the President might consider <Col N="1212" /> that it was a matter which should go to a referendum.  Again, I put it to the Taoiseach and to the House that the action taken by the Oireachtas&mdash; President, Dáil and Seanad&mdash;in September, 1939, shows what was really thought of a referendum.  Neither the Dáil nor the Seanad, nor the President suggested that that all-important matter should be put to the people. The Taoiseach has quite obviously in mind&mdash;judging by the amendment extending the war period for this country&mdash;the grave problems that will affect the country after the war.  Yet, he keeps in the Constitution a provision which makes possible the holding up of legislation.  Under certain conditions, drastic legislation may be necessary.  If legislation is drastic, it may hit certain interests and, with a certain attitude on the part of the Seanad and a fraction of this House, a referendum may be demanded.  That is a thing that it would be better to guard against than what is aimed at in extending the period of war for this country.  The referendum in most countries has been an obstacle to progressive legislation.  As a rule, it rejects changes of legislation.  It may be desirable after the war that drastic legislation should not be impeded. Speaking from the theoretical and practical point of view, I think that it is a great mistake to try to combine a Parliamentary system with a mock, direct-democracy system.  There is practical objection to putting obstacles in the way of urgent, important, legislative measures when the war ends.</P>
    <P>We are still keeping the provision of the Constitution dealing with the election of the President directly by the people.  Having solemnly laid down in this House that this was the keystone of the Constitution, the two principal Parties came together later and said: &ldquo;That keystone is not going to be there any longer so far as the first election of President is concerned.&rdquo; This great, democratic right of the people was swept away, in practice, after a conference.  I admit that anybody who fulfilled the necessary conditions could have gone up for election, but nobody was foolish enough to do that.  Is it desirable that <Col N="1213" /> if, for one reason or another, there were a vacancy in the office of President in the next couple of months&mdash;I hope there will not be; nobody would be sorrier than I if there were&mdash;we should be plunged into the expense and turmoil of a presidential election?</P>
    <P>I am sorry that, from one piece of experience which we know the Taoiseach had, namely, presidential elections and how to deal with them, he did not build on that particular experience.  I, therefore, was greatly disappointed when I looked through the Bill to find that the amendments I hoped would be there were not there, and that most of the amendments were, as the Taoiseach said, drafting amendments provided by Departments.  I know the tendency of Departments to snow under Ministers&mdash;I should say that we have plenty of examples of that at Question Time&mdash;but I am sorry to see the author of the Constitution and the Taoiseach himself suffer from that disease.  It is not the experience of Departments, or even of the Attorney-General, that ought to decide what amendments of the Constitution were necessary.  It is the experience we all have had of the working of the Constitution.</P>
    <P>There is one amendment in this Schedule about the wisdom of which I have the gravest doubts.  There are one or two others&mdash;one other particularly&mdash;about which I have some doubts. But, what I am mainly perturbed about is what is not in the Bill.  However, I do not intend to say any more about it, except that when we heard of these amendments of the Constitution we thought we were getting something, but we are getting nothing of value.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not help being astounded at the rather light-hearted manner in which the Taoiseach introduced this extensive series of amendments to the Constitution, and the sparse attendance on the benches in this House to-day is a rather ironic commentary on the importance attached to a Constitution claimed to be the only one that was freely drafted by ourselves.  Now we come to institute a whole bunch of amendments to <Col N="1214" /> the Constitution, and about one-sixth of the Legislative Assembly think it worth while to listen to the Taoiseach introducing the amendments, or think it worth while to listen to the nature of the amendments proposed in this Constitution.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest to the Taoiseach that the explanation of that niggardly attendance is not the reluctance of members of the various Parties to come into the House to worry themselves with matters of Constitutional importance, but the fact that in his own Party the members are not allowed to take any but his own conception of what a constitution should be.  I suggest to the Taoiseach as a member of the Fianna Fáil Party that they have a different method of organising the Constitutional structure of the country.  I can imagine the punishment that would be meted out to any daring member of the Party who attempted to stand up even to the height of the Taoiseach's knee in Constitutional matters in relation to himself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fact of the matter is that, instead of approaching this whole question of the Constitution in a big, broadminded, and national way and inviting members of all Parties to cooperate in the preparation of a Constitution and its enactment, the Taoiseach came to the House and steam-rolled this Constitution through with the aid of a legion who did not even bother to participate in the discussion but came in when the bells rang to do what the Taoiseach wanted them to do, because of their infallible belief in the Taoiseach's knowledge of the best means of dealing with Constitutional matters.  This Constitution was simply steam-rolled through the House by one Party, having at the time a pretty small majority in the House, and I <Col N="1215" /> doubt if they were reinforced by the authority of the majority of the votes of the people cast at the previous election.  At all events, with the aid of three-member and five-member constituencies, they had a sufficient majority in the house to be able to get their own Constitution through.  I thought then, and nothing that has happened since has convinced me to the contrary, that these were unhappy auspices under which to launch the Constitution, and that the precipitate steps then taken by the Taoiseach would in the course of time react seriously on the respect which our people had for the Constitution.  As I said, the sparse attendance while we are discussing these 26 amendments to the Constitution is an indication of the little respect that is felt even amongst members of this House for the Constitution which we now have and indicates a lack of interest even as to the manner in which we amend it.</P>
    <P>Even now I think the Taoiseach might endeavour to repair some of the damage which was originally done. That damage might be repaired if, recognising that, for good or evil, we now have this Constitution, an all-Party committee examined the operation of that Constitution in the light of the rather fragmentary experience which could be obtained from events during the past few years.  With such information as was available, it might then consider whether alterations in the Constitution were desirable and, if so, what type of amendments were desirable.  If you had an examination of the Constitution by an all-Party committee of that kind, you might very well get even, at this stage, a rather general adoption of the provisions of the Constitution by all groups in the House.  We might, therefore, take it away from the rather curious parentage which it has at present by reason of being steam-rolled through the House by the votes of one Party.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy O'Sullivan that instead of, at this early stage, hurriedly making amendments of the kind indicated in this Bill, we might have <Col N="1216" /> taken a longer period during which to consider the amendments that it was necessary to make.  For instance, during the past 18 months at least, the country has been living in the shadow of a war.  The Constitution meant nothing to the people.  The people have been concerned during the past 18 months with endeavouring to preserve the neutrality of the country and to repair the worst damage which is being caused by the blockaded position of the country.  There has been very little thought on the part of any section of the community, practically no thought whatever on the part of this House, and certainly less by people outside the House, as to what blemishes or imperfections have been shown in the Constitution during the past two and a half years.  So that, with practically no informed public opinion as to defects in the Constitution, with no public consideration given. to the question of whether the Constitution works smoothly or otherwise, whether it was found to break down in this or that connection, we now proceed to pass through the House a Bill providing for a whole variety of amendments.  All that is done, we are told by the Taoiseach, after he got information from certain Departments as to what they thought on the matter.</P>
    <P>I do not regard Departments as good judges in a matter of this kind; in fact, I regard them as the worst possible judges.  I do not know anybody qualified in the Departments to express an opinion on Constitutions. Departments generally have quite an indifferent regard for the dignity of this House or for the powers of this House.  The whole, tendency of the modern Government Department is to get power into its own hands.  If it can get power to initiate administrative or executive action by regulation, that is the type of legislation that that particular Department will look for.  To suggest that the personnel in Government Departments, with the exception of legal folk in one or two Departments, have any special qualifications to advise on an amendment of the Constitution is really asking the <Col N="1217" /> House to swallow too much this evening. I do not believe they have any such qualifications.  I do not believe I could count more than two people in all the Departments put together who have any special knowledge on a matter of this kind.  I think, if the Taoiseach wanted advice as to the type of Constitution that would work best in conformity with Parliamentary Government, and bearing in mind the necessity for an expeditious form of Parliamentary Government, he might very well have got much better advice from an all-Party committee, in tune with the feelings of the people throughout the country, having a knowledge of the way the Parliamentary machine works and anxious that it should act as a complementary agency to the Executive Council, than he could possibly get by way of consultation with any Government Department.</P>
    <P>I would suggest to him now that he might very well reconsider this whole question.  Under Article 51 of the Constitution, provision was made whereby it could be amended in this way within three years from the first day on which the President entered on his office.  I do not think it would be wholly impossible to amend that Article, even by avoiding a referendum.  If paragraph 2 of Article 51 be looked at, I think it will be seen that a way is provided there for the avoidance of a referendum.  It seems to me that, with our limited experience of the present Constitution, covering about 1½ of 2½ years, we might very well, at this stage, extend the three-year period so as to make it possible for us to review the operations of the Constitution over a longer period; over a period not so brimful of the extraneous kind of excitement that we have had for the past 18 months.  Even now, the Taoiseach might, I think, look at Article 51 with a view to taking power under it to amend the Constitution by legislation over a longer period than three years.  That longer period would, possibly, carry us into more tranquil times and calmer waters.</P>
    <P>With that longer experience of the Constitution, and the promotion of a <Col N="1218" /> national outlook in regard to it among all Parties, it might then be possible to make in the Constitution much more effective and commendable amendments than can be made by the method provided under the measure before us to-day.  For instance, if the Taoiseach were anxious to avail of the three years within which to cut out some of the dead timber in the Constitution, prematurely dead timber, or to take out some of the spanners that are acting as sand in the machinery he might, for instance, give some little attention to the position of the President in relation to the Constitution.  When the Constitution was going through the House, I expressed doubts as to the desirability of having the President elected in the manner provided for in Article 12.  We set off there most gallantly and heroically to declare that the President shall be elected by the direct vote of the people.  That seems to be all right to anybody carried away by phrases, or to anyone who likes superficial democracy of that variety, but it will not work and it has not worked.  The Government and the Taoiseach know perfectly well that it was only by the exercise of the most frantic efforts on their part that a contest was avoided when we came to elect the first President.  We set off, under Article 12 of the Constitution, to make the President the plaything of any political Party that will adopt a potential President.  The scheme for electing a President provides that the candidate will, in fact, have to be the nominee of a political Party.</P>

      <P>Not necessarily, but almost certainly.  A political Party decides to nominate a candidate for the Presidency.  He has got to be 35 years of age, to get the nomination of not less than 20 persons who are members of one of the Houses of the Oireachtas, and he must be nominated by not less than four administrative councils as defined by law.  We then take the President out on the hustings. We take him up and down the country addressing meetings&mdash;public meetings in the market squares, fair meetings, <Col N="1219" /> meetings in town halls and in urban council halls.  We take him from Donegal to Kerry, around the south coast and up the east coast and give him a canter over the Midlands, and after that we bring him back to Dublin for the final rally.  Having regard to what our experience of elections in this country has been, one could imagine the kind of things that would be imputed to that poor man by the time he had done a tour of the country.  He would come back to Dublin for his final rally and the election would take place.  He would be one of three candidates.  Probably, the other two would be as much mud-stained after that political campaign as the one who ultimately succeeds in getting elected.  At any rate, they would all get back and finish up the election in their respective strongholds. On the day appointed the people go to the poll and elect the President after having, during the best part of the preceding month, spent their time abusing him&mdash;the man they disliked.</P>
      <P>After all that kind of schemozzle you get a President, someone who has got a majority.  You then instal him in the Phænix Park and say to him &ldquo;You are the President.&rdquo;  This is a person who has been abused by a substantial proportion of the electorate during the previous four or six weeks or two months, a person who has probably got a bare majority of the votes, and a person who has probably been derided by two of the three political Parties in the State.  With all that kind of undesirable embroidery on him, he takes up office as President of Ireland, having made himself an enemy of two of the Parties in the State and a political enemy of a substantial majority of the people.  Then we expect him to carry out the functions which are provided for the President in the Constitution.  It could not be done, and it cannot be done.  You cannot pet the respect for a non-political President elected by methods of that kind that you can get for a President elected in other ways.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What we have done in the Constitution <Col N="1220" /> is: we have provided the American method of electing a President where there is a nation-wide campaign.  The President there is the nominee of one Party and comes back to the White House as such.  That is all right.  He is the head of that political Party.  If our President were the head of the reigning political Party, well and good, go on and elect him by the direct vote of the people. But what we have done in this Constitution is&mdash;we have made our President a kind of hybrid President.  We have given him the American system of election, and the normal pre-war functions of the French President.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>We are even concerned with protecting the Ceann Comhairle from the inconvenience of an election once we set him up in a certain position here, but a potential President can run the gauntlet of an election in this country, about as stormy a place as he could contest an election in.  We permit that kind of system to continue while amending the Constitution, although when we first tried it out it was the one piece of the Constitution that broke down, and broke down immediately, and of course it will break down again. Deputy O'Sullivan conjured up the possibility&mdash;with him I hope it will be a remote possibility&mdash;that we might conceivably find it necessary to fill a vacancy in the Presidential office say within three months, or within six months or within 12 months.  The Constitution says that the President so elected shall be elected by direct vote of the people.  Does anybody want to elect a President within the next three months or six months or 12 months by direct vote of the people?  Can anybody contemplate what is going to happen if he has to be so elected?  The Government will probably produce some candidate, and run him in the country, and probably because of the fact that they have produced him he will be opposed by candidates of other Parties, and in the circumstances <Col N="1221" /> through which we are now passing it is apparently calmly contemplated that we should have an election here by a direct vote of the people.  I think the whole thing is a mistake; I think it is short-sighted.  I think it is a variety of democracy that will not work, and, because it will not work, is no use.  I think it would be far better if we were to devise some scheme by which the President would be elected by a kind of electoral college representative of the Dáil and Seanad, with perhaps, if it is found desirable, some additional representative persons from outside the House.  At all events, the one thing we ought to do is to get away from the sheer nonsense of electing a President by the direct vote of the people.  The one way in which we will surely get a political President, the creature of the Party in power, is by having that President made the nominee of a political Party, hawked around the country by that political Party and shoved into office by the same political Party.  I think that is a mistake.  The Taoiseach should have been courageous enough to introduce an amendment to Article 12 of the Constitution, recognising that that scheme has not worked, that it will not work, and that there will be the same panic-stricken efforts next time to get agreement on the nomination of a particular person as President, in complete defiance of and for the purpose of getting behind the provisions of Article 12 of the Constitution.</P>
      <P>We come now to the amendment to Article 56 of the Constitution.  Section 5 of Article 56, which it is proposed to amend says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Nothing in this Constitution shall prejudice or affect the terms, conditions, remuneration or tenure of any person who was in any Governmental employment immediately prior to the coming into operation of this Constitution&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When this Constitution was being discussed by the Dáil advertence was had to the fact that, in Articles 77 and 78 of the old Constitution and in the Transferred Officers Compensation Act, <Col N="1222" /> 1929, certain Constitutional and statutory guarantees were given to transferred officers, and the point was made when we were discussing Article 56 of the Draft Constitution that at all events we should do nothing in Article 56 to wipe out those Constitutional guarantees contained in Articles 77 and 78 and the statutory guarantee in the Transferred Officers Compensation Act, 1929.  Arising out of consideration of that kind, Section 5 was put into the present Article 56 of the Constitution, saying:&mdash;&ldquo;Well, nothing in this Constitution shall prejudice whatever rights you previously had&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>This Article 56 which has the force of law, and by virtue of that is contained in this document described as &ldquo;Draft Constitution Approved by Dáil Eireann,&rdquo; is being amended under reference 28 in the present Bill, and the degree of amendment is set out on pages 22 and 23 of the green Bill which has been circulated to Deputies.  Now, the purpose of Article 56 as it at present stands is to say to transferred officers &ldquo;whatever rights you had under Articles 77 and 78 of the old Constitution, and whatever statutory rights you had under the Transferred Officers Compensation Act, 1929, still exist,&rdquo; because we provided definitely in subsection (5) of Article 56 that&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;nothing in this Constitution shall prejudice or affect the terms, conditions, remuneration or tenure of any person who was in any Governmental employment immediately prior to the coming into operation of this Constitution.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That section of that Article clearly left the position as it was.  In other words, so long as officers previously had Constitutional rights or statutory rights the position was not disturbed by the enactment of that Article.  That position was then clearly accepted by the Government.  Notwithstanding subsection (5) of Article 56, the Taoiseach comes along now to add&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Nothing in this Article shall <Col N="1224" /> operate to invalidate or restrict any legislation whatsoever which has been enacted or may be enacted hereafter applying to or prejudicing or affecting all or any of the matters contained in the next preceding subsection.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Although Section 5 of Article 56 provides that nothing in the Constitution shall affect or prejudice the rights of officers as compared with the rights which they previously had, we have an amendment now to the effect that, notwithstanding that apparent safeguard, nothing in that safeguard shall prevent anything being done in the future which will in fact completely obliterate any rights which officers have or had under Section 56 or under any previous Constitutional or statutory guarantee.</P>
    <P>I wonder what induced the Taoiseach to put in this amendment?  The Taoiseach knows that up to the present, notwithstanding the provisions of Section 56 (5), he has, in fact, violated the rights of transferred officers.  Transferred officers, under Articles 77 and 78 of the previous Constitution, and the 1929 Compensation Act, were entitled to have their remuneration calculated periodically by reference to the cost-of-living index figure.  There was to be a review of the remuneration upwards or downwards in accordance with the fluctuations in the cost-of-living figure, and for the best part of 17 years they had the experience of seeing that remuneration fall constantly under the downward tendency of the cost-of-living index figure; but, due to war conditions, the figure began to rise and the Government, which had pocketed all the advantages of the agreement with the transferred officers to have the remuneration adjusted in that way, suddenly decided that it would unilaterally repudiate the agreement to which it set its signature and by which it was morally and legally bound.  Having got all the advantages, it declined to put up with any of the disadvantages of a rising figure.</P>
    <P>The result of that unprecedented and dishonourable action&mdash;that is the only <Col N="1225" /> way I can describe it&mdash;on the part of the Government, an action which has been made applicable to people with less than £1 a week and to thousands with less than £2 a week, is that these people have felt it necessary to go to the courts to try to have their Constitutional rights vindicated.  A case has been entered for hearing in the courts in which these officers are seeking a declaration that they are entitled to have their rights construed with reference to the Constitutional position as set out in the present Constitution, in Article 77 and 78 of the previous Constitution and in the 1929 Compensation Act.  The Taoiseach is apparently now concerned that they have a very strong case, in view of the provisions of Article 56, and he is seeking to insert an amendment, the effect of which will be to legalise any action which may be taken by him, legislatively or under the Emergency Powers Act, to invalidate the guarantees given in Section 56.</P>
    <P>This amendment by the Taoiseach is clearly an attempt to get behind the courts.  It is clearly an effort to prejudice the position of the case now before the courts and clearly an effort to strengthen the Government's hand when it comes before the courts.  Not satisfied, apparently, with committing the act of which they have been guilty, now, when they are brought before their own court to have an opinion pronounced there upon the Constitutionality of their actions, they will not even be prepared to accept the judgment of the court.  In order to make sure that the judgment suits the Government, we get an amendment such as the one proposed to Section 56. The haste displayed here is positively indecent.  It shows that the Government is not prepared to allow the courts to adjudicate on a matter of this kind.  Instead, the Government want to create, in connection with the Constitution, an atmosphere of doubt so far as the officers are concerned and an assurance that those officers have not the rights which they are asking the court to decide they have.  That is a matter we can deal with more fully on the Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1226" /> I think the Taoiseach ought not to have introduced an amendment of this kind.  It would be better to have waited until we had more experience of the working of the Constitution and then an effort could be made to try to have the Constitution amended as a result of a detailed consideration of its provisions by an all-party committee of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>There are certain matters relating to this Bill which may properly be dealt with on the Second Stage.  Few of us will forget the Taoiseach's purple passage when he arrived in the House with a copy of the original Constitution and described it as a thing of rags and patches.  The rafters rang with Fianna Fáil cheers at that <i>tour de force.</i>  But to-day, after a comparatively short time, this workbag for a patchwork quilt has been presented to us.  Rags and patches! Whatever amendments were made in the previous Constitution had at least some substance and purpose in them.  Here are all the changes in a patchwork quilt produced as a great instrument of liberation.  Rags and patches!  These words should ring in the Taoiseach's ears and, if he wants to use one of the most capacious receptacles for that commodity, I can recommend him to the amending Bill of his own Constitution, which was described as the greatest instrument of liberty and democracy that this State had ever seen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There have been 28 amendments in the light of 18 months' experience.  I wonder, at the end of another 18 months, will the Taoiseach be longing to apply 28 more rags and patches to the patchwork quilt which he will then have placed us in possession of?  If he does, will he consider that an evidence of his own instability of character?  It has been emphasised, since this debate began, that this document and the Constitution that it is designed to amend are the children of the Taoiseach's brain, his own unaided begetting.  In that connection I always turn back, when I am obliged to attempt the task of probing the Taoiseach's purpose, to a manual of <Col N="1227" /> which I know him to be a close and ardent student&mdash;I turn back to a book written by a great mediaeval politician called Niccolo Machiavelli, in which I read the advice he gave to Prime Ministers of his day, and I must ask the indulgence of the House to trespass on their time for a few moments while I remind them of the advice that Niccolo Machiavelli gave to such men.  A Prime Minister, therefore,</P>
    <P>&ldquo;being compelled knowingly to adopt the beast, ought to choose the fox and the lion; because the lion cannot defend himself against snares and the fox cannot defend himself against wolves.  Therefore, it is necessary to be a fox to discover the snares and a lion to terrify the wolves.  Those who rely simply on the lion do not understand what they are about.  Therefore a wise lord cannot, nor ought he to, keep faith when such observance may be turned against him, and when the reasons that caused him to pledge it exist no longer.  If men were entirely good this precept would not hold, but because they are bad, and will not keep faith with you, you too are not bound to observe it with them.  Nor will there ever be wanting to a prince legitimate reasons to excuse this non-observance.  Of this endless modern examples could be given, showing how many treaties and engagements have been made void and of no effect through the faithlessness of princes; and he who has known best how to employ the fox has succeeded test.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;But it is necessary to know well how to disguise this characteristic&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>I invite Deputies to pay special attention to this paragraph.</P>
    <P>&mdash;and to be a great pretender and dissembler, and men are so simple&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>Especially in the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>
    <P>&mdash;and so subject to present necessities that he who seeks to deceive will always find someone who will allow himself to be deceived.  One <Col N="1228" /> recent example I cannot pass over in silence.</P>
    <P>And I may say in parenthesis that I have no desire to compare the Prime Minister with Alexander the Sixth.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Alexander the Sixth did nothing else but deceive men, nor ever thought of doing otherwise, and he always found victims; for there never was a man who had greater power in asserting, or who with greater oaths would affirm a thing, yet would observe it less; nevertheless his deceits always succeeded according to his wishes, because he well understood this side of mankind.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Therefore it is unnecessary for a prince to have all the good qualities I have enumerated, but it is very necessary to appear to have them.  And I shall dare to say this also, that to have them and always to observe them is injurious, and that to appear to have them is useful; to appear merciful, faithful, humane, religious, upright, and to be so, but with a mind so framed that should you require not to be so, you may be able and know how to change to the opposite.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;And you have to understand this, that a prince, especially a new one, cannot observe all those things far which men are esteemed, being often forced, in order to maintain the State, to act contrary to fidelity, friendship, humanity and religion. Therefore, it is necessary for him to have a mind ready to turn itself according as the winds and variations of fortune force it, yet, as I have said above, not to diverge from the good if he can avoid doing so, but, if compelled, then to know how to set about it.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;For this reason a prince ought to take care that he never lets anything slip from his lips that is not replete with the above-named five qualities, that he may appear to him who sees and hears him altogether merciful, faithful, humane, upright and religious.  There is nothing more <Col N="1229" /> necessary to appear to have than this last quality, inasmuch as men judge generally more by the eye than by the hand, because it belongs to everybody to see you, to few to come in touch with you.  Everyone sees what you appear to be, few really know what you are, and those few dare not oppose themselves to the opinion of the many, who have the majesty of the State to defend them; and in the actions of all men, and especially of princes, which it is not prudent to challenge, one judges by the result.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;For that reason, let a prince have the credit of conquering and holding his State, the means will always be considered honest, and he will be praised by everybody; because the vulgar are always taken by what a thing seems to be and by what comes of it; and in the world there are only the vulgar, for the few find a place there only when the many have no ground to rest on.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>It is true, and all the Constitution-mongering that goes on here is the best of politics, because, at the very moment when some unfortunate <Col N="1230" /> creature down the country is beginning to to say what she really thinks of the Prime Minister, somebody says: &ldquo;Whisht, you should not talk that way about him.  Did you not see the grand Constitution he is after writing, telling us all to reverence the Lord God Almighty and to be good Catholics, and everything else?  He is a great man&rdquo;.  He deliberately acquires that reputation by the Constitution-mongering that goes on from time to time here, and, in due course, if that reputation requires further reinforcement, we shall have a Constitution amendment propounded to the country by way of referendum, and he will be stalking through the country, like a modern prototype of Saint Paul, turning his back on all small matters and concerning himself before the people only with the loftiest considerations of individual liberty and the Constitutional rights of the sovereign Irish people, whereas we poor miserable politicians, tailing after him, will be talking about pigs and Indian-meal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is right and prudent that this House should recognise that aspect of the present proposal because that element enters into this business in no small measure.  Here we have the scholar Taoiseach, surrounded and harassed by smaller men, and he has the blessed assurance that not 5 per cent. of the citizens of this country have ever, or will ever, peruse this draft Bill, or know, or ever will know, what is in it, and he has the further assurance that not 10 per cent. of our people give two hoots about what is or is not in it.  But we, who are in this House, and know, from day to day and hour to hour, the dangers with which our country is confronted, and the measures requisite to meet and overcome them, cannot forbear to concentrate our minds on this question: if the crisis for which we were called upon to legislate 12 months ago had supervened 12 months after this Constitution became incapable of amendment, except by referendum, what would have happened this country? We might well have had chaos and anarchy before the requisite steps to keep the ship of State upon an even <Col N="1231" /> keel could have been taken, and, with that warning clearly before us, we announce that whereas experience has shown that certain amendments of the Constitution are necessary, we are going to abolish the only machinery whereby that Constitution can in future be expeditiously amended.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach says to this House:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The reason I still stand for that is that the experience which I, the Taoiseach, have had has satisfied me that these are all the amendments necessary and no reasonable posterity could differ from that conclusion, any more than any loyal member of the Fianna Fáil Party might be expected to differ from it to-day.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Such an attitude of mind, in my judgment, amounts to monomania.  Here is the Taoiseach coming to the House and saying:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;After the 18 months' experience of my time, I have found 18 or 20 amendments necessary, some of which I know require to be made over-night, some of which I took the responsibility of telling Dáil Eireann had to be given within 24 hours if the State was to be saved; but I say to posterity that no such circumstance can ever conceivably arise again, and I propose to bar and bolt that door so that if any successor of mine, as Prime Minister of this country, finds himself confronted with problems different from mine but equally urgent, he must suffer destruction and the sight of his country's destruction because I rendered the legislative machinery of this country so rigid in my day that it was beyond his power to take the steps requisite to safeguard the State.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Conceive the situation that would have arisen if my leader, Deputy Cosgrave, when he was President of this country, had retained in the Constitution which he was responsible for recommending to the country the proviso that amendments could not have been made except by referendum, and that Constitution was in <Col N="1232" /> operation when the crisis came upon us last October 12 months.  According to the words of the present Taoiseach, had that been so, he could not have taken responsibility for maintaining the State in safety for an hour. Through the foresight and the prescience of Deputy Cosgrave, that provision was removed from the old Constitution&mdash;admittedly, over the frantic protests of the present Taoiseach.  The wisdom and foresight of the men who took that provision out were amply vindicated by the events through which we passed.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies may think that the Taoiseach had in mind, when recommending the Constitution of 1939 to this House, that crises lay ahead which might, conceivably, require its rapid amendment.  That is not true.  The Taoiseach believed, when passing this new Constitution through the House, that he had made ample provision to meet all emergencies which could arise and that, by taking certain steps in conformity with the text of that Constitution, he could provide himself with all the powers requisite to meet any threat to the country.  But, when the time came, he found that the powers he had fashioned were insufficient and that nothing but an amendment of the Constitution would meet the situation with which he was confronted.  I think that the Taoiseach would be well advised to consider further the question of whether this rigidity should be preserved in the Constitution.  Even if he cannot bring himself in these tumultuous times to recommend a permanent decision on that matter to the people, he would be well advised to ask the people for a rest-period during which a final decision might be taken and meanwhile extend the operation of the section which requires a referendum after a given day, so that in the interval thus purchased all parties in the State might combine to take counsel with a view to determining whether the extra safeguard provided by that Article is worth the added danger which our own experience teaches is inherent in such a plan.</P>
    <P>I appeal not only to our own experience but to the experience of the <Col N="1233" /> United States of America.  In the U.S.A., there is a provision that the Constitution cannot be altered except as the result of the consent of a very considerable number of the constituent States of the Federation.  What has been the result of that?  On every modern development of social reform in the U.S.A., constitutional crises of the first magnitude have arisen.  There is fresh in the memory of us all the strange expedient which the Roosevelt administration resorted to when they introduced the Supreme Court Bill, because the Constitution was incapable of amendment except by a long, tedious procedure.  They put into the court men whose views were well known on the interpretation of certain sections of the Constitution which the then administration desired to amend and were unable to do.  The administration was quite determined to have the interpretation of these sections coincide with their view rather than the view of the Supreme Court, as expressed on different occasions.  Only two weeks ago a decision was taken by the Supeme Court reversing itself and making child-labour illegal in the United States.  It is hard for the people of this country to realise that, in certain of the States of the United States Federation, conditions relating to child-labour were much the same as those that obtained in industrial England in the first half of the nineteenth century and that it was impossible to change them.  The referendum made change impossible.  The only means by which they could be changed was by carrying on a struggle with the Supreme Court which went on from 1914 to 1941.  Only a few days ago has a decision been secured from the Supreme Court interpreting the Constitution to mean that it was within the power of the Federal Government of the United States to make child-labour illegal in inter-State commerce &mdash;a thing which was effected in the internal economy of Great Britain 70 years ago.</P>
    <P>Is it desired that the Legislature of this country should, in respect of matters which could arise here, be so supremely hamstrung as that?  What <Col N="1234" /> useful purpose is served?  If this country were cursed by a Government which desired to oppress a minority, would a bit of paper hold it up?  Is there any country where a minority has been protected against a really ruthless majority by a paper Constitution? What do dictators care about written Constitutions under which they take power?  The Chancellor of the German Reich, Herr Hitler, was most scrupulous in observance of the constitution of the Weimar Republic when he entered into the Chancellorship. Has he protected the Socialists and Catholics of Germany?  Has Marshal Petain abided by the constitution of the Third Republic?  Did Stalin carefully consider the Duma constitution of Russia?  Has any minority which was really confronted with a resolute determination on the part of the majority to oppress and grind them down secured safe refuge in a paper Constitution? That does not argue&mdash;although I am no lover of Constitutions <i>per se</i>&mdash;that it may not be useful to have a written statement of one's rights from day to day so that the individual citizen will have Constitutional safeguards against the executive of the day, with a general understanding amongst all parties that there will be ready submission to the text of the Constitution. But if that be its sole purpose, what objection can there possibly be to leaving it in the hands of the Legislature, which can readily be called together, to make amendments to the Constitution if such amendments are promptly needed for the preservation of the State?  All this abracadabra about a referendum is designed to prevent an unscrupulous executive from taking away the fundamental rights of a minority.  In my submission, no unscrupulous minority in any country has been so deterred, though, many a time and oft, an individual citizen has invoked the fundamental law to protect himself from bureaucracy or from a Minister.  When the court declared the fundamental law to be on the side of the citizen, then it was the wish of all parties in the State to compel the executive or the bureaucracy to mend its hand.  For that reason, some argument can be made for the written Constitution <Col N="1235" /> but I do not think it is a very coercive argument.  But it can be made. In my submission, when the rag-bag has been produced, the rag-bag of 26 patches, the Taoiseach in forbearing to add another tatter to the rag-bag's collection, to put in one useful piece of cloth amongst the fustian which would deliver us from this rigidity which may well threaten the State, has not shown on this particular occasion any, of that remarkable political sagacity with which I credited him.</P>
    <P>The last thing I want to say on this Constitution is this.  I think the Second Stage of a Constitution (Amendment) Bill is the appropriate stage on which to say that too many people in this country and in many other countries in the world to-day are allowing themselves to be dazzled by the proposition that a Constitution written upon paper, or a new order evolved by some individual's mind, is going to provide a charter of freedom and justice for all men under which the world is to blossom and prosper and is going to create a world in which all men will receive their own.  No greater illusion could bewilder the minds of men.  The fact is that it is not the system of Government that matters; it is the men who operate it.  It does not matter what order you evolve, or what Constitution you write, if those who are charged with the task of administering it do not approach that task with the reverence and sense of duty that that responsibility should imply, then the Constitution might as well never have been written or the order never evolved.</P>
    <P>It is not Constitutions and orders that require amendment in our day, but rather the hearts of men.  There is no use in the legislators of this State, who are responsible for the welfare of our people, shuffling off that responsibility to any written document or any political concept. The evils from which our people suffer and the evils from which the peoples of the world suffer to-day are not due to Constitutions or orders. They are due to the failure of those <Col N="1236" /> who operate those Constitutions and those orders, old or new, to operate them in accordance with the sovereign law of God.  That is the plain fact. We are, all too frequently, thumping our craws, and protesting our devotion to Christian principles.  If public men in this and other countries would practise Christian principles and would adopt as their slogan, justice and charity, instead of <i>liberté, egalite and fraternité, Deutschland uber Alles</i>, or, &ldquo;My country, may she be always right, but my country right or wrong&rdquo;, 99 per cent. of the world's problems would be solved.  But the truth of the matter is that 99.9 of us who should face that responsibility, turn our backs upon it and soothe our consciences by writing documents analogous to this Constitution and by piously amending them from time to time, hoping that by the application of these rags and patches to the inadequate hyprocrisy enshrined in Bunreacht na hEireann we will succeed in getting paper and print to do for us what no one but ourselves can do.</P>
    <P>To be perfectly frank, I do not give two fiddle-dee-dee's what amendments we make in the Constitution.  I do not think it matters a damn, except that we should make it as amendable as it is possible to make it.  There is only one thing in that Constitution that really matters and that is bad. That is its rigidity.  Remove that element from it and I do not give a fiddle-dee-dee what you do to it.  I do not want to appear to preach, and I do not want to exclude myself for one moment from the great minority; but I do deliberately say, and it ought to be said on the Second Reading of this Bill, that changing Constitutions or orders will avail the people nothing. Change is necessary, but it is a change in the hearts of men.  We in this country should and could give an example to the world that that change could, in practice, be made.  I see very little evidence of it on the hustings at the present time.  I only hope that some day may dawn when, instead of advocating it, all of us in this House may salute its advent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnLymbrickEsmonde" hpid="Mr. Esmonde Mr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I have in my hands a <Col N="1237" /> copy of the Constitution which has been referred to so often in this debate.  I was one of those who voted against that Constitution along with a very considerable minority of the people of the country.  But, as a member of this House, I must treat this document with very great respect, as it does represent the Constitution of our country.  As a member of this House, I think there is a duty imposed on us to interpret that document by our actions here, not only in the letter but also in the spirit.  I believe that some of the amendments which are sought to be made by this Bill are entirely contrary to the bargain that the people made with themselves when they enacted this Constitution. I have only to refer to two sentences in the preamble:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;We, the people of Éire, do hereby adopt and enact and give to ourselves this Constitution.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The supreme power in this country is derived from the people of this country and put in legal form in this document.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is only fair to assume, though I do not think it actually was so, for the purpose of discussion here and of finding out what our duties are, that those people who did enact this Constitution knew what they were about and knew what it meant.  Article 51, which is referred to in the preamble to this Bill, gives both Houses the right, without seeking any further mandate from the people, within a period of three years to amend the Constitution. I submit that is a very reasonable clause to be put there for one purpose and for one purpose only.  It is natural to assume that, in a trial of a document of this kind, there would arise the necessity for certain small adjustments here and there.  The Constitution would want a shake down during its first few years of working.  Therefore, when the people were asked to tie their hands and to tie the hands of this Assembly I submit that, under Article 51, it was done on the basis that there would have to be re-drafting of sections here and there, the reconciling of the two languages in which <Col N="1238" /> the Constitution is written, and so forth.  In so far as a number of these amendments seek to do that, there is-no breach of faith with the people of the country, but, in other respects, and particularly in respect to two of the matters which the Taoiseach referred to as going beyond ordinary drafting amendments, I do think there is a breach of faith.</P>
    <P>The first point I would refer to is the amendment to Article 28.  Other speakers adverted to what would have happened if the European war had not broken out for a period of more than three years after the coming into operation of the Constitution.  In September, 1939, as a result of the crisis which then arose, and in the emergency which existed here as a result of the outbreak of the European war, a war likely to last for some time, Constitution (Amendment) No. 1 Act was passed, not for the primary reason of amending the Constitution, of giving any greater rights or providing any greater safeguards than existed, but so that this House could take away from itself and give to officials in the employment of the Government the right to legislate&mdash;the right which we were sent here to discharge.  That was done so that the Emergency Powers Act could be passed, and so that hasty legislation, by means of emergency orders, could be passed.  We see these orders appear from day to day.  It enabled things to be done which, in normal circumstances, would, in a great many respects, violate the principles of this Constitution.  That was all very well but, at that time, I think it was straining the meaning which one would attach to the words &ldquo;time of war&rdquo; in Article 28.  The amendment sought in amendment No. 21 in the Schedule is an amendment of words to be added to words that have already been put in by the Constitution (Amendment) No. 1 Act.  In that Act the people declared that all the laws of this country would be invalid if passed in a certain manner, except during a time of war, revolution, and so forth.  It was for the purpose of meeting the situation that existed at the time that the Constitution (Amendment) <Col N="1239" /> No. 1 Act was passed.  We were asked to strain the meaning of Article 28 by reading into &ldquo;time of war&rdquo; to include.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;... a time when there is taking place an armed conflict in which the State is not a participant, but in respect of which each of the Houses of the Oireachtas shall have resolved that, arising out of such armed conflict, a national emergency exists affecting the vital interests of the State&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>That was passed by this House.  I submit it was something that was never contemplated in the spirit of the Constitution, or in Article 28 that was amended.  Now, that is the thin end of the wedge.  As a result of the passing of Constitution (Amendment) No. 1 Act matters involving property, liberty and other very important functions are sent out in legal form from an office desk by some official in the employment of one of the Departments of State.  That is the effect of the powers given by the Constitution (Amendment) No. 1 Act, and by the Emergency Powers Act of 1939, but it does not stop there, because this Bill which we are discussing now places the time in which civil servants can still govern this country beyond the period when the war would have come to an end.  I would submit that some very strong reasons should be advanced by the Taoiseach before he asks the House to grant those powers, because what I have said is the effect of them&mdash;to give the right to issue those orders that we receive by post almost every morning after the European war is over.  If it is necessary that those powers should be retained by the Executive, and that those functions should be taken away from the Legislature for a period beyond the duration of the war, I suggest that we should not abrogate our rights but should fix some limit of time.</P>
    <P>I think that some time limit should be fixed, because, as the Constitution will read when this Bill is passed, as undoubtedly it will be passed, it would be open to a Government to carry on <Col N="1240" /> for ever and ever by order unless a resolution, such as is contemplated here, be passed.  The second matter I would like to have some information on is that in regard to <i>habeas corpus.</i></P>

      <P>I was about to deal with the amendment to Article 40 of the Constitution contained in reference No. 25 in the Schedule to the Bill.  The section which it is proposed to amend, sub-section (2) of Section 4, Article 40, says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Upon complaint being made by or on behalf of any person that he is being unlawfully detained, the High Court and any and every judge thereof ....&rdquo;</P>
      <P>In the new sub-section proposed to be substituted, the words &ldquo;any and every judge&rdquo; do not appear.  I take it the intention of the Taoiseach&mdash;or perhaps I am misinterpreting the position&mdash;is that the right to go to one judge only will exist to a person who is unlawfully detained, and that, having had a conditional order refused by one judge, he cannot then proceed to another judge to obtain such conditional order.  That right apparently existed before by use of the words &ldquo;any and every judge.&rdquo; Those words are changed now to the words &ldquo;to the High Court or any judge thereof.&rdquo;  I do not know whether or not there is any intention behind that change, but I think it is a matter which should be looked into.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Constitution was being amended for the last time by this House, I think there was a number of matters that could have been included and were properly the subject matter for amendment.  There is one which I should like to mention, and possibly I will be alone in my views on this; certainly I will find myself in violent conflict with the leader of the Labour Party.  I think a situation should never arise again when the people would be deprived of their right to elect the head of the State, the President.  It has been mentioned here in debate that it is hoped that in future there would never be an election for President, and that there would <Col N="1241" /> always be some accommodation by all Parties with regard to an agreed nominee.  I think that is very bad.  I think it is wrong; I think it is taking away from the people a right which they understood they had, and creating the impression that the members of this House will come together and agree behind the people's backs to deprive them of the right to choose the head of the State.  I think something should be included in the Constitution, even at this late stage, to prevent a similar situation arising again as arose at the election of the first President.</P>

      <P>I can imagine, in happier days pre-war and possibly in happier days post war, this House spending, as it has already spent, two and a quarter hours discussing amendments to the Constitution.  As one of my reasons for voting against the Second Stage of this Bill, I propose to say first of all that it is sheer waste of time in this House to discuss this matter at present when there are hundreds of other more urgent things to be dealt with.  I believe it is waste of time to discuss this Bill now.  At the last sitting of this House there was a motion before us dealing with a matter that, under the Constitution as it exists, affected thousands of people and their families, and that put a number of people and a number of children in this country on to the very verge of starvation, a period employment order which was enforced under the existing Constitution, and we got three hours to discuss it.  There will be more than three hours spent in discussing this Bill.</P>

      <P>If that is the way the Taoiseach feels about it, will he get up now and withdraw the Bill, and let us discuss the things that ought to ibe discussed in this House?  On this Order Paper there are at least five motions dealing with tillage, dealing with foot-and-mouth disease, and dealing with supplies.  When the orders for the day were being given, and the Taoiseach <Col N="1242" /> was asked whether time would be provided for those motions, he was practically sarcastic in the manner in which he refused the movers of those motions Government time or even Private Members' time in which to discuss them.  For once in his life the Taoiseach made a serious speech; he made it in Limerick last Saturday.  If that speech in Limerick had any good effect in the country, if it brought home to the country the serious position in which this State is now, that good is completely gone when the Parliament of this country spends two and a quarter hours and will probably spend another couple of hours discussing futile amendments to the Constitution. I do not intend to waste the time of the House for more than five minutes. I would be quite satisfied to discuss amendments to the Constitution from any point of view at any other time, but, at the present time, when the people of this country are hungry and do not know where they will get their next meal, when the farmers of the country are scared and frightened owing to the mishandling by the Government of the tillage situation, owing to the mishandling by the Government of the seeds and manure situation, and owing to the mishandling by the Government of the foot-and-mouth situation, I think it is scandalous waste of time in this House and making a laughing stock of the Parliament of this country that we should be discussing 28 amendments to the Constitution, most of which are being brought in because the Irish in the original Constitution was not correctly phrased.  I do not want to waste the time of the House now, because I believe it is being scandalously wasted.  As far as I am concerned, and on behalf of my constituents, I resent the time of the House being wasted on fiddling with Constitutions when the people of this country are being driven to desperation every hour of the day because the Taoiseach and every Minister under him are scandalously mishandling the situation.  If the Taoiseach, in regard to the really serious matters facing the country at the present time, took one-tenth of the interest which he takes in fiddling with Constitutions, I would be <Col N="1243" /> glad to give him time to deal with this matter.  If the Taoiseach says we are wasting time here, will he get up and withdraw this Bill now, and not waste any more time on it?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I gather that there are two points of view on whether or not this Bill should be properly and adequately discussed.  My colleague, Deputy Linehan, has just given utterance to one point of view, for which there is much to be said.  In the interruption which the Prime Minister made a few minutes ago, he gave utterance to another point of view, because he rather sarcastically said there probably would be more than three hours occupied on this side of the House.  The only meaning of that was that we should not discuss this matter at all while Deputy Linehan thinks that there are other matters more vital to the interests of the people which should be discussed.  The Prime Minister rather suggested to me that he takes the attitude in regard to this amendment to the Constitution which he took on the original discussion of the Constitution when it was going through this House.  It could be summed up in one statement: whatever he said was to go, and whatever his views on the Constitution were they were to be accepted irrespective of discussion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not intend to occupy the time of the House to any great extent.  This Bill is largely a Bill dealing with detail.  There are one or two fundamental changes which it proposes to make.  I approach the consideration even of those fundamental changes with no degree whatever of enthusiasm. In saying that, I think I am reflecting the view of the people in general towards the Constitution which has now been in existence for about three years.  The people have almost completely forgotten that there is such a thing as a Constitution.  Perhaps the only knowledge they will have that there is a Constitution in the country is the fact that we are going to amend it here in this House.  As I said, there are one or two fundamental changes which are proposed to be made under <Col N="1244" /> this Bill.  The chief one has been referred to by Deputy Esmonde, that is the change in reference to the clause dealing with the right of the citizen to writ of <i>habeas corpus</i> in the High Court.</P>
    <P>It is proposed, as I understand the amendment to Article 40 of the Constitution, to take away what has been in this country since the establishment of the State in 1922, the fundamental right of the citizen to apply to any and every judge of the High Court for a writ of <i>habeas corpus</i> which will give him the right to have his detention investigated by any and every judge of the High Court.  That right was enshrined in the Constitution of 1922. It was carried forward in the amendment of the Constitution which was introduced a couple of years ago and which is now the Constitution of this State.  Any person who claimed that he was unlawfully being detained had the right to apply to any judge of the High Court for a writ of <i>habeas corpus.</i>  He had the right, not merely to apply to any judge of the High Court, but to select the particular judge to whom he would make his application.  That right, which was embodied in the original Constitution of this State, was really taken over from the law as it stood before the coming into being of this State.</P>
    <P>It was even in the Black and Tan times the right of the subject to approach any judge of the High Court and apply for a writ of <i>habeas corpus</i> so that his detention could be inquired into and the judge would determine whether or not he was being unlawfully detained.  He had the right to select his judge and, if he was refused that right, either on the original application for a conditional order of <i>habeas corpus</i> or if, after a plenary hearing, the particular judge refused him the right of <i>habeas corpus</i>, he had the right to walk into the chambers or the private residence of any other judge of the High Court and demand, as of right, the issuing of a writ of <i>habeas corpus</i>, and that judge was entitled and bound to issue that writ irrespective, if he so pleased, of the decision of one of his colleagues.</P>
    <P>That was a valuable right and not <Col N="1245" /> merely a theoretical right.  There is at least one man alive to-day who would have been dead 18 or 19 years ago if that right did not exist.  There was a case in which I was engaged&mdash;it was the case of Egan and Macready&mdash;and it was heard in 1921, at the height of the Black and Tan régime.  Every High Court judge had been tried up to that.  The decision of the King and Allen had applied and every judge of the High Court had refused to grant a writ of <i>habeas corpus</i> or inquire into whether the people who were then fighting the fight for freedom were being lawfully detained or whether they were under lawful sentence of death.</P>
    <P>There was only one man left, the late Master of the Rolls, who at one time adorned the Supreme Court of this State.  He was the only judge left, and he had the courage, in spite of his upbringing and outlook, to remember that it was the judicial tradition, even in the old days, that <i>habeas corpus</i> took precedence of every business.  He stopped his Chancery business, his ordinary court business, when we applied to him for a conditional order in the case of Egan, who subsequently became Lieutenant Egan.  He gave the conditional order for the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i> and subsequently heard it himself and, notwithstanding that every one of his colleagues of the High Court had declined to pass judgment owing to the case of the King and Allen, he gave independent consideration to the matters put forward.  He gave independent judgment, with the result that there is one man alive who would not have been alive if that right was not in existence.</P>
    <P>That very valuable Constitutional right was preserved and given authority in the original Constitution of this State.  I should have said that the particular person in that case of Egan and Macready was under sentence of death, but it was implied.  He was under a sentence of death and was saved from death by only a few hours. That right was embodied in our original Constitution and was continued in the amendment of the Constitution, but in this amendment of the <Col N="1246" /> Constitution it is proposed to be taken away.</P>
    <P>I was not here when the Taoiseach was making his Second Reading speech.  I do not know whether he has attempted to give the House and the country any justification for these proposals. It is a very radical and fundamental inroad on the Constitutional rights of the citizen.  I think the House and the people are entitled to know the reasons impelling the Government to introduce so fundamental an amendment of the Constitution.  This Bill is largely confined to very minor and entirely unimportant amendments, amendments for which I personally think there is not the slightest need. Amongst the whole of them this one stands out.  It may be the Taoiseach or the Government have some reason for this.</P>
    <P>The right was exercised in recent times, within the last year or two, and one judge did grant a writ of <i>habeas corpus.</i>  The right was exercised by people who were alleged to be unlawfully detained by the Government of this State, and I think the counsel refused to go on with the case before three judges of the High Court, and that right was conceded to the person detained.  His right to have his case heard by one judge was within the last 12 or 18 months conceded by our courts.  It is a very valuable right, a right which is very inconvenient at times to the Government. It was to the last Government when the members of the present Government were operating in a somewhat illegal fashion outside this House and inconvenient to the Government of the present time when they are asking people to obey without question their orders and dictates, whether embodied in laws or in the sheaves of administrative orders that emanate from Government Departments hourly.</P>
    <P>We had the Minister for Supplies appealing at the university the other night for implicit obedience to the Government, for an implicit following of the dictates of the Government in connection with administrative orders which nobody can follow and which sometimes people cannot buy.  Implicit obedience to the Government and reverence for the law will not be obtained <Col N="1247" /> unless the citizen knows that the rights which he has are respected. It is, perhaps, not a matter which I should comment upon, but it is not without its significance that, when this point is being raised here, and raised seriously by me, the Tánaiste carries on a facetious conversation with the Parliamentary Secretary.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether we will have any reply to this matter.  I anticipate the reply will be that this point is being raised by Constitutional lawyers who have specialised in making such points over the last few years.  That may be so, but at all events something of a fundamental character, which will recoil on the democratic institutions of this country, is being slipped in under the cover of futile and ridiculous amendments in this Bill.</P>
    <P>That is the big fundamental change that is being made in this Bill.  Slipped in along with it and in the same clause, or in the same Article, another inroad is being made.  We find in the first proposed amendment to the Constitution the matters to which I have referred. We find that not merely is the citizen prevented from selecting his judge, but he is prevented from going from judge to judge.  We find the President of the High Court can himself select the judge and that he can have not one judge, but three judges, if he likes, and we find that the right and initiative passes from the citizen into the President of the High Court.  We find, further, that in a case which involves the invalidity of a law, according to the Constitution, where a person is illegally detained by a law which, in the opinion of the High Court, infringes the Constitution&mdash;I wait until the conversation between the Tánaiste and the Parliamentary Secretary has concluded; I am interrupting it.  We find, as I was saying, that when a case being heard and investigated by the High Court is one in which the person complaining is being detained under a law which, in the opinion of the High Court, is invalid, having regard to the provisions of the Constitution, provision is made, not that that person shall be immediately released, but that he shall be <Col N="1248" /> detained; that the opinion of the High Court that the provision of that law is invalid according to this Constitution is not to be given immediate effect to, but that a case is to be stated by the High Court for the opinion of the Supreme Court as to whether the High Court is right or wrong.</P>
    <P>One would have thought that the old tradition, going back for centuries and derived from the British common law, from which we have derived many of the best principles embodied in this Constitution, would be given effect to in this State which supposes itself to be one of the most democratic States in the world.  It has always been held, and was always the law, and still is the law, that if any judge grants a writ of <i>habeas corpus</i> and orders the release of the person seeking that writ, no appeal from the granting of that writ lay to any higher tribunal, that it was the Constitutional right of the citizen, subsequent to the foundation of this State, immediately to be released and that the State&mdash;the Crown in the old days and the State in the days subsequent to the setting-up of this State&mdash;was not entitled to appeal from that decision.  The position was that a person refused the grant of a writ of <i>habeas corpus</i> was entitled to appeal.</P>
    <P>That was established by the House of Lords, but it was made quite clear in the case I have referred to, Egan and Macready, that while Clifford and O'Sullivan had established in the House of Lords that the subject or citizen had the right to appeal, the Crown or Executive had no such right.  That was the position that existed until this amendment, bringing our democratic Constitution up-to-date, was introduced. The Prime Minister in the course of his career around the country, during the general election at which this Constitution was submitted to the people for their opinion, used to ask the people to read this Constitution and to ponder upon it.  As I say, the people have forgotten there is such a Constitution since, but if they read or ponder on the Constitution and on this amendment of it, they will be still more convinced that a written Constitution is no safeguard of their liberties, and that this last amendment is the greatest <Col N="1249" /> inroad upon the constitutional liberty of the citizen that has been made since the establishment of this State.</P>
    <P>Before these considerations, the other matters pale into insignificance. I should like to know, however, in passing, why it is that there should be a provision continuing the state of emergency and, in effect, suspending the provisions of the Constitution, after the war has ended or the emergency has passed.  I do not know what the justification for that is.  We may recall here that Acts which were introduced into the British House of Commons during the last European War are still law here under the provisions of the Constitution which it is proposed now further to amend and extend. The Government have wide powers, granted to them under the Emergency Powers Act, which, in effect, nullify and suspend the provisions of the Constitution, and it is proposed under this amendment to allow that state of affairs to be continued indefinitely after the war has ended or the emergency has passed. The provision is that the emergency legislation&mdash;put plainly, the suspension of the Constitution&mdash;is to continue until both Houses of the Oireachtas determine otherwise.</P>
    <P>We know the composition of the Seanad as it stands at present under the beneficent auspices of the present Government; we know that we have in this House government by the Party system, and by a majority, and that that system is reflected in the constitution of the Seanad; in other words, this proposed amendment of the Constitution allows, if it is not designed to allow, the Government, after the war, for an indefinite period which can be prolonged by virtue of their majority in this House, and the Seanad, which reflects the political complexion of this House, to continue the state of affairs in which the Constitution is amended and emergency legislation in full force and effect.  I gather that the Prime Minister, in moving the Second Reading of the Bill, did not give any justification for these proposals.  I should be interested to hear of any justification, and will perhaps look forward to returning <Col N="1250" /> to the charge on this matter during the Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>There is one minor matter which is, perhaps, not a matter for Second Reading, but upon which I should personally like to have some light or leading from the Prime Minister as to the justification for it.  I know that he is following a precedent established by the Supreme Court in the last few months.  The proposed amendment is that the Constitution should be amended so as to provide that, in effect, when the Supreme Court is pronouncing judgment on the validity or invalidity of a law, having regard to the provisions of the Constitution, only one judgment is to be given, and that one judgment is to be the judgment of the court.  That may be a very convenient method of dealing with the situation, both from the point of view of the Government and the judiciary.  The precedent for it, of course, exists in the practice of the Court of Criminal Appeal, where the practice is that only one judge pronounces the judgment of the court.  It is, perhaps, easy to see reasons for that, which, incidentally, is taken from the British practice.  It is, perhaps, desirable that in a case in which a person has appealed to the Court of Criminal Appeal from the verdict and sentence of a judge and jury, there should not be any apparent doubt as to the correctness of that verdict and sentence.</P>
    <P>It might be, particularly in the case of death, undesirable that there should be apparent any want of unanimity of judicial opinion.  I cannot say how that applies to matters affecting the Constitution.  It is vital that in questions affecting the validity or invalidity of laws under the Constitution, if there is to be any respect for the Constitution, that each and every judge of the Supreme Court should deliver a written judgment, if possible.  I do not want to make any observations in this House which might appear to be contrary to what my intentions are, in the nature of preaching on their duties to the Supreme Court, but I suggest that the public will be better served, that Constitutional lawyers will be much more interested, and probably that it <Col N="1251" /> will tend towards a more accurate decision, a wider view of the Constitution, and a deeper interest by Constitutional lawyers and the public if, in a matter affecting the validity of law, and involving the interpretation of clauses of the Constitution, there should be a written judgment by each and every member of the highest tribunal in the land that is determining the validity of that law, and determining the provisions of the Constitution.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand this Bill is necessary, in the opinion of the Government, because of the fact that the time for making changes by legislation expires within the next few months.  A common-sense amendment which should be embodied in this Bill would be one which would give this House power to amend the Constitution at any time without difficulty, or without going through the form of appealing to the people through a Referendum.  It is not right that in a case of serious emergency this House should be debarred from amending the Constitution whenever it thinks fit.  For that reason, if there is to be any amendment at the present time, it should be one to empower this House-to amend the Constitution at any time by legislation.  Because of the time limit in the existing Constitution, we are compelled here and now to devote Parliamentary time to the consideration of this Bill.  If it were not for the fact that there is a time limit, the time of this House could be occupied much more usefully than dealing with the complicated clauses of the Constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since this Bill has been introduced I think there are serious omissions in the changes that it is proposed to make.  The most obvious omission is the failure to change the system of electing the head of the State.  No one who takes a serious interest in public life agrees that the present system of electing the President is a good or a desirable one.  Means were found by which it was possible to avoid an election in the case of the first President, but it is not likely that it will be always possible or desirable to <Col N="1252" /> avoid an election.  If the Presidency was a position with political or executive power, similar to that which exists in the United States of America, there would be reasonable justification for having an election, but having regard to the fact that the head of the State here occupies more or less of a judicial position, it is neither proper nor desirable that an election should be held, and it is not likely that a President elected by the machinery provided by the existing Constitution would be the best person to discharge the functions of the head of the State.  We would all prefer that every honour and dignity should be attached to the office of President, and for that reason it is undesirable that the first step in the election of a President should be through a general election.  That is the first amendment which seems to be urgently called for, and if it could be included in this Bill it would greatly improve the Constitution.</P>
    <P>Another amendment that is urgently called for is in regard to the election of the Executive by this House.  In most public bodies and voluntary associations the executive is usually elected by the members.  This House when electing a Government is compelled under the Constitution to follow the example and the precedent established in Great Britain of having a purely party system of government.  That is to say, the head of the Government is elected and he is empowered to select Ministers.  The amendment of the Constitution which the country would desire would be one which would empower this House to elect a government by proportional representation so that we would have a government which would be representative of all parties.  The principle of proportional representation is adopted in the election of Deputies.  It is logical that the same system should be extended to the election of the Executive by this House. That would be in the best national interest, as it would give us at the present time an all-party or national government, which would be the best government to lead the country in the crisis through which we are passing. There is no reason why the Party system should be ever embodied in the <Col N="1253" /> Constitution or why it should be continued, especially when an opportunity is provided in this Bill to make a change.  A most desirable amendment of the Constitution would be one to enable this House to elect a representative government by proportional representation.  If that were done we might have a more efficient Government, a Government which would be better qualified to deal with our pressing economic, social and financial problems. I ask the Government to reconsider this Bill and to introduce the changes suggested.  I also ask that the period within which it would be possible to amend the Constitution, when considered necessary, should be extended.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to draw attention to one aspect of this Bill which I think is of importance to the community. I think the Government are quite right in deciding that the mere ending of hostilities in Europe and in the world generally does not conclude the emergency so far as we are concerned. I think it is very important that the public should be aware of the value of the particular section of this Bill which deals with that position. Even assuming that we are happily left in a state of peace at the end of this war, many of the conditions which obtain during the war so far as our economic life is concerned may be even more onerous when the war is over. For example, at the end of the war, no matter what may be the result, our external income may have collapsed to a point where we shall have to exercise the most drastic choice in regard to our imports from countries with whom we have no normal trade.  The idea that at the end of the war we can suddenly start to purchase maize from the Argentine is one which is associated simply with the most extravagant optimism. We may not have the means to trade with the Argentine so far as maize is concerned if we have not got the income derived now from external investments with which to pay for the maize, and we may have to make use of powers to decide what we shall do with what will be a diminished income in order to secure the economic life of our people, and to secure employment. <Col N="1254" /> Therefore, so far as the choice of our imports and their direction are concerned, we shall certainly require emergency powers long after the war has terminated.</P>
      <P>Secondly, so far as the rationing of commodities is concerned, acute scarcity may obtain for a considerable period after the war.  It may obtain through stronger nations than ourselves purchasing raw materials which will become available at the end of hostilities by making use of their own powers to do so and leaving us short. In a similar way we shall have to make the rationing powers available under the Emergency Act for a long time after the war ceases.  Again the question arises that we may in certain cases have a surplus of very high priced commodities in this country, either produced at home in dire need, or else actually obtained by manufacturers who had the courage to buy when such materials were available.  If, at the end of the war, we are allowed to import freely commodities at a very low price while having those stocks bought at a very high price, the result may prove disastrous to a number of people, with the result that there will be increasing unemployment.  That would particularly apply in the case of turf. Very huge stocks of turf may be accumulated at the end of the war, and it is essential to make use of the emergency powers to see that these stocks are liquidated in the interests of the farmers.</P>
      <P>The same thing applies to the mobilisation of our securities.  It may even be necessary at the end of the war, when there is a condition approaching financial, chaos in the world, for us to make use of very drastic powers to control the savings of our own people in the interests of the community, and it is obviously essential that those powers now carried by the Government under emergency orders should continue, so that we will have those powers for some considerable time after the war has ended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then, again, we may have to consider making use of our emergency powers to direct our exports in the manner best suited to the economy of the country.  For example, it may be <Col N="1255" /> more convenient for us to send surplus seed potatoes to some particular country from whom we receive goods rather than to countries with whom we normally trade.  It may be necessary, in order to compensate for the loss of our external income resulting from a long war which will affect the whole world, including ourselves, to take drastic action to stimulate our exports by means which, in normal times, would be considered unnecessary. There, again, the continuance of the emergency situation is obviously essential.  Equally, steps which we have taken to preserve public order may, unfortunately, prove only too necessary for a long period after the war.  I feel quite certain, so far as the economic life of the country is concerned, that the whole emergency system under which we operate will be more vitally necessary at the end of the war, no matter who may be the victor and under what conditions the war is concluded.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The first remarks I should reply to are those of Deputy Linehan, who said that we have a lot of very important work to do and we should not spend time dealing with amendments which in their character do not appear to be vital to the Constitution. The reason we are dealing with them now is because the three-year period is practically up; because the moment the 24th June is passed it will not be open to the Oireachtas to amend the Constitution without a referendum.  The period of three years was to give time during which the operation of the Constitution could be observed, and the various Departments which might be affected by it could have it under observation so far as the work of each Department was concerned; and that at the end a report should be made to the Government of the day so that they would be in a position to bring in such amendments as experience might have proved to be valuable.  Now the time is running out.  I should like to remind Deputies that one thing that was deliberately excluded by the Constitution itself from the power of the Oireachtas, even during those three years, was to <Col N="1256" /> change Articles 46 and 51, because, if there is to be any use in a Constitution at all, if we are to have one at all, it surely should be out of the power of the representative assembly, which it is supposed to bind, to keep changing it without reference to the people from whom the Constitution ultimately derives its authority.</P>
      <P>There have been remarks made about this Constitution.  What I should like to remind some Deputies of is this.  This Constitution was brought in here to the Parliament of the day.  It was discussed over a long period.  Invitations were issued to the various Parties to try to approach the measure, not as a Party measure, but as one that affected the interests of the State as a whole.  Deputy Norton spoke about an all-Party committee. This House was a committee.  There was an all-Party discussion of this Constitution at the start.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But we have our different views. Each citizen has his own view of what is right, of what is good and what is best, and surely there must be, in the end, some way of deciding these matters.  The democratic way of deciding them is by a majority vote of the people, or, if the matter has to be decided by the representative Assembly, then by the majority of the representatives. That procedure was followed. In the first place, the Constitution was put before the elected representatives of the people here.  They discussed it fully in committee as well as in a general way.  We had a committee of the House discussing it for a period of weeks.  Therefore, there was an all-Party discussion of it.  Then it was put to the people in a way that this people had never had any law put to them.  It was discussed on platform after platform throughout the country. The majority of the people voted in favour of it.  There is no law in this State, and there has been no law in this State&mdash;leaving aside its fundamental character altogether&mdash;that got such discussion and that got so deliberately the approval of the people as this law did.  The only Deputy who approached it in the right spirit was Deputy Esmonde.  He said that it did not <Col N="1257" /> matter who introduced it.  The point is that it was adopted by the people as their fundamental law, and, as such, deserves a greater measure of respect than any other law that has been passed in this State.  It is in that spirit that I certainly approached the amendment of it.</P>
    <P>The suggestion was made as if the amendment of it was simply left to Departments.  That is not so.  The experience of the Departments was asked.  The principal officers were asked to send up suggestions as to any amendments which they had found to be desirable in the operation of the Constitution, and which would seem to them to be advisable.  These suggestions were examined.  Some were amendments of a type that would improve the style, the language or something else.  These were not the amendments that we paid a great deal of attention to, because we were not looking for a document from the point of view of style, but rather one that would be clear, and that would be able to be interpreted properly.  The amendments in this Bill are those which it was felt were necessary for clarity, to eliminate a few mistakes and minor errors that had crept in.  It was for the purpose of discovering such that the period of three years was given. As I have said already, we did not want to have a longer period than three years because otherwise the Constitution would be of very little value.</P>
    <P>Now, I know that you can have a representative democracy without a Constitution if you are prepared to give to the elected representatives of any particular period full and complete powers.  There is a great deal to be said for that: to put it to the people that, when they are electing a government they are electing an all-powerful body that will not be prevented from taking any action that the majority consider to be in the interests of the community, and that there will be no reference back at all to the people. We, however, for a variety of reasons considered that, on the whole, it would be better to have a written Constitution that would embody certain principles and certain machinery which, by a <Col N="1258" /> chance majority, the Government of the day could not set aside.  But we cannot have it both ways.  We cannot have a limitation on the power of a majority that might be a purely temporary majority to do what they please, and, at the same time, not have such a limitation.  The two are contradictory, and, therefore, we must have one or the other.  Which do we want?</P>
    <P>Let us not have the argument from the same person, at the one time advocating that there should be no restriction, and on the other hand advocating that there must be.  You must make up your mind which it is you want. We, at any rate, the majority of the House, and the majority of the people, decided that they would have a written Constitution.  It is not a rigid Constitution. It can be changed by reference to the people.  I know that is a costly process, and, in many ways, not a very satisfactory process.  Therefore, it is not likely to be adopted unless there is a real necessity for doing so. There may be some vital question which so affects the interests of the community as a whole that the most satisfactory way of settling it would be by referring it to the people.  The fact that it is an expensive way, and a more or less cumbersome way, will, in itself, act as a deterrent from using or abusing it.</P>
    <P>The next thing that was referred to was the question of Irish.  What was said would, I think, come very much better from those who knew the language and would be able to criticise it from that point of view.  The fact is that the Constitution was passed in both languages by the House.  When it was being examined the two versions were there side by side.  Reference has been made to certain omissions, and the suggestion made that the Constitution was prepared in a way other than it was.  These omissions, however, were due to the fact that amendments were brought in here while the House was in session, and, in the nature of things, were discussed in English.  It was because the amendments were made in this House that the omissions occurred in having a corresponding Irish text.  The Constitution was passed in both texts, as this Bill will be.  At the <Col N="1259" /> time the Constitution was going through it was pointed out that if there were any members of the House who wished to have the Irish text examined because they felt that they were not able to do that themselves, they might get members of their own Party to help them, or, if necessary, we could set up a Committee of the House which would make that examination for them so as to give them greater confidence.  In the two texts we express, as far as it is reasonable to expect, the same ideas, and provide that if there is in any respect apparent contradiction between the two texts then the Irish is to prevail.  Some people take the view that it is a great advantage to have a fundamental law in two languages.  Ambiguities are found in practically every language. You will have those ambiguities no matter how you may try to provide against them.  Skilful lawyers will take up a text and will be able to construe it quite differently from what was intended by the people who wrote it originally.  It will be very difficult to do that where you have two texts. Where there is an apparent slight ambiguity in one text, when you turn to the other text you find that it is completely removed: that it quite clearly has one meaning and not another.  You can see that by reference to the Constitution itself.  If an attempt were made to force a meaning from a phrase or sentence in the English text, by turning to the Irish text, it will be seen at once that it was a forced meaning and not that intended originally.  Passing the Constitution, therefore, in two texts has that advantage.  It has that advantage in the case of a fundamental document like the Constitution.</P>
    <P>There are two omissions which are being rectified, one the provision with regard to the Seanad.  There was a certain electorate proposed with regard to the Seanad.  When we changed it here as a result of amendments which were introduced in this House and accepted, a word or two were left behind which did not belong to the new text but belonged to the text as it was originally introduced.  When we <Col N="1260" /> come to the Committee Stage I will point that out, and you will see where it occurred.  It is quite wrong to suggest that there was carelessness about the preparation either of the English text or of the Irish text, or that one was simply a translation of the other. There was an attempt, naturally, to make the two as close as they possibly could be one to the other.  As a matter of fact, the first person with whom I discussed the drafting of the Constitution was a native Irish speaker, and the very first text was produced by him.  But he was not a lawyer, and there were many technical things that had to be discussed, and bit by bit when we had a committee we had to get the English-speaking people, lawyers for the greatest number, to deal with some of the fundamental points, some of the difficulties.  The fact is that, side by side with the one, you had got the other, and every effort was made to have the Irish text as original as possible, in the sense of being as original an expression of the ideas as we could get, but we did have to get the two texts corresponding.  We wanted to have them as near as possible one to the other, so that each could be regarded as being as close a translation as possible.  To draw any conclusions from the omissions here would be quite wrong.  Again, I stress the fact that those omissions were due-to the changes produced by the amendments here in this House.</P>
    <P>The Bill is being criticised through the fact that there is a number of minor changes.  Well, we can let Deputy Dillon get away with his statement about that.  It does not worry me very much.  The fact is we are taking advantage of this change to tighten it up in various ways in regard to phrasing and so on, to try to remove ambiguities, and in one or two places to try to express more adequately what was intended.  It has been criticised because of what is not in it.  Again, of course, Deputies on the opposite benches who were here when the Constitution was first going through, and who had different views to the views of the majority, will naturally think, like most other people, that they were right all the time, and expect that changes <Col N="1261" /> will be made now to suit the views which we then opposed because we believed that those views were not right at the time.  One of those matters is the question of three years.  As I have pointed out we deliberately chose the period of three years, which we thought was sufficiently long to allow the Constitution to operate and to see whether in fact there were some minor changes that had to be made.  There was a way of amending it after that period, a little more difficult&mdash;in fact, if you like, a good bit more difficult&mdash; than by simple legislation, but that period was deliberately accepted, and deliberately we prevented that particular article which said three years from being amended itself.  Even within the Constitution itself we cannot propose to extend it now.  The argument we had then is being produced here now. That argument was settled by majority vote at the time.  That argument was settled by the acceptance by the people of the Constitution as a whole, and that argument will be settled in the House in that way.  It is not open to us now, except we have an amendment which would go to the people, to extend the time.</P>
    <P>The next thing that has been criticised is that we have not changed the mode of election of the President.  I think when I was bringing in the original proposition I pointed out that undoubtedly a popular election for President, if there was a way in which it could be avoided, was not an easy process.  There is nobody who knows better than I do that, when a person is before the people in an election, opponents will say things and sometimes fling mud, and that some of it is bound to stick.  Unfortunately, democracy is run in that way.  Every one of us, whatever side of the House we are on, when we go up for election, have to stand listening to a lot of things which are quite unjust, quite wrong. But are we not to have elections on that account?  The President is no doubt the most important officer in the State, and to the utmost extent we ought to try to have a President who will have the respect of all sections of the people, but it is also true that public representatives generally have a <Col N="1262" /> very important part to play in the life of the country, and that what is said with regard to the President ought also to hold, though perhaps not to the same extent, in regard to those who hold other offices.  But we cannot have it.  It would be very desirable if it could be done, but we cannot have it, and we have to take democracy with its faults as well as its virtues if we are going to work with it.  Therefore, though it is unfortunate that the President should have to be elected in that way by a vote of the people, if we want what we were striving to have&mdash;that is to have the powers of the President appear to come directly from the people&mdash;we cannot get rid of it.  I felt, when we were bringing it in, that it was particularly important here in this country of ours, in view of our past history, that the chief officer of State should be seen by the people to have been elected by them, that they had the power of electing him, that he was not the nominee of one person or another, that he was there clearly as the chief officer of the State, whom they could elect.  It is said that in the last case we disliked an election so much that the Parties agreed to the present President.  That was so; he was so outstanding that all the Parties agreed.  If we can get such a person in future that all the Parties will agree, I take it in general that the people would also be quite satisfied and would agree, but if there is any section of the people dissatisfied there is another method besides the nominations of the Dáil.  Remember that if the Dáil elected a President, if the Parties actually had an election of the President here by the Dáil and Seanad, there would also be objections raised to that.  It would be said that there was wangling of one kind or another in the election.  It is, I admit, a cumbersome way.  There are difficulties attached to it.  There is the disadvantage which has been pointed out that probably a President going up for election will have quite a number of things said about him that are unjust and wrong, and that may help to a certain extent to weaken his influence in his high office afterwards, but, as I have said, that is something which we have to <Col N="1263" /> face because no better method can be suggested.  As I have said, if it were done by the two Houses, you would have other suggestions made.</P>
    <P>The next question raised was the extension of the period after the immediate emergency of actual conflict has passed.  I admit that there is a difficulty there again.  If somebody will tell us how we can solve that difficulty I will be very happy.  I thought myself of having some limit of a year or some period like that, but again the minute you try rigidly to fix definitely a period of a year you will find that a year and a month was the time which was required.  If anybody can suggest how we are going to have better than this, I am prepared to keep an open mind with regard to it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will give the matter consideration.  It can be considered from that point of view.  The only question is, is it conceivable that you will have a Parliament like this, where we have parties, and that those powers are going to be continued without somebody bringing in a motion to end them?  I do not think it is.  It would be closing our eyes to the ways parties operate.  I will consider the point, but my own feeling is that the direct way is better.  The two Houses have to meet and have to pass a resolution saying that this particular situation was in existence, and they would similarly have to meet and pass a resolution before it would pass out. My belief is that our system would <Col N="1264" /> not operate without having some party in the House&mdash;generally the Opposition, if the Government were slow about doing it&mdash;which would undoubtedly try to speed up the end of the time in which these very great powers would be given to the Executive.</P>
      <P>On this question of how it can best be done, I gave the matter a certain amount of thought and I have not been able to get a satisfactory solution. There is undoubtedly a situation to be covered.  Simply to say that we must not do anything about it will not be enough.  We must do something about it and it is essential that there should be some provision made.  The Article as it stands is not clear enough. There is no point of time at which you can be certain that the conflict has ended.  We must have somebody to declare that particular point of time. That can best be declared by the bodies who brought it into being.</P>

      <Col N="1265" /> The next point dealt with <i>habeas corpus.</i>  With regard to that, there is the question of the omission of the words &ldquo;any and every judge&rdquo;.  My advice is that, as it is, it expresses the same thing.  If there is any difficulty about it, I will consider whether &ldquo;every&rdquo; should not be put back. Most people reading &ldquo;any and every&rdquo; would at first sight ask what is the meaning of it and what is its purpose. It might possibly be clearer in the light of certain interpretations, but I have not met any cases in which the interpretation was not the same as we have here.  If there are any difficulties experienced on the point of this not being very clear, we might be able to put it in a clearer fashion.</P>
    <P>Next comes the question of the three judges.  The point is that before a conditional order is made absolute it should be decided by three judges, if the President of the High Court should consider it of sufficient importance to have three judges.  We are passing on to the judiciary the responsibility of saying whether a case is of such importance that it should be tried by one judge or by three judges.  There are cases in which we insist in the Constitution that the whole Supreme Court of five judges should act.  When there are important cases we know that judges, like other people, differ in their opinions.  Very often when you have two judges they may differ in their opinions, and then you have three in order to get two to one, if possible, so that there will be a majority decision and an absolute determination of the issue on the rule of the majority verdict.</P>
    <P>No one will deny that there are times when you have to consider the interests of the individual, of the State, and the community as a whole and, whilst it is right that in so far as it is possible the bias should be in favour of the individual against the combined power of the State&mdash;the individual is relatively helpless unless he is assisted by having rights of this sort definitely guaranteed and the power of the State can show itself in a variety of ways&mdash;at the same time you have to safeguard the rights of the community as a whole.  If there is an <Col N="1266" /> important matter to be decided as to whether a certain law is constitutional or not, it is not proper that that should be dealt with in the haphazard way of finding some judge with a particular view, and allowing him to decide.  You try, in other words, to choose the person whose opinion happens to be in a certain direction and then get your verdict.  We would not stand for that and I think, therefore, that for the final determination, if it is regarded by the President of the High Court, who is removed from politics, as of sufficient importance to have three judges, there is no harm done to anybody.</P>
    <P>It might be said that it is easier for an individual to convince one judge than three, but, if it is a matter of simple justice and a question of law and right, I think a court of three judges is a more secure guarantee for the parties concerned.  Let us assume that some person is detained in prison and his liberty is taken away for the time being, or it may be assumed that he is awaiting trial or is guilty of some offence.  If there is a question whether he has been rightfully detained in accordance with the law, then the first step will be to let him go to any judge he pleases and, after that, he can go on until he gets some judge to give him a conditional order.  Then there will be the question of the final determination by one judge or three, according as the President of the High Court determines.  I am not a lawyer and I have not the time or opportunity to study cases, even leading cases, in regard to <i>habeas corpus,</i> but I am told that in important cases three judges generally are engaged.</P>
    <P>In the case of the Constitution of 1922, there was a provision put into it under which it was decided that a person who applied for a writ of <i>habeas corpus</i> could insist on having one judge to try the case and finally determine it, but that was not, I am informed, in accordance with the general practice, in accordance with which the terms of that Constitution were supposed to have been drawn up.  We shall no doubt have much closer argument on this when we come to deal with the amendment itself.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what the text would mean.  We can argue as to the rights and wrongs of it, but the President of the High Court, as a nonpolitical person dealing with a case before him would have advertence, I should say, particularly to this: &ldquo;Here is an important case upon which we want to get a just decision.  We want to try to arrive, on the principle that three or two heads are better than one, at a fair and proper settlement&rdquo;, and I think everyone will admit that the danger is that you may have a person with a particular bias who will be sought out and who may very well give a decision which would have very important consequences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The final amendment on which there is difficulty is No. 28.  I am repeating much of what I said at the start, but <Col N="1268" /> apparently, if I am to judge by some of the remarks made here, not much attention was paid to it.  With regard to No. 28, the position is that when the Constitution was being enacted, we wanted to ensure that the mere passing of the Constitution was not going to prejudice the position of certain rights; that, in other words, they would be left, in effect, what they had been.  An amendment was moved here urging that we should give Constitutional guarantees to certain State officials.  I refused it, and it was turned down by a majority of the House.</P>
    <P>There is clear evidence of what the intention at the time was.  It was that there was to be no constitutional guarantee, but that these rights rested on an Act, the 1929 Act, which embodied a certain agreement, and that in the old Constitution they did not have, and could not have, the same rights as they would have under this Constitution, once this Constitution becomes unalterable except by referendum. If we had accepted that amendment, we would have put them in this Constitution in a position superior to that in which they had been, because they would have been held to have rights which could not be affected unless we went to the people with a referendum.</P>
    <P>We resisted that wisely.  We said: &ldquo;You have rights and we are not changing them.  You did not have the sort of rights you would have under this Constitution, and we would not give them to you,&rdquo; and this amendment is necessary, because there has been some sort of suggestion that, notwithstanding our intention, there was a possibility that there could be read into this an intention quite different from that which we had; in other words, that there might be a suggestion that if they were given constitutional rights in accordance with this Constitution, it would mean that we could not deal with these rights except by way of referendum, if we wanted to change them in any way.</P>
    <P>This amendment is designed to make it clear that this Constitution, which cannot be changed except by referendum, is not going to give to any officers <Col N="1269" /> of the State a position which they did not have before this was passed.  Its purpose is to make it clear, and we have to put it in, if you like, a very brutal form in order that it may be quite clear that no construction can be given to it which would suggest that they are getting constitutional rights under this Constitution.  We have to put it in a very plain and more or less brutal form, in order to make it quite clear, and in order that there will not be any misunderstandings about it. Our position in this respect is perfectly clear.  It is there on record, and anybody who reads the debate on the amendment in the names of Deputy Costello and Deputy McGilligan, and which was actually moved on the occasion by Deputy Rice, he will find what I said.  There is no doubt whatever as to what the intention was, and we want to ensure, before this Constitution passes beyond the stage at which it can be changed by legislation, that there will be no misunderstanding in that regard.  That is the only purpose of this amendment.</P>
    <P>I am not sure if I have covered all the points raised, but as this is in the main a Committee Stage Bill, we shall have an opportunity of arguing the various points more closely on Committee Stage.  The result of the amendments will be that, in some of the cases, the texts will be brought more closely into consonance and the Constitution will be improved from that point of view.  I think there is no use in our foolishly hoping that we will be able to get agreement on the fundamental questions between us, which were fundamental when the Constitution was being discussed in the Dáil.  The views expressed simply show that those on the opposite benches now hold the views which they held when the Constitution was going through the House, and we on our side hold the views we held then.</P>
    <P>I think the Constitution has worked, on the whole, well during the years it has been in operation.  It has stood up to most of the tests.  I will be told that I was fortunate that the three years had not passed before this war broke out and that otherwise I might <Col N="1270" /> have found myself at the beginning of the war in a position which would give rise to a certain amount of difficulty; but I think that if we had had to face that situation, we would just have faced it.  It would probably have involved a referendum at the time, but I have no doubt that we would have got&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It is possible, and I am not quite clear about what advice was given to me at the time, but whatever I said was the advice given.  Leaving out the actual legal position as it might be determined by the courts, if the position were such that we could not have brought in that amendment, we should have had to get it in some other way.  The resources of civilisation have not, so to speak, been exhausted.  I am perfectly certain that we should have been able to deal with the difficulty even if it were necessary to have a reference to the people.  It would, however, have been inconvenient.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>For the purpose of clarification, by way of addition.  We held that Section 5 means a certain thing&mdash;that civil servants and transferred officers could not plead that they were getting rights under this Constitution, because that would be giving them a position they did not occupy before.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We hold that they did not, but we have not the final determination. This is a matter which could be determined in a court of law. We take the opportunity, again, to emphasise the position by way of clarification which, to the minds of some people, might seem to be necessary.  I do not know what view a court would take but we are taking the opportunity to make as certain as we possibly can that it will not happen that&mdash;contrary to the intentions of the House and of the people, because there was a very big debate on the question&mdash;any section like that will get a position under this Constitution which would be an improvement on the position they held before.  The purpose of this Article originally was to leave things, so far as their rights were concerned, as they were before.  We argued what their rights were under the 1929 Act&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>As there is an amount of statistics in this, I propose <Col N="1282" /> to read the statement on the main Estimate.</P>
      <P>The Estimate for the Department of Local Government and Public Health in the present year makes a provision for a net expenditure of £1,229,829. Grants for housing amount to £702,765 and for health services to £360,790, making a total of £1,063,555 for the social services included in this Vote. There is a net increase of £18,487 in the Vote as compared with the financial year 1940-41.</P>
      <P>It is customary in moving the Estimates for the Department to examine the statistical evidence concerning the present state of public health. It is a matter of special interest that further progress was achieved during the year 1940.  In the past ten years a great deal has been done in improving public health services, raising the standard of sanitary administration, providing new homes in replacement of insanitary and overcrowded dwellings, and removing bad environmental conditions. The results which have been achieved have had a considerable influence on the maintenance of health, and in bringing about a general improvement in the welfare of the community. There has been a gratifying reduction in mortality from the principal notifiable and preventable infectious diseases.  The vital statistics for the year 1940 are at present, however, only provisional and may be subject to slight modifications, but they reflect a continued improvement in public health.  The total number of deaths attributed to the principal notifiable and preventable infectious diseases in that year was 279 which was a reduction of 106 as compared with the number of deaths in 1939 (385).  The corresponding number of deaths for 1937 and 1938 was respectively 542 and 487.  The mortality from these diseases in 1940 was the lowest on record.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The principal notifiable and preventable infectious diseases are typhoid, typhus, scarlet fever, diphtheria and puerperal sepsis.  The number of deaths from typhoid was 29 in 1940, the lowest number on record for the country from that disease.  In 1939 there were 56 deaths from typhoid, while the average annual number of such deaths for the <Col N="1283" /> decennial period 1930-39 was 68.  The number of notifications of typhoid fever received in 1940 was 253 which was a definite decrease in comparison with the previous year when the number of cases notified was 385.  It is worthy of note that there was only one case of the disease notified from Cork and Waterford Cities during 1940, and that no cases arose in 50 out of a total of 61 urban districts and in 115 out of a total of 162 rural areas.  The incidence of typhoid fever is to a certain extent a reflex of the standard of general sanitation in the country, and the fall in the incidence of the disease is due in large measure to the provision of adequate and pure water supplies throughout the country generally during the past ten years.</P>
    <P>When submitting last year's Estimate, I was in a position to state that the year 1938 was the first year in which there had been no outbreak of typhus fever in this country since the Infectious Diseases (Notification) Act, 1889, came into operation.  The disease has been of infrequent occurrence in recent years and in 1940 it broke out in two counties with fatal results in two cases.  Ten cases of the disease were notified from four different districts in one county, and were traced to a band of itinerants who had moved rapidly from place to place before the disease was definitely diagnosed.  A single case of the disease was reported in another county.  The circumstances of these outbreaks were such that a serious epidemic might have developed if it had not been for the alertness and efficiency of the local medical services and the promptitude with which precautions for preventing the spread of infection were taken.</P>
    <P>Deaths from diphtheria have been a source of anxiety for a considerable number of years past.  In the returns for 1940 a substantial reduction in the mortality rate is shown.  178 deaths attributable to diphtheria occurred in that year as compared with 245 deaths in 1939, and with an average annual number of 342 deaths for the ten year period 1930-39.  The rate for 1940 approximates to a reduction of 50 per <Col N="1284" /> cent. on the average for that decennial period.  The total number of cases of diphtheria notified in 1940 was 1,891, of which 808 occurred in the four county boroughs, 321 in urban districts and 762 in rural districts.  The number of cases, viz. 1,891, represents a reduction on the total notifications in 1939, which were 2,097.</P>
    <P>There was no case of diphtheria reported during 1940 from 29 out of the 61 urban districts, and from 53 out of the 162 rural districts, as compared with 14 urban districts and 47 rural districts in 1939.  The latest returns in regard to approved schemes of immunisation against diphtheria available are those for the year 1939.  These schemes operated in the four county boroughs, in 12 urban districts and 14 county health districts, and resulted in the immunisation of 22,593 children in that year.  Further discussions have taken place with the representatives of the medical profession in regard to the rate of remuneration payable for immunisation work against diphtheria and for other additional duties, and it is expected that agreement will shortly be reached.  A more widespread and effective combat against this disease can then be organised.</P>
    <P>The number of deaths arising from scarlet fever in 1940 was 35, constituting the lowest figure yet recorded.  In 1939 the number of deaths from the same cause was 43, while the average annual number in the ten years, 1930-39, was 88.  The mortality in 1940, therefore, represented a decrease of 60 per cent. on the average annual number of deaths for the decennial period above-mentioned.  The number of cases notified in 1940 was 2,465, which is a substantial reduction on the number, 2,779, reported in 1939.</P>
    <P>Influenza is not a notifiable disease, but influenzal pneumonia is.  As is generally recognised, the incidence of influenza varies considerably from year to year.  The most serious outbreak during the last decade was in 1937, when 2,772 deaths attributable to that cause occurred.  In 1940 the number of deaths was 804.  The number of cases of influenzal pneumonia notified in 1940 <Col N="1285" /> was 250, as compared with 208 in 1939. The number of deaths due to cancer in 1940 was 3,573, being a reduction of 165 on the number for 1939.  The incidence of cancer does not fluctuate very much, but has shown an upward trend for a considerable period.  The investigations of the Provisional Cancer Council which was set up to investigate and report on certain aspects of the causes and incidence of this disease have had to be suspended owing to present conditions as it was not practicable to make investigations of the system of treatment in other countries or to obtain full information thereon.</P>
    <P>For some years past there has been a gradual improvement in the death rates attributable to puerperal sepsis and to accidents of childbirth and pregnancy.  The predominant factor contributing to the mortality of mothers in childbirth is puerperal sepsis.  It is noteworthy that since 1936 there has been a continuous decrease in the annual number of deaths due to that cause.  The returns for 1940 show 35 deaths due to puerperal sepsis as compared with 38 in 1939 and 46 in 1938.  The average annual number for the ten-year period, 1930-39, was 74.  The figure for last year, therefore, represents a reduction of about 53 per cent. on the decennial record.  In 1940 no case of the disease occurred in Limerick City, and only one case each was reported from Cork and Waterford Cities.  No case occurred in 48 out of the 61 urban districts or in 122 out of 162 rural districts.</P>
    <P>Infant mortality still continues at a high rate.  The death rate in 1940 is practically the same as in 1939, the total deaths in 1940 amounting to 3,698. The rates for the four county boroughs are still very high, being per 1,000 births as follows:&mdash;Dublin, 92; Cork, 94; Limerick, 74, and Waterford, 107. The rate for Waterford in 1939 was 73, and the increase in 1940 was due to abnormal mortality from diarrhoea and enteritis.</P>
    <P>The counties in which the provisional infant death rates per 1,000 births were highest were Waterford, 88; Dublin, 84; Carlow, 78; Kilkenny, 73, <Col N="1286" /> and Kildare 70.  These rates compare very unfavourably with the corresponding rates per 1,000 births in certain counties on the western seaboard. In these counties the provisional death rates per 1,000 births were Mayo, 37; Clare, 46; Kerry, 49; Donegal, 49, and Sligo, 50.</P>
    <P>In the four county boroughs where the death rate is highest, maternity and child welfare clinics have been established which afford medical advice and nursing services.  In Dublin the attendances at clinics were as follows:&mdash;mothers, 32,315; infants, 15,721, and children, 29,380.  In addition to the work done at welfare clinics in Dublin, there is a well organised system of visitation of mothers and children in their homes.</P>
    <P>The following extracts from the report of the medical officer for maternity and child welfare relate to the position in 1939:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Thirteen welfare clinics are held weekly in the city at different centres, usually in slum areas. Mothers, pre-natal and post-natal, are seen and advised, as well as infants and children up to five years of age.  Defects discovered are dealt with by recommending the case to the special department of the different hospitals.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;A short talk is given at each clinic by one of the health visitors. This talk is on some subject of mother-craft.  Experience shows that the mothers are availing of this service in a much better way than they used formerly.  A medical officer is in attendance at each of these clinics to assist and advise.  The clinic in the Pembroke district is held in the open air during the summer months. In July, 1939, a new combined welfare clinic and dining hall was opened on the north side of the city at St. Joseph's Mansions, Killarney Street.  This is unique in that it is actually built into the block of flats and serves a very dense slum area.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The number of deaths due to measles in 1940 is returned at 67, which compares favourably with the number for <Col N="1287" /> 1939, which was 84.  The mortality for 1940 is the lowest on record.  This disease is compulsorily notifiable only in a few districts, but steps are being taken to ensure that at least the first case occurring in a family will be notified in future.</P>
    <P>The several medical inspection schemes which are in operation in every county and county borough continue to progress.  There were 135,404 children examined in 1939, constituting 35 per cent. of the total average school attendance.  The number of defects ascertained were as follows:&mdash;Dental, 63,258; diseased tonsils, etc., nose and the throat, 25,857; eye defects, 24,146. The numbers treated were: Dental, 50,448; diseased tonsils, etc., nose and throat, 7,766; eye defects, 19,456.</P>
    <P>The examination of school children affords a great opportunity for an investigation of the prevalence of malnutrition amongst school children.  The following extracts from reports of county medical officers of health for three counties indicate the results of such investigations:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Out of the total children examined this year, 278 were regarded as suffering from malnutrition, representing a rate of 3.6, while for the previous year there was 5.3 per cent.....  In the majority of cases seen by me the cause of this condition was poverty, and in some others the subnutrition was attributable to defects such as enlarged tonsils, etc.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Another report says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The percentage of slight malnutrition among the school-children was 10.8, being a small reduction on the figure found during the 1938 inspections. The number of children manifesting signs of pronounced malnutrition was only two out of a total of 4,249 examined.  This represents a percentage of only .04 as compared with .33 in 1938 and the position may therefore be regarded as satisfactory. When children in rural areas of this country are found to be markedly malnourished it is usually because of parental ineptitude and neglect.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1288" /> A further report says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;There were 42 cases of definite malnutrition requiring treatment found and these were referred for medical advice....  A special form has been printed for the purpose of advising parents as to the amount of rest, the proper clothing, the proper type of diet and the values of various foods suitable for children and this is circulated among the parents of children whose nutrition is less than average standard.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>School meals are provided in four county boroughs, 41 urban areas and seven towns.  In these districts for the year ended the 31st March, 1940, the average weekly number of children in receipt of meals was about 160,000.  The total number of meals provided was approximately 5,205,000.  School meals are also provided in rural areas of the Gaeltacht by the boards of health for the counties of Donegal, Galway, Kerry, Mayo and West Cork.  The total number of meals provided in the last financial year was approximately 2,800,000.</P>
    <P>The arrangements for the supply of free milk, for which a sum of £90,000 is provided in this Estimate, were continued during the year in urban and rural areas, with the exception of two urban districts.  The allowances are limited to children under five years whose parents or guardians are in receipt of assistance or are unable to provide from their own resources an adequate supply of milk for children of this age.  The value of this scheme continues to be highly reported upon by county medical officers of health.</P>
    <P>The scale of allowances is as follows:&mdash;one eligible child in family, one pint; two eligible children in family, one and a half pints; three or more eligible children in family, two pints.  The general supervision of the schemes is entrusted to the medical superintendent or county medical officers of health.  The premises of milk contractors are visited frequently by veterinary inspectors to ensure that the methods of milk production are satisfactory and samples are sent for examination as to quality and purity.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1289" /> Local authorities are encouraged to give a preference to milk sold under a special designation.  In Dublin County Borough only highest grade milk has been supplied during the past year (298,420 gallons were distributed during 1939/40) whilst in Dublin County highest grade and standard milk are provided.  In Limerick City highest grade, standard milk, and pasteurised milk are supplied.  In Dun Laoghaire Borough pasteurised milk and in Carlow Urban District standard milk are provided.  Difficulty continues to be experienced in some districts in securing registered suppliers and it was again necessary to authorise the distribution of dried milk powder in such districts.</P>
    <P>Schemes for the treatment of tuberculosis are in operation in each county and county borough.  Local sanatoria have been provided in three county boroughs and in 17 counties.  Treatment for children is provided in five open-air institutions in which there are also facilities for the general education of such children.  On the unrevised figures the death rate from tuberculosis in 1940 increased to 1.22 per 1,000 of the population as compared with 1.13 for 1939.</P>
    <P>During the year further progress was made in the installation of water supplies and sewerage schemes in urban areas and in towns in county health districts.  Forty-one schemes were undertaken at a total expenditure of £200,000, of which about £80,000 was met out of the Employment Schemes Vote.  Some delays occurred in deliveries of pipes, plant, etc., but they did not seriously interfere with the programme of works.  Twenty urban authorities undertook works for the provision or improvement of parks, playgrounds and fair greens.  The schemes undertaken were mainly small works, but they nevertheless represented useful additions to the amenities of the towns concerned.</P>
    <P>There was a very considerable reduction in the number of houses built by local authorities in 1940 as compared with previous years.  The total number is not likely to exceed 3,405.  For the <Col N="1290" /> previous three years the numbers of houses completed by local bodies were 5,383 in 1939/40, 6,932 in 1938/39, and 4,890 in 1937/38.  The number of new houses built by private persons and public utility societies in 1940/41 in rural areas was 2,175.  The number of houses reconstructed was 2,768.  Private building in rural areas, taking into consideration the conditions prevailing, was maintained at a good level and it is intended to introduce very soon a Bill extending up to the 1st April, 1942, the period for the payment of grants for houses built in rural areas in accordance with existing regulations.</P>
    <P>Of the new houses built by local bodies in the last financial year, about 1,555 were provided in urban areas and 1,850 in rural areas.  The total number of houses provided to date by the local bodies is approximately 25,484 in urban areas and 18,462 in rural areas.  The reduction in the number of houses built by local bodies has been disappointing, but more particularly so in the case of the four county boroughs where it was expected greater progress would have been made.  In Dublin City, several contracts were entered into during the year, but the number of houses completed fell to a very low level.  The number is not likely to exceed 800. Under the provisions of Section 6 of the Unemployment Relief Works Act, 1940, the corporation were authorised to make arrangements with holders of existing stock for an exchange into new stock equal in nominal value, and to withdraw from the Stock Redemption Fund an amount equal to the nominal value of the exchanged stock in the manner authorised by the Act.  These arrangements were duly carried out and resulted in moneys to the extent of approximately £500,000 being made available for the financing of housing schemes.  At the end of February, 1941, there were in course of construction 1,896 dwellings, consisting of 1,618 houses and 278 flats.</P>
    <P>In Cork City, there was also a falling-off in the number of houses built last year compared with the previous year.  It is estimated that the number built in Cork will not exceed 190.  In <Col N="1291" /> Limerick, the number of houses built is estimated at 130 and in Waterford, at 100.  Only in Waterford did the amount built in 1940 exceed the number built in the previous year.</P>
    <P>Building operations are in progress in four county boroughs, 12 other urban areas and in 18 counties.  The number of houses in course of construction is approximately 3,210 in urban areas and 1,300 in rural areas.  Outside the county boroughs urban authorities have been somewhat reluctant to proceed with further schemes owing to the increase in building costs.  In rural areas housing conditions have been vastly improved by the number of new cottages already provided by boards of health and by private persons and public utility societies, and proposals of an urgent nature for the clearance of bad housing conditions in non-municipal towns need only be considered in present conditions.</P>
    <P>Only in respect of certain materials have difficulties been experienced in the completion of housing contracts. The main difficulty is stated to be in regard to glass and to some extent timber.  In some areas the supply of timber is reported to be adequate for another 12 months.  The rationing of petrol has to some extent affected haulage necessary for building activities. Every effort is being made to ensure that reasonable supplies are forthcoming to ensure the continuance of housing contracts, where alternative fuel for motor vehicles cannot be used.</P>
    <P>During the year 8,220 allotments were provided for unemployed persons. These were let as follows:&mdash;6,265 to persons in receipt of unemployment assistance or unemployment benefit; 336 to persons in receipt of home assistance; 338 to persons employed on employment schemes; 1,231 to persons in temporary employment and whose means did not exceed the prescribed amount.</P>
    <P>The allotments were generally plots of ? acre and were let at a nominal rent of 1/- for the season.  In special cases where the applicants had large <Col N="1292" /> families allotments of ¼ acre were provided and a rent of 2/- per plot was charged.</P>
    <P>The Department of Agriculture provided free of cost implements (spades, shovels and spraying machines) for the use of the allotment holders and seeds, manures and spraying materials were also supplied free of charge.  The services of instructors were made available during the planting and potato spraying periods.  The instructors' reports indicated that the allotments were generally well cultivated.</P>
    <P>For the present season a special appeal was addressed to local authorities throughout the country requesting their co-operation in making available ample facilities for the cultivation of allotments.  Up to the present, schemes embracing some 14,300 plots have been approved and it is estimated that a further 1,700 plots will be provided, making a total of 16,000 for the year. In rural areas, the boards of health are providing tracts of land for cultivation in allotments, and there is every prospect that a substantial contribution to food production will be made by allotment holders.</P>
    <P>I have on a previous occasion referred to the increasing demands of the voluntary hospitals for grants from the Hospitals Trust Fund to meet expenditure in excess of income.  In the year 1939 the deficits in the accounts of those hospitals amounted to about £156,058.  This was an increase of £40,368 on the amount for the previous year, and an increase of £105,785 on the amount of the deficits for the year 1933.  The deficits for the year 1940 have not yet been definitely ascertained but are likely to exceed £180,000.  At the rate at which expenditure has been increasing in recent years the provision for endowment would require to be brought up to £6,000,000, which is double that already made. The provision of a permanent endowment fund of £6,000,000 would make a serious encroachment on the amount which it was reckoned would be available for erection and equipment of new hospitals, and may lead to the indefinite <Col N="1293" /> postponement of many desirable projects since further substantial additions to the fund cannot be anticipated.</P>
    <P>The Hospital Library Council which was set up in 1937 continues to render valuable service in the formation and maintenance of hospital libraries. Most of the hospital libraries are now in their third year and are developing satisfactorily.  During the year 1940 two additional hospitals were registered by the council which brings the total number of hospital units served up to 76.  Libraries are in operation in 74 of these.  The number of books issued during the year was 3,621.  The total book stock at the end of the year was 28,207 volumes.  During 1940, grants amounting to £5,000 were made to the Medical Research Council out of the Hospitals Trust Fund.  The grants paid up to the present amount to £22,500.  The council have made a number of grants to research workers &mdash;both whole time and part time.  In one instance, I understand, research has led to the discovery of a new serum which is likely to have very important results on the treatment of certain types of diphtheria.  A statement from the research council on the position is awaited.</P>
    <P>Hospital authorities were advised in 1939 and again in 1940 to lay in emergency stocks of medical and surgical supplies and local bodies generally were recommended to purchase reserve supplies of non-perishable articles of food and also accumulate stocks of fuel.  This course has been generally followed, and there are at present seven to 12 months' supplies in medical and surgical requirements and reserves of various stocks of food and fuel.  Due credit must be given to the official contractors for the manner in which they dealt with greatly increased orders from local authorities when they themselves were finding it difficult to obtain fresh supplies.</P>
    <P>During the year the Department continued to exercise the strictest control over increases in the contract prices of commodities permitted under the Emergency Powers (No. 18) Order, <Col N="1294" /> 1939.  Since the order became operative, applications in respect of more than 1,000 commodities have been investigated and the results communicated to the local authorities concerned. In view of the general fuel position local authorities have been authorised to cut all the turf which they need for their own requirements.</P>
    <P>The organisation of parish councils was a notable development which took place during the year.  When it was suggested in July last that parish councils should be organised to help in carrying out measures to meet this emergency, there was an immediate response from every part of the country.  The work of the parish committees formed under the auspices of Muintir na Tíre had shown that valuable results would ensue from the establishment of such bodies.  There are now over 800 parish councils who are taking a special interest in the general welfare of their areas.  Some have taken measures to help unemployed persons by providing allotments. Many have taken part in the tillage campaign, and more recently they have been called on to further the movement for the production of more turf.  Everyone is agreed that parish councils can fill a useful rôle in the life of the community.  There is a wide field for their activity outside the purview of statutory bodies, and if they develop a spirit of co-operation among the people of the parish they should have a very useful existence.</P>
    <P>Full particulars of the collection of rates by county councils at the 31st March are not yet available.  In the first nine months of the financial year the collection was proportionately much the same as in the previous year. The returns for the last quarter have not yet been received from the county councils.</P>
    <P>In 1940, the repayments to the guarantee fund in respect of arrears of annuities were much in excess of draws upon the fund to meet arrears in respect of the current gales and consequently the county councils received last month not only the whole of the balance of the agricultural grant for last financial year but in addition a <Col N="1295" /> sum of £136,207, which had previously been held in the guarantee fund owing to non-payment of land annuities. County Meath received repayments of over £25,000; County Kildare over £14,000, and Westmeath over £15,000. In these counties relatively heavier reductions were made from grants in previous years than in other counties. The total sum repaid, viz., £136,207, should reduce substantially the need for temporary borrowing for the financing of local services, which had somewhat increased in the past year.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I would like to express my appreciation of the services rendered by the Corporations of Dublin and Dún Laoghaire when during the Christmas period we had the unhappy experience of aerial bombing.  The managers and the air raid precautions staffs of the two corporations, assisted by the Local Security Force, rendered very valuable and efficient service during a critical period.</P>
    <P>I should have preferred, if it had been agreed upon, to take the Votes for National Health and Widows and Orphans' Pensions now.</P>

      <P>I move that the Estimate be referred back.  This Estimate covers the expenditure of what is the most important Ministry in the State&mdash;the Ministry which is charged with the function of grappling with poverty and bringing relief and succour, so far as possible within the resources of the State, to those who are suffering the hardships of poverty.  Reading this Estimate, one gets the impression that the Department is far removed from a true realisation of the abnormality of the times through which we are passing. It does not seem to square with the efforts being made by the head of the Government to arouse in the minds of the people a true appreciation of the serious times through which we are passing and through which we are likely to pass in the year for which <Col N="1296" /> this Estimate budgets.  It is a purely normal Estimate in very abnormal times.  The very able statement made by the Minister seems to reflect, in its complacency, what is shown in the figures in the Estimate&mdash;that no realisation of the true position has penetrated into the Ministry of Local Government and Public Health.</P>
      <P>Listening to the figures quoted by the Minister regarding malnutrition and other ill effects of poverty, one wonders if the statement refers to the same areas as we represent.  From my experience, the provision of milk up to now has been totally inadequate for the times through which we have been passing. County Limerick is one of the finest dairy counties in Ireland, if not in the world.  The Taoiseach was told in Limerick City last Saturday by a distinguished priest and by others that a huge population in County Limerick are absolutely without milk and have been in that situation for some considerable time.  Children and adults are drinking black tea.  They cannot get milk for normal household purposes, notwithstanding the figures quoted here.  No substantial alteration has been made in the figures in this Estimate relating to milk.  Yet, it is one of the most essential foods in our dietary.  Two members of the medical profession told me, after the meeting in the Town Hall in Limerick last Saturday, that they were glad the matter had been brought to the notice of the Taoiseach because they were dealing with patients in need of milk day after day.  They advised them to get off heavy foods and to take up a milk diet. The invariable reply of the poorer class was, &ldquo;I cannot get milk; it is too costly.&rdquo;  Apart from the cost, there are difficulties in the way of operating the free milk scheme in Limerick.  Notwithstanding their best efforts, the board of health are not able to get supplies owing to the provisions of the 1935 Act, whereby these persons must be registered milk-sellers.  Between that and the high price charged, thousands of people are not getting milk in County Limerick.  That is a statement over which I can stand and it is supported by members of the medical profession whose function it is to deal with this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1297" /> If that is the position in April, 1941, and if it was the position in 1940, what will be the position in the coming year? Unemployment is rife and 39,000 persons&mdash;to quote the figures given by the Minister for Industry and Commerce&mdash; are being deprived, under the Employment Period Order, of unemployment assistance from the month of March this year, whereas the period last year was from the month of June.  Are the dependents of these people not going to be in a much worse position this year than they were last year, apart from the added dislocations caused by the blockade of our country and the war situation?  How can the Local Government Department come along and say that everything in the garden is lovely? In that respect alone, I suggest they should make much more inquiry.  This House would not grumble regarding any estimate which would make adequate provision for milk for children and adults and mothers and expectant mothers.  That milk is at present being denied to them in my own county and, when that goes for Limerick, I think it goes for other counties as well.  These people have no fuel in their homes and their poverty is such that it cannot be left unminded by the Department of Local Government and Public Health.  The people of whom I speak cannot secure coal owing to its cost and the inaccessibility of supplies.  They have no means of purchasing turf which, we all hope, will be won in larger quantities this year.  They are suffering cold and hunger and it is not a time for the complacent report read by the Minister, having regard to the facts.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to allotments. I am very grateful for what has been done by the Department in that respect.  So far as the cities are concerned, they have acted well, and I am glad the cities have responded to their gesture and have embraced the allotment scheme with enthusiasm.  When the Minister goes on to speak of the assistance given to the allotment holders in the country districts, I am at sea as to the contribution made by the Local Government Department.  It is all very well to talk about parish councils and what they are doing.  They <Col N="1298" /> are a very useful adjunct to the national life and ought to get the necessary co-operation and assistance. But they ought not to be asked to assume the mantle of the Local Government Department.  This is a responsibility of the State, and neither this Department nor any other Department should hand over the running of the social services to parish councils or to the St. Vincent de Paul Society or any other body.  They are necessary adjuncts to the life of the community, but they should not be asked to carry the whole burden.  I know that parish councils are trying to do something regarding allotments.  What can they do?  They plan a scheme, send it to the board of health, and ask them to acquire a particular piece of land.</P>
    <P>The land is acquired by the board of health and they will come to terms with the owner as to the rent to be paid.  But the allottees will pay back that rent.  I do not know of any scheme where they are getting free plots.  They will pay back the economic rent, the rent that has been determined between the board of health and the landowner.  That is not of much use to the unemployed in the towns and villages.  The unemployed in the cities, as the Minister said, can get one-eighth of an acre for 1/- a week.  They also get seeds, implements and manures supplied free.  But the Local Government Department has not very much to preen itself about in regard to what it has done for the allotment holders in the country districts.  One would think that every unemployed man would be pressed into service to produce more food.  An unemployed man with the best intentions, cannot produce food on his allotment if he has not the wherewithal to buy seeds to put into it, if he has not the implements to work it, and manure to help to grow the crops.  I believe that there is a great weakness in not taking full advantage of the allotment scheme in the country districts.</P>
    <P>Parish councils to my own knowledge are in very serious trouble at present because they entered into commitments to take certain lands. Now that they have the land they have <Col N="1299" /> no seed to give to the unemployed. There was an idea that the Department of Agriculture would come to the rescue of these people, but we learned from several of them last Saturday that they had been turned down by the Department of Agriculture.  In several parishes I am told they will have to close down the scheme for want of seed to give to the unemployed who have taken the land.  These matters should be within the knowledge of the Local Government Department. If we are to take any credit for what we are doing, I think we ought to give some additional help, so far as the law will allow us, to the parish councils in this national campaign of producing more food.</P>
    <P>As I say, we are facing an extraordinary year and I was expecting an extraordinary Estimate for the Department of Local Government.  Poverty will cause the rates to fall into arrear and that will cause additional unemployment.  The tenants of our labourers' cottages are also unable, and, in an increasing measure, will be unable to meet the rents.  Already a number of cottiers are under notice to quit by boards of health for failure to pay rents, and, in some instances, I understand the amounts are very small. I think action has been taken in this respect much too quickly in some instances, having regard to the hard times the people are going through.  I have seen notices issued in respect of sums of 20/-, 25/-, and 30/-.  If that is the position early in the year, 1941, one can visualise that it will be very much worse during the year, because there is no employment available for these people.  The fact that an Employment Period Order has been issued by another Department, under which they have been struck off unemployment assistance, does not mean that there will be work for them.  If they get into arrears with their rates and rents, they will get notice to quit from the board of health.  They are not able to provide the fuel and food necessary for their families.</P>
    <P>The home assistance provided by the boards of health has been wholly inadequate up to now, and is being <Col N="1300" /> called upon in an increasing measure owing to the Employment Period Order.  I am not exaggerating the position when I say that there is hunger in the country and I fear that there will be much more of it in the year to come.  For that reason, I believe there is no justification for the complacency which this Estimate seems to indicate.  The Estimate was introduced in a very fine and able statement read by the Minister, which I regret I cannot accept as being a true reflection of the position in the country.</P>
    <P>This is not the time to deal with the question of labourers' cottages.  There is a point I should like to make in connection with them, but perhaps this is not an opportune time.  I believe that a good deal of the difficulty in connection with labourers' cottages is due to the passing of the recent Act for the purchase of cottages.  The labourers have not availed of that.  I should like to know what has been the result of the labours of the Local Government Department during the last three or four years since the Act was passed.  How many labourers have taken advantage of it?  How many have relieved the public authorities of the responsibility for the maintenance of the cottages?  In my county I believe none have availed of it.  The cottages are deteriorating.  I saw recently where one board of health complained about the growing cost of maintenance.  They are getting no satisfaction from the present method of maintenance.  If the board of health are not getting satisfaction, I say the tenants are not getting satisfaction either.  The cottages are deteriorating.  Rain is pouring in through many cottages.  When all is said and done, these cottages are the property of the nation.  But, between one thing and other, nobody is doing anything; the tenants are suffering and their cottages are deteriorating. That is a matter that should receive the attention of the Minister and his Department, namely, the repair and maintenance of these cottages so as to preserve the health of these people and, incidentally, the cottages which are the property of the nation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1301" /> There is another matter about which I want to complain.  The Local Government Department do not seem to realise the assistance they could give in helping to solve the unemployment problem to a reasonable extent. In Limerick we have been trying for a considerable time to get on with the regional hospital.  The foundations of that hospital could be put in.  It is estimated that from 100 to 200 men could be employed for about 12 months in the cutting of the foundations and the necessary development work which would not need any material except what is on the spot.  The plans were submitted to the Department and were sent back for some alterations.  They were altered in accordance with the request of the Department and sent up to the Department again.  Some further alterations were considered necessary and the plans were altered at the dictation of the Department.  My information is that since last September they have been lying in the archives of the Department, and that all efforts to get them released to enable the work to be put in hand have failed.  I should like to know what more the Department wants.  Will we be told that they do not want the job to go on?</P>
    <P>I have been informed that every effort has been made by the architect and the people concerned to meet the reasonable requirements of the engineering staff of the Local Government Department, but still the plans have been lying there since September or October.  People in the town and the country around are asking when the work will start.  That is a very serious question for the Department, if they have not a very good reason to give as to why they are standing in the way of the work being put in hands which the unemployed have been looking forward to since last September.</P>
    <P>I am not a member of the Limerick Mental Hospital Committee, but I am aware that one of the wings built there at considerable expense has not been utilised owing to sanction not being given to a proposal with regard to the furnishing.  What is the idea of building a wing to a mental hospital to cater <Col N="1302" /> for a certain section when it cannot be utilised for the purpose because it cannot be furnished?  That has been going on for more than 12 months and the deadlock still continues.  After listening to the very nice and very well-prepared statement of the Minister, one would think that everything in the garden was lovely so far as the Department of Local Government is concerned. I regret very much that I cannot accept that statement.</P>
    <P>I want to make a final appeal on behalf of one section of the community that do not seem to have got the consideration they are entitled to from the Department.  I refer to blind persons. The sum of £7,340 is provided here for the Blind Welfare Scheme, an increase of £40 on last year's Estimate.  A sum of £40 is to mark the difference in the treatment of poor sightless persons in the coming year.  Is that a reasonable Estimate for the treatment of poor people who are denied God's gift of sight and whom charitable institutions and citizens are doing their bit to try to help?  Is that all the co-operation that is going to be given in these times when things have come to such a state owing to the rise in prices?  I appeal to the Minister to reconsider that item and treat these people generously. They are our own people and they are deserving of anything that we can give them.  It is very disheartening to hear that, in the year 1941, there is still the same old figure, with just an addition of £40, for the welfare of the blind.  I think a better head-line than that should be set by the Department, so as to encourage the various charitable organisations that are working for the welfare of the blind.  The Government should be more generous in the provision it is making.  I am totally dissatisfied with the Estimate that has been presented from this Department.  I fear that the Department is completely out of touch with the realities of the situation.  Judging by the Estimate one would imagine that we were living in normal times.  We have been told by people in high positions that we must budget for an abnormal period.  This Estimate is not doing that.  In my opinion, it is unworthy of the Department <Col N="1303" /> of Local Government, and for that reason I am moving that it be referred back.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>It was interesting to listen to the Minister.  There are some matters on which he and the country generally deserve to be congratulated. One is that of public health generally. I think it is a tribute to the schemes in operation that there has been such an improvement in the public health. At the same time, we cannot congratulate ourselves on the way in which tuberculosis has been developing through the country.  It is sad to feel that the mortality due to that disease has been on the increase.  While I do not want to throw the blame for that at anybody's door, I still am of the opinion that the Department of Local Government has been somewhat lacking. We have had reports over a number of years past from county medical officers of health up and down the country in connection with this disease to the effect that what was really needed was the provision of more sanatoria so that the infected people could be isolated from their relatives and neighbours.  A few years ago there was a great to-do in the County of Roscommon in connection with the provision of a sanatorium.  There was a three-county meeting held in Athlone with a view to getting one that would serve Offaly, Westmeath and Roscommon. The matter was taken up enthusiastically, but it never got any further.  The Department of Local Government apparently did not care for the proposal.  The Department, I think, will have to get out of the groove it has got into.  Personally, my hopes of seeing this Department get out of its present groove are pretty forlorn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>About 12 or 14 years ago I criticised the then Local Government Department in this House because I thought it was unwieldy, top-heavy, lackadaisical and that the spirit of <i>laissez faire</i> had crept in there.  I thought also it was too expensive. Since then, it has become doubly so. The number of officials has been increased by more than two to one, and <Col N="1304" /> expenditure by more than four to one, but I wonder are the people getting any better value for their money?  Why have those increases in staff and expenditure taken place?  We find that both these increases have taken place since the advent of the present Government to office.  It has been said here that quite a lot of work has to be done in the Department in connection with housing.  I agree, but if we take housing out of it, what do we find? If we take out the provision made for housing in 1931/32 and in 1932/33, and the provision that is being made for it to-day, we find that the Department is costing about £300,000 more to-day than it did at the time I speak of.  I wonder are we getting better services for that money?  What are the new services?  The figure of increased cost that I have given does not include the cost of widows' and orphans' pensions or of the personnel of that section of the Department.  Therefore, I say that if my criticism was justified 12 or 14 years ago, it is doubly justified to-day. In fact, all the speeches made here, ever since I became a member of the House, might be repeated to-night, because I do not think there has been any improvement, and that we have been going from bad to worse.</P>
    <P>Deputy Keyes referred to a hospital in Limerick.  If his experience of the Department in connection with hospitals is anything like what mine has been, all I can say is that the Department is the worst sinner I have ever come across.  In my opinion what is really wrong with this Department in dealing with the hospitalisation of the country, with the delays that take place in either approving or in rejecting plans, is that they have no person who has the guts to stand up to the architects of this country.  That is my candid opinion.  Surely if we want a district cottage hospital in Roscommon, with provision for 15 to 20 beds, we ought to be able to get a decent one at a cost of about £10,000. Instead of that we get a plan for a hospital which, at the lowest figure, is going to cost £39,000.  The result is that the project has to be abandoned after the local board of health has been put to the cost of £1,800 in getting <Col N="1305" /> plans, etc.  We have a glorious hospital in Roscommon with about 100 beds.  It has been completed for over a year but we cannot take it over because, apparently, nobody thought of putting in a sewerage scheme to serve it.  That scheme has yet to be started.  The hospital is there, and will cost us something like £1,000 per bed.  There has not been any kind of co-ordination between the Department and the local authorities in regard to hospitalisation. I regard that as a scandal of the first magnitude.  Additions have been built to mental hospitals in Ballinasloe and Castlerea.  There is a new mental hospital in Castlerea.  It would appal Deputies if I were to take up the time of the House telling them how that job was done, and of what it is going to cost the people to maintain it.  I hate talking or thinking about it.  They are all fine buildings, but their upkeep is going to blister the ratepayers.  They are glorious buildings, with the latest in flooring and furniture.  All I can say is this: all these hospitals are going to be great memorials to the architects who designed them, but as far as utility is concerned I think much less pretentious buildings would do equally well.</P>
    <P>As the Minister said, this Estimate which was presented to-day is £18,000 of an advance upon last year's Estimate.  Last year's Estimate showed an advance of something like £8,000 on the year before, and the previous year's Estimate was an advance of £11,000 on its predecessor.  But this year's Estimate is an advance of about £793,000 on 1932-33.  When we start to make comparisons between this year and last year, we forget that we made a huge jump in 1934-5 and 1935-6. Instead of steadying ourselves, and turning the money to some useful purpose such as that to which Deputy Keyes referred, we are still going along and making the machine more top-heavy; we have more of a staff than we had, and we are paying them more than we did.  We have an inspectorial staff of 43 persons.  Surely to goodness with an inspectorial staff of 43 persons we ought to be able to do things efficiently.</P>
    <P>We ought to be able to see that any <Col N="1306" /> matters in any county in Ireland that need attention are attended to at once. We ought to be able to see that there are no matters left on the files of the Local Government Department awaiting replies for months.  We have seen quite a lot recently in the public Press with regard to delays by the Local Government Department.  That is usual.  It is an everyday occurrence. It is the experience of every local authority all over the country.  We cannot get replies.  We cannot get the assistance that we ought to get.  Then the Local Government Department&mdash; and the Government apparently&mdash; thinks it is the local authorities that are at fault, and that a Managerial Bill will solve it all.  It will not.  As I said here on a previous occasion, if you do not mend matters at the top, no managerial system will give you efficient service.  The Minister said that there were delays in various schemes that were undertaken, through waiting for pipes, parts, and so on.  There were, but they were as nothing to the delays that the local authorities had to encounter through the Local Government Department itself.  We in Roscommon have experience of such a delay which is costing us hundreds of pounds at the present time.  The Local Government Department did not sanction the site for a doctor's residence. After some time, they did sanction the site, but then the contractor was building a hospital and had gone away from the site.  He charged us for coming back to the site and restarting the work; he charged us at a new price owing to the costs having increased in the meantime.</P>
    <P>I should like to draw the Minister's attention to this matter.  At the present time there is a shortage of fuel, and we have a great to-do about the provision of turf.  Owing to the circumstances, it is everybody's duty to put his shoulder to the wheel and assist in the provision of native fuel.  I will give the Minister an instance of what has happened down in Roscommon.  In the county home and hospital in Roscommon, the board of health were advised to lay in a stock of fuel some time ago.  We did, to the extent of whatever the capacity was for <Col N="1307" /> coal.  We got foreign coal, and we got native coal from Arigna. They were used for two totally different purposes.  The foreign coal was for ranges and the other was for boilers.  We did not get in a very big supply of Arigna coal, because we had not the capacity to store a lot, but we got in a fairly good supply of foreign coal.  Now, what is happening? Our supply of Arigna coal has run out, but, because we have over 100 tons of foreign coal, the Minister for Supplies will not give us a licence to get any Arigna coal.  Is not that an extraordinary thing?  Now, we are drawing upon the fuel that is not suitable for boilers, and we are possibly going to leave ourselves without suitable fuel for the ranges later on.  That is possibly happening in other places, too, and I should like to draw the Minister's attention to it. I know the Department's attention has been called to it through the minutes of the board of health in Roscommon, but I have very little hope of anything being done for a considerable time to come.</P>
    <P>Another matter to which I should like to draw the Minister's attention, is with regard to medical supplies through combined purchasing. I drew his attention to it last year, and I hear the very same complaint being made now, but it will be very much more acute now than it was last year.  As the Minister pointed out, medical supplies at the present time are not very secure, and you do not know where you are going to find them. Very often there is a chemist down the country who has a good supply of some particular medicine, and it cannot be got through the combined purchasing. I know that our local surgeon has been prevented from buying it below, even though he could not get it through the combined purchasing. That is an extraordinary thing.  We are not passing through normal times. Conditions are very abnormal at present, and the Minister ought to take cognisance of that.  At the present time you cannot apply hard and fast rules of the type which would ordinarily apply.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1308" /> The Minister paid a compliment to parish councils.  Well, in some places they are capable of and are doing a great deal of good, but I am afraid the Minister is an optimist if he thinks that in general the parish councils are operating at all.  They are in a few places, and doing quite good work, but let the Minister not pin his faith on them to provide either fuel or food for the people in a crisis, because if he does I am afraid he will not get very far.</P>
    <P>I have always been intrigued and I am still intrigued by the Housing Board.  I never could see what their functions are, although they cost us some thousands of pounds per annum, and their travelling costs are some £400 per annum.  I never heard what they did.  However, they are still here, and I suppose we will have them with us while the present Government is in office in any case.  Deputy Keyes referred to the fact that times were far from being normal, and that consequently the Estimate which is presented for the Local Government Department ought not to be normal.  I do not agree with that, because I think it would be asking quite a good deal of the Local Government Department to bring in something abnormal at the present time.  I should like to ask the Minister a question with regard to the contributions towards annual loan charges of local authorities, that is sub-head S (1)&mdash;contributions towards loan charges under the Housing (Financial and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1932.  We made provision last year for £446,000, and this year we are making provision for £516,470.  Is it the intention of the Local Government Department to continue that type of contribution? Is it in fact a contribution on behalf of the local authorities to the Local Loans Fund?  The point is that it is being made by the Government to the Government.</P>
    <P>I remember reading in the Banking Commission Report that it did appear to be rather an absurd transaction, except that there was a certain contingency attached to it; that is, that it held over the local authorities a kind of whip-hand with regard to the type of persons who should be selected for cottages. <Col N="1309" /> But there is no merit in the transaction, and there should be some other way of dealing with it besides continuing this kind of contribution. Does that £516,000 go to the Local Loans Fund?  Is the Local Loans Fund being maintained year after year by that amount of money?</P>
    <P>If so, what is the purpose of maintaining the Local Loans Fund at that size?  While, no doubt, there always will be a need for housing construction, the time ought to come when the extreme need for houses which we had and have will cease; we will come to some kind of normality and then the Local Loans Fund will not be needed to the same extent as in the past or at the present time.</P>
    <P>In such circumstances, why should the taxpayer be taxed to the extent of £516,000 as a contribution on behalf of the local authorities to the Local Loans Fund?  I should like the Minister to tell us something about that. Perhaps he will clarify the matter for us.  We have here a contribution of £516,000, which is the taxpayers' money and it is paid on behalf of the local authorities to the Government by the Government.  It is really a kind of paper transaction.  I want to know if it is being used to swell the Local Loans Fund, and, if that is so, will that procedure always continue, or when will it cease?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the heading, &ldquo;Grants for the Supply of Milk to Necessitous Children,&rdquo; I see that last year the sum was £90,000, and this year it is again £90,000.  About six months ago I drew the Minister's attention to the fact that milk had increased in price and welfare organisations, in their annual reports, have stated that, because of the fixed grants that they were getting, in order to meet the increase to the milk producers they had to reduce the supplies of milk to necessitous children.  I do not think any member of the House would wish that an increase in the price of milk should be met by taking from a certain number of necessitous children their ordinary milk supply. That statement was made in the report <Col N="1310" /> of at least one of these organisations. I sent the report to the Minister's Department.</P>
      <P>One would think that the increase in the price of milk would have been included in this Estimate so as to allow the same number of necessitous children to get the same quantity and quality of milk as they got over a year ago.  In addition to that, because of the existing conditions in the city, with further unemployment, an increase in the cost of living and generally the hardships which the poor have to bear, one would think that these grants would have been increased so as to help to save the lives of the children. I feel confident, now that I have mentioned the matter, that the Minister will consider it and see that the milk that is needed by these welfare organisations, whatever the quantity may be, will be made available.</P>
      <P>I believe that under some old Acts the Minister has power to include in his Estimate a sum of money in order to give a free supply of coal to the people who to-day are without as much as a stone of coal to boil a kettle, to dry clothes or to give warmth to themselves and their children.  It might surprise Deputies and Ministers when I tell them my experience of only a week ago.  I saw a woman at midnight going into a huckster's shop to buy 1d. worth of tea and 1d. worth of coal. I saw the 1d. worth of coal in her hand when she was coming out.  It was in the shape of a very small briquette and that was to be used to boil the kettle next morning in order to use the 1d. worth of tea.  That happened in Gloucester Street last Friday night.  I think some inspectors of charitable institutions are going into the matter.</P>
      <P>I wish the Minister could give a grant to our charitable institutions, a very big grant of £4,000 or £5,000 a week, in order to tide them over the difficulties they are facing to-day.  I hope the Minister will not wait until it is too late to see that the people of the tenements of Dublin, the unemployed men with their wives and families, get the ordinary necessaries of life which they need so much to-day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1311" /> One Deputy drew attention to hospital accommodation.  I will not go into that question very fully now, but I have been informed that so far as Dublin is concerned it is nearly impossible&mdash;it is just as hard, at any rate, as ever it was&mdash;to get a Dublin working man or his wife or child into a hospital there.  I have been told that, outside maternity cases, there is hardly a bed to be obtained.  It is difficult to get an extra bed for an accident or sickness case.  A Minister stated here some time ago that the fact that new hospitals were being built throughout the State would relieve certain beds in Dublin hospitals.  I understand that although we have hospitals in the country, lovely buildings and equipment, they are without specialised treatment and, if any person in these hospitals in any part of Ireland requires a major operation, that person has to come to Dublin to be treated by the specialists.  No method has been adopted of giving specialised treatment in the country. I hear also that some of our new hospitals are working with inadequate staffs, and that is a matter the Minister should seriously consider.  A considerable amount of money has been spent on the erection of hospitals throughout the country and I think the Minister should see to it that the people using these hospitals are able to get specialised treatment there and so leave beds in the Dublin hospitals vacant for the ordinary accident and other cases that occur in the city.</P>
    <P>Reference has also been made to housing, and I want to assure the Minister that something will have to be done very soon in regard to the housing, feeding and clothing of our people. I unhesitatingly say that the system has completely broken down.  The Dublin Corporation building houses for people and charging 10/6 and 12/6 for cottages four miles away from their work, or from where they should work, means so many loaves off the ordinary table which that family used to enjoy and something further will have to be done to enable us, with the assistance of the Government, to build houses at rents which the people can pay, without inflicting hardship or injustice on <Col N="1312" /> their families.  I ask the Minister carefully to consider the point about an additional milk supply which I know he has at heart, and to see, if it is possible under any Act, that the families of the unemployed get an immediate supply of coal free, either through his Department or through the local authorities with his assistance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>This Estimate and the manner in which it was presented to the House show very little realisation of the exceedingly critical position prevailing in this country at present. I should have thought that even some of the warnings uttered in the last few months about the exceedingly dangerous position which was developing might have been in some way reflected in the Estimate, because this Estimate and the Department of Local Government should be more seriously concerned with the position of things in the country, and more thoroughly animated by the most generous and humane considerations in dealing with that position, than any other Department. There can be very little doubt that the activities of the Local Government Department have been slowed down very considerably for a long time, and that there is in the Department an atmosphere of indecision and delay in taking decisions which has resulted in a very serious decline in the standard of administration carried out by that Department.</P>
      <P>It is the experience of all members of the House, and, I think, of the general public, that officials in the Department have invariably been kind, helpful and courteous but my conclusion is that there is a sort of paralysis on the Department which prevents decisions being taken and that the Department continually exists in an atmosphere of indecision and delay. That is a very serious matter, and I think the Minister must accept responsibility for that position.  The Minister ought to be in a position to answer complaints of that kind in the House, which have not alone been put forward in the discussion of this Estimate, but have been featured prominently in the Press for several months past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1313" /> There are certain matters for which the Minister was responsible during the year which were not referred to in his statement.  I want to recall to the Minister some of his triumphs. About 12 months ago, certain local authorities, realising that living costs were rapidly advancing, thought to show some recognition of those rising costs by giving some small increase in wages to their employees.  In County Cork, the increase given by the local authority to their road-men was the very modest sum of 2/6 per week.  After a comparatively short enjoyment of that increase, the road workers in the county were deprived of it by an order of the Minister.  I want the Minister to stand up here and justify his action in that respect because I have heard no justification of it anywhere up to the present.  It was computed that the men who were the subject of that order by the Minister were earning, at the time this increase was given to them, an average of 24/- per week, and how the Minister could justify an order to the local authorities to refuse that increase, which had been unanimously voted by all Parties in the county council, and by more than one county council in this country, is something which requires very considerable examination.</P>
    <P>I recall to the Minister, because again he must bear personal responsibility for this, that on the day the local authority was told that the Minister declined to sanction this wage increase, an order was sent to the Cork County Council to increase the salary for the position of temporary assistant medical officer of health by £100, with an intimation that if the local authority did not do so, steps would be taken to see that it would be done. Half-a-crown taken from the roadmen in County Cork and a direct order from the Minister to increase the salary for a certain position by £100&mdash;it is no wonder that people are saying and thinking the things they are saying and thinking at the moment.</P>
    <P>I was glad to hear the Minister give some tardy recognition to the fact that a very important advance in medical research was recently made by the discovery <Col N="1314" /> of a serum which is likely largely to eliminate the recurrence in the future of diphtheria.  If the Minister's statement that he is awaiting official intimation of this discovery from the research council is an answer to statements made in the Press that no official recognition was given and no notice taken of this discovery by the Local Government Department, I am glad that he has made it.  I want to refer again to this question of tuberculosis, to the fact that tuberculosis has shown signs of increasing rather than declining, and to the question of the entire inadequacy of the arrangements made for dealing with tuberculosis. It is within the knowledge of most people that the institutions set up for the treatment of tuberculosis lag very much behind the standard that ought to be maintained and achieved in such institutions.  Anybody knowing what has been done in other countries, or even reading a little of what has been done in other countries, must acknowledge how very much we lag behind, but, even in this country, we have some institutions which have achieved a fairly high standard in that respect.</P>
    <P>We have many other institutions which can give very little results, so that in many parts of the country the feeling of the patient and of the patient's relatives and neighbours, when it is known that somebody is going to a sanatorium, is that the end is not far away.  The number of people who are able to reach the two institutions which have advanced very considerably along the road of prolonging life and restoring health, in many cases, is small.  The average poor person finds it impossible to get near institutions of that kind.  I am satisfied that the arrangements made in Cork County for the treatment of tuberculosis are not adequate or satisfactory. It should be the right of every poor person in Cork County to go to Newcastle or Peamount and get what is believed to be better and more up-to-date treatment there.  The Minister precludes them from going there.  He says that, unless they are able to make a contribution out of their own resources or the resources of relatives, <Col N="1315" /> they are precluded from going to institutions of that kind and must be satisfied with local institutions.  Many medical men and others, in private conversation, will admit that that is a very serious handicap on their chances of recovery.  It is better to have plain speaking about this matter, because it is a serious matter.</P>
    <P>I am not satisfied, and many other members of local authorities are not satisfied, that the school medical services are as efficient as they ought to be.  I am not satisfied that the examination of children for dental defects or defects of sight are in rural districts anything like satisfactory.  As regards rural areas, what is described as conservative dentistry&mdash;the avoidance of extraction of teeth by timely attention&mdash;is being neglected.  It is not practised to any great extent. What is called dental treatment is the wholesale extraction of teeth, whereas the possibility is that many of the teeth could be saved for the benefit of the child for a considerable time.  I think that an arrangement could be made with part-time local dentists for conservative dentistry&mdash;periodical inspection and care of the teeth of school children.  I believe that the suggestion would give results if adopted.  While I admit the value of the original purpose of the scheme and of the principle of school medical inspection, I think it is time that many of the faults and defects revealed by the working of the system were reviewed and completely eliminated.</P>
    <P>One very considerable blot on our whole poor law system remains in spite of the many enthusiastic reformers who have come and gone during the past 17 or 18 years.  I refer to the condition of our county homes.  We have called them county homes for a long time, but they present the same grim, forbidding and miserable appearance that the old poorhouses or workhouses presented.  We have&mdash;I speak with knowledge of the circumstances in North Cork&mdash;knocked at the door of the Local Government Department and asked them, in the allocation of hospital improvement grants, to do <Col N="1316" /> something to put the hospitals and infirmaries attached to the county homes into decent condition.  Owing to circumstances over which neither the Minister nor ourselves had any control we were, unfortunately, precluded in West Cork from acquiring a very fine place.  This was some distance from Clonakilty and the intention was to convert it into a county home.  Having been frustrated in that design, we fell back on the hope of persuading the powers that be to give us some money to improve the almost intolerable sanitary conditions referred to in the report of the assistant county medical officer of health, which report was the subject of discussion both at the board and in this House.  Our effort has been in vain, so far.  We have these cheerless, miserable, unsatisfactory and, very often, unhealthy conditions, with overcrowding, in the county homes.  These conditions leave us with a number of children, a large number of unmarried mothers, a number of destitute able-bodied, and a number of people who are infirm, in one institution, without any definite plan for their classification, without any definite plan for their accommodation and without any realisation of the problems that have brought many of them into that position.  I suppose it would be too much to hope that, in the present situation, much attention could be given to this matter, but it is a serious reproach to the Local Government Department and the services generally that that condition of affairs should remain.</P>
    <P>I remember the zeal with which a number of our reformers set out, with the support of all sections, to give us, in the rural areas, self-contained hospital services.  Theirs was a very fine and praiseworthy effort to provide in each district a local hospital where people could be capably attended, no matter what class they belonged to, and where, in addition to making primary provision for the poor, accommodation would be provided for people who could afford to pay for their treatment.  They were to get every kind of skilled surgical attention, and it was to be possible to deal with urgent and acute cases locally.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1317" /> That was a very fine ideal and, on the occasion of the opening of a number of the hospitals, we had glowing speeches from officers of the Local Government Department, enthusiastic parish priests and local representatives as to the prospects.  The only drawback is that nothing in that respect has happened to any extent.  Again, I speak with knowledge of five hospitals in West Cork, where no more serious operation can be carried out than the extraction of a few teeth or something like that.  It is one of the tragedies of local government that elaborate hospitals were erected, substantial provision made in the way of operating theatres and other auxiliaries necessary for surgical work, and that these places are now used in some cases for storing medicine bottles and odds-and-ends of all kinds.  The medical officer is paid £100 a year by order of the Local Government Department, thus making certain that no work such as that for which the hospital was primarily erected can be carried out. We have the north and south infirmaries and other voluntary hospitals, with which the Minister has nothing to do, serving the people well.  Perhaps it is because the Minister has nothing to do with them they are giving, so good results and taking the place of the hospitals in the county for which the Local Government Department is responsible.  If that Department had done its duty, they would have at least one man in each district who would be capable of doing work of this kind. Thousands of pounds, which have to be spent in sending patients from rural areas to the City of Cork and paying their expenses there, would in that way be saved.  While this is being done, the local hospitals are just clearinghouses, when they are not filled with chronic patients for whom the workhouses formerly catered in this country. That is certainly a very sad turn from the road on which all of us set out with such high hopes 17 or 18 years ago.  It is well that the people should know that the responsibility for that does not rest with the local authorities, but with the Department which has not alone permitted but brought about such a situation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1318" /> I do not know where the Minister got the information that malnutrition was on the decline in this country, because it seems to me to be entirely in conflict with the position to-day.  A repetition of statements of that kind does not do any good, because everybody must realise that this is a time of cruel hardship for poor people.  I will take West Cork as being typical of the poorer rural districts of this country.  The average valuation of a holding there is about £10.  Married men in the rural areas of West Cork have been deprived of unemployment assistance.  They are expected to turn to work on the land. But the land of farmers whose valuation is about £10 is worked by the farmers themselves and their families. In fact these farmers themselves are applicants for work being done by the county council and other people.</P>
    <P>I think there has been a cynical disregard of the realities of the situation. I tell the Minister seriously that it will be too late to deal with this matter when the bread riots start and when other things happen that many people are seriously thinking about at present. If a situation of that kind develops, the Minister must bear a very considerable amount of responsibility for it, because hand in hand with the Employment Period Order which his colleague is responsible for, there has gone out an order to local authorities to stop what are called the roads rural schemes, which have all been stopped since Monday last.  No reason has been given for that.  The effect of that, in the rural areas in any case, has been an intensification of the difficulties of people who were solely depending on work of that kind.</P>
    <P>Deputy Keyes was so courteous in dealing with the cottage purchase scheme that he has not said what I intend to say, namely, that this fraud has been completely unmasked in the last 12 months.  Cottage tenants who were deluded into believing that they were going to get some bargain in connection with this matter of purchase have discovered that it is a fraud.  Consequently the Act is a dead letter and the Minister ought to repeal it.  If he <Col N="1319" /> does not repeal it, he ought to let the cottage tenants know that he too realises that this scheme will never come to anything.  It was really what it was described by some of us to be, namely, an attempt to make political capital out of the statement that they would be the owners of their own homes and that they would be independent in the future.  The fact is that the Act has completely failed, as anybody who took the least trouble to understand the problem knew it would fail.  It should be taken off the Statute Book if there is no desire to amend it or improve it.</P>
    <P>The Minister sounded strangely inconsistent when referring to parish councils and paying a tribute to the merits of local representation after having achieved during the past year a complete elimination of local representation from all local authorities. I cannot understand the Minister speaking with two voices in this matter. Either local representation is a good thing, both in a voluntary way and in connection with local authorities, or it is a bad thing.  The Minister has shown by the legislation which he has been responsible for putting through the House that he has no faith in local authorities.  I do not see how the people connected with parish councils can regard his tribute to their efforts as of very much value because of that fact.  I know that parish councils, as established by a certain organisation and working along certain lines, have done and will do a considerable amount of good.  I think they would have done very well if the Minister had not meddled with the matter at all.  In the present confused position with regard to parish councils, I doubt if very much can be achieved, in many parts of the country at all events, as a result of their efforts.  They have received very little guidance as to what they are expected to do and can do.  They have no funds to utilise for any purpose. Of course, if the desire is just to keep them talking so as to prevent people thinking of other things that can be achieved fairly well.</P>
    <P>This Estimate ought not to be passed <Col N="1320" /> without being searchingly examined and criticised.  I think the Estimate ought to be sent back for further consideration, because this year, as Deputy Keyes says, is a very abnormal year.  It is going to be a very difficult year.  The Local Government Department ought to be foremost in facing the difficulties of the present situation. There is no evidence of that in this Estimate.  There was no evidence of it in the Minister's statement.  In the absence of some realisation of the present position, the Estimate ought to be sent back for further consideration by the Minister and presented to this House again with some evidence on its face that that realisation has come about.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyLinehan" hpid="Mr. Linehan Mr. Linehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Linehan</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the main difficulties about a discussion of this Estimate is that possibly the only real solution would be to bring the Minister down to each local authority, because instead of the discussion being such as should take place in a legislative assembly, it developed into a discussion of the failure and the good work of each board of health and county council.  Unfortunately, it must be so, because even those of us who are fortunate enough not to be members of local authorities have something to say about local authorities, whether in favour of or against them.  I might surprise the Minister by saying as one legal man to another that I think the county councils are spending too much on law.  If Deputy Corry were here I am sure he would appreciate that very much.  The reason I make that point is that the Minister's Department, through the county councils, is responsible for the institution of prosecutions under the Food and Drugs Act.  It is the county councils who institute prosecutions against farmers who bring milk to the local creameries if their milk is not up to the standard in regard to butter fat or solids.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A farmer delivers milk to the creamery and the milk is tested by a Civic Guard and if it is discovered to be deficient a prosecution is then instituted in the name of the county council <Col N="1321" /> by the Civic Guard, who gives evidence. That is the position at present.  The last Food and Drugs Act was brought in to close the loophole where the defence was made that the milk was sold as it came from the cow to the farmer, but now another loophole has been discovered and that is that the county council are not the proper people to prosecute when the milk is being delivered to the creamery.  Still county councils are insisting on prosecuting farmers whose milk is below the test described when delivered to the creamery and are wasting money on prosecutions of that sort.</P>
    <P>Secondly, I might point out another example of how county councils waste money on law.  In a particular area five people may be prosecuted for not cutting their hedges after they had been served with notices within the requisite period.  The five prosecutions are brought in the District Court and are dismissed because they were not instituted in the name of the county surveyor.  They could not have been instituted in the name of the county surveyor because there was no county surveyor in Cork County.  What did the county council do?  They objected to the decision of the District Justice. I am not questioning the merits of the decision&mdash;I am simply pointing out the way the county council wasted money. Instead of picking out one case as a test case they appealed the whole five. The county council represents the ratepayers. If the county council lose the five appeals, it will cost the ratepayers £50; if they win the case it will still cost the ratepayers £50.  That is a scandalous waste of money.  I think the Minister should look into the loose way in which prosecutions are instituted and legal actions are carried on by county councils and other bodies. Of course, the Minister will realise that, when I say that, I am doing something which is most injurious to my own interests and, naturally, would not do it unless I felt deeply about the matter.</P>
    <P>There is another point.  In quite a number of board of health areas, actions have been instituted against <Col N="1322" /> the board of health by the cottage tenants for damages for breach of agreement and they have recovered damages because the cottages were not being repaired by the local authority. These decrees in favour of cottage tenants have been obtained in District Courts throughout the country.  What did the board of health do?  Instead of repairing the cottages, several boards of health passed resolutions stating that, if cottage tenants institute proceedings to compel the board of health to repair the cottages, they will reply by serving notice to quit.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, if I am put in a position of having to defend a tenant of a board of health cottage who has got a notice to quit, and who has received an ejectment summons, I have no defence in law.  It is no defence to say that the tenant has been put out through spite. If there is any board of health in these Counties of Limerick or Cork&mdash;and those are the only two areas where I can say it happened&mdash;so neglectful of its public duties that people can go into the court and get decrees for noncompliance with their legal obligations, and these boards of health retaliate by serving notice to quit, then the quicker the Minister abolishes these boards of health and puts in instead people who have an appreciation of their public duties, the better it will be for everyone.</P>
    <P>I was glad that Deputy Murphy referred to the Minister's attitude to local bodies.  On the one hand, legislation has been introduced which has taken away local powers and, on the other hand, there is a lot said in favour of parish councils.  I do not find that so inconsistent at all, as I think that, of all the rotten systems instituted and developed here, the worst was the board of health system.  What happened when the board of health system came into being was the old district councils, who were in the locality and had great local interest, disappeared. The board of health roughly covered the area of a parliamentary constituency, and eight or ten people represented the ratepayers, the poor people, and those receiving home assistance in the area.  The functions thrown <Col N="1323" /> on that board of health meant that, instead of dealing with small local matters with which they should be dealing, they went in once a month to the council meetings and, after three months in office, they were met with an agenda that would take five years to catch up with.  In fact, they never could catch up with it, and most of the county councils have not done so.</P>
    <P>If there is any good in the parish council system, I hope we will see the re-establishment of the old rural district councils.  I think it was a fine system, and it was the most democratic there ever was here.  There are a number of people in this country who would give valuable public service but who could not possibly afford to be county councillors or even afford to be T.D.s.  Those people were quite prepared to give their time and service on a local authority, provided it was in their own immediate area.  A lot of good people were taken out of public life in this country by reason of age and circumstances when rural district councils were abolished.  I do not believe that the people who came in to the boards of health instead were any great improvement.</P>
    <P>Deputy Murphy also mentioned that the Minister had treated the Cork County Council badly when he refused to sanction an increase to the road workers and suggested an increase to a highly-paid official.  I cannot understand on what basis increases are given to public officials.  A case has been made here to-night that, in the rural hospitals, which were supposed to give complete medical service in rural areas, in fact the medical service there did not go much further than drawing a tooth or an operation for tonsils.</P>
    <P>There is one exception in Cork County and that is the Fermoy Hospital.  The doctor there has performed as many major operations in any given year as any private surgeon in Cork City.  The North Cork Board of Health is sick and tired sending resolutions begging the Minister to sanction an increase in that man's salary.  If that man were given 25 per <Col N="1324" /> cent. of the amount he would be earning in private practice, he would be getting ten times his present salary. There are people&mdash;and not people representing the North Cork area&mdash;who know the services that man has given to the poor, voluntarily and for a small salary, equal to what any ten doctors would be doing in other areas.  The Minister must know about the position in that case.</P>
    <P>Time and again, the board of health have asked that that man's salary be increased and time and again that has been refused.  If the Minister would just put this query to the four representatives of North Cork here in the Dáil&mdash;the two on the Government Benches and the two on the Fine Gael Benches&mdash;and ask us individually what we know of that man's services to the community, everyone would tell him that that man has done more for the medical services in a year than any ten other doctors.  There is certainly no incentive to a first-class man to give work of that kind unless he is adequately compensated for his services.</P>
    <P>There is another thing I wish to mention.  In this case I am not quite sure if it is the Department or the local authority that is at fault.  If you question the Department they always blame the local authority and <i>vice versa.</i>  It seems to me that there is generally a long interval between the time that somebody drops out of a job and the time the job is filled.  Take the question of a county surveyor for Cork County.  The last county surveyor died and that office was vacant for a considerable time.  Perhaps the members of the Cork County Council in this House could explain why the position has not been filled, or perhaps the Minister could explain.  At the moment, the work is divided between two assistant county surveyors.</P>
    <P>Under the Local Government Act of 1925 nobody but a county surveyor is entitled to do certain acts and he is not entitled to delegate those powers.  It is rather peculiar that, in that Act, in the case of urban authorities prosecutions, notices and so on are served in <Col N="1325" /> the name of the local authority and in the case of the county council they are served in the name of the county surveyor and, if there is not a county surveyor in the county, it cannot be done. I do not know what the legal position is, but would point out to the Minister that it has already given rise to serious litigation in the area and if litigation starts on a point like that some other technical point will be raised on other occasions and it may involve the local authority in heavy expenses before it is decided.</P>
    <P>The same position applies to the county law officer in Cork.  That position has been vacant for a very considerable period.  I believe it has now reached a point where it is going to the Local Appointments Commission.  At one period it seemed as if the Cork County Council was going to make the appointment.  I am delighted to know they are not and that it is going to the Local Appointments Commission because I approve of the principle of the Local Appointments Commission and I reserve my right to criticise the appointment when it is made.  I seriously suggest that it is not good principle to have a position like the law officer for a local authority which has the handling of something like £750,000 in a year held in abeyance for a year or two.  I believe the quicker an appointment of such an important nature is made the better.</P>
    <P>Last year the Minister was shocked and horrified when I criticised the building of labourers' cottages in the country and he was very much surprised that labourers' cottages were being built throughout the country without any back door.  He practically told us, by way of interjection on that debate, that he could hardly imagine that was possible until Deputy Nally told him that such was the case in his own constituency.  I wonder did the Minister look into that position since last year, because every cottage that has been completed since, to my knowledge, within a reasonable distance of where I reside, has been built without any back door.  The man who invented that plan or who allowed that plan to be inflicted on the unfortunate <Col N="1326" /> people living in those cottages did not deserve the qualification of engineer or architect.  The Minister should realise that it means that people are bringing turf and everything else into those cottages through the front door, into the living room, instead of by the back door.  It is most uncomfortable and certainly ridiculous.</P>
    <P>Another complaint I had last year as regards my own area was the famous, recurring question of the Mallow Hospital.  I am delighted to say that the Mallow Hospital is now functioning beautifully.  But no thanks are due to the Minister or to the North Cork Board of Health because, having been built for three or four years, and standing idle at the side of the railway line, it was opened this year by the Department of Defence.  The Department of Defence marched in a complete staff of doctors and nurses with ambulances and operating tables and they are doing quite well.  But if the Department of Defence had not walked in, between the Minister and the North Cork Board of Health, that place would be a white elephant for the Lord knows how long.  I understood that the reason for not using the hospital was that certain parts, nurses' quarters and garages, had not been built.  If that was so, it was entirely wrong because, first of all, unless the plan was complete the Minister should not have allowed nine-tenths of that big building to go up and be left lying there derelict.  If the board were at fault they should have been made do their job.  It was certainly not edifying to the ratepayers and the people who sought better medical treatment in the area to see this magnificent building standing idle for the past few years.</P>
    <P>I can tell the Minister there is quite a number of people there who feel that it would have been just as well and of much more advantage to the ratepayers if the hospital had been staffed, even though it had not been fully completed, for the benefit of the ratepayers.  The medical staff which could have been put in there would have been able to carry on their work just as efficiently as the military officers are now carrying <Col N="1327" /> on.  I believe the military who are there now say that the hospital is one of the finest they were ever in.  They are perfectly satisfied with the equipment. It seems to me a terrible scandal that it was left idle for a few years until the Department of Defence discovered that waiting for them in Mallow was an hospital able to cater for the entire needs of the Munster Command of the Army.</P>
    <P>There is one very serious position in regard to cottages.  A number of contractors entered into contracts with various boards of health immediately prior to or just after the outbreak of war.  Owing to the usual delays that took place in public bodies, between sanction and everything else, these contracts were not started until the war was advanced and the contractors had to complete their contracts at a time when the cost of the materials they had to buy had risen very high compared with pre-war prices.  I understand that it is under active consideration in the Department as to whether these people would be entitled to get any compensation for the added costs or not.  I think they have a very strong case.  Assume that an estimate was made by a board of health engineer in the month of August, 1939, for 18 cottages. Some time in the month of October, 1939, those cottages were advertised.  The tenders were based on the specifications made on pre-war prices.  Owing to delay in sanction and everything else, the work was not started until some time last year and not completed until the autumn of last year.  But these people had to carry out the contracts at the price they contracted for.  Some of these contracts were actually signed pre-war.</P>
    <P>I will give the Minister an instance now of particular hardship.  One contractor entered into a contract to build 12 or 14 cottages for the North Cork Board of Health at pre-war price.  He discovered that he was not able to carry out the contract and dropped it. The board were in this position, that the walls of the cottages had been built but there were no roofs on them.  The <Col N="1328" /> board then had the remedy of bringing that man's guarantors into court and taking their legal rights against them. What happened was that one of the guarantors decided to carry out the contract himself and he completed the cottages to the satisfaction of the board and to the satisfaction of the Department's engineers.</P>
    <P>That man completed the cottages at a time that was six months later than they should have been completed normally if the original contractor had completed his contract and even though that man could have been used and might have been compelled by the court to pay damages for the non-completion of the original contract, his taking over the contract meant that the board of health got their cottages finished, the tenants are now in them, and he saved them a lot of expense. Even though he was saving his own skin at the same time, he saved them a lot of litigation.  Certainly I think that man ought to be considered when the question of giving some compensation for the rise in prices is being examined.  I believe the board of health estimate that in the case of a cottage where the contract was based upon pre-war prices a sum of £25 per cottage should be allocated.  I know of my own knowledge that that would be a very small sum, although the contractors would be satisfied to take it. I know the sum of £25 would not repay the loss they sustained by reason of the fact that they had signed contracts at pre-war prices and, owing to delays in sanction, bad weather and everything else, they had to complete the contracts when the cost of the material had greatly increased.</P>
    <P>There is one other point as regards contracts which I can never understand. It is assumed that a building scheme or sewerage scheme or some scheme of that nature is being carried out by a local authority.  The Department's engineers or the local authority's engineers estimate the cost of that scheme.  We will say they fix it at £1,000.  The contract is then advertised and tenders are received. Generally, the local authority takes the lowest tender.  I have known cases <Col N="1329" /> recently where the lowest tender has been far lower than the Department's estimate.  I think that is a very bad policy because, if the Department's engineers or the local authority's engineers know their job, the figure they give must be a reasonable figure, allowing for the cost of material, the duration of the contract and the wages paid, and if a man is prepared to take a contract at a considerably lower figure than their estimate, it would suggest that the work is scamped or that proper wages are not paid.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TimothyLinehan" hpid="Mr. Linehan Mr. Linehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Linehan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and a person takes a contract at a figure substantially lower than their estimate, either he is scamping the work or paying lower wages.  There is no other explanation. I say it has given rise to a type of contractor in this country who is of no benefit to the board of health or to the country.  I do not know exactly how to describe him.  He is not a carpenter; he is not a tradesman; he is not a mason; very often he is not even a good handyman; but, because he thinks it is an easier way of living than to work for an employer, he blossoms forth into a contractor.  He and four or five friends are prepared to cut contract prices and, as I believe, count their own time for nothing if they get £5 out of the job.  It may be a way of getting the work done more cheaply, but I do not think it is a good principle, and I believe that the Minister for Local Government and Public Health should make a survey with regard to the contractors for such works in this country and find out what was being done and whether they were paying proper wages.  Then, if the Minister was satisfied that the engineer's estimate of, say, £1,000, was correct, he could advertise the contract for <Col N="1330" /> tender.  He could take the lowest tender, provided that he was satisfied that the conditions would be observed; and if there were a number of reputable contractors prepared to do the work at that estimate, I do not see why their names should not be put into a hat, so to speak, and drawn from the hat. Any member of a board of health must be aware of the number of alleged contractors, of the type I have referred to, who grew up suddenly as a result of the various building schemes, and who collapsed just as quickly.  Members of various boards of health have had sad experience of that type of contractor, and I hold that there is a sufficient number of reputable contractors in the country, whose interests should be considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another matter to which I should like to refer is the question of the collection of rates.  Actually, one of the most serious acts of an officer of a local authority, that I am aware of, was what was done by certain rate collectors of the Cork County Council with regard to the payment of rates.  Everybody knows that when the rates are struck and announced by any local authority the first moiety is due on the 31st March and the second moiety is due on the 1st October, but everybody also knows that under the old system the first moiety was always collected before the 31st September, and the second moiety was collected some time about the following 31st March.  That gave the ratepayers a reasonable chance of making their payments, and it also gave the rate collectors reasonable time for closing their books.  To my own knowledge, however, the rate collectors in the case I am referring to issued printed notices to this effect: &ldquo;You will have to pay your first moiety by the end of September and the second moiety in October.&rdquo; The first moiety is usually due in the beginning of September and the second moiety is paid in March, but the rate collectors were asking for the first moiety on the 1st September and the next in October.  I might inform the Minister that I know of one case where a ratepayer was served with a summons in this connection and brought before <Col N="1331" /> a district justice, and the district justice said to the ratepayer: &ldquo;I am sorry for you, but the law is the law, and the second moiety is due after the 1st October.&rdquo; The district justice expressed his compassion for the man concerned, but had to follow out the law, even though he pointed out that that was not the usual practice.  Now, I say that any rate collector who uses his authority in that way should be sacked, because 90 per cent. of the people in rural areas are good ratepayers and they have always been in the habit of paying the first half of their rates before the 30th September and the second half on the 31st March, and, as a matter of fact, they always got a rebate for doing so.  I think it is a scandal that an officer of a local authority should use his powers to insist on people doing what would impose a hardship on these people. Every country Deputy knows, as well as I do, that there will be hundreds of farmers in a particular area who will have half the moiety in their pockets in September, but will not have the second half until the 31st March.  I would ask the Minister to look into that matter with a view to seeing that people should not be asked to pay the second moiety until the time they have been in the habit of paying it, and that the second moiety should not be demanded as it has been in the case to which I am referring.</P>
    <P>With regard to this question of allotments, I recently put down a question to the Minister in connection with the giving of an allotment to the wife of a serving soldier, and I mentioned a particular case.  The man concerned was serving in the Army, and the Minister undertook to see that the local authority would give the necessary facilities, but I see that, in answer to a question to-day by Deputy Everett, the Minister stated that the wife of a certain man, now in the Defence Forces, was asked to pay £3 for an allotment.</P>

      <P>Yes.  Well, I think it is unreasonable that when an unemployed man took over a plot at a nominal rent of 1/- and has afterwards joined the forces, his wife should be asked to pay that money.  The wife is in an entirely different position, since her husband is in the Army, and she would probably have to get somebody to till or work that plot for her. I think that the wives of serving soldiers who get allotments from rural or urban authorities should be treated in the same way as their husbands were before they joined the forces. The parish councils and local authorities do not seem to know what the position is.  It is not easy to get allotments near a country town, but some of these lands are being let in conacre already, but the position seems to be that although the parish councils would like to provide allotments for the people they have no power to do so.  The local bodies have certain statutory powers, but the exercising of such powers would mean a considerable delay, and that would mean that the allotments would be useless so far as this year is concerned.  I wonder would the Minister consider doing something that would authorise boards of health or local authorities, generally, to acquire land compulsorily for allotments? At least, something should be done in that connection, because the local authorities, with all the goodwill in the world, if they cannot get such lands voluntarily, will not be able to acquire them compulsorily without a long delay.  I do not know whether the parish councils could deal with this matter of allotment schemes in another way, and perhaps it would not give as good a result.  I know of cases of parish councils, the members of which went around to farmers and asked the farmers concerned if they were prepared to give one or two roods for allotments, and the farmers agreed to do so, but in some cases they might not agree.  There are many farmers living within a reasonable distance of a country town who would be quite willing to give four or five roods of land for such a purpose, and that would mean the provision of extra work.</P>

      <P>To-day at Question Time I asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether he had received, from public bodies in County Cork, resolutions protesting against the increase in the bus fares recently imposed by the Great Southern Railways Company and, if so, whether he is in a position to say if action will be taken to give effect to the demands expressed in such resolutions.  The reply I got referred me to an answer given to a question standing in the joint names of Deputies Bartley and Keane.  From the question which these Deputies put down, it is apparent that resentment against the increase in bus fares is not confined to Cork county.  The question pointed out that there was much disquiet and resentment at what was regarded as an attempt to take advantage of the situation of monopoly created by the petrol shortage.  I want to point out that resentment is not confined to Cork.</P>

      <P>On March 20th, I addressed a question to the Minister asking if he were aware of the increases that were being brought about and what action he proposed to take in the matter.  In reply he stressed the fact that the company had legal rights in the matter and he did not go beyond that.  The answer did not in any way satisfy the peoples' demand for some kind of inquiry or investigation by the Minister's Department or some other Department to find out if those increases <Col N="1334" /> were justified.  The Minister relied altogether on the legal rights of the company, forgetting that the people have rights in this matter as well.  The people have a right to see that their interests are safeguarded and if the Minister or some section of his Department cannot safeguard those rights, I ask the Minister in what way can the people be safeguarded against the monopolies that have been created and against exploitation by these monopolies?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister told me that since the 20th March, he had received protests from public bodies including a protest from the Cork County Council, a body representing the whole of Cork.  As far as I can see from the answer I received, he has not, up to the present at any rate, taken any action as result of these protests.  It is rather unusual to find such spontaneous protests coming from all sections of the people and from all parts of the country as we have on this question of the increase in bus fares.  It is remarkable also that the Government on their own initiative have not taken any steps to see whether those increases were justified, considering the fact that it is the declared Government policy that no section of the people&mdash;and I assume that includes the directors and other people in charge of the Great Southern Railways buses&mdash;should be allowed to recoup themselves during this emergency at the expense of other sections. That policy has been very well put into operation with regard to increases in wages that were given to workers.  These increases were strenuously resisted as far as Government Departments were concerned.  I can quote one striking example in which an increase of 2/7 per week was given to road workers.  That increase required the sanction of the Local Government Department, which sanction was refused on the ground that it was contrary to Government policy that any section of the people should be allowed to recoup itself for increases in the cost of living at the cost of other sections. These road workers are very poorly paid.  Their expenses have gone up very considerably owing to the increased cost of living but, at the same <Col N="1335" /> time, the Government strenuously resisted their demand for an increase.</P>
    <P>Let us now turn to the increases that have been secured by the Great Southern Railways Company in their receipts.  What extra expenses have they to meet?  So far as I am aware there has been no increase in wages. There has been no increase in the cost of petrol.  They have a monopoly of transport in the South of Ireland and, owing to the petrol shortage, there has been a very substantial increase in the number of passengers carried.  Still the Minister tells us they have a legal right to increase their fares.  He does not tell us what moral right they had to increase these fares.  Are they justified in increasing these fares?  He has taken no steps to investigate that side of the question.  He has taken no steps to see that they will not be allowed to recoup themselves at the expense of the people generally.</P>
    <P>What is the type of people from whom the Great Southern Railways Company have decided to recoup themselves?  They are principally workers, people who have been travelling on these buses since the inception of the service.  In my constituency places like Crosshaven, Ballycotton, Castlemartyr, Riverstown, Glanmire, Passage, and Rochestown have been very seriously affected by these increases.  I might also mention Kinsale and other places in the West Cork constituency.  Numbers of workers come from those areas to the City of Cork.  They include members of the various trades and also girls who work in offices and shops.</P>
    <P>It would be no harm at this stage to quote from a letter, typical of many others, which I have received on this question.  It does not come from any member of the Labour Party but, as the writer says, he is one of my constituents.  He lives in Crosshaven, County Cork.  The letter states:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The increases which take effect on and from the 19th instant are, as far as can be ascertained: Single fare Cork-Crosshaven, now 1/-, is to be increased to 1/9.  The adult weekly <Col N="1336" /> ticket (one journey each way daily for six days) now 8/8, is to be increased to 15/9.  There are other weekly tickets for &lsquo;student,&rsquo;&lsquo;apprentice,&rsquo;&lsquo;child&rsquo;.  I have no information what the increases in these cases are but, presumably, they are in proportion to the increases mentioned above.  I also understand that the single fare on the 6.50 a.m. bus Crosshaven to Cork, via Monkstown and Passage (obviously a workers bus) is to be increased from 1/- to 2/6.  These are the figures which the company's officials have given out but they state they &lsquo;are not definite on the matter yet&rsquo;.  As a daily traveller on the 9.15 a.m. bus Crosshaven to Cork and the 6.15 p.m. bus to Crosshaven, I can tell you that the mildest term I have heard applied to the company's action is &lsquo;outrageous&rsquo;.  The views expressed by passengers include the following: (1) an increase of wages to the company's employees would justify an increase in the fares to some extent (hardly 75 per cent.) but the employees say they are not getting an increase.  On the contrary the company have reduced their weekly earnings (in the case of employees I have spoken to) by reducing their working hours and discontinuing (except in, I think, two cases) the supplying of duplicate or relief buses during the heavy traffic periods of the day.  (2) The traffic on this route is even in winter of heavy volume as evidenced by the fact that, after cutting off two buses each way, the company's &lsquo;restricted&rsquo; service schedules 12 buses from Cork and 12 buses from Crosshaven daily.  (3) The cutting out of &lsquo;relief&rsquo; buses means loss of employment for drivers and conductors, and allows the company to carry human lives in a manner which they would not be allowed to treat livestock.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The writer goes on to point out that men with families, including children travelling to school to Cork, cannot afford the new rates.  15/9 per week is too big&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I was about to quote the figures sent to me.  This writer goes on to say:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;15/9 per week&mdash;the cost of the weekly ticket&mdash;is too big a slice out of the wages of the manual workers and the girls working in factories and in business houses.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The result is that a number of those people have either to get digs in Cork or lose their employment.  The whole question turns on what is the necessity for those increases.  May I put it to the Minister in this way: Even if the increases were justified, is this an opportune time to put this very heavy burden on the people who have to travel on buses, when we consider that Government policy is quite contrary to this procedure?  I want to know from the Minister why he has not made any inquiry as to whether those fares are justified or not.  When that has been done, the question will arise what power he has.  I suggest that the Minister has ample powers, under the Emergency Powers Act of 1939, to deal with a situation like this.  Are the people whom I have mentioned, principally workers and children, to be mulcted to the extent that I have indicated by the monopoly company operating on those routes?  Some people suggested to me that the Minister could deal with this by introducing a Bill.  I think the most expeditious <Col N="1338" /> way of dealing with it would be under the Emergency Powers Act.</P>
    <P>Under that Act, the Minister could deal with the situation at once.  At the moment he seems to regard the matter as being outside his jurisdiction because of the legal rights enjoyed by the company.  During the week-end it was pointed out to me that a number of men who had been kept on since the petrol shortage arose, and since the putting into force of restrictions on the use of buses, have been disemployed because there was now no need for relief buses and no overtime offering. The result of that was that there were 22 dismissals last week-end, attributed locally to the increase in fares.  I want to put this case to the Minister from the point of view of the people who are directly concerned and who have protested to me.  Mention has been made in the House of the very useful functions that parish councils could perform. On this subject I have received a number of letters and resolutions from parish councils.  This one is typical of them:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That this council protests most strongly against the excessive in crease in the bus fares between Crosshaven and Cork as imposing an almost impossible burden on working-class residents employed in the city, and on parents who are trying to continue their children's education at secondary and vocational schools.  And that copies of this resolution be sent to the Minister for Industry and Commerce, the T.D.s of the area and the manager, Great Southern Railways.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That, as I have said, is typical of a number of resolutions I have received from parish councils.  If the parish councils and the county council, which have made protests on this matter, do not represent the voice of the people of Cork County, then I must confess that I am at a loss to know what other method we should adopt to bring this matter forcibly to the notice of the Minister.  I have said already that I had noted from Question 18, which appeared on to-day's Order Paper, that this matter had been taken up by <Col N="1339" /> people in other districts, not only by the members of this Party but by the members of the Minister's own Party. Surely, in the face of such a consensus of opinion it is time the Minister took action in this matter and decided that the present is not an opportune time for an increase in those fares.  The increased fares mean an increase in the cost of living for those who are obliged to travel by bus.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to consider, in the first place, the justification, or otherwise, for an increase in the fares, apart altogether from the legal aspect of the matter.  Secondly, I would ask him, if he considers, as I am sure he will, that those increases are not justified, to take power under the Emergency Powers Act to compel the Great Southern Railways Bus Company to restore their fares, at least to the level at which they were before the 20th March.</P>

I did not, in my reply to Question No. 18, refuse to investigate these charges.  I stated very distinctly that the whole matter is at present the subject of examination by my Department.  When we have examined it, we can then see whether&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The investigation <i>prima facie</i> must be devoted to ascertaining whether the company in increasing their fares have committed a breach of the regulations.  There are 11,500 fares in which increases have taken place, and it will take some time to examine them.  When the matter has been investigated we will then consider, in the light of the information we have obtained from the company as to its costs, whether we would be justified in amending the regulations.  That is not a decision to which we could come in a hurry, or without searching examination.  If we start on the assumption that when the maximum fares were increased in 1932, conditions were very much easier than they are to-day, and that the maxima then allowable were justified on the score of the existing costs of the company, the position to-day is that the company has found itself compelled, drastically, to reduce its services.  Such a reduction would, of course, be a source of increased cost to the company even if operating charges, such as wages and petrol, had not increased.  Wages and petrol are not the only cost-factors with which the company has to contend. There is the cost of maintenance, and the cost of materials for maintenance, and over and above that there is the fact that there are heavy overhead charges of the company's road services.  All this will have to be borne by traffic which has diminished possibly by 50 per cent. to 60 per cent. Naturally, the railway company is not in the position to operate these services at a loss.  The Deputy is as familiar as I am with the precarious position of the railway company, a position to which it has been reduced by reason of the fact that costs have been continuously increased, while traffic receipts have been going down.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I will have to leave the House if the Deputy interrupts. The Deputy knows that the buses are operated by the railway company.  In <Col N="1341" /> these circumstances, it is quite clear that the first thing we shall require to be satisfied about is that the company has not exceeded its existing legal rights, as laid down by regulations, and in the next place, in justice to the passengers, we shall have to consider whether the maxima permitted by the regulations are, in fact, too high.  We have to consider what would be the just maxima for the railway and owners of the buses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is very definitely a problem in which we must not do an injustice to any section if we can avoid it.  Certainly it would not be justice suddenly to transfer to the proprietors of the railway company in existing circumstances the whole of a loss which some party must bear.  Accordingly, as I have indicated, the question is one for investigation and, as I told the Deputy in my reply to-day, it is being investigated at the moment.  The Deputy must bear in mind that this is not the only problem in which the Transport and Marine <Col N="1342" /> Section of my Department has to deal; that there are other questions of very much greater moment, in one way or another, with which it is concerned, questions that are much more vital for the country and to which only a certain amount of time and staff can be allocated. When this very involved question has been investigated then we may take any action that seems warranted by the facts, when ascertained.</P>
