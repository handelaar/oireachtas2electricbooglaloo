    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for External Affairs whether it is a fact that German aeroplanes bombed and machine-gunned the Irish ship, <i>S.S. Glencree,</i> bound for Éire with a cargo of coal, whether the ship was clearly marked as an Irish ship and what those markings were, and whether he will now direct the arming of Irish ships in order to prevent such attacks being made on undefended crews in the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for External Affairs (The Taoiseach)</NameTxt>
      <P>At 6.30 p.m. on the 5th November, the <i>Glencree</i> was subjected to machine-gun and cannon fire from a German aircraft at a point about ten miles off the English coast.  Three bombs fell between the <i>Glencree</i> and another vessel which was sailing with her.</P>
      <P>The <i>Glencree</i> bore clear nationality markings consisting of the national colours and the name &ldquo;Éire&rdquo; on her sides, and the national colours in two places on her deck.  The <i>chargé d'affaires</i> in Berlin has been instructed to protest to the German Government.</P>
      <P>In the present circumstances, I am not prepared to alter the decision against arming our ships.  The matter has been carefully considered, and I am satisfied that the decision we have taken is still the one best calculated to reduce the risks to which our crews are exposed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that the reason he gives for declining to arm these ships is that he desires to minimise the risk to seamen, has the Minister for External Affairs consulted with the representatives of the seamen as to whether, in their judgment as experienced mariners, his view with regard to this matter is the correct one or not?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not myself seen the representatives of the seamen, but I know that the Department concerned has examined this matter very carefully.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am perfectly certain that the views of the seamen in connection with this matter would be represented to the Department.  I have no definite knowledge that they have been, but I will make further inquiries, if the Deputy considers that necessary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for External Affairs certainly seems to know very little about this.  What I want to know is, will steps be taken forthwith to discuss with the representatives of the Irish sailors whether, in their judgment, their safety is best ensured by leaving them open to murderous attacks by all and sundry on the high seas?</P>

    <Title>Ceisteanna&mdash;Questions.   Oral Answers. - Copper Coins.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether he is aware (1) that there is a growing shortage of copper coins in circulation; (2) whether representations have been made to him that certain persons are offering more than the face value of such coins; and, if so, whether he will take steps to prevent any interference with the currency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. O Ceallaigh) Seán T. O'Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. O Ceallaigh)</NameTxt>
      <P>While I am aware that various statements have been published about the alleged shortage of copper coin, I have no ground for believing that the amount of copper coin in circulation is, in fact, inadequate.  Considerable fresh issues of copper coin have been made by the Currency Commission during the past two years, with the result that the total face value of such coin outstanding has risen during the two years ended 31st ultimo from about £97,000 to about £127,000.  Considerable further issues of nickel coin have also been made during the same period.</P>
      <P>I am aware of allegations that there have been purchases of copper coin at more than its face value, but I have seen no evidence to support them. Although such statements are inherently improbable, the penny being much more valuable as money than as metal, I shall not overlook the need for preventing any improper interference with the currency in these or other circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Tánaiste the only man in Ireland who has not heard of a <Col N="700" /> scarcity of copper coins?  Has he not experienced the difficulty of getting pence and halfpence when he wants them?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Then he is a happy man &mdash;he deals only in gold and silver.  I have been scouring the country for pence and halfpence and the banks tell me they cannot get any.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. F.H. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if, in view of the shortage of pipe and cigarette tobacco and the increasing difficulty of importing these commodities, he will permit and encourage a substantial increase in the acreage of home-grown pipe and cigarette tobacco.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, substantial encouragement has been given to growers by this year's Finance Act, which increased the difference between the customs and excise rates of duty from 10d. to 1/1 per lb.  I will be prepared to consider favourably proposals for a further increase next season in the acreage under home-grown tobacco in the light of the experience obtained in the present year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Supplies whether it is his custom to answer letters addressed to his Department in the English language with circulars printed in Irish; and, if so, whether in view of the fact that some of his correspondents do not understand Irish he will consider replying to letters written in English in English and to letters written in Irish through the medium of Irish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not the custom of my Department to answer letters addressed to the Department in the English language with circulars printed in Irish.  It may be that the Deputy has in mind the printed form which is used in acknowledging the receipt of letters addressed to the Department. This form is printed in Irish only.  The practice of issuing acknowledgments in Irish has been followed by all Government Departments for over 12 years and I see no reason why any exception should be made to the general rule so far as my Department is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I suggest to the Minister that some note might be put on the Irish circular indicating that it is an acknowledgment of the letter and that a further letter will follow? Repeatedly people in the country write to me saying that they cannot understand this document.  That may not have been a serious matter before the vast extension of the work of the Department of Supplies, but now, when every small shopkeeper in rural Ireland is constrained from time to time to get into communication with the Department on matters which, very often, in their judgment, are urgent, it makes it extremely difficult for them if they get a document in reply, the contents of which they do not understand. If there were a footnote to the effect that a further communication would come in due course, or something of that kind, I suggest that it would be a good idea.</P>

      <P>Might I put this to the Minister?  Generally speaking, when a person in the country gets an acknowledgment of that particular type <Col N="705" /> he does not understand it.  To my own personal knowledge, in five cases at least, people have told me that they had a letter from Mr. Lemass himself &mdash;although the letter was from the Department of Agriculture&mdash;because it was signed &ldquo;Mise le meas.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been the standard practice in all Government Departments, since 1929, that acknowledgments of correspondence go out in Irish only.  There is, I think, a Government order in existence requiring that, but I shall have the Deputy's suggestion considered.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health whether he is aware that 25 nurses were elected by the Dublin Board of Assistance to the staff of St. Kevin's Hospital, Dublin Union, on the 29th October, 1941; whether it is a fact that the qualifications of none of the applicants were placed before the Dublin Board of Assistance for their consideration and guidance in basing their selections; whether at least one of the candidates was notified officially that no interview was necessary, although only those candidates who were interviewed were recommended by the Medical Selection Committee as suitable for appointment; whether 17 of the 25 candidates recommended by the Medical Selection Committee as suitable for appointment on account of outstanding qualifications were rejected by the Dublin Board of Assistance without reference to qualifications or merit, and whether in view of the foregoing facts he will withhold sanction for these appointments and cause a Departmental inquiry to be instituted into the method of election by the Dublin Board of Assistance.</P>

      <P>From the information at my disposal the Dublin Board <Col N="706" /> of Assistance dealt with the matter at their meetings on the 1st, 15th, and 29th ult., at each of which the Deputy is recorded as being present.  On the 1st ultimo the board directed advertisements to be issued inviting applicants for appointment as trained nurses.  At the meeting of the 15th October the board had before them the following report of medical staff:&mdash;&ldquo;The medical staff have had before them 318 applications for 25 positions of temporary nurses.  One hundred and eleven applicants reside in Dublin and are apparently qualified.  Thirteen others who reside in Dublin are over age and are therefore disqualified.  The medical staff recommend that 111 applicants residing in Dublin be interviewed by a board consisting of the resident medical superintendent or deputy, one or more of visiting medical staff, and the matron, and submit to board of assistance lists of all of these nurses qualified and suitable.  `A' list to include nurses suitable for eight posts for which special experience in operation theatre or other special departments is essential.  `B' list (including those in `A') suitable for remaining vacancies.  Before taking up duty nurses should be medically examined.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>According to minutes of proceedings the board made the following order:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Approved.  Applications received to date to be submitted to the board.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>At the meeting of the 29th October the resident medical superintendent submitted the report of the committee of the medical staff and matron on candidates interviewed in accordance with the board's instructions of the 15th October, 1941.  The report is as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;We submit to the board of assistance lists&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  giving names of nurses interviewed who are specially recommended for the eight special appointments;</P>
      <P>(b) nurses interviewed and specially suitable for remaining posts;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(c)  containing names of all <Col N="707" /> nurses interviewed including those in (a) and (b) who have all average training and are suitable for appointment.</P>

    <P>At the meeting of the 29th October the board of assistance appointed all the applicants whose names appeared on the list marked (a) of the selection committee.  According to the minutes of proceedings the board then proceeded to select 17 nurses from the lists of all remaining candidates except those over age and those whose applications were received after the 15th ultimo.  The 17 candidates chosen include six of the applicants whose names appeared on list (b) of the selection committee, and the names of these applicants as well as eleven other candidates appointed were included in list (c) of the selection committee as nurses who had all average training and were suitable for appointment.</P>
    <P>The matter of according sanction to the appointments will not arise until the board of assistance have furnished the Department with particulars of the applicants, including details of their qualifications.  That information has not yet been furnished.</P>

      <P>Is the Parliamentary Secretary aware that the order, made by the board on the 15th October, in relation to the matter of confining the selections to nurses with postal addresses in Dublin, was made between 10.30 and 11 o'clock in the morning, when less than half the number of board members were present, although the election was advertised to be proceeded with at 12 o'clock as was stated also on the agenda circulated among the members?  Is he further aware that, notwithstanding the fact that it appeared to be the policy to select nurses with Dublin postal addresses, six candidates were interviewed with <Col N="708" /> postal addresses in the country, two of whom were appointed and, in fact, I think, placed on the Medical Selection Committee &ldquo;A&rdquo; list?</P>

      <P>I am not aware as to the time of day when a decision was reached by the board to restrict appointments to certain classes of people.  I am aware that all the persons appointed were on some one of the lists submitted to the board by the selection committee.  It is true that the board did not appear to follow the exact recommendations of the selection committee, inasmuch as the selection committee recommended 17 who were specially suitable for the remaining posts.  At the same time the Deputy will appreciate that all the persons appointed, if they were not deemed to be specially suitable by the selection committee, were at least persons who were described by the committee as having average training and being suitable for appointment.  I do not think I can throw any further light on the matter for the Deputy until the query sheets are returned to the Department.  If, in fact, any of the candidates appointed by the board has not the necessary qualifications set out in the advertisements, sanction will not be given to the appointment.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the extent of the flooding which has occurred in North Kerry, near Listowel, having directed an immediate inspection to be made in order to ascertain the full facts.  The question of the immediate alleviation of the distress occasioned has been promptly dealt with by the Kerry Board of Health and Public Assistance who have provided temporary accommodation and assistance for all the families affected, and by a local relief committee which has been formed and which has received from the Red Cross Society a contribution of £200.  It is necessary to emphasise that the question of the further steps to deal with conditions created by the flooding is not mainly one for the Department of Local Government and Public Health but will be examined by that Department in conjunction with the other Departments and interests concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. Derrig)</NameTxt>
      <P>
      </P>
      <P>(1)  The position in regard to a pass in singing as a preliminary condition for admission to the women's training colleges for national teachers is as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Students admitted to the training colleges for women in any particular year may be included in any of the following four categories:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  Girls who have successfully completed a course in one of the Department's preparatory colleges;</P>
      <P>(b)  Nuns or lay native speakers of Irish who, having qualified at the training college entrance examination, are eligible for admission to training by selection, i.e., on a noncompetitive basis;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="712" /> (c)  University graduates who have fulfilled certain specified conditions at the training college entrance examination;</P>
    <P>(d)  Girls who have qualified for admission to training by open competition at the training college entrance examination.</P>
    <P>A pass in singing at the training college entrance examination is an essential qualification for all candidates other than those of group (a) and the nun candidates of group (b).</P>
    <P>In the case of candidates in group (a) &mdash;preparatory college students&mdash;singing is a compulsory test at the preparatory college entrance examination, but candidates whose general answering shows high merit may be accepted, even if they fail in the test in singing.</P>
    <P>Nun candidates at the training college entrance examination are not required to pass in the test in singing, but nuns who fail to pass in singing are not eligible for appointment subsequently in schools other than those in which suitable provision is made for the teaching of the subject.  Notice has been given that it may be necessary in connection with future examinations to require members of religious communities to pass in singing at the training college entrance examination.</P>
    <P>(2)  Music (singing) is an essential subject of the programme for national schools in all cases in which the teachers are qualified in the subject. It is most important from the cultural point of view, that as many as possible of the pupils of primary schools should receive effective instruction in singing, and it is consequently necessary that every effort should be made to ensure that the teachers leaving the training colleges are adequately qualified in that respect.  The current regulations represent a development in a policy designed to secure this position at an early date.  It is not regarded, then, as desirable in the interests of the children and of the nation as a whole that the existing requirements in this matter should be relaxed; rather, is it hoped in time, to extend to all categories of candidates (both men and <Col N="713" /> women) the obligation of passing in singing as a condition precedent to admission to a training college.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is under a misapprehension in this matter.  In the late news bulletin on the evening in question approximately six minutes' time was devoted to the debate on Agriculture, of which a statement by the Minister, including replies to points raised by Deputies Dillon and Hughes, occupied four minutes, and criticism by these Deputies of the Minister's policy in regard to the marketing of barley and oats and prices of seed wheat, the remaining two minutes.

      <P>When dealing with this matter on the last evening, I stated that, in my opinion, this was one of the most serious Estimates this House would have to consider for a long period.  The Minister for Supplies is responsible for the supply of all necessities to this country during a very trying period, the period of the war. He has to face the responsibility for seeing that the people of this country will have sufficient bread during that period.  I warned the Minister the last day, and I repeat that warning now, that, in my opinion, from the knowledge that I have of the country, he will not get anything like 300,000 acres of wheat grown this year at 41/- per barrel&mdash;he has no hope of getting it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is making provision in his Estimate for the extra cost of wheat, and I suggest that he is not, on the one hand, making sufficient <Col N="720" /> provision, and, on the other hand, that the provision he is making is being spent in the wrong manner. The Minister states he is making provision for the import of something like 80,000 tons of wheat at his present figure of roughly about £33 per ton. I suggest to the Minister that, with world conditions as they are, he has very little hope of getting 80,000 tons of wheat across the Atlantic and, if he can bring in 80,000 tons of anything across the Atlantic, I suggest to him that it should not be wheat.  I suggest that wheat can be grown here in sufficient quantity for this country's needs.  We have proved it.  We have worked on that policy ever since 1932. Now is the time to try out that policy. The Minister's 80,000 tons will cost about £2,500,000 landed here at £33 per ton.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>And we can give him 120,000 tons for the same price.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest that, in the Minister's position of responsibility for seeing that this nation has sufficient bread, he should take steps to see that the full quantity of wheat is grown at home; that he should consider the agricultural community in the same manner as he is considering the industrial side of it.  If he does that, the agricultural community will supply him with sufficient wheat.  The Minister stated here:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The total amount of commodities which all those ships, working at their fullest capacity, can bring in a year is very limited.  Every ton of wheat which we bring in in excess of the minimum required to maintain the quantity of flour required by our people can only be imported by stopping something else and there are many other commodities, essential commodities, which are in such short supply that we must avail of these shipping facilities to bring them in.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest that we can spare him 80,000 tons, which is the quantity he is budgeting for.  I suggest further that, if the Government stick to their present proposal of 41/- per barrel for wheat in the coming season, he will want <Col N="721" /> to budget, not for the import of 80,000, but 200,000 tons, and more perhaps. The position is too serious.  I ask the Minister to look at it in the light of the seriousness of the situation.  We grew 490,000 acres of wheat last year. The Minister said he expected to get 290,000 tons of wheat from the Irish wheat crop.  But even that has not materialised.  Out of 490,000 acres, he was not able to get 290,000 tons.  He has got 170,000 tons, and perhaps he may get up to 200,000; but I doubt it. That shows that the yield this year and the situation of the Irish farmer who grew wheat were worse even than we thought.  I budgeted myself on getting between 8½ and nine barrels per statute acre.  I got six to the acre, and was lucky to get it.  Some of my neighbours did not get six.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I got 50/- for wheat for seed and they were glad to buy it at that.  If we are to work on the basis that every ton of shipping belonging to Irish Shipping Limited that can be spared should bring in something else besides what wheat is required, then I say to the Minister: &ldquo;Let us have an economic price fixed for wheat this season.&rdquo;  It would pay him better.  He can afford to give up to 50/- per barrel for Irish wheat and lose nothing by it.  In fact he would gain by it.  He would gain to the extent of the foreign securities that have to be used for the foreign wheat, as against our own currency here.  I suggest that it is nothing short of criminal lunacy in the middle of a war to start out on an economic fight for our daily bread.  I <Col N="722" /> say that frankly as one who made up his mind away back in other years that this country would not be caught out during the period of a war for want of sufficient wheat being grown here to supply our own people.  I started out with that before my mind and, despite all the codology preached here by Deputy Dillon, we stuck to that.  If this country to-day finds itself in the position that the greater portion of its requirements in wheat are grown in the country, it has to thank the Minister for Supplies and other Ministers like him.  I want to give him praise for that; but I ask him now not to spoil it in the midst of a trial by expecting the agricultural community to do this year what, in my opinion, they will not do, and that is grow wheat at an uneconomic price.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister whose Vote we are considering now is the Minister who is responsible for seeing that we have sufficient supplies in this country.  The responsibility rests on his shoulders, and I am suggesting to that Minister, who budgeted for 290,000 tons of wheat last year, and who states he has only got 170,000 tons out of 490,000 acres, that if he is going to ensure that this country will get a sufficient supply of wheat this year he will have to change his plan.  Instead of spending £2,500,000 in trying to bring wheat across the water, he should use that money for the production of home-grown wheat here and see what the result will be.  It is a far safer insurance policy than investing money in the hope of bringing anything <Col N="723" /> across the water in the present condition of world affairs.</P>
      <P>Every other class in the community is catered for.  The agent, who never sees our wheat, who never bothers with our wheat, who only gets the cheque and passes it along to us, gets his commission. He is provided for.  The miller is provided for.  He gets 6 per cent on his shares.  Every other class in the community is provided for except the man on whom dependence must be in the first instance, because if the farmer does not produce neither the miller nor the agent will have anything to get.  I do not wish, nor do the farmers of this country wish, anything exorbitant.  The farmers in this country last year were asked to make a sacrifice and they made it.  They grew 490,000 acres of wheat at an uneconomic price.</P>

In dealing with that, the Minister made certain statements.  He made a statement as to the quantity of Irish wheat he expected to get; as to the quantity of foreign wheat he intended importing and as to the subsidy he would have to pay on both.  I am suggesting that it is absolutely in order on that to deal with the actual amount of Irish wheat which, in our opinion, the Minister will get, the steps he would require to take to get a sufficient <Col N="724" /> supply and the foolishness, to my mind, of the Minister budgeting on a supposition that he will be able to bring any wheat from abroad.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>When I want Deputy Belton to put me right I will ask him. Up to the present I am confining myself to the two points that came before us, one is, the sending abroad, under the Minister's proposal, of £2,450,000 out of foreign securities to buy wheat and import it, as against the payment of roughly about £1,500,000, as I suggest, at home in order to see that the full quantity of wheat required for this country is grown here, which would mean that we would not be gambling on anything.  I suggest that that should be the policy of the Minister. I am supporting the subsidy because, in my opinion, the burden of getting bread for the poor at the present day should be placed on the shoulders of those most able to bear it; but I am suggesting to the Minister that it would be far better for him, as the Minister responsible for seeing that our people have sufficient food, to see that the money is spent in producing sufficient supplies at home.  If he wants to bring in anything to this country to-day let him bring in artificial manures, which would help us to get a decent result from our wheat crops. Let him devote the 80,000 tons of space that we are giving him&mdash;or a good deal of it&mdash;to artificial manures, and he will find it will pay both of us better.  The difficulty, as I see it, is that the situation is too grave to gamble on bringing wheat from abroad. Deputy Belton asked me the other night if I were prepared to support Deputy Belton's price of 60/- a barrel. I am not prepared to support it.  I do not think it is necessary to offer our farmers an inducement of 60/- a barrel in order to get them to grow sufficient wheat for our people.  I do not think it is necessary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>

      <P>I do not wish to press the matter further.  I just wished to put forward the case, as I saw it, to the Minister who, in my opinion, is responsible.  That Minister, from 1932 onwards, from the moment we started out on a wheat policy, has been the one man who has shown the way and led the way and I ask him at this point, when the whole policy is on trial, not to spoil it.  If he does succeed in bringing in 80,000 tons of wheat and if, at the same time, he has made provision for the growing in this country of all the wheat necessary for the supply of our people, there is not a man in this country who will not clap him on the back for it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not.  I do not believe there is any necessity for importing into this country anything that can be produced or made in it, even if we have to do with substitutes.  I should prefer to see the people living on oatmeal than to import wheat for them, but there is no necessity for them to live on oatmeal, because there is plenty of land to grow sufficient wheat for the country's needs, not only for this year but for the next ten years, if the war should last that long, and I believe it almost will.  I think it is absolute lunacy to depend on the importation of 80,000 tons of wheat and to set that out as a definite policy for the next 12 months, because, with the Yankee coming into the war and the Japs also coming in, I see very little hope of bringing any of that wheat in. Whatever else we say we must do without, <Col N="727" /> let us not say that we will run any risk in relation to the provision of sufficient bread for our people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>When an Estimate of this size, marking a departure in regard to policy and involving so many different sets of figures is introduced here, one would have expected that the Minister would have provided us with a White Paper in connection with it. It is not easy to decide to which of the various figures he gave us the Minister is pinning himself down.  Let us take one example.  He has said that 370,000 tons of wheat are required to supply the country with flour and bread, and then we have the Minister's statement that we must import one-fifth of that amount.  Is the Minister altering his figure of 80,000 tons to be imported to 74,000 tons, or is it that it is merely an approximate 20 per cent.? We are informed that very careful steps are being taken, and that various checks are being provided, to ensure that correct accounts will be kept in this matter, and, almost in the same breath, we are told that when the Minister is in a fix in relation to dealing with the flour problem and the shipping problem, he goes outside and gets in business men to help him.  The experts, I suppose, are within and the specialists are without.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have different figures for the price of flour and for the price of wheat.  In one case, there is what is called the allocation price.  Presumably, that is the price at which this new body which the Minister has set up is going to issue wheat to the millers. This wheat in one case is stated by the Minister to have been purchased at 15/- per barrel, and having supplied the Dáil with an estimated price for the quarter, of 120/-, we find that the price of this wheat which is to be imported this year will be 70/- per barrel.  If the sum of 15/- is paid for it and it is to cost 70/-, it is obvious that the transit charges and other expenses amount to 55/- per barrel, or £22 per ton.  May we ask in all seriousness if that is a correct figure?  If so, I think the experts ought to be changed, or some alteration made in the whole procedure. <Col N="728" /> £22 a ton for transit charges, freight and insurance!</P>

Even when he was in Ottawa, he could have learned from Mr. Bennett, the then Canadian Prime Minister, of the drop there had been in the price of wheat over a few years at that time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Or on dangers, either. The Minister lectured the farmers and told them of the serious steps that were going to be taken in the event of their using wheat for feeding stuffs.  Let us put the farmer's side of the question.  He gets 16/- per cwt. for the wheat he grows himself. What is he asked to pay for feeding stuff of a much lesser value?  At least 6/-, possibly 7/- and maybe 10/- more.  Is the Minister aware of that?  Is he aware of the difficulty the farmer has in buying any feeding stuffs, if he has not grown them himself.  In this year, whether the Minister is aware of it or not, the yield per acre is down, the price of feeding stuffs is up and the costs of threshing and all the other operations <Col N="730" /> are higher than ever they were, and are increasing.  The suggestion made by Deputy Corry, if he understood it, was probably a fairly sound one.  The Minister informed us that we would import 80,000 tons of wheat. He gave us a price of 120/- for 480 lbs. which is 70/- a barrel.  It is made up of 15/- a barrel, the cost of the wheat to the producer, and 55/- freight and other charges.  The wheat would cost, on this calculation, £480,000, and the transit and other charges £1,760,000, making a total of £2,240,000.</P>
      <P>Taking that figure with the figure which the Minister supplied us with, the price which it is expected the Irish wheat will cost, the average all-in price is about 54/- a barrel&mdash;that is on the basis of 46/9, not the 40/-. That would probably admit of an extra 5/- or 6/- a barrel for wheat in this country, if it were all to be grown here, although it is nonsense to be talking about it in the way that Deputy Corry did.  There is no use in growing wheat that will only yield three or four barrels to the acre.  No man will do that unless he is prepared to run a big loss as well as injure his land.  When the Minister talked about stocks of wheat he obviously had in mind the possibility of a war at that time, but what did he do about manures then? What is going to be done about manures now?  The better policy in this case, the one which would be more satisfactory from practically every angle, would be to save that 80,000 tons of shipping space and grow wheat here. I doubt very much if it is an attractive proposition at the price.  It certainly is not a sound proposition in the absence of manures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My final point is that the Dáil is entitled to a White Paper on this whole matter.  I do not think it has been properly presented to the House at all. The House is entitled to something more than lectures from the Minister about the danger of this policy.  We know all about that.  He has been engaged in this matter of subsidies over the last ten years.  That has not tended to improve the country in any respect.  It has been responsible for a smaller number of persons being put into employment than was the case <Col N="731" /> before he became Minister.  His industrial push was all bosh.  Whatever advantage was in it was at the expense of other forms of employment.  In connection with the guaranteed 6 per cent. on the money that is invested, what exactly is meant by the money that has been invested?  I have looked up the particulars of one company, and I find that there are 5/- shares quoted at 15/-.  I am informed that in the prospectus the 5/- shares were sold at 15/- to the public.  This particular company for a number of years paid 20 per cent. on those 15/- shares.</P>

      <P>What did the Minister say?  I do not wish to misquote him at all.  If he wishes to intervene now he can do so.  What did he say? Did the Minister say that he was providing, in connection with this business, that the flour millers would not get more than 6 per cent. on the money that was invested?  The Minister said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;In other words I am allowing nothing for any possible increase in the cost of production or for any change in the remuneration of the milling industry, which is 6 per cent. on the capital employed in the industry as a whole.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="732" /> As I have said, I have not seen the balance sheets of this particular company. I was supplied with a stock exchange card which gave particulars showing that this company paid 20 per cent. from the year 1934, in which it was incorporated, up to 1939.  Last year it paid 16? per cent.  Now 6 per cent., on the basis of 15/- being paid for the 5/- shares, would, I presume, be 6? per cent.  It would be 18 per cent. against 20.</P>

      <P>Obviously, the Deputy does not understand the matter yet. I explained that we fixed the price for flour, and that in doing so we had to have regard for the capital invested in the flour-milling industry as a whole, and on the basis of allowing a remuneration of 6 per cent. on the capital invested the price was fixed.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>The amount we are asked to vote under this sub-head&mdash; £550,000&mdash;is very substantial.  It represents a contemplated annual expenditure of £1,900,000.  That is an extremely large figure for any particular object.  When I saw in the Press some days ago a statement by the Minister that it was intended to subsidise the price of flour to the extent of, approximately, £2,000,000 for the current year, I, in common with, I am sure, a very large part of the population of this country, expected that a full and ample explanation would be given, so as to enable the public to appreciate the necessity for the expenditure of this sum.  I sat here and listened carefully to everything the Minister said in connection with this matter.  I do think that, in the presentation of this Estimate to the House, there was a great lack of clarity because of the different units mentioned.  Reference was made to quarters, sacks, tons and barrels.  It was only by sitting down and very carefully parsing and analysing the Ministerial statement, as it appears in the Official Report, that I was able exactly to discover the case the Minister was making.  It may be that I am not as intelligent as the bulk of the population, but it certainly required not only my presence here, but careful analysis of the printed statement, to discover the case made by the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The people, generally, believe that this sum is being voted for the sole purpose of subsidising the millers.  It was stated by the Minister that the sum is required for the purpose of ensuring that the price to be paid for bread will be fixed.  In other words, the Minister regards it as an insurance against an increase in the price of the loaf.  The public believe&mdash;on a careful analysis of the Minister's statement, I do not think that anything will be found to disabuse their minds in this respect&mdash;that this sum is not so much an insurance aimed at controlling and <Col N="736" /> keeping within certain limits the price of the loaf as an insurance that the pet industry will not suffer a single penny of loss as a result of the emergency through which we are passing.  That is the general opinion in the country. I searched the three daily papers&mdash;including the Government organ, the <i>Irish Press</i>&mdash;and read what they had to say on the subject, and I could discover nothing in those papers which put any other interpretation on the Minister's statement.  In a matter of this kind, where a large sum of money is involved, I think the Minister should have made the position much clearer than he did.  I shall pay the Minister this tribute, if I may, that he is a splendid advocate in a bad case.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

    <Speaker pid="JohnLymbrickEsmonde" hpid="Mr. Esmonde Mr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not departing from that view.  I regard this sum with intense suspicion.  The Minister marshalled his facts in such a way as to put a face on the case for spending this money but he did not disabuse the minds of a number of people of the idea that the money was more intended to benefit the milling industry than to benefit the people of the country in respect of the price of the loaf.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not acquainted with any of the directors, not even with the names, of Grain Importers, Limited, but I agree with the Minister that it is a splendid thing that people should come forward and offer their services voluntarily for the purpose of helping the general good.  I quite agree that they should not be attacked for doing so, but I do not think they deserve any particular credit for the action they have taken in this matter.  After all, they represent a committee of a certain trade or industry, and they are ensuring that they will get adequate supplies of their <Col N="737" /> own raw material at a price which will involve them in no loss.  In any industry, any profession or any occupation a group of people would gladly form an association, and give their services voluntarily in their particular occupations if, in the times we are living in, they were assured of a supply of raw materials.  That is the position of these people.</P>
    <P>My criticism is chiefly directed towards seeing that the Minister approaches this question, not from the point of view of benefiting one section of the community, but for the general good.  The figures which he quoted reveal a very serious state of affairs. The importation of wheat will be reduced from 50 per cent. to 20 per cent. The importation on the Minister's figures will be 30 per cent. less for the year we are now discussing than the previous year.  Yet, in spite of that, the additional cost will be £1,200,000.  I accept the Minister's figures.  They disclose a very serious state of affairs. The bulk of the amount, he pointed out, will represent freight and transport. The whole object, I think, underlying the Minister's activities in this direction was to look after the millers.  I am not saying that in a critical sense, but that appears to be the arrangement.  Speaking in this House last week the Minister, at column 598 of the Official Debates, when referring to the price the millers would have to pay for home-grown wheat said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The average price paid to the farmer will be 40/6.  Allowances in respect of sacks, agents' commission and drying costs will remain unchanged, but the 10 per cent. loss on drying will involve a higher figure because of the higher price.  Consequently, although the guaranteed price to farmers was increased by 5/-, the actual cost of dried wheat to the millers will be increased by 6/-.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There is not a single aspect of the millers' problem, in the purchase of wheat from the grower, that has not been dealt with there, in case it was possible that through a contingency they might suffer a loss.  How different <Col N="738" /> is that from the way the grower, the person who in the first instance is responsible for the production of wheat, is treated.  Accepting the Minister's figures, and assuming that this sum of money is to be spent for this particular purpose in order to stabilise the price of the loaf, I think the Minister and the Government would be very much better advised to divert portion of that sum towards ensuring that bigger and better crops of wheat will be grown, and in that way encourage farmers to produce more wheat at home, with the knowledge that such encouragement is necessary.  I know that it is not within the province of this discussion to deal with the fixed price of wheat, and I do not intend to do so, but it is perfectly obvious that with the Department of Agriculture, and all the resources of the State, some other way should be found to increase the quantity of wheat, and to have it available at a certain price rather than to be paying this large subsidy to the millers.  If the subsidy was directed in a different direction, something on the basis that exists in England and Northern Ireland of £2 to the acre or something like that, the Minister would find that there would be a very much better return, and that it would not be necessary to come to this House to ask for this extraordinarily large sum of money.</P>
    <P>The country believes that the millers are the pets of the Government.  I do not know whether that is so, but having listened to the Minister, and read his speech he had no word of sympathy whatever and no word of encouragement for the growers.  Everything was for those persons who buy the wheat. The whole idea was to put the millers here in a favourable position.  In an agricultural community like this it is up to the Minister to give a better explanation than he has given.  It may be that the view I take is entirely wrong, and that this enormous subsidy is necessary, but I do not think that 99 per cent. of the people realise or approve of the action taken.  I certainly did not realise it, and I did not appreciate it.  I believe there are other ways in which the money could be <Col N="739" /> spent for the purpose of producing a cheap loaf, and for that reason I intend to oppose this proposal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe we all agree that the paramount consideration of every Deputy is to ensure that bread is available for our people, particularly for our poor people, during the present year, at a price that will not exceed the present price.  Whether the method that has been adopted by the Minister to secure that object is the best method is a matter that I very seriously question.  I think the method adopted to subsidise bread and flour as adumbrated by the Minister is a highly complicated method and one that leaves itself open to very grave abuse. It will require very drastic inspection and supervision that will prove very costly to the State.  Notwithstanding drastic supervision, I am satisfied that many people will find loopholes in this scheme, at all events dishonest people, and I am afraid we are not free from that type in this country.  They will be able to net something to which they are not entitled.  It will be very difficult to arrange.  The Minister suggests that he is not prepared to pay a subsidy on fancy bread made on premises where that bread is produced in conjunction with batch bread. I feel that that is a method of handling this situation that undoubtedly leaves itself open to the danger of being abused.  We got numerous figures from the Minister when he was dealing with this question, and the estimated production from native sources this year was 290,000 tons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If you take it that that is the production of 490,000 acres, and that the Minister is banking on that for seed for next year for approximately 600,000 acres of wheat, which would require about 400,000 barrels, and that a considerable quantity must be retained by farmers for their own household purposes, it appears to me that the Minister has calculated on a yield this year of at least about seven barrels to the statute acre.  From my experience as a farmer, I have not the slightest hesitation in saying that the average yield <Col N="740" /> this year will prove to be far less than seven barrels&mdash;I think you could not put it higher than six barrels&mdash;to the acre.  The Minister told us that, so far, that expectation has not borne fruit, that up to the present date not more than 170,000 tons out of the 290,000 tons estimated has reached the millers; so that that figure alone of what has reached the millers at present, will indicate to the Minister that he cannot possibly base his calculation on a return of 290,000 tons from native sources.</P>
    <P>It is a well-known fact that there is a very substantial drop in the yield this year, that we had a bad year and lack of sunshine, and that there was a rather serious shortage in artificial manures.  On that account, many people who grew wheat this year are very disappointed with the result.  In face of that situation, there is an announcement of a price of 41/- for the coming year.  The Minister has been advised by many Deputies already&mdash; and notably by a Deputy from his own benches, Deputy Corry, who is a practical farmer&mdash;that the result of a price offer of 41/- for the coming year will be a serious falling off in the amount of land under wheat cultivation.  I must say that I am in complete agreement with Deputy Corry on that point. Taking the price of foreign imported wheat and all the chances and risks that are involved, the cost of importing it and also paying on that a subsidy &mdash;as the Minister has told us&mdash;of £2, it appears to me that the course he is asking the House to agree to now shows that the producers in this country are being treated in a very shabby way.</P>
    <P>The Minister has based his calculation first on the chance of importing 80,000 tons of foreign wheat in the teeth of a U-boat menace, although he has informed the House that quite recently cargoes of wheat have cost as high as 84/-.  The Minister has not made it clear to the House how he can hope to reduce that figure of 84/- a barrel to 70/-.  Possibly it is by means of direct shipment, and that the 84/- wheat was shipped through Lisbon and that the handling charges there have driven the price up to 84/-.  The fact <Col N="741" /> remains that any imported wheat we can secure at the present time&mdash;after running all the risks of war&mdash;is going to cost us £3 10s.  In face of that figure, the position is that we are now offered a price which amounts to only 1/- increase over last year, notwithstanding the fact that the position with regard to the supply of artificial manure is very serious for the Irish farmer.  Undoubtedly, we had a considerable reduction in the amount of artificial manure available for the production of wheat last year and that reacted very unfavourably on the yield. I ask the Minister, if that was the position last year, what will it be next year, in view of the present supply of artificial manure&mdash;or what we are told it is likely to be for the coming year?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not suggesting that it will affect it.  Undoubtedly, if a better price had been paid for this year's wheat, it would have affected the subsidy this year, as it would reduce the amount required still further. The price offered this year of 40/- was not sufficiently attractive to induce enough people to put land under cultivation, to produce 100 per cent. of our requirements.  Undoubtedly that would affect the subsidy this year.  The Minister was informed on this point when numerous Deputies expressed the view &mdash;on more than one occasion here&mdash;that he should not allow the same position to obtain in the future, as it will be even much worse next year.</P>
      <P>The present position is that the farmer has to sell his wheat at £16 a ton as human food.  If he is feeding many animals and requires animal food, he cannot replace that at the present time at £16 a ton, or at anything like that figure, nor can he get any animal food at all at anything like £16 a ton.  There is the risk that wheat may be used for animal feeding, notwithstanding the fact that the Minister has warned and threatened people that severe penalties will be inflicted on anyone making use of wheat for animal feeding.  As an alternative to that, I believe it is a very good suggestion that some of whatever shipping is available should be used for the importation of artificial manures, if agriculture is to be kept going.</P>

Every English farmer is stocked up; he has all his requirements of sulphate of ammonia. <Col N="743" /> He was appealed to to take early deliveries.  Imperial Chemicals had large stocks of sulphate of ammonia and they were anxious to unload these stocks, because the place might get bombed at any time, and the English farmers were asked to take early deliveries. There was an inducement offered to them of a rebate of £1 per ton.  The price in June and July was £9 10s. a ton.  There was plenty of sulphate of ammonia available.  There is any amount of it coming over the Border at £25 a ton.  It is available to Northern Ireland farmers at ten guineas a ton, less a rebate of £1.

That is the type of artificial manure he ought to try to secure, in view of the fact that shipping charges are so high.  If it is possible to get a highly-concentrated manure of that sort, the freight charge of £22 per ton on it would be relatively less than on a low-grade manure.</P>

Out of the amount that is being made available now by the House, you certainly could pay much more on the wheat that was produced this year. The home production has been very disappointing.  The financial return to the producer is uneconomic and it is bound to have a very bad effect on future production, unless there is a very substantial increase in the price the Government are prepared to fix.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>This Estimate is one of great importance to the country, inasmuch as it is intended to enable flour and bread to be provided for our people at a price which they can pay. One great worry in the minds of Deputies is that a very large percentage of the money which is being provided will give a very inadequate return.  Much of this money will be spent subsidising the importation of wheat.  In that way, it will be spent on freight charges that are excessive. It will be spent in connection with <Col N="745" /> ships which are not value for the money paid for them, and much of the money will find its way into the pockets of speculators and profiteers who are out to take advantage of the abnormal situation that exists.</P>
      <P>Every Deputy will agree that it is a shame and a pity that all this money could not be held in the country and eventually be put into circulation amongst our farmers and other agricultural workers in the production of wheat.  Everyone admits that there was slackness in the effort to secure the 100 per cent. wheat requirements of this country last year.  In the first place, there was failure to stress at the proper time the need for an increased supply of wheat.  Secondly, there was failure to provide an adequate price, a price which would induce farmers to cultivate the necessary acreage of wheat.  It is our duty to ask if any real effort is being made to secure our requirements for the coming year. Two of the most important months of the year, from the point of view of wheat production, have passed.  The cultivation of land for wheat growing should begin in September.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Having failed to offer the inducement which is absolutely necessary if we are to secure a supply of wheat adequate for our needs, the Minister is now forced to provide a subsidy to pay for imported wheat at the rate of 84/- per barrel.  Now, surely it is not good business, it is not sound business to offer to pay such a price for imported wheat when it is possible, when it is within our means, to provide the home supply.  There is in this country, first of all, sufficient land to grow all the wheat we require for our needs.  There is, in addition, I think, sufficient seed within the country to seed that land for the coming year. Those two things are available, and even though, having regard to the shortage of artificial manures, it is necessary to plant a greatly increased acreage in order to provide our needs for the coming year, there is still sufficient land and sufficient seed available to ensure that we will in the future, or should in the future, be independent of imported wheat.  Yet we find that time is passing and no reasonable effort is being made to offer the necessary inducement to farmers and to take the necessary steps to ensure that wheat will be cultivated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An offer of an increase of 1/- a barrel for wheat is simply insulting the potential grower, putting him off wheat altogether, and making him feel that those in charge, and having on their shoulders the responsibility for providing this country with a food supply, have absolutely no sense of responsibility and do not seem to care whether the necessary food is provided in this country or not.  It makes it appear to the plain people that the Government prefer to sink the taxpayers' money in the Atlantic Ocean rather than pay the farmer and the agricultural worker for the production of wheat.  Deputy Esmonde suggested that it would be a <Col N="747" /> good policy for the Government to provide a subsidy per acre for wheat grown in this country.  I do not think that that is sound.  I think the Government should pay for the article or the commodity produced, but I think it would have been a good policy&mdash;it certainly would have been a good policy, and I think the Government will realise it&mdash;to have offered some special inducement to growers to plant autumn wheat, even by giving a small bounty on wheat sown during the autumn months.  By so doing we would have ensured that a greatly increased acreage would have been put under wheat instead of having to rely on a shorter period for growing wheat in the Spring.</P>
    <P>These considerations are of vital importance to the people of Ireland and they should be of vital importance to the Government and to the Government Party.  The importance of this question does not seem to be indicated by the attendance of the Government Party in the House at the moment, but I am sure that within the private meetings of the Party the question is getting consideration and anxious thought, and I hope the Government even now, though it is somewhat late, in order to secure the maximum production of wheat that could be secured, will mend their hand in regard to the price of wheat and offer a substantial increase which will make it unnecessary in the future to provide a subsidy on imported wheat.</P>
    <P>The most startling fact which was brought to light by the Minister in his opening statement was the fact that only 170,000 tons of wheat have been delivered so far to the millers.  That seems to indicate that the yield for the present year has been abnormally low, lower perhaps than most people are aware of, because it must be certain that the bulk of the season's wheat crop has been already delivered to the millers, and if the yield is so low it is certain that a tremendous effort will have to be made to secure the production in the coming year of even the inadequate quantity which was produced during the present year, and so far as we can see no effort has yet been made <Col N="748" /> to face up to this problem.  Some time ago, the Minister for Agriculture informed me, in reply to a question which I asked, that he did not know what the acreage of arable land in this country is.  Yet we have the Government making estimates of the necessary amount of compulsory tillage required, and so on, without any facts upon which to base these estimates.  We have the position also that the Minister&mdash;and he made it clear to me, in reply to a question&mdash;does not know what is the cost of producing wheat in this country.  These are two essential facts upon which the Government of an agricultural country, apparently, have no reliable information.  They are in much the same position as a blind man in a black-out: they are groping about trying to find some means of solving problems as they arise but have no knowledge on which to base calculations for the future.  Now, I think that the Government of an agricultural country should know exactly what it costs to produce cereal crops, that the Government of this country should base the price of such cereals upon the cost of production, leaving a decent margin of profit, and that in addition to that they should know exactly how much arable land is available in this country. If they did that, we would not be called upon now, as we are to-day, to provide this enormous subsidy upon imported wheat.  I hope that even now the Minister for Supplies, who is believed to be a man of energy, will take the Minister for Agriculture to task and insist upon his providing the necessary wheat for the coming year and providing it by the simple means of offering the producer an economic price.</P>

      <P>I am afraid, Sir, that all these matters have been extensively debated up to the present, but I do not intend to dwell further upon them. There is also in the Estimate provision for a subsidy on bread, and I should like to ask the Minister for Supplies <Col N="749" /> whether he is satisfied that the people, and particularly the people who are dependent solely upon plain or batch bread, are getting a product which is as good as could be produced out of the materials available?  I am satisfied that over a very large part of the country the bread provided is not as good as that which could be provided. This may be due to the fact that the bakers have not adjusted their equipment to the production of bread from the present type of flour.  At any rate, there is certainly a very great difference between the bread produced in some parts of the country and that produced in other parts, and I think it is a question to which the Minister should direct some attention.  I was told of a workman's wife who, having purchased some loaves of bread and some sods of turf, both of emergency quality, unfortunately made the mistake of putting the turf on the table and putting the bread into the fire, but she hardly noticed the difference. There is certainly considerable waste of this very essential commodity, flour, due, I believe, to the fact that in many cases the bakers have not the necessary equipment or for some other reason are not producing bread which can be used economically.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would not mention this matter except for the fact that there are other bakers who are producing quite good bread, and it is obvious that there must be something wrong somewhere. I am not putting the entire blame on the fact that the present extraction is too high.  I think if the Minister were to inquire into this matter he might have it adjusted.  I would appeal to the Minister for Supplies, who has this important duty of keeping the country going, to ensure that in the future the very limited shipping space which we have available will be used for the importation to this country of really essential commodities.  It may be possible to secure artificial manures, and, if it is, all available shipping space should be devoted to that purpose. There is an abundance of other materials used in the manufacture of home-produced commodities for which shipping space is urgently needed, and to which it could be devoted if the <Col N="750" /> Government were to adopt even now a vigorous and progressive policy in securing our 100 per cent. of home-produced wheat.</P>

      <P>The last speaker described this as an enormous Estimate. Undoubtedly, it is for a very large sum, £1,900,000, but the trouble is that we are not quite sure that it is sufficient.  It seems to me that the House will be faced with a further Supplementary Estimate for this very purpose.  So far as I can understand, this sum is based upon 290,000 tons of Irish wheat finding its way into the mills of this country.  The Minister told us last week that, so far, 170,000 tons are in the stores, and he expressed the hope that the other 120,000 tons would come in to be ground by the millers.  I think that was a very optimistic hope.  I think that, at the very end of the grain season, it is too much to expect that there are 120,000 tons of wheat in this country still to be purchased.  I think anybody who knows anything at all about the wheat situation here will agree that that is, to say the least of it, very unlikely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as I am concerned, my main interest in this matter, my primary interest, if you like, is to see the price of flour and the price of bread stabilised. If this £1,900,000 is essential for that purpose, and if it is to be used exclusively for that purpose.  I do not believe anybody in this House will object to it.  There are really two aspects to this question; one, the stabilisation of the price of flour and bread, and secondly, an economic price for home-grown wheat to the farmer. Deputies, I think, with reason, have said that the Government should have offered greater financial inducement to the farming community to grow more wheat.  I should like to say, with all respect to the Deputies who have spoken, and most of whom have greater knowledge of this matter than I have that it is not altogether a question of financial inducement.  So far as certain farms in this country are concerned, no financial inducement that could be offered would get economic wheat growing.  Deputy Cogan, I think, was right when he said that one of the Minister's biggest problems in equalising <Col N="751" /> the price of home-grown and imported wheat, and in arriving at an estimate, whether it is £1,900,000 or £2,500,000, is the fact that home-grown flour is not available to the millers to the extent that we expected.  One of the reasons for that is unquestionably the fact that the yield of wheat this year is down anything from 20 per cent. to 25 per cent.; certain authorities in this country have put it as high as 33 per cent.  Coupled with that, you have the fact that this year more farmers than ever have kept wheat for themselves, and even those who always kept a certain amount of wheat for their own use have kept a far greater amount this year.</P>
    <P>I should like to take the opportunity of saying here and now, reinforcing, if I may, the statement made by the last speaker, that the great danger is that we are facing a cereal year when the shortage is going to be even far greater than it is this year.  I have heard with regret dozens of farmers&mdash;I think I might say, without being accused of exaggeration, hundreds of farmers&mdash; saying at the end of this harvest, when their crops were gathered and threshed and ready for sale, that they would not grow wheat again next year, or that if they did, they certainly would not grow it to the same extent as they have grown it this year.  I think that is to be deplored.  There are two reasons for it.  One is the low yield this year, and the other is that they realise that they are facing a new cereal year with probably only one-third or perhaps only one-fourth of last year's artificial manures available. Of course, every practical man in the country realises that it is almost impossible to grow wheat, or certainly to get any sort of decent return on wheat, without artificial manure, although the leader writer of the <i>Irish Press</i> pushed it aside a few days ago and said that artificial manures were unnecessary.</P>
    <P>If you go and ask any farmer in any part of the country&mdash;I do not care what his political views are, or which newspaper he reads, or whether he reads any newspaper at all&mdash;whether he thinks artificial manures are unnecessary for the growing of crops <Col N="752" /> here, particularly beet and wheat, he will very soon give you an answer. There are certain lands in this country that will grow wheat&mdash;perhaps a fairly decent crop of wheat, and perhaps even two crops of wheat&mdash;without the aid of artificial manures.  I am talking at the moment about some of the most intensely cultivated parts of this country where they have always tilled and grown wheat, but it is impossible in places where the soil is light to grow crops of wheat without artificial manures.</P>
    <P>Without desiring to widen the discussion in any way I say that three main points present themselves to me. Firstly, there is the question whether we have any chance of getting in the 290,000 tons of wheat we should get, according to the Minister, this year. That will depend on whether this estimate is sufficient, and I doubt it very much.  Secondly, the question arises&mdash; and in passing may I say that it is a matter of tremendous importance and urgency?&mdash;whether adequate steps are now being taken to see that we shall not be called upon for a far greater subsidy in respect of the next cereal year.  Thirdly, if the Minister can convince the House that this sum of money or even a larger sum is essential for the stabilisation of the price of flour or wheat, I think he will get the House behind him provided he assures us that it is used exclusively for that purpose.  Fourthly, I should like to know whether the Government have satisfied themselves that 41/- is a fair price for the farmer, and is it the highest price they can afford to give. These are very important matters and now is the time, this very month, to settle them definitely as the best part of the year for the preparation of the ground for growing wheat is practically over.  Every day we lose now is storing up for our people very hard times in regard to flour and bread for the next 12 months.  These are the points that present themselves to my mind, and I do not want at this stage to deal with any other aspect of this Estimate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>The country seems to be getting by easy stages to a system <Col N="753" /> of rationing for the entire population, and I just want to make a few remarks as to why rationing is necessary.  I feel that one of the reasons is to be found in the policy of the Government in the past.  In many cases only one manufacturer was allowed to accumulate raw materials, as against a stocking-up by the entire distributing trade. In other cases regulations were made by the Prices Commission that rendered the holding of supplies unremunerative for the distributor.  I know the Minister does not agree with me in that.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am dealing with the subsidisation of flour and rationing.  I merely refer to it in passing as one of the problems that has aggravated the position.  Nobody suggests that we could, by any process of stocking-up, have got the country over the war period, but we are now coming to the most important stage of this country's supplies.  Supplies are getting scarcer in the one market where we can get any goods.  I was rather disappointed that the Minister did not seize this opportunity to give us some idea of what the policy of the Government is going to be.  I should like to suggest to him that the alternative facing the Government is: are they going to take the duty off some supplies which can now be got or will they wait to remove the duties until these supplies have disappeared? Again, I should like to ask the Minister if when removing these duties he can see his way to give any forecast as to the period for which the duties will be removed, whether it will be for the duration of the war, or the duration of the war plus a certain postwar period.  The Minister has spoken about this subsidy that is to be given to flour.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>Another question that arises is, what is the population that <Col N="754" /> will consume that flour during the coming year?  Naturally, the first thing that the people require is something to eat and I think bread is a primary commodity.  I do not see how the Government, therefore, could avoid some system of subsidising bread, but at the present time it appears as if this country were faced with a total stoppage of almost all essential supplies in the very near future.  I should like the Minister to give us his views on that question.  Surely the Minister should be able to give some indication to the country as to the materials that are running short?  As an instance of what I am referring to, petrol became very short.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I quite agree, but the question of rationing is involved and I am merely using the case of petrol to illustrate my argument.  Petrol became very short and people turned to gas. Of course, there is no gas in this Estimate either, but I might point out that a lot of people installed gas-bags on their cars when the petrol shortage arose.  Soon afterwards it transpired that they would not be given any gas for the bags.  That is a procedure I should like to see reversed.  I should like the Minister to have told these people that there was no use in installing gas-bags on their cars because they would not be given any gas.  I think that if the Minister could give a lead to the country by way of telling the people in future what they should or should not install, his time would be well spent.  I should have liked the Minister to have availed of the opportunity to give us a forecast over a wider field than the flour position because there are other people who have their problems as well as the Government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>One serious fact which this Estimate has elicited is that there is a very alarming wheat position in the country to-day, because, although we are now in the middle of November, the Minister has told us that there are approximately only 170,000 tons of wheat in and that we still require to <Col N="755" /> get in 120,000 tons, which, with the 80,000 tons which it is intended to import, will probably carry us up to the next harvest.  But I, with other Deputies, have grave fears that, in the middle of November, you are not likely to get in another 120,000 tons of wheat and I think the sooner the Minister realises that the better, rather than that the country should be treated again to the shock tactics&mdash;&mdash;</P>

He was told then that small nations in Europe had extensive mercantile marines and ships that could be bought.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>We were told that there was not merely a shadow Department <Col N="756" /> of Supplies but an actual Department of Supplies in operation before the war commenced, and the Minister was supposed to be a kind of one-man brains trust who was thinking and planning for the dark days of shortage which the war would probably herald.  Then the war broke out and there was considerable commercial activity between nations for a considerable period, although the war was on. Then the commercial activity was interrupted suddenly by events on the Continent.  We found it difficult to import commodities and discovered that the Department of Supplies, which was to do all the planning and all the storing had, at most, a few weeks' supply stored away and no more.  The moment the relations between nations broke down, owing to the events of the war, then we were pretty well in the position of a beleaguered nation.  We ought to have thought in 1939 of the necessity for growing a full wheat harvest, sufficient to provide our people with an all-Irish loaf and an all-white loaf.  Of course, nothing was done in that matter until last November when the flour importers discovered that they could not charter ships to take grain here.  Then the Minister for Agriculture was released on the country to urge farmers to grow wheat at all costs and, of course, we go the inadequate results that are visible to everybody this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are told that the acreage under wheat was 490,000.  Apparently, all we hope to get out of the 490,000 acres is 290,000 tons of wheat, showing, at all events, a very small yield.  Of course, if the Minister went through the country he would realise from what he would hear from farmers that the yield all over the country has been uniformly low; so low, in fact, that, as Deputy Morrissey rightly pointed out, many farmers will abandon wheat growing this year and go in for growing oats and barley in preference to the growing of wheat.  Before the Minister is many months older, he will be able to get returns of the acreage under wheat which will indicate a veering away from the production of wheat to the production of other cereals which are calculated to give a better yield on the <Col N="757" /> soil available for growing them and less risk from the standpoint of the farmer growing the cereals.  I suggest to the Minister that that position has got to be faced and that he ought not, in the middle of next year, come to the House, as he had to come so often before, to tell us of another difficulty that has arisen, because this difficulty can be overcome now if the Government will only think and plan.  It can be overcome if the Government will insist, in respect of each suitable holding, on a minimum acerage of wheat, and at the same time give the farmer a price for the wheat which will ensure that he is encouraged to sow wheat and that he is kept in the production of wheat for the use and benefit of our people.</P>
    <P>Apart from the question of the now inevitable shortage of wheat supplies for the current cereal year, I have grave doubts about the wisdom of this Estimate, and I have more doubts as to the generoús way in which this House, in present circumstances, is treating the millers of the country. According to the Minister's statement a sum of £1,900,000 is to be shovelled out to the millers, and the bakers in order that they will not get too envious, are to get £80,000 as well. When you think, in these circumstances, of millers getting a subsidy to that substantial extent and of bakers getting a subsidy of £80,000 and contrast that treatment, on the one hand, with the provisions of Emergency Powers (No. 83) Order on the other hand, one thing that strikes you immediately is that, apparently, the miller or baker is to get what he likes from the Government, but, as regards the worker, the best treatment the Government can give him is to peg down his wages to a low level while doing absolutely nothing to control prices.  We were told by the Minister for Finance and by various members of the Government that the Government had decided to set its face against any class in the community getting compensation for the increased cost of living.  The millers apparently walk in and present a demand to the Minister and are now being offered a cheque in the name of the House for £1,900,000.</P>

      <P>A small number of people are able to come in and get a subsidy of approximately £2,000,000 while the Minister, on the other hand, refuses to allow workers to get any compensation whatever for the increase in the cost of living so far as it affects them.  The Minister tried to explain to the House why these gentlemen are treated in this lavish fashion whilst he reserves for the workers, apparently, the bitterest hostility in respect of wages that he could manifest.  The workers' wages are to be pegged down to a low level.  They dare not get an increase.  The greatest sweating employer in the country, if he wanted to wipe out sins of low wages committed in the past, would not be permitted to do it under Emergency Order No. 83.  That is the treatment reserved for the workers.  He virtually throws £2,000,000 at the millers in this country and the Minister imagines he is conferring a public benefit on the nation by treating that monopoly in this generous fashion.</P>
      <P>The most striking part of the Minister's statement was his admission that he asked 1,000 provincial bakers to send him copies of their certified accounts and that out of the 1,000 people communicated with only one provincial baker sent him a certified copy of his accounts.  Notwithstanding the fact that he had not got a certified copy of the accounts of these 1,000 bakers, the Minister intimates that he is nevertheless going to give them a subsidy of £80,000.  What information was the Minister looking for when he asked for the certified accounts?  Information, presumably, as to the financial position of the firms in question and their rate of profit or loss.  What information has the Minister now about that position if he did not get a certified copy of the accounts from the firms?</P>

      <P>I read it all.  The Minister said he got one reply from a provincial <Col N="760" /> baker.  The 999 simply put out their tongue at him and would not furnish him with any certified accounts. The Minister says: &ldquo;Nevertheless, let me give this fraternity £80,000 as a subsidy towards their increased costs,&rdquo; although the Minister has not got from the firms in question the information which he felt was necessary when he asked them for these certified returns. I would like to know on what grounds the Minister attempts to justify the payment of a subsidy to bakers.  There may be a case.  We have not heard the case.  The Minister talked about costs increasing.  I have seen reports of firms in the Press and they do not appear to be doing too badly in these difficult times.  But, of course, the gentleman marauder in the whole milling industry is the miller because that gentleman has plucked and salted the community with impunity for many years past and, by reason of the fact that he possesses a State milling licence, he is apparently put now in such a privileged position that not only can he legally continue to salt the public but he is now advanced even further; he is now entitled to come to the House and say: &ldquo;Notwithstanding the fact that you gave me a milling licence, please also write a cheque for £1,900,000.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I heard the other day of a gentleman in the flour-milling industry who was appointed at a salary of £7,000 and he subsequently had the salary increased to £10,000.  Fancy £10,000 being paid to a gentleman in the flour-milling industry out of bread and flour sold in the main to poor people in this country.  That is the type of firm for which we are writing this cheque for £1,900,000.</P>

I hope I will not annoy the Minister by reference to Mr. Rank and I do not want to conjure up any ghosts of the Minister's past speeches about the gentleman but everybody knows that Rank came into the country and bought up the interests of any mill he could get, and bought them for the purpose of closing them.  He originally did that in order that he could flood this country with flour.  Then the Government changed and Rank changed. Then the Government changed again to conform with Rank but Rank floated a company consisting, I think, of a group of other companies that he bought up. He released, I think, in 6 per cent. preference shares, £700,000.</P>

All that was done by a firm that is now getting a very substantial slice of this £1,900,000.  I regard that as racketeering. I regard that as simply swindling the public and making exorbitant profits out of the vital needs of the people.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Rank is able to float these shares at 15/- because our people eat bread and because our people want flour.  He is, apparently, allowed to do that, which is a most dishonest form of gambling because there is no element of loss or probability of loss in it so far as Rank is concerned.  It is downright racketeering, downright plundering of the people, to permit a firm to get away with that type of financial welshing on the needs of our community in respect of bread and flour. These millers have been given a monopoly by the State&mdash;a milling licence. That is their goodwill.  We created their goodwill by giving them a milling licence.  That is the only goodwill they have and that is the thing that entrenches them to-day.  We gave them a licence to deal in the most vital need of our people, namely, flour, a commodity which has become still more vital because of the circumstances under which we live.  I have very <Col N="763" /> grave doubts if it is good national policy to give a subsidy of £1,900,000 to a monopoly which is in private hands.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>And I think on an invested capital of about £7,000,000&mdash; which is not bad either.  Flour in present circumstances is a vital necessity for our people and having regard to all we know about flour milling and having regard to what we know has gone on in respect of flour milling and having regard to the exorbitant profits which were made out of the milling of flour, I do not think that we should continue to allow this monopoly, in present circumstances, to rest in private hands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems to me that what the State ought to do, having regard to the conditions with which we are now faced, is to take over the mills and operate them as nationally-owned institutions, administer them not for the purpose of issuing shares, or for the purpose of paying salaries of £10,000 a year, but for the purpose of producing flour at the cheapest possible price and making the provision of flour for the people the overwhelming consideration of their milling policy.  At present the millers think of one thing, that is, the making of the highest possible profit, and they are sufficiently well organised and have sufficient financial resources to be able, according to this Estimate, to shake the Government any time <Col N="764" /> they choose to do so; but, in present circumstances, it seems to me to be very undesirable that a private monopoly of this kind should be given this gigantic sum of money.  I should very much prefer that the State itself would take over the flour mills and operate them under national ownership, basing their policy on the production of flour at the cheapest possible price.  So far as we here are concerned, we are in favour of any practical policy which will keep bread prices low and which will keep flour prices low.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>But the Deputy will vote against it all the same.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The way in which that can best be done is by the State taking over and operating the flour mills on a non-profit&mdash;making basis.  Does it not seem absurd that we should pass through this House the Shannon Electricity Act, which prevents any profit being made out of the generation and sale of electric light, while we give a free field to the flour millers to make any profit they can get away with in respect of flour, a still more vital commodity?</P>

      <P>I did not say any price, but any price which will pay the flour miller generously.  Is that not the position to-day?  The people who are getting rich are the flour millers.  The mass of the people may have their standard of living depressed, but if you want to get rich you have to be a flour miller or a bacon curer, and then you have a passport to a kind of Eldorado under this Government.  My quarrel with this Estimate is not in respect of the amount of it, but in respect of the purpose for which the money is being used.  It is being used for the purpose of subsidising the millers, and I should prefer to see that money kept in the pockets of the State and to see the State breaking from the policy of the past, taking over these flour mills, especially in existing circumstances, and operating them for the purpose of providing cheap flour for the people, instead of huge profits for the millers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnJamesCole" hpid="Mr. Cole Mr. Cole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cole</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as the debate has gone, it certainly will not ease the minds of the traders or the people who have to procure bread in the counties along the Border.  I had two telephone messages this morning before I left home saying that they still had not got an adequate amount of flour.  They have got most of their quota for the month, but, owing to the amount of flour which has come in illegally during the past three months, the people have not got sufficient for their requirements. There has been a good deal of discussion about this sum of almost £2,000,000 and about where it is going. Deputies say that it is going in one direction, and the Minister says that it is going in another direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wonder did the Minister consider whether it would be better to give a subsidy to the millers or to give it, as Deputy Esmonde has suggested, to the farmers?  If the Minister would take the trouble of finding out what it would cost to pay for these 370,000 tons of wheat required and dividing that sum into the £2,000,000 which he proposes to give to the millers, he would find that it would represent about £5 a ton.  To approach it from <Col N="766" /> the other angle, it is estimated that we have about 490,000 acres of land which might be developed for this purpose, and dividing that into the £2,000,000 which he proposes to give to the millers, we find that it works out about £4 an acre.  If some of this money were given to the farmers, it would be an inducement to them to grow wheat because they will not grow wheat at the present prices.  Even people who are not engaged in the agricultural industry realise that wheat cannot be grown year after year, or even in the space of two or three years, without a great quantity of artificial manures.  This year, unfortunately, we cannot get artificial manures.  We were able to get a certain amount last year by ways and means which will not be available this year, and something should be done, and done immediately, to give the farmer a subsidy or some increase in price&mdash;let it be paid by the acre or by the ton, and I think the weight system would probably be the better&mdash; because winter wheat sown later than October is not nearly as good as winter wheat sown in that month.</P>
    <P>A terrific amount of money was spent last year on advertisements encouraging farmers to grow wheat up to January and into February.  Some of the Ministers went through the country in February and said: &ldquo;There is still time to grow wheat.&rdquo;  That is not so.  It is impossible to grow winter wheat at that time of the year.  Some Deputy asked a question as to the cost of these advertisements and we were told the figure.  It was a huge amount, but anyone in the habit of growing wheat realises that there is a difference of tons between wheat sown in October and wheat sown in January.  The longer it is left unsown, the worse it is, and unless a move is made immediately, there is no hope of getting the wheat required.  There is another item which you, Sir, will probably permit me to refer to, although it is not exactly relevant to the Estimate, that is, the matter of tea.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickGiles" hpid="Captain Giles Captain Giles">
      <NameTxt>Captain Giles</NameTxt>
      <P>We always seem to be wrangling over sops of one kind or another here, and it is unfortunate that we can never get the Minister to view things correctly.  He always seems to stick his heels in the ground and to do practically as he likes.  We have now a glorious opportunity of showing the world that we can produce our own food and live by the hands of our agriculturists, but have we the manliness to do it?  We find ourselves in a position in which practically £2,000,000 are to given away.  And who are the people who are to get this money?  The millers and some importers, while the very people who can and will produce the food, the farmers, are to get nothing.  If the producer is not given a better price for the wheat that he grows than he got last year, then everyone knows we are not going to get half of last year's acreage grown for the reason that his costs of production are so heavy.  The Government and all concerned should realise that.  Now is the time for sowing winter wheat, but the fact is that very little of it has been sown except in a few areas of the country.  I come from what might be described as a ranch county, in which there is a great deal of virgin soil.  There very little winter wheat is being sown.  The farmers will not be encouraged to sow it until the Government offer them a decent price for it.  If that situation is allowed to go on, it may very well land this country in a desperate position.  We may be faced with famine, so, therefore, I would urge on the Government to offer a decent price to the farmers and encourage them to grow all the wheat that will be needed to feed the people. What is wrong that we cannot afford to pay a decent price to the man who is ready to produce food for the people?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickGiles" hpid="Captain Giles Captain Giles">
      <NameTxt>Captain Giles</NameTxt>
      <P>The point that I am <Col N="768" /> trying to make is that, in my opinion, this subsidy is being wasted.  A subsidy is going to be paid to the millers, but I think it is the producers who should get it, the men who kept this country in safety last year.  They can be relied on to do the same next year if they get a fair deal.  I agree that we can produce all the wheat we need. Of course, it is only in a time of emergency that such a thing will be done, because when the war is over you will have wheat being landed here from many far away parts of the world.  In that case our farmers will go out of wheat production, but we do not want that to happen this year.  We want them to stick their heels in the ground and to produce all the wheat possible. Growing wheat year after year on the same land means that you get a diminished return per acre.  To produce wheat properly you must have adequate supplies of manures and fertilisers. We are not likely to have either this year.  Therefore, the only incentive to the farmer to grow more wheat this year is to offer him a decent price.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Belton, Deputy Corry and other Deputies who have said that to offer anything less than £3 a barrel for wheat will not get the farmer to produce it.  I know, of course, that in a time of emergency our farmers will do the right thing, but the Government should not be tinkering with this thing.  They should go out boldly and offer a price that will encourage farmers to produce.  Otherwise the country may be faced with starvation and we may have to appeal to outside powers to help us out of our difficulty.  We should not be put in that position.  It is now in the power of the Government to do the right thing, to take the necessary steps to stave off any fear of starvation in the coming year.  If immediate steps are not taken by the Government the winter wheat, which gives a good return, will not be sown.  Farmers will put off sowing it and will wait until the spring.  We all know that winter wheat is desperately hard on land: that it takes years to bring back that land to a good condition.  The farmers are the people who can deliver the goods and it is they who should get <Col N="769" /> the subsidy.  If the tillage undertaken last year had been carried out in a proper way a subsidy of perhaps £1,000,000 would be sufficient.  In the county that I come from I saw tens and tens of thousands of barrels of wheat lying rotting on the land.  It was not that the people could not overtake the work but rather that proper care was not exercised in the saving of the crop.  In some places we had very big landholders who tilled hundreds of acres of land, not because they loved to do it&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Giles</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to show that £1,000,000 of this subsidy could be saved if the crop last year had been properly harvested, and if there had been more supervision of some of the people who tilled large areas of their land.  A lot of them put in the crop and then let it take pot luck.  In a number of cases I saw cattle and birds eating the crop, and there was no attempt made to save it at all, although Providence had blessed us with a bountiful crop which should have been saved to meet the needs of the people. I do not know where all the inspectors were.  They seemed to be very anxious to get the land tilled, but when it came to saving the crop the inspectors were not to be seen at all.</P>

What they have been really doing is this: making a case for a reduction in the price that the farmer should get at the present time.  Everyone of them knows quite well that it is a good &ldquo;cant&rdquo; to get going in the country&mdash;probably good ammunition for propaganda purposes&mdash;to say that the Government are paying the millers £2,000,000 of a subsidy. If they go out on public platforms and say that it will go all right. It is quite a good &ldquo;cant&rdquo;.  Deputy Dillon should go down the country with it immediately.  If he thinks he can get away with it, I am sure he will.

He knows quite well, and other Deputies know, too, that the price of the loaf of bread and of flour would have to be increased substantially as a result of paying farmers 40/- for their wheat and also because a certain amount of hard wheat had to be imported at an exorbitant price from abroad.  Those are the two reasons why this £2,000,000 has to be paid this year to keep the price of bread to the poor at the level at which it has been since the war started.</P>

      <P>Regarding the distribution of flour, I do not agree that one point made by the Minister is correct &mdash;that 90 per cent. of complaints regarding shortages in the rural areas were attributable to the traders concerned &ldquo;trying to get something out of it&rdquo;.  The suggestion is that, in rural areas, traders were getting a reasonably level supply of flour from the millers and that they were holding this up and not giving it to the consumers. That is not so and I defy the Minister or anybody else to prove it.  It is not correct that millers were delivering to traders&mdash;particularly, small traders&mdash;in the rural districts a reasonably level supply of flour.  Some traders always got flour but others could not get it. In the case of one large milling industry&mdash;the Minister referred to this &mdash;one half of a county got very little flour for a period and the other half of the county got a good supply.  That was simply because the commercial traveller for one half of the county was able to secure supplies for his customers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TimothyLinehan" hpid="Mr. Linehan Mr. Linehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Linehan</NameTxt>
      <P>My information from a baker is that it happened in County Cork.  When the Minister asks parish <Col N="774" /> councils and similar bodies to investigate complaints about flour shortages before sending them up to him, how does he expect them to do it?  The ordinary consumer goes into a shop in a village where he has been buying his flour all his life and he is told he cannot get flour.  According to the Minister, that is the fault of the trader.  I say that is not so.  If the Minister was satisfied that the shortage was being created artificially by the trader, is it not strange that we did not hear anything about it until he introduced this Estimate?  If the Minister is allowing traders to get away with the creation of artificial shortages in flour, it is a scandalous situation.  I say that the shortage is not the fault of the smaller traders.  They are absolutely at the mercy of the millers and the Minister knows that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The most serious feature of the whole situation&mdash;one which was referred to by a number of Deputies&mdash;is that regarding the 120,000 tons of wheat which have not got into the mills to be turned into flour.  The subsidy in this Estimate is not going to bring in those 120,000 tons of wheat.  I should like to hear from the Minister how he proposes to get in those 120,000 tons because it is obvious that, if they are not got in, there will be a 50 per cent. shortage of the wheat necessary to provide flour up to the next harvest. That is more serious than most people realise.  If that be the position, drastic measures will have to be taken to deal with it.  There is a suggestion in the country that certain people are using wheat for animal consumption.  In present circumstances, that is a shocking crime.  I doubt if that practice is widespread but, if it is happening at all, it is a shocking crime against the people.  If 120,000 tons of wheat are unlikely to be turned into flour, it is the most serious revelation made since the present emergency.  I find it hard to visualise what will happen if that wheat is not got in.  The subsidy under this Estimate will not have the slightest effect in bringing it in.  It will not offer the slightest inducement to bring it in.  A number of Deputies in talking about an increased price for wheat&mdash;whether it be justified or not&mdash;<Col N="775" /> may be doing a lot of damage.  If the Government feel that they should offer an increased price to get that wheat in, let them offer it now, but let not an atmosphere be created in which certain people will think that they will get an increased price, and accordingly, hold up the wheat with a view to getting it.</P>
    <P>I am afraid that is what is happening. When you have a number of Deputies on all sides expressing their views, rightly or wrongly, as to the right price, there are people with the necessary accommodation who can hold up their wheat, and if the Government do not choose to give an increased price, what will happen?  Suppose these people hold up the wheat until March, and the Government do not give a better price, what possibility is there of getting it?  None at all.  The people who will not sell it now will not sell it in March or April.</P>

      <P>While the Minister denies that the flour millers are going to get anything out of this £1,900,000, he does not suggest what is going to happen it.  So far as I can judge, it will not go anywhere.  It will not go to the farmer, because he will get the same price as before.  It will not go to the consumer because he will pay the price for his bread as before, and the Minister says it will not go to the millers.  It is beyond me to guess what will happen it.  According to the Minister, we are voting this sum for some purpose, but he does not tell us what will happen it.  If it will not go anywhere, then he does not want it at all. But it is utter nonsense to suggest that it will not go to the miller and the baker.  In fact, the Minister gave the figure on which he based the amount to go to the baker.  The Minister is very foolish to be defending his attitude, as he did to-day, by suggesting that Deputy Norton and Deputy Dillon are making the same speeches as they made before, and are merely doing that with a political object.  Perhaps the Minister will tell me how he is going to get in these 120,000 tons of wheat so as to turn that wheat into bread? If he is not able to do that, then we have a shocking position, and no subsidies will get over it.</P>

      <P>It is up to the farmers to help to feed the nation, and it is the duty of the Government to help the farmer to sow more wheat.  My experience of the county which the Minister for Agriculture and myself represent is that a great deal of barley is grown because the land suits barley. So long as the farmers are getting £2 for wheat and 30/- for barley, there will be little wheat grown in that county.  The farmers cannot be blamed for not growing it.  The best way to spend some of this money would be to go out and tell the farmers that you would give them a decent price for their wheat, so as to make it worth their while to grow it.  Deputy Belton suggested that the farmer was entitled to 50/- a barrel for his wheat.  I agree with Deputy Belton, and I voted for <Col N="777" /> his motion.  We all know that this is not a suitable country for wheat growing. There is considerable dampness at times, and plenty of sun is required for wheat.  There is only one way to feed the people, and that is to give the farmer a good price for his wheat. He should not be told in April, May or June what he will get.  He should be told now that he will get £3 a barrel&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Listening to the debate this evening, it comes as an agreeable surprise to me that at least one-half of the Opposition is now preaching self-sufficiency&mdash;a word which used to be laughed at and about which there was a lot of codology.  The only question now seems to be how to handle the sufficiency.  Personally, I believe that the price of wheat will have to be advanced, if the farmers are to be expected to produce it.  We all know that at the moment in certain districts oats and wheat are both going at 2/- a stone.  Therefore, something must be done to give encouragement to grow wheat.</P>
      <P>The whole meaning of the subsidy&mdash; as I understand it&mdash;is to give bread to the poorer part of the community at a reasonable price, and I ask those people who are opposed to the subsidy, if there are any, if they would in the same breath ask to remove the stabilisation of salaries and wages.  Are we going to have this inflation&mdash;one thing chasing the other&mdash;and none of us in this House able to sum up where it will end?  At the moment the Government is trying to ensure that the food produced will be sold at a price which will enable people to live within the present salaries and wages.  It is argued by some that the Government should take over the mills and nationalise them.  That is a very big question and I, for one, would not like to start on it in the present emergency and world outlook.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="779" /> I believe we should try to give encouragement for production.  Some people do not set the same value on money now that they set on it five years ago: they do not know where the present world racket will end or what its value will be.  Our consideration should be to get as much industry and production going as possible and to try to make conditions for our people, as a whole, as easy as possible.  We cannot expect to have it very easy, as the cost of many things from foreign countries has gone up.  After listening to some of the speeches in the debate, I must say I cannot see any division on this point, and I would not have risen were it not that one side of the House has been ridiculing the Minister and nobody here to defend him.</P>

      <P>One of the items which has been very well dealt with is that in regard to the subsidy, and the Deputy who has spoken made a very good case for it; but there is another item to which I would refer&mdash; the very first item.  It shows £42,168 increase in salaries, wages and allowances. That is an appreciable item and I suppose it is an indication of an increase in the number of officials.  If there is an increase like that in the number of officials, one would expect that there would be efficiency in that Department, but from long experience of trying to deal with that Department I have found that, instead of having any sort of efficiency, it is behind every Department in the State.  There seems to be neither head nor tail there, nor any kind of order.  It is very hard to account for it.  They never seem to get things into shape, or to have any method in that Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGovern</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose there is hardly any difference of opinion about the need for reducing the price of bread and the price of flour.  As regards the method by which that money is passed out to the people it is intended to reach, the trouble is that it is paid over to the men who have a monopoly&mdash;a few millers who have been multiplying their profits for the last few years.  They get a present of this subsidy, to deal with it very much as they like.  The money is voted by this House, but they do not reduce the price of bread or flour.  If we vote money to people who have a monopoly like this, it is but natural to expect that they have some obligation in regard to these privileges handed over to them.</P>
      <P>There should be no reason for debate on this question.  I believe that all sides of the House ought to be satisfied that it is a little difficulty which could be overcome, if there were some committee of men competent to deal with it, representing all Parties in the House, to arrange the way this money would be paid.  Some Deputies say it would be better to pay it direct in increased prices for wheat.  All sides of the House are inclined to agree that that would be the best way.  There has been a tendency here for a considerable time to give more and more to the monopolists&mdash;to the men who are making thousands and hundreds of thousands of pounds in profits&mdash;making millionaires of them and making paupers of the bulk of the people, the real producers on whom the country has to rely for food.  It is not fair, and everyone knows that it is not fair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know why the Government should be so anxious to pass it all on to the men who need it least and to throw the responsibility on them to use <Col N="781" /> it as they like and they will deal with it very much as they like.  They do not distribute it to the satisfaction of any section of the community, and I am sure that nobody on that side of the House would agree that they are dealing with the subsidy properly and letting the people entitled to benefit get the benefit.  If they were doing that, there would not be so many complaints about the price of flour, bread and other commodities.</P>

That has been a very troublesome matter in this area between the consumers and the shopkeepers, the Deputies and the Government.  I got in touch with the Department of Supplies in June last about an extreme shortage of flour there and the first time I got a reply was in September. That was to a letter I wrote in June&mdash; three months before&mdash;and it went no further than saying they were going to investigate the matter.  From September until now practically nothing has been done about it.  About two weeks ago, I got a notice from the Department of Supplies that they had decided to increase the quota by 5 per cent.&mdash;that was over the whole country. Any suggestion of 5 per cent. or 20 per cent. or even 50 per cent. indicated that the Minister or the Department did not know the first thing about the problem there.  I explained it as far back as last June, and it has since been explained by the people concerned in the flour trade and has been clearly put before the Minister and the Department.</P>
    <P>There is no purpose served by talking about any increase if there is not going to be a general rationing scheme in these districts where special circumstances exist, as the Minister knows.  Certain conditions that existed in my area in 1940 made it inevitable that the quota was very much below what it should have been.  Yesterday I was speaking to a man who, in conjunction with two others, gets flour from a miller; they are distributors in the town of Ballyconnell.  This man told me that the amount of flour they got for the last month or two would work out at 1½ lbs. every week for each <Col N="782" /> person in the area which they supply. From another source I heard it said that if the flour were rationed there would be 5 lbs. for each person.  It is no use talking about increasing the percentage when there is such a wide difference as that.  It may be asked how did the people manage to get along during the last year.  There is an explanation for that, and I believe some of the traders there have brought it to the Minister's notice.  They were able to carry on because they had laid in supplies, but these supplies are now exhausted and unless the Minister sees to it that something will be done, there is nothing but starvation facing those people.</P>
    <P>I heard yesterday of another increase over and above the 5 per cent. I advise the Minister not to rest assured that that will meet the situation. The people who have the responsibility of supplying customers must be satisfied that they are getting a fair and equitable supply as compared with other districts.  They do not want to be better off and neither do they want to be worse off than the people in other districts.  There has been a serious scarcity in this area, and I hope that situation will not be allowed to recur. The people have correctly informed the Minister of the circumstances and they will be satisfied if they get a fair show. The supplies that the people were advised by the Government to lay in have been exhausted.</P>
    <P>The district I am speaking of is not a place where any wheat worth while can be grown, because the land is unsuitable. The people have to depend on whatever supplies they can get.  I hope the Minister will give some attention to their grievances.  At the present time many people are writing to the Department and they fail to get satisfaction.  It is impossible, of course, for the Department to deal with individual complaints from all over the country.  If the people are given to understand that goods are being distributed in an equitable fashion they will realise there is nothing to be gained by writing, and thus the Department will be able to save a good deal of time, and a more satisfactory <Col N="783" /> condition of affairs generally will exist.

      <P>I must respect the ruling of the Chair.  I do not think there is anything more I can say on this subject.  Other speakers have dealt with it better than I could, and perhaps it is better to leave well enough alone.  I appeal to the Minister not to overlook the district to which I have referred, and I trust he will arrange for a suitable flour allocation.  He does not seem to realise to what extent the existing quota has been affected by the supplies brought in last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFlynn" hpid="Mr. J. Flynn Mr. J. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister referred to complaints, and he pointed out that in nine out of every ten cases there was no proper ground for complaint. In the area I represent I am aware there was a definite shortage.  I am not referring to what led up to the shortage, whether it was the fault of the traders or the system of distribution, but there was a definite shortage in some of the congested areas in South Kerry and, were it not that one or two traders in one district happened to have a substantial quantity of flour in stock, the position would have been very serious.  In order to avoid that happening again the Minister should adopt some system along the lines already outlined here.  He mentioned the definite quantity that would be required for the whole country.  Could there not be a certain quota allocated to each county in such a way that every area would receive a fair quantity?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my opinion there is a lack of uniformity in the matter of distribution. It is the duty of the Department to see that all Government orders are <Col N="784" /> enforced and properly respected. There should be a general evening-up of the whole position.  Deputy Linehan and others mentioned that farmers were withholding wheat stocks and that 100,000 tons were still being held in different parts of the country.  It has been suggested that some of the subsidy could be utilised to give an enhanced price to the farmers.</P>
    <P>Of course, everyone realises that would not be fair, because a certain price has been paid to the farmers who have already sent in their produce and their stocks, and why should anyone suggest that farmers who have still held on to their stocks should at this stage be given an enhanced price as an inducement?  I do not think that that would be fair or just.  There is, however, the question of the farmers holding on to these stocks for animal feeding.  That is deplorable, if it is true.  I have been informed of a few cases where people have held over stocks of wheat.  I must admit that it is a difficult matter to check up on, because these farmers, naturally, state that they require it for home consumption and that it will be utilised eventually for home requirements.</P>
    <P>I believe that there should be some check-up on this matter, even if the Minister has to call in the assistance of another Department of State.  For instance, why should not the Minister for Supplies, on occasion, call in the assistance of the Gárda Síochána in the enforcement of some of these orders?  I think it is necessary and that it will be necessary, and I would suggest that when he is replying the Minister should refer to the fact that it is understood that there will be a fixed minimum price in regard to the retail price of flour.  That would be a step in the right direction, and I believe that that would be one deterrent so far as the distribution of flour is concerned.</P>
    <P>I have been given information&mdash;I have passed it on, not to the Minister for Supplies, but to the Minister for Agriculture&mdash;with regard to the withholding of stocks of wheat.  I have also been informed in regard to traders who have sold two and three sacks of <Col N="785" /> flour to farmers for the feeding of animals and had none at all for the poor people and others who came from congested districts.  They had none at all for these people when the shortage took place.  These are the matters I was referring to when I mentioned the question of the Gárda Síochána being called in.  If the Minister adjusts the system, probably it would not be necessary to have any such proceeding or any intervention at all so far as the Gárda are concerned, but I believe that in order to have proper distribution and a proper check-up on the whole thing the position must be reviewed.  The Minister makes an order up here and the House gives it its approval, but it is another matter altogether to get the order enforced and respected.  With regard to the subsidy, I would suggest, if I am in order, that a percentage of that subsidy should be put aside for an increased price for wheat for the coming season.  I do not know if I am in order in suggesting that.</P>

      <P>Well, could not portion of this money be left over, if necessary, so as to make sure that the price of wheat would be increased for the coming year?  That would be one of the main considerations in connection with having a sufficiency, in my opinion.  We are given to understand, and we agree, that the Minister is doing the right thing in asking for this money to subsidise the price of flour and to regulate the whole system, but I should like to know, since we are given to understand that portion of this money will be required for the subsidisation of imported wheat, homegrown <Col N="786" /> wheat, etc., whether portion of it could not be also utilised for the other development, that is, to ensure a sufficiency for the coming season. Could not portion of that £1,900,000 be held over and not expended for the current year?  I am only making that suggestion in case such an adjustment is possible and if I am in order in doing so.  In conclusion, I should like the Minister, so that this shortage will not occur in future and so that there will be a proper distribution in the areas I am referring to, to consider the question of a minimum retail price for flour.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>The House is being asked to vote a sum of £1,900,000, as stated by the Minister, to enable him to keep the price of the loaf at its present level.  Now, portion of that £1,900,000 will be for the 80,000 tons of wheat that the Minister hopes to import into the country, but the price of that 80,000 tons of wheat is not included in this Estimate, I presume.  The total Estimate of £1,900,000 will go to the miller and the baker to subsidise the price of the loaf to the consumer in this current year, and I believe that that will be allowing the baker something like 1d. per loaf.</P>
      <P>I do not know how much the miller will get out of it, but £2,000,000 is an extraordinary amount for the taxpayers and the people of this country to have to pay this year to the millers and the bakers.  The loaf will be at the same price as it was for the past three or four years.  For the past year they have been selling the loaf to the people at the same price, while that loaf was very inferior in quality, and therefore their profits must have been greater than when they were giving us white bread at the same price.  Now we are giving them another £2,000,000.  The Minister said that the millers will not get any of it.  I suppose the bakers will not get any of it either, and I should like very much to know where this £1,900,000 is to go.  I know the farmers are not getting any of it.</P>

      <P>The farmer is paying the whole lot; there is no doubt about that.  I have been very much surprised at the figures given for this year's yield of wheat.  The Minister says he has 170,000 tons from 490,000 acres.  Is that correct?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It may not be correct to-day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it is correct. Surely there was a better yield than that even though the year was not a very good one.  Another Deputy has stated here that he believes there are 120,000 tons of wheat in the country unaccounted for at the moment.  If that is so, it is not being held by the farmer who went out to plough up his land in order that the people would have bread, and it is not being held by the working farmer who had to harvest his wheat as quickly as he possibly could and get the money for it.  It is being held by the people who can afford to hold it in order to get a better price for that wheat out of the sweat of the people of this country. If that wheat is here, and I believe it <Col N="788" /> is, then it is the duty of the Government immediately to see that it is procured for the people at the price that was paid to the farmers for this year's crop.  I would say to the Minister, if I am in order, that now is the time to fix the price for the coming year's crop of wheat, and that a decent price should be fixed if the farmers are to be asked again this year to be the great heroes that they were last year in producing 500,000 acres of wheat. The Minister will remember that if the yield was low this year it is likely to be very much lower next year, when the farmers will be unable to get any manures, and the price will have to be greater if the wheat is to be got for the people.  Now is the time to fix the price.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. F.H. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with some of the statements made by Deputy Flynn regarding a shortage of flour in South Kerry, particularly in the Kenmare rural district, and in the area called Castlecove.  When the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs was in Kenmare about two months ago I drew his attention to the matter, and he raised it with the Minister for Supplies. The situation improved slightly at that particular time, but there is still a serious shortage in that area.  I should like if the Minister would endeavour to improve the supply of flour into the Kenmare rural district, particularly Castlecove.  I tabled a question to-day, more or less in the form of a helpful suggestion, asking that a bounty would be given per acre for the growing of wheat in congested districts and in the areas where the land is poor.  I had a particular reason for <Col N="789" /> tabling that question, because I remember distinctly that, during the Great War, the congested districts and areas along the seaboard produced quite a large quantity of wheat, mainly for the use of the tenants themselves, and the falling off in the growing of wheat this year is very noticeable in those areas.  As a matter of fact, the shortage of flour is particularly noticeable in the areas where no wheat is grown.  I know quite a lot about that subject for the simple reason that I had something to do with the milling of wheat during the Great War, and I know that there is at least 80 per cent. shortage in the growth of wheat in those congested districts.</P>
      <P>There must be some reason for that, and, therefore, I think it is up to the Minister to encourage the growing of wheat in those areas.  Apart from that altogether there is the question of transport.  The transporting of flour from the rich tillage areas into the western seaboard makes a big demand on the transport facilities of the country, and the granting of a small bounty per acre for the growing of wheat in the poorer lands would certainly relieve the transport problem. I was not satisfied with the answer I got to-day, and if the Minister has any influence in the matter I would ask him to take serious notice of the necessity for giving a bounty for the growing of wheat in the poorer lands, because I am fully satisfied that, if that bounty had been given, at least 25 per cent. of an increase in the growing of wheat would have taken place this year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesFagan" hpid="Mr. Fagan Mr. Fagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fagan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is evident that the reason why the Minister had to bring in this Supplementary Estimate is that the whole wheat question has been bungled.  If the farmers had received more encouragement last year, we would have more wheat.  If the Minister had taken my advice six or eight months ago the price of wheat would have been increased, and the full complement of wheat grown in the country would be in the mills now.  We heard during the debate that there is a certain amount of wheat still outstanding. Wheat at 2/- a stone is cheap feeding stuff, and no matter how many inspectors <Col N="790" /> the Minister sends out he will not get all the wheat in the country. Another matter to which I want to refer is the way in which bread is being made at the present time.  I was in a farmer's house the other day&mdash;I will not mention names no matter what the Minister says&mdash;and I saw two loaves there.  I asked: &ldquo;Is that all the bread you buy?&rdquo;  I was told: &ldquo;We buy two loaves for the hens, and then we have our own wheat; we cannot eat the loaf bread.&rdquo;  The complaint all around the country is that nobody can eat the loaf bread made at the present time.  If more of the bran and pollard were taken out of the flour, there would be more use made of the bread; it is not being eaten at the present time.  Anyone who goes down to the restaurant here will see that there is home-made bread and loaf bread, and the loaf bread is left on every plate.  The bread is being used for animal feeding, because the people cannot eat it.  It is a great hardship on the poor people to ask them to eat such bread.  The people who can afford it can go and buy their bag of flour.  Frequently people in the country cannot get flour. There is a workman of my own who has eight big growing sons and his family normally used a bag of flour every ten days.  These eight boys cannot get sufficient bread at the present time unless they eat this stuff which is made at the baker's.  That is a problem which the Minister must examine.  Again this flour made into baker's bread is sheer waste.  Now the Minister has to provide a subsidy in order to secure sufficient wheat to carry on until next harvest.  If the Minister had given sufficient forethought to the matter he would not have to do that.</P>

      <P>You want to get enough wheat to carry you on until next September. You must remember that next September there may be a position in this country in which you will be able to import nothing and if you do not make provision now, all the subsidies in the world will not get you wheat. There is, therefore, every necessity to encourage farmers to grow wheat because the fact at present is that many farmers are getting out of the growing of wheat.  I prided myself this year on my crops of wheat.  I thought they were as good as it was possible to produce but the wheat did not ripen or did not give the yield which I expected so that in the end the crops did not pay me.  I had as I say an excellent crop.  On manured ground, it bushelled over 62 but on the lea ground it did not bushel 57.  That is the trouble all over the Midlands. Wheat did not come up to expectation owing to the moist weather in the month of August with the result that generally it bushelled only 54 or 55.  I thought I had myself the best crop of wheat in Westmeath and many people congratulated me on it but, except on manured ground, none of it bushelled more than 59.  I do not think on that basis it would pay me to go into it again.  I put plenty of artificial manure on it.  I bought it wherever I could but I cannot see where I am going to get it this year.  Although I used such a quantity of artificial manure last year the yield of my crops was not up to expectations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister wants the farmers to produce sufficient wheat to carry the country over the next year he must get the Cabinet together and put the problem before them.  There is a general idea in the country that the Minister for Supplies is the enemy of the farmers.  There is a belief that, were it not for the Minister, we would get a better price for our produce.  I think the Minister should get the Cabinet together and put this problem before them, otherwise next September you may have a position in the country in which not all the subsidies <Col N="792" /> in the world will get you wheat. Unless he throws out a sufficient bait to the farmers there will be no wheat and no bread.  Should that position arise, the fault will lie on the shoulders of the Minister for Supplies.  He is paid to see that the country has a sufficiency of all essential supplies, and if he wants to be sure of a sufficient supply of bread, he will throw out a good bait to the farmers now.</P>
    <P>I admit that I voted against an increase in the price of wheat to the farmers last year because I did not want to raise the price of bread on the people and because I honestly thought the price that obtained at that time would pay the farmer.  After my own personal experience, I can now say that it did not pay them.  If the Minister wants a sufficiency of wheat he will encourage the farmers to produce it by paying an adequate price.  It has to be remembered that owing to the shortage of artificial manures, the yield this year will be lower.  It must also be remembered that a very large proportion of the land is wheat-sick at the present time.  Wheat has been grown on it for the last three or four years and farmers will tell you that they cannot produce wheat on such land again this year.  You may produce wheat for two or three years on certain land but you cannot produce it after that.  That is why I say that the Minister should make every effort to encourage the farmers to grow wheat by offering them a proper price.  I think the Minister should also give the people a loaf they can eat.  It is all right for the rich man who can buy white flour but it is sinful to compel the poor people to eat, or to try to eat, the bread made out of the present flour.  It is wasteful also because if more bran and pollard were taken out of the wheat, that bran and pollard could be utilised for animal feeding and the bread would be all eaten whereas, in many instances at present, it is simply thrown out because it is unfit for human consumption.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to draw the Minister's attention to the fact that in certain districts along the Border there has been a shortage of flour for the past few months.  It is perhaps only <Col N="793" /> natural to expect that in the difficult conditions through which we are now passing there would be a shortage of certain commodities, but I hope that the Minister will see to it that the districts to which I have referred will receive a fair share of whatever supplies are available.  The subsidy of £2,000,000 which it is proposed to provide for flour under this Estimate is a very large sum.  I am not going to suggest that all that £2,000,000 will pass into the pockets of the millers; neither am I going to take the advice of Deputy Allen and other Deputies on the opposite benches who seem to imagine that we should swallow everything that is said on the Government Benches and vote this £2,000,000 without asking any questions.  I was surprised to hear Deputy Allen talking about propaganda and suggesting that Deputy Dillon should try to go out to undermine the Fianna Fáil Party on this issue of a subsidy of £2,000,000 for flour.  I think that Deputy Dillon has to go a long way to equal the tactics of Deputy Allen and others in the past as regards propaganda.</P>
      <P>This, as I say, is a vote for a very large sum of money and I am interested to know whether we are going to get value for it.  It is only right to say that portion of that money will go into the pockets of the Irish farmers. I think that, according to the Minister's statement, something like £700,000 of this money will go to the Irish farmers and that £1,200,000 is being paid to cover the extra cost of the wheat that has been imported.  It strikes me as extraordinary&mdash;I do not know whether I am right or wrong; if I am wrong I hope the Minister will correct me&mdash;that a sum of only £700,000 is being paid in respect of the 80 per cent. of the wheat that is raised in this country while a sum of £1,200,000 is being paid in respect of the other 20 per cent.  In other words, the 80 per cent. of our wheat requirements which is being produced in this country receives only £700,000 of the subsidy while the 20 per cent. that is imported receives £1,200,000.  Am I right in that assumption?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I should quote from the Minister's statement on the matter.  He said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The increased cost of native wheat will be £700,000.  We estimate that 80 per cent. of the total wheat used will be native wheat, as against something below 50 per cent. previously. The increased cost of imported wheat will be £1,200,000.  We estimate that the allocation price will be £30 per ton, as against £15 per ton last year, and that only 20 per cent. of the wheat used will be imported wheat.  That sum of £1,900,000, which represents the total increased price we will have to pay for wheat on the assumption that the quantity of flour to be consumed will be 2,700,000 sacks, means that, without any subsidy from any source, the price per sack of flour would be increased by 14/-.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Therefore, it does seem extraordinary. The reason I emphasise those figures is that I want to relate this question of wheat production to the Estimate, seeing that the Leas-Cheann Comhairle has more or less ruled the point out, and quite properly so.  Yet, it is important, and I think the Minister, in conjunction with the Minister for Agriculture, should examine those figures and see whether it is not possible to produce more wheat in this country in the coming year, and not have a situation arising whereby, to use the Minister's own words, this country is paying £1,200,000 for 20 per cent. of the wheat we use in this country, and we have only paid £700,000 for the other 80 per cent.  That is the position as I see it, from reading the statement of the Minister.  Therefore, it is imperative that the Minister should take cognisance of the fact. While I know the difficult position that exists in this country, yet, on these figures, something must be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems to me, from reading the Minister's statement, that he at least is resigned to the fact that we are not in a position to grow sufficient wheat for our own requirements.  I should <Col N="795" /> like Deputy Allen and other Fianna Fáil Deputies, who are always preaching the policy of self-sufficiency, to recognise that fact.  I think they will agree with me.  My reading of the Minister's statement gives me the impression that this country is not able to produce sufficient wheat to meet our requirements fully.  It seems to be the fact.  So far as I can see, I am afraid we will not produce the same quantity of wheat this year as last year.  As I say, it seems extraordinary to pay £1,250,000 for 80,000 tons of wheat. That represents the produce of about 80,000 acres.  I am assuming a yield of about eight barrels to the acre.  On that assumption, 80,000 tons means the produce of 80,000 acres.  I think it would pay the Government and the people of the country if we could get an extra 80,000, 100,000 or 150,000 acres of wheat, and not be paying £1,250,000 for 80,000 tons which as I say, represents the produce of about 80,000 acres. In some parts of the country there may be only a yield of six barrels to the acre, but I think the average yield is about eight barrels to the acre; that is about one ton per acre.  Therefore, 80,000 tons represents the produce of 80,000 acres.  Surely it would be good policy to induce the farmers of the country to grow 80,000 more acres of wheat.  On the Minister's own estimate, that would save us an expenditure of £1,250,000 for the import of 80,000 tons of foreign wheat.</P>
    <P>I know the extra price is due to the freight charges and war risks.  I recognise the fact that the price at which we get that wheat in the country where it is produced is a mere bagatelle when compared with the price when it is landed at the ports of this country.  I think that the Minister, in conjunction with the Minister for Agriculture, should endeavour by whatever means is possible, let it be an increased price or not, to get that extra acreage of wheat grown here.  I am not a farmer, and I have never grown wheat, but from reading the statements made here and knowing something about the matter, there is no use in talking about a policy of self-sufficiency if we <Col N="796" /> are not in a position to grow 80,000, 100,000 or 150,000 extra acres of wheat this year and save the expenditure of that £1,250,000.  I should like to ask if this country is able to produce sufficient wheat for our requirements, or have we been talking nonsense for some years past?  It would take 600,000 or 700,000 acres to provide sufficient wheat.</P>

      <P>How is it that that has not been done?  I am not speaking politically.  The times are too serious to be indulging in political speeches; but facts are facts.  Are we in a position in this country to turn 600,000 or 700,000 acres into wheat?  I believe there are between 10,000,000 and 11,000,000 acres of arable land in the country.  The question, therefore, arises: are we able to turn into wheat 700,000 or 800,000 of that 10,000,000 or 11,000,000 acres?  If not, then we have failed, and all this talk about self-sufficiency is just so much bunkum, especially in view of the fact that that huge sum of money has to be paid for the purchase of a very small percentage of our total requirements.  The Minister may have some explanation to give in answer to my contention, but that is my reading of the statement that he made, that £700,000 goes into the pockets of the Irish farmers who produced 80 per cent. of our total wheat requirements, and that £1,200,000 is to go into the pockets of the millers, or whoever is responsible for getting this wheat into the country.</P>
      <P>Whether we are getting full value for that £2,000,000 is what we are debating. I am not saying that the £2,000,000 is going into the pockets of the millers, but I do say that it is not fair that they should get 6 per cent. on their capital, in view of the difficulties through which the people of the country are passing at present, especially if, as the case may be, the capital is put at such a figure that it is much in excess of requirements; in other words, that it is inflated and that they are getting 6 per cent. on that inflated capital at the expense of the farmers and the rest of the community.</P>

      <P>I can appreciate the motives which have induced the Minister and the Government to introduce this Estimate.  It is in order to prevent the poor from having to pay an extra price for the loaf.  One can appreciate that fact, but at the same time we do not want to pay one penny more than is sufficient, if we can avoid it, because we are paying sufficient at present.  In regard to the suggestions made by Deputy Fagan, I think it is worthy of consideration by the Minister and by the Government, and that is whether by reducing the extract of flour we could not produce as much if not more bread, or at least bread that the people could eat.  It is a well known fact that from 15 to 20 per cent. of the bread goes to waste in some parts of the country, although it is hardly fair to say that that happens all over the country.  So far as the bread produced in Dundalk is concerned, I can say that I will not lose a night's sleep if I do not get any change of bread for the rest of my life.  That is as far as the bread in Dundalk is concerned, and I am told that it applies to the Drogheda bread also.  I am not praising the bread produced in Louth as against bread produced elsewhere, but I have heard it stated that the bread, especially in the Midlands, is very bad.  It has been suggested here before by many Deputies, including Deputy Dillon, that it would be much better if the Minister would reduce the extract by from 10 to 15 per cent.  He would have as much flour for the people and they would have as much bread, because there is a wastage of from 15 to 20 per cent. of the bread produced at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would also ask the Minister whether, in conjunction with the Minister for Agriculture, he could not get the farmers, by some means or other, to produce sufficient wheat to give us 100 per cent. of our requirements, instead of having to import wheat from other countries.  I will not go into the question of whether the wheat policy is good or bad.  We are passing through <Col N="798" /> an emergency, and time will tell all that when the war is over.  Deputy Allen may have to change his tune when the war is over about the growing of wheat.  We need not go into that question now.  I have my own opinion about it.  We are now faced with an emergency and we have to do the best we can with the means at our disposal, and it is up to us all to do it. In the meantime I would ask the Minister to pay attention to the question of the lack of supplies in certain parts of the country, especially those districts adjoining the Border.  Of course, I know the reason why there is a shortage there to-day.  There is no use going over that but, however, times are becoming normal now and I hope they will not be penalised for the good times they had in previous years.  I hope that sufficient flour will be sent to those districts so that the people may have their usual allowance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">

      <P>There is a matter that has taken my attention.  In the Minister's speech, reported at column 611, Official Debates, 13th November, he says:&mdash;&ldquo;It is proposed also to subsidise the price of wheaten meal produced by licensed wheaten meal millers for sale.  The cost of the subsidy in respect of wheaten meal is estimated at £33,000.&rdquo;  That is a matter which is puzzling the people in my part of the country.  I happen to come from a part of the country where both commission mills and licensed wheaten millers are working, and I can give the Minister figures for both these mills.  I would like to know if the Minister had any advice from people who are acquainted with both sides of this question before he came to the conclusion that he ought to subsidise wheaten meal from these mills.  I wonder if he had any advice?  I wonder if he has gone into the figures to find out what is the profit already being made upon wheaten meal by the millers who have licensed wheaten meal mills.  Has the Minister done that?  I am going to give the figures to the House and it does not appear to me or to the people in the country that there is any justification for subsidising wheaten meal as the Minister says he is going to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="799" /> The Minister said a while ago, in reply, I think, to Deputy Daly, that one of the causes for this subsidy is the increased price of home wheat.  I am going to take the Minister up on that and to see how far that is justified in regard to the production of wheaten meal.  Take, for instance, the man down the country who takes a barrel of wheat to a commission mill.  We will say his barrel of wheat is worth 40/-.  Any of the country Deputies who are in touch with commission mills will know what I am talking about.  The barrel of wheat is worth 40/-.  He will pay the commission mill 3/6 per barrel for turning that into wheaten meal and he will get back 18 stone, after drying. What is 18 stone of wheaten meal worth to the licensed wheaten-meal miller?  It is worth 24/- per cwt., that is 54/-.  If we add the price of the wheat, that is 40/- and the 3/6, that is 43/6, it would cost the ordinary licensed wheaten meal miller to turn that into whole meal the sum of 54/- and the Minister does not think that is enough.  Is that the position? He has 9/- per barrel for handling the wheat and he is not providing bags at the moment.  The Minister proposes to tell the House that one of the reasons why he has to provide this subsidy is in order to give £33,000 to those millers.  Is there any justification for that?  Those are the figures I bring up from the country from mills that are operating at my back door.  I would like the Minister to give his attention to this matter and to justify, as far as he possibly can, the subsidy to the licensed wheaten meal millers down the country who are making whole meal and are charging 24/- per cwt. for the whole meal.  If that is in keeping with the Minister's other statements, it is no wonder that the House and the country would be very doubtful of what the Minister says.  Deputy Allen, I am sure, knows perfectly well what I am talking about.  On the price of 40/-, the value of the wheat, the miller is able to make at least 9/- a barrel profit and the Minister does not think that is enough for him.  I do not want to spoil my case by saying any more or bringing in any other matters.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="800" /> I would like the Minister to tell us what he thinks about it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I had hoped that we would have been able to discuss this proposal to subsidise the price of flour and the price of bread in a spirit of a legislative Assembly dealing with an important matter of national policy.  I think it is utterly discreditable to members of this House that they should have endeavoured to use this occasion for the purpose of misleading the people of this country as to the proposal before the House and as to the effect of that proposal.  We have to face the fact that the wheat we are going to use this year will cost more. Everybody knows that.  The guaranteed minimum price to Irish farmers was increased from 35/- to 40/- a barrel.  Somebody must pay the extra 5/-.  The wheat which we are going to bring from across the Atlantic is going to cost more.  Somebody must pay the extra cost.  If we do not subsidise the price of flour, that additional price for Irish wheat and additional cost for imported wheat will be paid by the consumers of flour.  All the rest that has been stated here is so much humbug. The extra cost of our wheat will increase the cost of flour from 52/6 to 66/6 a sack.  That is the result of the increased cost of wheat.  It will mean that the 1/- loaf will go up to 1/2.  If we do not provide this subsidy, that will happen to-morrow.  If the Dáil votes against this Estimate, as many Deputies indicated it was their intention to do, then, as from to-morrow, the loaf will be 1/2&mdash;it will probably be slightly more because there will be certain arrears to be made good&mdash;and the price of the sack of flour will be 66/6, because our wheat is going to cost us more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dillon said that we are providing this subsidy for the benefit of the millers.  &ldquo;Is there a Deputy in the House,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;who will get up and maintain that this plundering monopoly should be further buttressed up with £2,000,000 of public money?&rdquo; Later he said: &ldquo;The sum of £1,900,000 is to be handed over to these gentlemen.&rdquo; Not by one penny will the millers of this country benefit by this subsidy. Except in very exceptional cases they <Col N="801" /> will not even see a penny of it.  The purpose of this subsidy is to ensure that there will be delivered to the millers in this year wheat wherewith to manufacture flour at the same price that they bought it last year.  Getting the wheat at the same price, they will sell flour at the same price.  There will be no benefit of any kind to the millers. There can be no benefit to the millers. The operation of the subsidy will be conducted through Grain Importers Ltd., a Government organisation&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but that does not matter.  It is only the total quantity <Col N="803" /> that matters in this case.  Last year, we used 200,000 tons of native wheat which cost us 35/- per barrel on the farm and 40/9 per barrel delivered dried to the mills.  If Deputies work that out, they will find that the total cost of native wheat last year was £3,260,000.  In order to make good the inadequacy of the home supply, we imported 170,000 tons of wheat, or, at any rate, we used 170,000 tons of imported wheat which was delivered to the millers at the allocation price of £15 per ton.  That cost £2,550,000 and the sum total of these two amounts was £5,810,000.  That, roughly, was the total cost of the wheat we used, whether native or imported, last year. This year, the consumption of native wheat will, we think, increase from 200,000 to 290,000 tons, and that native wheat will be bought from the farmers at 40/6 per barrel, instead of 35/- last year, and delivered dried to the millers will cost 46/9 per barrel.  290,000 tons at 46/9 per barrel will involve £5,400,000.  We have to supplement that 290,000 tons of native wheat by 80,000 tons of imported wheat which this year will cost £30 per ton, making £2,400,000.  The total cost of both these items is £7,800,000.  Last year, the wheat used to produce all our requirements of flour and bread cost us £5,810,000 roughly.  This year, it will cost us £7,800,000.  The difference is what we are going to make good by subsidy.</P>

      <P>I am not going to deal with these minor factors which may affect our calculations.  I am dealing with broad figures.  Some quantity of that flour purchased by millers was devoted to purposes other than the manufacture of bread for sale to householders. Other minor factors operate which affect these figures in greater or lesser degree, but, roughly speaking, these calculations will show Deputies clearly where this additional sum of £2,000,000 is going.  It is going to pay the extra cost of Irish wheat, plus the additional cost of imported wheat. Even that statement is somewhat misleading&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;because, as Deputies will have noted, the amount which will go to Irish farmers this year exceeds by more than £2,000,000 the amount which Irish farmers got last year, because not merely has the guaranteed minimum price of the wheat been increased but the total production of wheat by Irish farmers has increased, and therefore, the total amount which will go to the farmers exceeds by more than £2,000,000 the amount which they got last year; but, on the other hand, even though the price of imported wheat has risen considerably over the allocation price of last year, the quantity will be so much less that the actual outgoings for imported wheat this year will be less, we assume, than last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have said that these figures are based on certain assumptions.  Deputies have misunderstood the statement I made last week.  I told them that, of the 290,000 tons which we calculated would be available for milling into flour, 170,000 tons, according to the latest information, had actually been delivered to millers or merchants. That delivery does not indicate that there is going to be difficulty in getting the 290,000 tons.  As a matter of fact, I gave that information on Thursday last as being the latest available to me, but, when I checked up on it, I found that, by Thursday last, 200,000 tons had been delivered to millers or merchants, <Col N="805" /> and the quantity delivered to date is probably larger still.  Those who are familiar with these matters tell me that, making allowance for the lateness of the harvest, the deliveries of wheat to date are quite good and well up to normal, and, in fact, somewhat above normal, and there is as yet no reason to anticipate that there will be difficulty in securing the estimate of 290,000 tons of dried wheat delivered to millers and available for milling. Whether that will prove to be so or not, I cannot say, but there are at least sufficient indications of the total quantity we will get to enable us to say that, if we do not get 290,000 tons, we shall at least get so near to it that the importation of the balance required to maintain a full supply of wheat will not be beyond our resources.  I therefore would not like it to be thought that there are any serious grounds for apprehension on that point yet.</P>
    <P>I have answered the question asked by a number of Deputies as to where this money is going.  In fact, it is going to pay for the wheat.  In practice, it will be distributed through Grain Importers, Limited, who will adjust the price of imported wheat to the millers in such manner as will ensure that the total cost of the millers' grist in this year will be the same as last year.  I want to make it doubly clear that there can be no benefit to the miller from the subsidy because that utterly misleading statement made here is likely to be accepted by some people, and in fact has already been assumed to be correct by occasionally intelligent people like Deputy Norton. The miller this year will get his wheat at the same price as that at which he got it last year.  He will pay in wages to his workers the same amount as he paid last year.  Whether the cost of producing flour from wheat will prove the same this year as last year will, in any event, not affect the price, because the miller is going to be allowed only the same charge in respect of that cost this year as last year&mdash;&mdash;</P>

It is not the practice of my Department, nor would it be practicable, to fix the price of flour at each mill according to the costs of production in that mill.  We take the flour milling industry as a whole.  We take the average costs of production in all the mills of the country.  We determine what is the total capital invested in flour milling in all the mills in the country, and, on the basis of these average costs, a price for flour is fixed which would enable the miller to produce flour with a return of 6 per cent. upon the invested capital.  Some millers, of course, are able to work to costs which are below the average, and some millers work to costs which are above the average, but the price is fixed on the basis of the average costs of the most efficient mills in the country.  I should have made that clear.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>For the information of the House I should explain that there are certain mills in this country which, because of their position, can produce flour somewhat more advantageously than others.  These mills are located at certain ports&mdash;Dublin, Cork, Waterford and Limerick&mdash;and our calculation of the cost of producing flour is based upon the actual cost of production in these port mills.  The price that we fix for flour is based at these port mills.  Over and above that price, flour is sold in other parts of the country at that port mill price plus the cost of transporting the flour from the port by the cheapest means of transportation.</P>
      <P>There was made recently an order, which comes into force on Monday, fixing a flat retail price for flour.  Heretofore that was not considered practicable because certain difficulties existed, but these difficulties have been overcome and an order is now coming into force which will fix a flat retail price for flour in these port mill towns and in the rest of the country.  The price in the rest of the country will be slightly higher than in the port mill towns.  It will be 3/- per stone in the port mill towns and 3/2 per stone in the rest of the country.  It is, therefore, clear that we do not, as has been stated, guarantee profits to anyone. We do make it possible for the mills of the country to carry on their industry. I think it is obvious that we must do that.  I know of no action by which a Government could compel any manufacturer or trader to continue in business at a loss to himself.  Clearly, any practicable arrangement for the fixation of prices which will be just to all parties must provide for the earning of at least minimum profits for the manufacturer. The profit that we have fixed in the case of flour milling, of 6 per cent. upon the invested capital, is, I think, the lowest point at which we could fix it.  Certainly in normal circumstances it would be held, by most people who are familiar with business conditions, that 6 per cent. upon ordinary industrial capital is an inadequate return.</P>

      <P>I am prepared to defend a return of 6 per cent. upon the capital invested in any industry.  In fact, there are some industires more precarious than flour milling, where 6 per cent., in my opinion, would be an unfair return.  The actual capital in the case of some companies is substantially less than the issued capital. There are many well-known companies in Dublin&mdash;big firms of manufacturers &mdash;whose nominal capital does not represent the value of their assets.  These assets have been built up out of profits. I think it is true to say of the banks and a number of other commercial concerns that the actual money invested in their businesses is substantially less than the original capital invested. There may be other cases, but for the purpose of this particular calculation the capital invested by the concerns in flour milling is substantially less than the issued capital.  That, in fact, is the normal situation in this country. Most of the flour millers in this country are also maize millers and engage in other business activities as well.  The total capital of the concerns includes their investment in their other businesses, maize milling or whatever <Col N="809" /> other activities they carry on.  The actual capital invested in flour milling is less than the issued capital of these concerns, and a return of 6 per cent. upon the invested capital, which the fixed price allows for, would not permit in some cases of the payment of 6 per cent. upon the issued capital. But if there is any basis in the charge that we, by this arrangement, are guaranteeing 6 per cent. to the millers, we are doing it not by the subsidy but by the fixed price.  The subsidy does not affect the position in the least. Any intelligent person can see that.  It is by the fixed price that we do secure, if, in fact, it can be said that we are securing, for the miller a return on his investment.</P>
      <P>I want to deal further with some points that were raised here of greater importance than those that I have referred to already, but as the time available does not admit of that now, I will have to postpone my remarks until to-morrow.  There is one point, however, that I want to make clear for the information of Deputies, and that is in relation to the shortage of flour which arose in some districts, and was attributed by some Deputies to the feeding of wheat, or wheaten products, to animals.  It was urged that we should make more extensive efforts to enforce that order, and particularly that we should employ the Civic Guards for that purpose.  It is at present the responsibility of the Civic Guards to enforce that order.  We realised that it would not be possible to secure the enforcement of it through the activities of departmental inspectors. The risk of evasion was much more widespread than in the case of other orders, and, consequently, arrangements were made with the Department of Justice that the Gárda Síochána should undertake the enforcement of that order.  Anyone who is aware that the order is being evaded: that this practice of feeding animals with wheat that we will require for human consumption is taking place, should make the fact known to the Guards who, I am sure, will take the necessary steps to bring the offenders to justice.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Supplies (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>When the House adjourned some time ago the discussion upon the motion in the name of Deputy O'Higgins, relating to the petrol supply, I was in possession. The motion asked the Dáil to approve of the establishment of a Select Committee to investigate and report on the position of the petrol supply, the basis of the present distribution of petrol, and to make recommendations. I told the House on the last occasion the motion was before it that I was not prepared to agree to it.  I did not think it was at all necessary to set up a special committee to report on the position of the petrol supply, because I am prepared to give the House all the information that could be had on that subject now.  As regards the basis of the present distribution of petrol, I am prepared to explain and to justify that basis, and I maintain that any proposal that we should depart from it should be discussed in public. So far as the position of the petrol supply is concerned it is as follows: The total quantity of petrol which we were given to understand would be available for this country during the course of the present year was 20,000,000 gallons.  Deputies will remember that at the beginning of the year a very difficult situation arose in <Col N="811" /> relation to petrol.  During the course of last year we were receiving, roughly, two-thirds of our normal supply, and licences were being issued to consumers of petrol on that basis.  That situation continued to operate since the beginning of the war, and there was reason to believe that it would continue so long as the supply position in the United Kingdom did not deteriorate. Arrangements made with the authorities in the United Kingdom appeared to ensure that we would continue to receive petrol supplies calculated generally on the basis of two-thirds of our annual consumption.</P>
      <P>On Christmas Eve of last year I received notification that a consignment of petrol which had been expected would not arrive; intimation, in fact, that no more petrol would arrive.  I found it hard to credit that intimation and let it stand over Christmas until St. Stephen's Day, when contact was again established with the petrol control in the United Kingdom, and the petrol importing companies, and the information that resulted from that contact appeared to support the information which we had already received that no more petrol would come to this country.  In consequence of that information I arranged to stop deliveries of petrol by the petrol companies. I felt it was essential that the limited supplies in the country should be conserved for absolutely essential purposes, and that further deliveries to garages and ordinary petrol consumers should be stopped in view of the intimation that we were getting no more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That action of mine has been frequently misrepresented in the Press as being the result either of panic or mismanagement, but I feel certain that any other person in my position in the same circumstances would have done precisely the same thing.  It was some days before we were able, through the various contacts we established, to get any other information bearing on the position.  As a result of the representations which we made and of the action which was taken, an additional quantity of petrol, amounting approximately <Col N="812" /> to 1,000,000 gallons, was promised us during the month of January.  On receipt of that promise I authorised the resumption of deliveries by the petrol companies on a restricted basis.  The 1,000,000 gallons did in fact arrive during January.</P>
    <P>It was at that stage we received more definite intimation of the deliveries of petrol we were likely to expect during the present year.  The previous intimation, that we were to get no more petrol was withdrawn, and the next intimation was that we could expect to receive during this year 20,000,000 gallons.  The distribution of the 20,000,000 gallons of petrol will, I think, give Deputies all the information they require as to the present position.</P>

      <P>If the Deputy is sincerely looking for information I will try to give it.  The Deputy knows quite well that the discussions were conducted by officers of my Department, the diplomatic representatives of this country, and through other proper and recognised channels.  The allocation, therefore, for this year is 20,000,000 gallons, from which must be taken 1,640,000 gallons used during the month of January.  Our use of petrol during January was in excess of deliveries in that month, and consequently there was available for 11 months from the end of January 18,350,000 gallons.  Of that 1,000,000 gallons were set aside for the use of the Army; 500,000 gallons were required for the operations of the petrol companies in their own deliveries, and 500,000 gallons as an allowance in respect of waste.  Apparently, it is necessary to make a fairly substantial allowance for wastage and evaporation.  That left what we call the sales quota.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>For the Army.  To the end of October the actual imports of petrol from the beginning of February were 13,666,900 gallons.  The actual issues of petrol to the end of September amounted to 11,666,000 gallons, and in October to 1,621,000 gallons.  Perhaps I have given an incorrect figure there.  To the end of September the actual imports were 9,422,000 gallons.  The quantity we were led to expect we would receive in that period was 11,666,000 gallons. In other words, imports were less than expected, while issues were 9,574,000 gallons.  It will be seen, therefore, that we received in that period slightly more than 2,000,000 gallons less than we were led to expect, and we issued about 150,000 gallons more than we received.  That was from the beginning of February to the end of September.  The total quantity which we were to receive to the end of the year was 18,350,000 gallons.  The actual quantity imported was 13,627,000 gallons, so that there is a balance due to us of 4,723,000 gallons.  That is our <Col N="814" /> position.  I do not know if the expectations of the oil companies in this matter of deliveries will be realised, or whether we will receive this year the quantity of petrol which at the beginning they told us we would get.  There is the figure of 4,723,000 gallons due to us. Although that will be reduced before the end of the year it is, nevertheless, impossible to say whether we will close the year with the account balanced.</P>
      <P>It is necessary also that Deputies should remember that there was no storage.  In each month we distributed the quantity which we received in that month.  In fact, there were months in which we had to gamble on the arrival of supplies early in the month in determining what the ration of petrol would be to the various users. We fixed the ration on the assumption that the petrol would be delivered, knowing that if by any mischance it did not come, there would be another outcry following a series of allegations about incompetence and mismanagement. The alternative was to leave the country without petrol for a week or two in order to protect our own reputations for competence and efficiency. In some of these months the quantity of petrol delivered was, in fact, less than that issued over the period.  At no time was it possible to accumulate any reserves or to do otherwise than to administer in the best possible way the quantity of petrol coming to hand.  I told the House already the reasons which led us to decide on the basis of distribution of petrol on a flat rate.  It is possible to distribute it on another basis. We could attempt to assess individual needs and to allocate petrol to individuals on the basis of their needs. We know that one doctor may require more petrol than another, that one clergyman might require more than another clergyman or that one business man, because of the nature of his business, required more petrol than another business man.  As between classes and individuals in each class there are variations in needs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We could have set up some form of tribunal or some judicial or semi-judicial officer to attempt to assess these needs.  We decided against that, <Col N="815" /> because not merely is it impracticable, but nobody would be satisfied as to the fairness of the assessment.  If one individual got ten gallons against another individual's eight gallons, assuming that both were engaged in the same business or following the same profession, there would be allegations of partiality, allegations that one individual had a pull with the Minister or with officials, or because he was a political supporter of the Minister he got preference over another who was not a political supporter.  I think it is undesirable that these allegations should be possible, however untrue they might be, because here and there are individuals who believe in them and, consequently, there develops a general disrespect for Government administration and Government authority.</P>
    <P>I felt that apart, therefore, from the impracticability of attempting that method of allocation, there were good reasons of public policy why we should fix the petrol ration upon a flat rate basis, giving to persons in particular categories the same ration, irrespective of their individual needs, and why we should try only to assess the requirements of classes, giving one class more than another if circumstances appeared to justify it.  Consequently, private individuals, business men, persons who use cars for other certain very limited purposes, get their petrol rations upon the basis of the horse-power of their vehicles.  Nobody can claim that the horse-power of their vehicles is influenced by personal or political considerations.  It is according to the horse power of the vehicles that the quantity of the petrol distributed is determined.</P>
    <P>We take out of the class of private car owners certain groups&mdash;doctors, veterinary surgeons, clergymen and one or two other minor groups&mdash;and give them, as classes, additional rations of petrol, but we do not attempt to distinguish as between the individuals in each class and their relative needs.  If a person comes within the class of doctors he gets the doctor's allowance; if a person comes within the class of clergyman he gets a clergyman's allowance, and so forth; <Col N="816" /> although we know, as everybody else knows, that some doctors have a different type of practice from others, and some clergymen have different needs from others.  That system of distribution does not fairly assess their needs, nor attempt to do so.</P>
    <P>The total quantity of petrol distributed during the month of September was 1,600,000 gallons.  It is roughly the same in each month now.  There are variations as between month and month in the requirements of petrol for special delivery purposes, but, roughly speaking, as between one month and another, the quantity required to maintain rations to all normal car users and the special services to which I have referred remains much the same.  One hears frequently the advice that petrol should not be made available to private car owners at all, unless it is clear that those private cars are to be used for some specific and essential purpose.  People object to seeing private cars at sporting events or being used for pleasure purposes or for purposes of personal convenience. There is behind that objection a very false assumption as to the proportion of our petrol supplies which goes to private car owners.  It is true that the casual observer in the street sees&mdash; or appears to see&mdash;a larger number of private cars driven around than of other types of vehicles, and gets the impression that a fairly high proportion of the total supplies of petrol is being used by those private car owners.  That is entirely incorrect. The total quantity of petrol used by private car owners is a very small part of the total consumption.</P>
    <P>In the month of September, the number of gallons authorised to be issued to private cars was 143,000, against a total distribution of 1,600,000 gallons.  Even if we were to stop that issue to private cars and conserve that petrol, the actual difference it would make in the size of the allocation to other users of petrol would be very slight indeed.  It is necessary to remember that a very large number of these private cars used by business men are used for necessary and essential purposes, and <Col N="817" /> that a great deal of employment depends upon the availability of transport&mdash;even if the transport be in the form of a private car&mdash;to the traveller or manager of a particular concern.</P>
    <P>The big consumption of petrol is, of course, in goods vehicles.  The commercial goods vehicles receive a basic allowance of roughly 400,000 gallons per month.  That is the total quantity of petrol required to give the basic allowance to commercial goods vehicles.  Hackney owners and certain other restricted classes of users receive 139,000 gallons; Government Departments of one kind or another receive 41,000 gallons; the rail and bus companies receive 184,000 gallons; industrial users, both agricultural and nonagricultural, receive roughly 70,000 gallons; and then there are large numbers of other classes receiving very much smaller basic allowances.  The total quantity given out on these basic allowances was 1,086,000 gallons in the month of September.</P>
    <P>The supplementary allowances, which are given to doctors, clergymen and veterinary surgeons, amount to roughly 50,000 gallons.  Supplementary allowances to hackney owners, ambulances and other vehicles of a similar character, amount to 13,000 gallons.</P>

      <P>Yes.  It is that basic allowance plus double that.  A doctor <Col N="818" /> with a car not exceeding 10 h.p. gets four gallons as a basic allowance and eight gallons supplementary, making 12 gallons altogether.</P>

      <P>The various types of goods vehicles receive between them supplementary allowances of 406,000 gallons.  The non-licensed carriers&mdash;a type of goods vehicles not licensed for public hire&mdash;receive almost 400,000 gallons. Creameries, building contractors and licensed and unlicensed hauliers' supplementary allowances amount to about 450,000 gallons.  The total of the supplementary allowances issued in the month of September was 514,000 gallons.</P>
      <P>I think that is all the information that can be given to the House.  It is true that the form of the supplementary allowances&mdash;at least the allocation of the petrol available for supplementary allowances between one class of user and another&mdash;varies from month to month.  I think we can con gratulate ourselves that, despite the apprehensions of some people at the beginning of the year, it can be said that no ton of turf, grain or any other essential product has failed to be moved because of inability to obtain petrol.  Individuals may have claimed petrol for that purpose and failed to get a licence, but in every case where we were satisfied that there was a genuine requirement of petrol for the transport of turf, grain or other essential commodity, that petrol was available for the purpose.  Those who had the direct personal responsibility of husbanding and managing petrol supplies are to be congratulated on having maintained that position throughout the whole year, even though it was a very close shave at some periods during the year.  I do not know that it is necessary to repeat here the actual allowances which were given to various types of vehicle owners.  That information has been published in the Press, and is, of course, available to anybody at any time they inquire for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before I conclude, I would repeat my objection to the motion before the <Col N="819" /> House.  Whatever circumstances existed when the motion was tabled first&mdash;and, as Deputy O'Higgins has pointed out, that was a considerable time ago, when there were circumstances somewhat different from those existing to-day&mdash; I do not think we should adopt that motion now.  I do not believe it is necessary to have a formal committee of inquiry in regard to the petrol supply, as that committee could get no more information than I have given to the House.  I have no more information to give, nor is it possible to get any.  As to what the supply position is to be next year, I do not know. At the moment we are endeavouring to get somewhat more specific knowledge as to what will happen next year, and if that knowledge becomes available I will take the opportunity to communicate it to the House; but at the moment it is not available.  I can give the House no information whatever as to what the supply position next year is likely to be.  As for the basis of distribution, as I have described, that is a flat rate basis as between individuals and classes, and I do not think we should depart from it.</P>
    <P>I have told the House that I am prepared, if the House desires, to consult with a committee representative of Parties in determining what the ration should be, having regard to the supplies available in any month, to consult them at the beginning of that month or towards the end of the preceding month when it is possible to state precisely the quantity of petrol available, and to allow them to express their views as to its allocation between the various classes of users.  I confess that that situation would shift from my shoulders some of the responsibility and give me an extra bulwark when individuals throughout the country abuse me because of the smallness of their allowances.  It would afford that protection to me, but I am not pressing for it as, after a few years in the Department of Supplies, one gets used to saying &ldquo;No&rdquo;, and in the matter of petrol I have said &ldquo;No&rdquo; so consistently that no one expects me to say anything else, when one communicates <Col N="820" /> the special circumstances on which a special allowance is claimed.</P>
    <P>If there is any desire by major Parties in the Dáil to be associated with the determination of the petrol rations, I am prepared to facilitate them, as I have said, but I think that is as far as it is necessary to go at the present time, having regard to the tremendous elements of uncertainty in the whole situation.  Any report that might be submitted by a committee as to the present supply position or future prospects might be completely invalidated in a week's time and all the labour would be for nothing.  The circumstances could change so rapidly as to completely invalidate any conclusions arrived at on the basis of the information at present available.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I recommend the Dáil not to pass this motion; but, in doing so, I assure the House that any time members want information on any of the points mentioned in the motion&mdash; either the petrol supply position as a whole or the allocation of petrol as between various classes of users&mdash;I will give them that information in as detailed a form as is possible.</P>

      <P>So the Press has given out.  On the question of supplies to private cars, there are a number of them doing a lot of commercial work, and I would not like to take it off them but, in view of the uncertainty and the possibility of the fight coming nearer home, surely they should not be getting any petrol at all.  Would it not be better to conserve that supply used for private cars, small as it may be, for future occasions, because of the uncertainty of getting supplies?  I read in a paper yesterday that no private cars in England will get any after the 1st January.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>They may have a different system in operation in Great Britain.  The Deputy's suggestion <Col N="821" /> would involve some attempt to discriminate between one private car owner and another.  That is not practicable. If an individual says: &ldquo;Give me my ration of petrol, because I want it for business purposes,&rdquo; I do not think that it is possible for us to check the accuracy of his statement.  It would mean some sort of sworn investigation into every man's claim and, of course, it would not be possible to do that.  If people find that, by making an inaccurate statement, they will get the ration, then we will get inaccurate statements.</P>
      <P>Therefore, there is no basis of distribution possible other than the flat rate basis, in which the allocation of petrol is calculated according to the horse-power of the vehicle or the general class of the owner.  If the position does not improve, it will be necessary to cut out or restrict further the allocation to car owners; but it must be realised that the saving that will be effected will be fairly small in relation to our total requirements.</P>

      <P>I could not say that there is.  There is a basic allowance which goes to the lorry owner.  So far as that basic allowance is concerned, it goes to him if his vehicle is taxed and it is calculated in accordance with the unladen weight of the vehicle.  In the case of a supplementary allowance, there is a check.  If there is a supplementary allowance given to a lorry owner to carry beet or grain or to serve a creamery, there are various checks to ensure that it is a <i>bona fide</i> claim.</P>

      <P>In many parts of the country one can see private cars at dog-racing on a Saturday evening, outside church doors on Sundays and at golf courses and other places.  Then there are men who get 60 gallons a month for commercial lorries and there is the possibility that this petrol may be used in private cars by people travelling round to amuse themselves. Is it desirable that the petrol should be distributed in that way when there is a possibility that in six months' time there will be great difficulty in getting any petrol?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Apart from the practical difficulty of determining the use that is going to be made of the petrol, the Deputy will understand that even if we cut out all private cars, having regard to the fact that there are only 140,000 gallons involved as against 1,000,000 gallons to lorry owners, the additional ration that would be possible for lorry owners in consequence of the cutting out of the private cars would not make any real difference to them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>This motion has been on the Order Paper for a long time and the petrol rationing scheme that was in operation at the time the motion was tabled is still in operation, with the exception of a few minor changes.  Evidently, from what the Minister has said, he is satisfied that the scheme he has in operation is the best type of scheme under which to distribute petrol to the limit of the quantity available.  One could understand, when we suddenly experienced the shortage in petrol, the introduction of a scheme making provision for our requirements on the basis of three or four classes of users, but, with the passage of time, and in the light of experience, one would expect a considerable improvement in the method of allocation either by the elimination of waste, or the restriction of supplies to cars and lorries engaged in work of national importance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister stated that petrol was available for the supply of any essential commodity and he did not know of any case where that supply was not made available.  Last spring <Col N="823" /> I brought to his notice that large quantities of lime were required for agricultural purposes and that there was no petrol available for the distribution of that lime.  The Minister then refused to make petrol supplies available for that purpose.  I look upon the supply of lime to certain types of land as raw material for the production of food. Lime has a very good effect on the yield.  It will release certain plant food in the soil and, in view of the fact that we have a very limited supply of artificial manures, petrol for the conveyance of lime or any commodity of that type ought to be made available immediately.  I do not think the Minister is justified in saying that petrol was available for the supply of any essential commodity.</P>
    <P>It may be, from an administrative point of view, the simplest way of dealing with this problem&mdash;that is, dealing with it on a class basis, taking three or four classes in the community. Where we experienced that sort of rationing scheme, we came up against a problem immediately There is, even in that limited supply, a very considerable amount of waste.  There are people who are carrying out what might be looked upon as a national service, people who ought to have an adequate supply of petrol, but who cannot get anything approaching an adequate supply.  As Deputy O'Higgins pointed out, you cannot compare men in his profession working in remote districts and finding it difficult to carry on, with men working in Dublin and having public conveyances passing their doors.</P>
    <P>The same thing applies to the agricultural community.  There are old cars that have been converted into lorries and they get a supply of petrol in order to collect rabbits and, on the other hand, you have men engaged in a national service, producing food, unable to get petrol to convey their workers to the land in the harvest time. I know cases where men had grain crops on out-farms and on conacre land and they were anxious to convey workers to those farms, but they were refused a supply of petrol.  It is unfair <Col N="824" /> and unwise to refuse those men petrol when they are engaged in work of national importance.  Then you have cattle buyers anxious to visit country fairs in remote places and, if those men are unable, through lack of petrol, to visit the fairs, the farmers will suffer very severely because they will not get a decent price for their stock; there will be no competition and the cattle will be bought up cheaply.</P>
    <P>Those are considerations that ought to weigh with the Minister.  The people who are engaged in the production of essential food are entitled to every consideration.  They ought to have first claim on any raw material necessary for the production of food  They have just got the same treatment as a man who gets a petrol ration in order to do a little joy-riding through the country, and I consider that is most unjust.  I think there ought to be a distinction made definitely.  I feel that cars ought to operate on a permit and that private cars that are not an essential service at the present time ought not to be permitted to operate at all.  The Minister mentioned the small amount of petrol which is allowed for the starting of tractors at the present time, and you have that on a standard basis again.  There is no differentiation between the different types of work that that tractor may be operating.  A tractor may be working all day in the field or hauling beet and engaged in different types of work on the one day involving a series of starts, and that is completely ignored.  I think that at the present time the ration of petrol for starting tractors is two gallons to every 50 gallons of kerosene.  That may be quite all right for a tractor engaged on a farm operation, only doing ploughing or cultivation and that sort of thing, but there are numerous tractors in the beet-growing areas that may be hauling loads of beet in the morning and then have to turn in to plough in the afternoon.  Such a tractor may have to be started up six, seven or eight times in the day, whereas the tractor that goes into the field to plough requires to be started only in the morning and in the afternoon.  A flat ration there, to my mind, does not meet the case.</P>

      <P>I am not talking about new hackney licences.  I am saying that old licences have been taken out, the cars left idle, and the coupons sold.  In fact, if I want to buy coupons I can procure any amount of them at 5/- a coupon.  That is public property in part of my county.  Every Civic <Col N="827" /> Guard and every official in the county knows it, and I expect the Minister has heard about it.  Some complaints about it were made to me, and I told the people who came to me to write to the Minister about it, as I was not going to be the intermediary in the matter, but I know that it is so and that any amount of coupons can be procured in that way at 5/- each.  That is one thing that the Minister's Department or somebody should inquire into, when there is so much talk about scarcity.</P>

      <P>I find it difficult to reconcile the Minister of to-day with the Minister of this day fortnight, and I find it still more difficult to reconcile different portions of the Minister's speech here to-day.  He opened his reply to this motion by being most vehement and emphatic that no useful purpose whatsoever could be fulfilled by the appointment of a committee from this House to make recommendations with regard to the distribution of petrol within this State.  He ended his statement by welcoming, or rather throwing out the suggestion that representatives of the different Parties in this House should do that exact work from month to month, either at the beginning of each month or towards the end of the previous month.  He scoffed at the idea of a committee making recommendations, on the ground that nobody could ensure the petrol supply from week to week.  If there is any honesty of purpose in that statement he should sack the whole petrol sub-section of his Department, because that huge, unwiedly, expensive Government Department is engaged solely on allocating petrol from month to month, and I believe it is a necessary service.  But if it is sensible and reasonable for that Department to allocate or make suggestions with regard to the allocation from month to month, it is equally reasonable for a committee of this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, earlier in the debate the Minister said that he would not have this matter referred to a committee, that he would do it in the open, that he <Col N="828" /> would have the views of the Deputies, and that it was a matter on which Parliament should speak.  The debate has gone on for two Parliamentary days, and there was only one voice raised against the motion, and that was the Minister's.  Five Deputies have spoken, and they have all spoken for investigation, examination, and some different form of allocation.  Was he honest, was he sincere, when he said: &ldquo;Leave it to Parliament?&rdquo;  There are times when even Ministerial bluff can be called.  Does he mean by leaving it to Parliament that he would give Deputies an opportunity to speak and express their point of view?  The bell rings and a political Whip operates. Men are brought up against their election pledges, and made to vote against their own opinion and against their consciences.  Is that the Minister's idea of leaving it to Parliament?</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;which has neither soul nor mind, and well the Minister knows it.  When we were discussing this subject on the last occasion, the Minister, referring to the supply of petrol given to the doctors, while admitting that the amount allocated to them was inadequate, went out of his way to add insult to injury by dragging in, in an entirely uncalled-for manner, a statement to the effect that he had a census taken of the cars seen in O'Connell Street one evening, and that 40 out of 60 of those cars belonged to doctors.  I took a note of his remarks. All the papers next day, including his own tied organ, came out with that quotation, that 40 out of 60 of the cars belonged to doctors.  I knew that that statement was definitely inaccurate and untrue.  I was prepared to challenge it.  I was prepared to ask for that census.  I waited for the official debate, and I found it was very carefully manipulated; that the figure was deleted, and the phrase was rounded off nicely to read that a number <Col N="829" /> of those cars belonged to doctors. It would be beyond reason that both myself and the reporters for all the daily papers would make the same mistake in taking notes of the remark. The wound was inflicted; the harm was done; the injured people were not only injured but insulted, and then, like a person who has inflicted a wound, he runs to hide the weapon and to amend the phrase so that it could not be challenged.  The Minister may use arguments, and he is very glib in the use of arguments, but, in the Minister's own interests, I would warn him to give up using figures, because he uses figures as recklessly as confetti at a wedding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister does not consider that any useful purpose would be served by listening to recommendations merely of Deputies with regard to the distribution of petrol.  No useful purpose would be served?  He must stand up there as the champion of rigid bureaucracy, while the taxpayers, the workers, the industrialists, the professional men and the business men of the State are just to grin and bear it.  Whether the rule of thumb provided either by himself or a cloistered civil servant is reasonable or unreasonable, whether it jeopardises either the interests of a household or the interests of a business, the rule of thumb must stand; no useful purpose is to be served by making suggestions or recommendations. We know there is not.  For ten years back we know there is no use in making suggestions no matter how sensible or constructive.  The rigid brass barrier of officialdom is there.  Nobody can teach them anything.  Nobody can make any sensible suggestions.  The only wise man in Parliament is the Minister for Supplies.  We have got enough of that kind of nonsense.  The Minister himself admits, taking the doctors as a whole, that there is a vast difference between the doctor with a busy practice in a large rural area and the doctor who in fact has retired from practice and has no professional business. While admitting that, he says that it would be unreasonable to make any distinction between them.  Such tosh.  Such utter nonsense, bearing the stamp of official laziness.  The Minister, earlier in the debate, said he <Col N="830" /> adopted a rule of thumb.  Why?  Because it was the simplest; because it was the easiest method.  It was not because it was the most equitable; it was not because it was just, but because it was the simplest, the easiest. That was the Minister's own admission. Of course it is the simplest.  Of course it is the easiest.  You do not want either a Minister or an expensive Department merely to draft a rule like that, apply it to everybody, and then close your ears to every representation made by anybody.</P>

      <P>The Minister, of course, says it is impossible, fantastically impossible, to endeavour to deal with individuals; that you cannot deal with individuals with regard to the allocation of petrol or the use they have for their cars; that it cannot be done.  Only a very small percentage of the people of this country possess motor cars.  I wonder what the Revenue Commissioners would think about that statement from the Government front bench.  If there is any sense to that argument, we should all be on a flat rate of income-tax.  But, when it comes to getting in the &ldquo;shekels,&rdquo; there is no trouble in going into the professional work, the clients, the business, and the income of every single individual in the State.</P>

      <P>But when it comes to getting work done, in order to provide the coffers for the Revenue Commissioners to loot, then the simplest line is adopted; the unjust line is the right one.  We heard the Minister's rule of thumb method&mdash;143,000 gallons a month for all the private cars in the country, one third of that being for Government Departments.  If there is dissatisfaction amounting to the point of anger amongst either private car owners, professional people using cars, farmers requiring to use cars or business people requiring to use cars, it is because of the evidence all round of the free use, the wastage, of petrol in Government <Col N="831" /> Departments.  The Minister will not hear of one extra gallon of petrol for a business man to get from one business house to another ten miles away. Oh, the State would rock if he got it.  The Minister will not hear of one extra gallon of petrol for a farmer to get to a distant fair.  The Minister will not hear of an extra gallon of petrol for a doctor to get to an urgent case. Yet there are a dozen of the biggest cars in Ireland trapesing around this city carrying single Ministers from their domiciles to their offices, and when they are not on duty carrying Ministers from their homes to their offices and back they are busy carrying Ministers' families around the City of Dublin.  I do not believe in the kind of clap-trap that was preached by the Minister 12 years ago&mdash;that a Government Minister should not have a car.  His predecessors had to do their 12 years without any car or petrol supplied by the taxpayers.  They benefit by a more sensible Opposition.  They get the same salaries and allowances, and cars purchased and fed with petrol by the taxpayer.  All I suggest is this, that if every motor owner in the country is to be inconvenienced to such an extent, and if that kind of drastic petrol economy is necessary in the public interets, then the Ministerial seats would be as comfortably ensconced in 8 horse power cars as in 30 horse power cars.  It is merely rubbing salt into the wounds of the people whose cars are taxed and idle in the garages, to be passed and met round the streets of Dublin by huge, high-powered Chrysler cars carrying Government Ministers, cars designed to devour petrol.  A more modest car, a car consuming not the fabulous amount of petrol that Ministers use, would certainly be some outward evidence, some visible sign, that Ministers meant what they said when they say it is necessary to conserve petrol.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I shall go a bit further.  The Minister says that the farmer or the business man, no matter how important his business, no matter how wide his field of activity, the commercial traveller who was rearing a family in a <Col N="832" /> certain kind of modest comfort through the medium of a car, because it is necessary to conserve petrol, can only get enough petrol to cover 120 miles a month at most.  And all the time that that bent and crippled man is trying to do his business on foot, or by pushing a motor bike or a pedal bicycle on the road, any five miles of an Irish road that he goes any day in any hour's journey he will be passed and almost run down by fleets of Army vehicles of one kind or another.  Would the whole life of this country come to a standstill if the Army in this country behaved like every efficient army in every other country, who utilise the rails and the public conveyances of the country to the maximum?  We saw the other day a list of priorities probably issued by the Minister on the rails of this country.  In a time of national emergency with war all round us, with the Taoiseach telling us that we may have war here at any hour, we do not have mention of the Army in the order of priorities on the public conveyances system.</P>

      <P>I do not remember the day, and I doubt if the Minister does, when he ever saw military goods loading or unloading at any station in this country.  I wonder did he ever see since 1923&mdash;I never did&mdash;a train stopping at the Curragh Halt.  Every army in the world no sooner takes up semipermanent quarters in a particular place than the first thing that is done is to push the railway lines to feed supplies and to transport goods backwards and forwards.  Here you would imagine that the waters round this little island and the rivers in the country were running with petrol. Whatever has to go from Dublin to Cork or Dublin to the Curragh, or from Dublin to another military post, big or small, the Army lorry must come or the Army lorry must go.  We have them going to and fro eating and <Col N="833" /> consuming petrol day after day  Is that a reasonable picture to present to the people at a time when you say that people's business must go burst, that old men must take to bicycles, that the cry of suffering must wait, that there is not an extra gallon to be spared in this country?</P>
      <P>The Minister knows as well as I do that I am not exaggerating.  The Minister can throw his figures recklessly and foolishly around.  The Minister can point to doctors' cars being on the streets of Dublin at a time when no petrol was allowed to anybody but doctors.  He jeers at the doctors.  What did he ever do to investigate where the other 20 cars got their petrol? What did he ever do to stop the huge black market which is there in every county in this State?  Does the Minister not know very well what is happening? There are some getting a lot too much; there are many getting a lot too little.  A committee of Deputies of this House would at least, in the interests of the State and the Government, put their finger on some of the appalling leakages that are there.  They would point out to the Minister what is happening in their counties and in the neighbouring counties.  They would give the Minister the tip.  They would help his Department to check the hæmorrhage, but no, it must be refused. It must be refused because it is an application that came in the name of an Opposition Deputy.  It must be refused because if a committee of that kind were established one thing is certain&mdash;the rule of thumb system would have to be defended.  The rule of thumb system would be investigated and inquiries would be made as to why some were treated in one way and some in another, and an answer would have to be given.  The simplest thing in the world is to shout out through a peephole: &ldquo;That is the way I am doing it,&rdquo; and then duck as in a Punch and Judy show, so that no questions can be asked or answered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The people of this country have made concessions and sacrifices in many directions.  It is popular for Government Ministers periodically to take to public platforms.  What is their tune from every public platform?  &ldquo;In the <Col N="834" /> national interest we call on you to make this sacrifice, that sacrifice and the other sacrifice.&rdquo;  The people have responded splendidly, the people have responded gallantly but the people are beginning to say: &ldquo;Well, what about the boy who is asking this; what sacrifice are the Government going to make, what way are they going to economise in the use of petrol and otherwise?&rdquo; The people have done much for the Army.  The people have made many sacrifices for the Army.  Many people have left their homes and gone in to lend a whole-time hand in helping the Army.  What consideration are the people getting in return?  The people are knocked off wheels and put on their feet because they are asked to make sacrifices for the State, for the Government and for the Army, to be in danger, at every twist in the road, of being driven over by a Government car or an Army car.</P>
    <P>The misuse and the waste of petrol in Government Departments, including the Army, is simply appalling.  If the thing is only faced up to sensibly, from a military or defensive point of view, they will realise that, if any of the dark prognostications that we have listened to from week to week ever come true, one of the vital sinews of our defensive war will be petrol, and that if it is only to make provision for that day, surely there should be a less reckless use of petrol by Government servants. Now, the Minister, perhaps genuinely, misunderstood a point I put in opening this debate.  He suggested to the House that my idea in having a committee of this kind was that every single individual motorist would have to be considered as an individual.  I did not go so far as to make a suggestion of that kind, though, if I did, I would not see anything unreasonable in it.  If it were only just to keep the Minister's thousands of officials warm in winter, it would be reasonable to give them something to do.  I do not see anything stupendous in examining into the common uses of all the private cars in this country.  There are not so many; there is an average of a few thousand to a county.  We have police, we have hundreds and thousands of inspectors, we have parish committees, we have L.D.F.s, we have L.S.F.s we <Col N="835" /> have more machinery in the hands of this State than Adolf Hitler has in Germany.  There is nothing enormous in that task.  But, what I did suggest was that, in addition to the few rough categories which he has at the moment of private persons&mdash;doctors, clergymen, veterinary surgeons&mdash;there should be about ten classes instead of three or four.</P>
    <P>There is unquestionably a vast difference between the private car used purely for pleasure and the private car used partly for pleasure and partly for business.  These two classes would separate themselves in each county as quickly as could be.  There is a difference between the doctor who has retired from practice and the doctor with a busy practice.  There is a difference between the doctor in rural Ireland and the doctor in a municipal area.  There is no great problem in differentiating between one and the other.</P>

But make the Medical Union even the authority to point out clearly where economies can be made and say that if economies are effected there would be more for every sound case, then the Medical Union would do your work.  But the Medical Union is not going to bolster up either laziness, or incompetence, <Col N="836" /> or inequitable distribution.  That is the answer of the Medical Union.</P>

      <P>That is the answer of the Medical Union and the Medical Union has more moral courage than ever characterised the Minister.  The Minister's whole defence of his rule of thumb, if you convert it into plain language, is lack of moral courage.  He says: &ldquo;If I attempted to do the right thing, everybody would criticise me.&rdquo; Did you ever hear of such a defence coming from a Government Front Bench?  Then the individual who puts up that contemptible defence has the effrontery to talk about moral courage. Grow up, have sense, and do not defend your own lack of moral courage by offending others.  The Medical Union are prepared to put up a reasonable case if they get any assurance that that reasonable case will be met.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister's case is this: That a busy doctor, in the opinion of the Minister and his Department, is entitled to travel three miles for every one mile covered by a purely private person.  Is there any committee of this House, no matter what side of the House they come from, will say that that is reasonable?  The Minister knows that he could not get a committee to say it is reasonable, and that is why he will not have a committee; because he knows that a committee of this House, no matter where they are drawn from, will do the right thing and will have the moral courage to do it. It is because of that that the Minister wants to shift the responsibility somewhere outside of this House.  The Minister can sit pat over the present position, a position which he agrees himself is unsound, a distribution which he states himself is inequitable; but a distribution and a plan which, according to himself, is only defensible on the ground that it is easy and that if he undertook a little work and carried out a more equitable distribution he would be subjected to criticism.  I wish the Minister well in that particular stand.  I hope every motor user in this country will respect the Minister and <Col N="837" /> the Government to which he belongs because of his statement, that an unjust plan is adopted because it is easy and that it would be unwise to adopt any fairer plan because he would be subjected to criticism.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I move the Second Reading of this Private Bill which has been standing in my name for some time past.  Beyond the fact that the Government gave this Bill a First Reading, I have had no indication as to the attitude of the Government with reference to the principles embodied in it.  The Bill contains four proposals designed to bring about a much needed reform in that part of the law of this country known as the law of torts.  While the four principles embodied in the Bill are in need of being passed into law, the purpose of the Bill is not merely to get these particular principles embodied in the legislative enactments of this country, but to direct attention to the fact that there is quite a large body of our law at the moment badly in need of reform.  The whole principle embodied in this Bill is that, wherever there are two or more people jointly responsible for committing a wrong to another person, the old rule, which has its roots in the British common law, that those people are jointly responsible to the injured person and that there should be no contribution between the various persons responsible for the injury, should be put an end to.</P>
      <P>The first proposal in the Bill is somewhat outside that principle, but it is a principle that has come down from the old British common law at a time when that law regarded the person of a wife as being just united in that of her husband; that husband and wife were one person and that husband and wife had no separate individuality in the law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following that principle, the principle that I wish to have repealed, namely, that the husband was liable for the torts or wrongs of his wife, was <Col N="838" /> established.  The provision contained in Section 2 of this Bill is that from the passing of this Bill the husband should not be responsible for the wrongs of his wife.  That principle has, both in England and in Northern Ireland, been long since abolished.  Why we should carry it on in our law I do not know.  I have raised this matter and the other matters embodied in this Bill every time that I could get an opportunity, relevantly and irrelevantly, in Estimates and other places, on the passage of the Courts of Justice Act through this House, in an endeavour to seek reform of these outworn principles. I was under the impression that I had got undertakings in reference to certain reforms I had drawn attention to, that they would be attended to, but years have elapsed and, accordingly, I put down this Bill as a first measure in the initiation of law reform in this country.  The idea that, if a wife commits a slander on some friends of hers in a golf club or elsewhere, her husband should have to pay for that, although he knows nothing about it, appears to be inequitable and has only justification in a completely outworn principle of British common law.</P>
    <P>The third section of this Bill has reference, perhaps, to a more vital and important aspect of the law, particularly in regard to the consequences following upon negligence in connection with motor cars.  To take the simplest example, if there is a passenger in a motor car and he is injured by an accident between the vehicle in which he is travelling and another vehicle travelling the road, he has, according to the law at the moment, the right to sue both or either of the drivers of those two vehicles, and the principle is that although one vehicle may be only 1 per cent. negligent in the sense of causing or contributing to the injury and the other vehicle 99 per cent. negligent in the sense that I have mentioned, this passenger can sue both the owners of those vehicles and recover judgment against both and, having recovered judgment from the jury or from the judge for the amount that would compensate him for his injuries, he then has the privilege of <Col N="839" /> executing for the entire of the costs and damages against the owner of the car that is only 1 per cent. wrongful. He can recover from the person who was the least guilty, who was guilty only in the most minor degree, the entire damages and costs, and let the other person scot free.  That such a state of affairs should be allowed to have continued so long in this country is due possibly, I think, only to the fact that the Government, in the stress of recent times, have not had their attention sufficiently directed to these matters.  This principle has also been abolished in Great Britain and Northern Ireland for some years.  The existence of that legal principle is inclined to lead to and has in fact led to very serious abuse.  I need not give any great number of examples of cases that have come within my own personal knowledge where a plaintiff, having recovered judgment against the owners of two vehicles involved in a collision, one of the owners of those vehicles or the insurers of that owner has approached the plaintiff, who perhaps has had a verdict for a couple of thousand pounds, and said: &ldquo;If you execute against the other fellow, you can have an additional £500.&rdquo;  In other words, the one man is made to suffer the entire of the costs and damage for which both are responsible, and the plaintiff is given a hand over for relieving the other person from being liable for the whole of it.  That has actually happened.  It is an abuse that should not be allowed to continue.</P>
    <P>The sections of this Bill dealing with this matter carefully and clearly preserve the right of an injured person to recover fully from both or either of the persons responsible, whatever degree they may be responsible for injuring him, but it provides that as between two wrongdoers the court should be in a position to state that one should contribute to the expense and the damages which they both have to pay to an injured plaintiff.</P>
    <P>I would like, personally, to go very much further along the road of reform in the law of negligence than this very tenuous proposal endeavours to do. <Col N="840" /> There are many people, I think, at present who would prefer to have the rule that exists in the British Admiralty by which, when various vehicles are in collision, the apportionment of the wrong between them is made by a judge and in accordance with whether one person is half right or half wrong the damages are granted.  It occurred to me, at all events, that it would be better to go in stages and to reach after the lapse of some years the position which has existed in England now for quite a number of years and to put forward this modest proposal that the old rule about contribution between joint tort feasors, as it is called, should be put an end to and that, in the first place, if a person gets judgment against one of these joint wrongdoers that that should not preclude him, as the law does at the moment, from suing the other person; and, secondly, that there should be a contribution to the expenses and damage occasioned by two wrongdoers to an injured person as between themselves.  If you sue one wrongdoer and get judgment against him and then discover that that person either has no goods on which you can seize or recover for damages or expenses, or is not insured, then you are precluded from going against the other person by the mere fact that you have got a judgment.  There is no justification whatever for such a rule and the first part of this section, sub-section 1 (a), provides that that rule should be abrogated.  The next paragraph (b), preserves the rights of the person injured, and paragraph (c) provides for the contribution between joint wrongdoers.  Sub-section (2) enables the court to fix the amount of contribution between them in accordance with their respective degrees of responsibility.</P>
    <P>I should say here that although this Bill does not on its face specifically provide that it is only to have operation as from its date, I think that if the Government accept this Bill or agree to it in principle and introduce something along the lines of it, that it should not be made retrospective, that it should only operate as from the date of its passage in respect of all the provisions in the Bill.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="841" /> As regards Section 4, I think that that section does introduce a new principle which is not in our law at the moment nor is it, so far as I know, embodied in the law of Great Britain or Northern Ireland.  It is a principle which I personally have been very keen on for some time.  It is one, however, on which there may be different views.  People may have different ideas as to the effect on the law of defamation and the question whether or not it is proper that people who take part in the dissemination of a libel or a slander should be all jointly liable or whether the damages should be apportioned in accordance with their varying degrees of responsibility. That is a matter that I would like to refer to in a moment, but before I develop the principle of Section 4, I would like to draw attention to something that is omitted from this Bill.  I had intended to put it down as a separate Bill, but I think if the Government see their way to accept the principles embodied in this Bill and <Col N="842" /> undertake to introduce something like it, they might embody this provision also in it.  As the law stands at the moment, under the Fatal Accidents Acts, the dependents of a person killed through the negligence of another person has no right to recover the funeral expenses from the person who was the cause of the death of the party on whom they were dependent. Why there should be such a provision I do not know, but that is the law in this country at the moment.  If your dog is killed by a motorist you can sue the person responsible and get damages for it.  If your child is killed, it is a million to one against your getting a penny damages.  You cannot even get the expenses of burying the child that is killed by the negligence of a motorist, as the law stands at the present time. I move the adjournment of the debate.</P>

      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he is aware that in the appointment of doctors applying for positions under the Department of Local Government and Public Health an apparently undue period elapses between the date of interview and the notification to them of the results sometimes causing such doctors serious inconvenience; and if he will arrange that in future no unnecessary delay will be made in communicating the results to them.</P>

      <P>Before recommending a person to a local authority for appointment to an office to which the Local Authorities (Officers and Employees) Act, 1926, applies, the Local Appointments Commissioners are bound by the terms of that Act to satisfy themselves that such person possesses the prescribed qualifications as to age, health, character, training and experience.  To do this they must make a number of inquiries, subsequent to the interview, regarding the candidate they propose to recommend and it is consequently inevitable <Col N="716" /> that in some instances a comparatively long period will elapse between the date of the interview and the notification of results to candidates.  For example, the claims to certain experience made by the candidate placed first must be fully verified before he can be recommended for appointment.  This verification may take a considerable time especially if some of the experience has been obtained abroad.</P>
      <P>Candidates cannot be notified of the result of their applications until the Commissioners have issued their recommendation of the successful candidate to the local authority.  Simultaneously with the issue of this recommendation the Commissioners notify the successful candidate that he has been recommended and then, within a few days, the unsuccessful candidates are notified. It is seldom possible to complete all the necessary preliminaries to the issue of a recommendation within a month of the date of the meeting of the interview board, and very often difficulties are met with which delay the completion of these preliminaries for a considerably longer time.  Every effort is made, however, to avoid unnecessary delay.</P>

      <P>The application for service certificate made under the Military Service Pensions Act, 1934, by Mr. William O'Donoghue, Coolatooder, Ballinhassig, County Cork, was fully investigated by the referee, who has reported to me that Mr. O'Donoghue is not a person to whom the Act applies.  The applicant is being informed accordingly.</P>
