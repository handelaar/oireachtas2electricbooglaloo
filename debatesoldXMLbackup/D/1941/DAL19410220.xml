    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if he will state the names of the committee forming the Hospitals Bed Bureau, and their address; if he is aware that there is still a scarcity of bed accommodation in hospitals in Dublin for citizens, and if he can say when new accommodation is likely to be provided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>It is presumed that the first part of the question has reference to the Advisory Committee appointed by the governing bodies of the hospitals to which the Hospitals Bureau relates.  I am not in a position to give the particulars asked for in regard to that committee.  As regards the second part of the question, I understand that last month and, again, in the middle of this month, there were about 200 vacant beds in nine general hospitals in the city.  There were also 32 beds vacant at the end of January in three children's hospitals.</P>
      <P>As regards the last part of the question, the reply is in the negative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Parliamentary Secretary say whether these beds which, he says, are vacant are at the disposal of the citizens of Dublin?  If there are cases requiring immediate attention, can the citizens of Dublin utilise those beds which, he says, are vacant, and which I have reason to believe are not held at the disposal of the citizens at the present moment?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the Parliamentary Secretary's reply, are we to understand that the hospital authorities have permission to fill all those beds by adult and children patients? My information is to the contrary.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Parliamentary Secretary kindly make inquiries and let us know, when he has done so, whether Dublin citizens requiring attention, as well as some little time in hospital, will have those beds, which are now said to be vacant, placed at their disposal? I am anxious to know because my information is the direct opposite of that given by the Parliamentary Secretary.  My information is that anyone requiring a bed at the moment cannot get it, in spite of the fact that the Parliamentary Secretary says the beds are vacant.  I want to know why they are being kept vacant while you have sick people requiring hospital attention.  I think the Parliamentary Secretary ought to reply to that.  I do not say that the Parliamentary Secretary is deliberately deceiving the House when he says that there are beds vacant.  I say they are not at the disposal of the public who require them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>Immediately.  That is my information.  Now, as regards the difficulty of getting into those beds, I would suggest to the Deputy that he should establish contact with the Hospitals Bureau.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy was present in the House when the Bill was passed through it establishing the Hospitals Bureau, and he must be aware that that Hospitals Bureau was established by the Hospitals Commission and is controlled by the Hospitals Commission. I am sure he can make contact with the Hospitals Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>

      <P>asked the Minister for Supplies if he will state whether, in view of the official statement that has been made that in spite of the increased percentage extraction from wheat in the production of flour, it is not intended that there will be a reduction in the price of flour or bread, he will state (1) the increased resultant profit per ton to millers, (2) the total such increase anticipated (a) by the end of the present cereal year, and (b) during the next 12 months, (3) the arrangements, if any, that have been made to create a special fund to offset possible increases in the price of flour, (4) the anticipated amount of the fund, (5) the authority under which the fund is being created, and will be used, and (6) the machinery which will control it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Minister for Supplies (Mr. Lemass) Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Supplies (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards the first two parts of the question, it is not anticipated that the standard profit of the flour-milling industry will be increased during the present cereal year.  It is not possible to state what will happen during the next 12 months as it is not expected that imported wheat will be available after the end of the present cereal year. The price paid by millers to Grain Importers (Éire), Ltd., for imported wheat has been increased so as to offset any possible profit which might be derived by millers due to the use of flour of increased extraction.  It is anticipated that as a result of this <Col N="2301" /> arrangement a sum which may be in the region of £100,000 should be available by the end of the present cereal year for use in maintaining the price of flour at a lower level than would otherwise be possible at that stage.  This amount is purely an estimate which may not be realised should unforeseen circumstances arise.  The arrangement was made under my direction, and the question of the actual machinery to be used for the disposal of any funds which may accumulate in consequence of this arrangement has not yet been decided.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister realise the implications of this arrangement, that, according to his own calculation, a sum of £100,000 is to be levied on bread to be appropriated for a purpose, the exact nature of which has not yet been determined, and the accounting for which will be made to nobody, and, if the Minister stands over such a procedure, will be explain how he can reconcile that procedure with the existence of the Department of the Comptroller and Auditor-General whose duty it is to see that taxation appropriated by this House is properly applied?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I ask the Minister if the effect of this arrangement is not this: that there will accrue a fund of £100,000 resulting from an excess charged for grain to the millers during the next six months, and if that is not taxation of wheat, and indirectly taxation of bread, will the Minister tell me what it is?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>They imported wheat at a whole variety of figures, but it has been sold at a flat price fixed by me, a price which at various times in the course of the past year yielded what might be regarded as a higher profit than would ordinarily be the case and, at times, yielded a loss.  We stabilised the price of flour and the price of bread, and we are proposing to continue to stabilise the price of bread, and if this arrangement operates to secure temporarily a profit for Grain Importers, Ltd., the whole of that profit will be used to continue to maintain bread at a lower price than that at which it otherwise would be.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JeremiahHurley" hpid="Mr. Hurley Mr. Hurley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hurley</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Supplies if he is aware that master bakers, who were in a position to buy up large quantities of white flour far in excess of their quotas, obtained such supplies from millers, and thus produced white bread while their less fortunate competitors produced the new brown loaf; further, if he is aware that there is a big reduction in the trade of such smaller bakers as a result of this unfair competition, and what steps he proposes to take to safeguard the trading interests of such people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that certain bakers have been placed at a disadvantage owing to the fact that they had no stocks of flour of less than 90 per cent. extraction.  In order, however, to prevent any waste of such white flour as is held by bakers, it was considered necessary to give them a reasonable time in which to utilise that flour.  An order was made yesterday under which persons carrying on the business of manufacturing bread for sale must use at least 80 per cent. flour of 90 per cent. extraction as from Saturday next.  This order should obviate any likelihood of unfair competition in the bakery trade.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>What will a baker do if he cannot get the 80 per cent. of flour of 90 per cent. extraction, because deliveries of bakers' flour at present are not unrestricted, and it may be that he is not able to get that quantity?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I hate to introduce my personal affairs, but, for the Minister's information, I am not able to get it. Will the Minister get for one baker in this country the requisite proportion of 90 per cent. extraction flour?  If he says &ldquo;yes&rdquo;, that settles it.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Supplies if he will consider arranging with flour millers for a percentage of flour of 75 per cent. extraction to be supplied for the confectionery and cake trade, as without such flour the confectionery trade will be severely affected; furthermore, if he is aware that the ingredients of such confectionery <Col N="2306" /> form staple articles of diet and that the scheme, if availed of, will result in an economy in the use of flour.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>As the quantity of wheat in the country is scarcely sufficient to cover requirements up to the next harvest even on the basis of a 90 per cent. extraction, arrangements cannot be made for the production of a flour of a lower extraction for the confectionery trade without endangering the food supplies of the people.</P>

      <P>That question is being considered, but there are, of course, two points of view.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan) James Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>Wide publicity has been given to the existence of foot and mouth disease in the Press, wireless, etc., and stock-owners should be under no doubt that it is their duty to report promptly to the Gárda any suspicion of the presence of foot and mouth disease in cattle, sheep and swine in their possession or charge.  Departmental veterinary officers are always available to investigate such reports. Failure to report promptly or cloaking the existence of the disease is an offence under the Diseases of Animals Acts and, on conviction, is liable to heavy penalty and possible loss of compensation for animals necessarily <Col N="2311" /> slaughtered to prevent the spread of the disease.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGovern" hpid="Mr. McGovern Mr. McGovern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGovern</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that people do not consider that this disease is as serious as I regard it?  There are people going around assuring farmers that they can cure the disease with a handful of salt and criticising the Department's policy of stamping out the disease and paying compensation.  If the Department intends to carry out its policy efficiently, it should insist on no other course being adopted.  If people begin to cure cattle, that will involve cloaking the disease and, for every beast cured, the disease may spread to 1,000, the cattle trade may be ruined and the taxpayer mulcted in millions. The Minister should make a statement on the matter and, if necessary, take more power to deal with this aspect of it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister, in that connection, consider a little local publicity, pointing out, in the first place, that the disease is not curable in existing circumstances and that no attempt must be made to cure it and, in the second place, pointing out that compensation in the case of foot and mouth disease is based on the full market value of the beast destroyed? A misapprehension on that point is what is causing people to cloak the disease.  The Minister may not be aware that people believe that, when a beast is killed under the Foot and Mouth Act, they will get only &ldquo;tuberculosis compensation,&rdquo; which amounts to £2 or £3.  If they were told that they would get the market price, you would get a much more generous measure of co-operation than you are getting at the present time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for External Affairs whether it is a fact that Irish ships have been bombed and Irish seamen machine-gunned when trying to escape in their boats by German aeroplanes, and, if so, will he arrange to have defensive armaments installed on Irish ships so as to enable <Col N="2319" /> our seamen to defend themselves against such attacks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="Minister for External Affairs (The Taoiseach) Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Minister for External Affairs (The Taoiseach)</NameTxt>
      <P>(1) I can best reply to the Deputy's question by giving a number of facts.</P>
      <P>(2)  Since September, 1939, eight Irish vessels have been attacked.  Two of these vessels were attacked twice, making a total of ten attacks.  In these attacks, four of the eight vessels were sunk, 20 lives were lost, and seven men were injured.</P>
      <P>(3)  In addition to these four vessels, five were lost in other ways.  Three sank as a result of striking mines.  The causes of the loss of the other two are not definitely known.  The total number of Irish vessels sunk in various ways since the beginning of the war is thus nine, with an aggregate gross tonnage of 14,205 tons.</P>
      <P>(4)  Four of the ten attacks on Irish ships occurred within a radius of 20 or 30 miles from our coast.  Of the others, three occurred in the Atlantic west of the coast of France, one off the Scottish coast, one 40 miles north-west of Land's End, one in the middle of the Irish Sea, and one in the River Mersey.  Of the nine Irish vessels sunk since the beginning of the war, two sank within a radius of 20 or 30 miles from our coast.  Three sank in or near British ports, and two in the Atlantic some 100 miles west of the French coast.  The exact places where the other two vessels sank are not known.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(5)  Seven of the ten attacks on Irish ships were made from the air.  In two of these seven cases the vessel concerned was machine-gunned as well as bombed.  I have received no specific charge that in any case the crew were machine-gunned while actually in their boats escaping from the ship, but in one case the Master of the vessel reported that four machine-gun attacks were made on his ship and one of these took place after the order to take to the boats had been given and while the crew were carrying it out.  In all but one of these seven air attacks, the markings of the attacking aircraft were <Col N="2320" /> identified as German.  It is right to say, however, that I have also received reports of cases in which German aircraft have circled and examined Irish ships at sea without attacking them.</P>
    <P>(6)  The loss of Irish lives and the sinking of Irish ships have naturally occasioned feelings of resentment here which we have not failed to voice, through the official channel, to the Governments concerned.  In every case in which the circumstances enabled us to do so, we have protested, lodged a claim for compensation and reserved all the rights to which we are entitled by International law.</P>
    <P>(7)  It is well, however, that we should be clear as to the position in this regard.  On the 17th August last the German Government declared a large area of sea around Britain to be a scene of warlike operations at sea and in the air, and announced that shipping operating in this area exposed itself to destruction.  The validity of this type of general declaration was challenged by neutrals in the last war, and it is a matter in which we, as a neutral in this war, reserve all our rights.  We must remember, however, that in the past, many States found that the only effective remedy against the danger to their shipping resulting from blockades was to prohibit their ships from sailing to the blockaded ports, or at least to warn them that, if they tried to enter them, they did so at their own risk.  Even in the present war certain neutrals, including great Powers, have taken the same step rather than incur the risks which the operation of their shipping in the waters round these islands would involve. For us such a course is not practicable, but there is no good in blinding ourselves to the fact that, by not taking it, we incur the risks against which other States, even great Powers, have taken the precautions to which I have referred as the effective remedy.</P>
    <P>(8)  As regards the question of defensive armament on our ships, the Government is not satisfied that the advantages of installing defensive  on Irish ships would outweigh <Col N="2321" /> the disadvantages.  There would be considerable risk that the arming of Irish ships, far from obviating such incidents as have occurred, would tend to make them more frequent, thereby increasing the danger to Irish life and property.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the Minister's reply, leaving aside for the moment the international problem created by raising the question of the legitimacy of bombing neutral ships upon the high seas, does the Minister not appreciate that the machine-gunning of our sailors when they are abandoning the ship and taking to the boats is an entirely different kind of crime, done apparently for the sole purpose of murdering men who are going on their legitimate business, and does it not merit a very different kind of protest from that which would ordinarily be made about the sinking of a ship without loss of life?  Secondly, has the Minister's attention also been directed to the fact that, if certain German aeroplanes have circled our ships and gone away, others have insolently come down, recognised our national flag upon the ship, and then, tearing the wireless aerial off the ship with its undercarriage, have proceeded to bomb and attack the vessel?</P>

      <P>The Deputy has been a member of two previous administrations and he knows as well as I do that financial procedure does not permit an Estimate to provide for expenditure under a statute which has not been passed by the House.  The main volume of Estimates for the year 1940-41 was introduced and I think a Vote on Account had been taken before the Unemployment Assistance (Amendment) Act, 1940, became law. Accordingly, any expenditure to be incurred under that Act could not have been brought within the original Estimate.</P>

      <P>That a sum not exceeding £924 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st March, 1941, to repay to the Contingency Fund certain Miscellaneous Advances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the House is aware, this Vote, which is taken towards the close of the year, is required to enable repayment to be made to the Contingency Fund of any moneys advanced from it since its replenishment the preceding year, other than advances for services covered by and recouped out of other Votes.  In the past year, up to the time of preparation of this Estimate, no advances had been made from the fund to other Votes.  The purposes for which the money covered by the present Estimate was needed are stated in Part III of the Estimate. There are only two items, namely (1) stamp duty remitted on deeds and other instruments for public Departments, and (2) triplets bounty, both of <Col N="2331" /> which are hardy annuals, being featured in this Vote every year.</P>
    <P>Nearly all the requirement of £923 8s. 6d. is in respect of the remissions of stamp duty.  It is a practice of long standing of the Revenue Commissioners, when dealing with deeds and other instruments for public Departments, to stamp them without insisting on payment of duty at the time; but as there is no power to remit such duty, which is imposed by statute, the amount is made good to the Revenue Commissioners from the Contingency Fund.  This is handier than if each Department concerned made separate provision in its own Vote. The Department of Lands and the Department of Education present the majority of the instruments for stamping, the former in connection with lettings and the acquisition of land for forestry purposes, the latter in connection with agreements between the Minister for Education and authors and between the managers and teachers of national schools.  The triplets bounty item of £15 represents five bounties of £3 each.</P>

    <P>That a Supplementary sum not exceeding £454,229 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending 31st March, 1941, for the Army and the Army Reserve (including certain Grants-in-Aid) under the Defence Forces (Temporary Provisions) Acts, and for certain administrative Expenses in connection therewith; for the Expenses of the Office of the Minister for the Coordination of Defensive Measures for Expenses in connection with the trial and detention of certain persons (No. 28 of 1939, No. 1 of 1940 and No. 16 of 1940); for certain Expenses under the Offences against the State Acts, 1939 and 1940 (No. 13 of 1939 and No. 2 of 1940) and the Air-raid Precautions Act, 1939 (No. 21 of 1939); for Reserve Medical Supplies for Civilian Hospitals; and for certain Expenses of the Local Defence Force (including Grants-in-Aid) (No. 28 of 1939).</P>
    <P>This, the second Supplementary Estimate for the Army Vote for the financial year ending on March 31st, 1941, is being introduced partly because it is necessary to regularise and provide for the new Local Defence Force, and partly because expenditure in other directions on the Army proper will be greater than was anticipated last November when the Dáil passed the first Supplementary Estimate for the Army Vote.</P>
    <P>The Local Security Force, Group A, ceased to exist as from January 1st, 1941, and from that date became known as the Local Defence Force.  All expenditure on the Local Security Force up to January 1st was borne on a Vote administered by the Department of Justice, and the present Estimate provides for all expenditure on <Col N="2333" /> the Local Defence Force for the period January 1st-March 31st, 1941.</P>
    <P>As regards Capitation Grants, it is necessary to explain that it is proposed to make each district fund a yearly Grant-in-Aid of £1 in respect of each member of the force in that district. The initial grant for which this Estimate provides will be made in respect of members who are certified to have been enrolled on or before 31st December, 1940, and not to have resigned on or before January 31st, 1941.  From the funds thus made available, the districts will meet current expenses such as postage, stationery, the hire of halls, etc.  Such grants have already been made before the transfer of the force to the Army, and it is provided that where such grants have been made they shall be taken into consideration in assessing the amounts payable to each district.</P>
    <P>Apart from this expenditure on the Local Defence Force, it is necessary to ask the Dáil's authority for increased expenditure under nine sub-heads of the Vote.  The increase under four of those sub-heads for the pay of civilians and officiating clergymen, for barrack maintenance and for telegrams and telephones is mainly due to an increase in the number of posts held by the Army: the increased amount required for clothing and barrack services is principally due to the continuous expansion of the Army.  The increase for provisions under sub-head K is mainly due to the rise in the cost of foodstuffs, and the increase in the cost of transport vessels is due to overhauls. Provision has also been made for a reserve supply of petrol and oils.</P>
    <P>The total amount under the various sub-heads which the Dáil is asked to approve in this Estimate is £747,531, but from this sum there must be deducted the sum of £293,302 which is expected to be saved on other sub-heads of the Vote from the total net amount of £6,454,601 already voted. The net sum to be voted in this Estimate is, therefore, £454,229 and for the year £6,908,830.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The appearance of these Supplementary Estimates for the Army <Col N="2334" /> constitutes a considerable shock to every conservative financier in this country.  I do not mind admitting that when I saw them they constituted a very considerable shock to myself. Nevertheless, I believe it is the essence of financial wisdom to provide whatever money may be necessary, however and wherever we can, to ensure that the defences of this country will be as adequate as we can make them to meet any contingency that may arise. It would be the height of folly to save money for an invader to collect.  We should look forward to the future, quite calmly and deliberately resolved that if any invader infringes the sovereignty of this soil, all we have will be spent by the Irish people in defending this soil until the invader is put out or the last Irishman is dead. Now, the knowledge that that view is pretty generally held by all sections in this country should not, and I trust will not, induce the Minister for Defence to relax his tedious vigilance, to ensure that money freely given for this purpose is not recklessly or extravagantly spent.  Mind you, in these circumstances it is very easy to waste money and the more economically and carefully every penny is spent, the stronger our ultimate resistance will be to any attempt to overcome it. Every £ that is wasted now by the Army finance authorities is a £ withheld from the defence of this country and a period of time withdrawn from the total measure of resistance upon which we must depend to preserve the integrity of this State. That is a very important aspect of this question, because people are inclined to say: &ldquo;Oh let us not be too hard on them; there is waste here and there, but sure they are about good work.&rdquo;  We must keep in mind that waste would be as foolish as niggardliness in appropriation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If general agreement is secured on that proposition we have then to provide against a further danger.  I have often felt, and I think many of my colleagues have felt also, that there was a great deal of petrol &ldquo;sloshed&rdquo; about by the Army that might have been saved.  I think that is possibly true, but I have often been reluctant <Col N="2335" /> to dwell unduly on that because I think it is also true that whereas at one post you may have a lorry run up and down six times to a village which may be seven or eight miles distant to get grocery supplies which could have been fetched in one trip had a little foresight been exercised, at another post you will find a highly paid and a highly skilled officer, sitting twiddling his thumbs, waiting to go to cover a job 20 or 30 miles away because they cannot find any other officer travelling there to put into the car with him, so that two men will travel instead of one. These are two extremes of folly between which we should steer a middle course.  Civilians have got to recognise that to steer that middle course may not be as easy as it sounds. I think the Army authorities know that all the difficulties with which they are confronted are receiving, and will receive, sympathetic consideration from those of us who are charged with public responsibility, but they must also know that it is the duty of the civil power in the State to ensure that the funds placed at the disposal of the Army authorities by the civil power will be used to the best advantage and that ceaseless vigilance to that end will be maintained, that the Department of the Comptroller and Auditor-General and the Public Accounts Committee of this House, will scan the accounts of the Army with the same care in respect of this year as they did in any other year, and that, bearing in mind all the special difficulties and special problems, there will be no lumping of the accounts nor a complete disregard of factors which might suggest that a greater prudence would have effected a saving which would have contributed to the successful defence of the country.</P>
    <P>This is a free country, and I am happy to say that I belong to a free Party, in which we agree on fundamentals and cheerfully disagree on details.  There has been criticism, by some of my colleagues, of the Local Defence Force uniform and that is a matter on which every man has his own view.  I do not agree with it, as I think the Local Defence Force <Col N="2336" /> uniform is excellent and is a useful and utilitarian one.  It is not its primary duty to fascinate the ladies, but that is not what it was meant for.  It was meant to be the most appropriate, the most serviceable and readily available uniform, to mark out those men who had the courage to offer their services to the country as soldiers of this State. In that connection, I should like to say that it has been suggested in certain quarters that, owing to the fact that the fabric from which this uniform is manufactured is a light-weight fabric and that individual members of the Local Defence Force very prudently have worn their clothes or part of their ordinary clothes under the uniform, this circumstance might justify an invader in treating persons appearing in the Local Defence Force uniform with their clothes underneath as <i>francs-tireurs.</i></P>
    <P>Such a suggestion is preposterous, and any person labouring under that misapprehension ought to put it out of his mind forthwith.  Any person belonging to a unit of the Local Defence Force is, in time of war, brought under the control of the Chief of Staff of the Army of this State and is entitled to all the protection afforded by international law to a regular soldier of any foreign State in the world.  If captured by an enemy, he must be treated as a prisoner of war.  Any State failing so to treat him would find their prisoners of war dealt with as <i>francs-tireurs,</i> that is, if they attempted to treat the members of our Local Defence Force as anything else but regular soldiers of the State serving in accordance with the provisions of recognised international law controlling such matters.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister for Defence, in connection with sub-head D.&mdash;which deals with chaplains&mdash; whether the question has ever been raised with the ecclesiastical authorities as to the desirability&mdash;particularly in times like these, when there has been so marked an expansion of the Army&mdash;of providing for the Army a full complement of chaplains wearing uniform and belonging to the Army, as is the case in most other regular armies <Col N="2337" /> of the world.  I do not suppose that this is a matter upon which laymen can venture to express too strong an opinion, and I suppose it is prudent and discreet to preface anything one wishes to say by emphasising that it is all subject to episcopal approval.  I suppose it is permitted to a layman, however, to have a preference, even if it subsequently appears that the episcopal view differs and that his preference, therefore, is a mistaken one. Of course, there are two sides to all spiritual relations.  If there is a spiritual father in the priesthood there must be spiritual sons in the laity and, speaking with all filial respect as a son under that relationship, I think there is a great deal to be said&mdash;where you have a large body of serving regular soldiers&mdash;for having chaplains permanently attached to them the same as the ordinary chaplains are.</P>
    <P>I remember meeting the Army chaplain in the barracks in Cork when I was privileged to inspect the defences of that part of the country, in company with the Minister for Defence and other Ministers last summer.  We have all met chaplains in the British Army, wearing the uniform and obviously partaking in the daily life of the men, whose problems it was their concern to deal with.  There may be some reason, that we laymen do not appreciate, why that arrangement is not desirable here.  If there is, well and good; but if there is not, I would be glad to hear from the Minister whether he has deemed it expedient to discuss this matter with the ecclesiastical authorities.  I may assure him that, if he is ever in a position to say that he has done so and that, as a result of his discussion, he has secured the services of full-time chaplains who will wear the uniform of the State and mingle in the Army life, a very valuable service will have been done to the State and, possibly, to the Church as well.</P>
    <P>Subject to these observations, I do not propose to go further into the matters covered by these sub-heads.  However, I would like, when the Minister is replying, a specific assurance that, <Col N="2338" /> in so far as is consistent with the efficient working of our defence measures, limited economy will be imposed upon those who are disbursing the very substantial sums which we are now placing at their disposal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one item which I should like to mention, under the question of allowances.  I wrote to the Minister some months ago about the case of a soldier who was killed going from Mallow to Cork in November, 1939.  He left a wife and five young children after him, and since he was killed they have not got a penny in compensation from the authorities. The last letter from the Department was to the effect that the woman was now in receipt of a widow's pension and that it was more or less expected that she was not in any great financial distress.  A case of that kind&mdash;where a woman loses her husband while he is in the Army, in an accident to a motor lorry travelling from Mallow to Cork, and gets no compensation so far from the State&mdash;reacts very badly on the whole spirit of loyalty of both the civil population and the members of the Army.  I should like to know if the Minister has any reference to make to that particular case, as the solicitor who has been in touch with the matter since has asked me to see if there is any way of expediting a decision. What is the cause of the delay since November, 1939?  I would like to know if there is anything the Minister can do in cases of this kind.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCann</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to take the opportunity on this Estimate to pay a tribute to the bearing and discipline of the Local Defence Force generally. There are also one or two questions I should like to put to the Minister in connection with the Local Defence Force.  Firstly, I am of opinion that £1 <i>per capita</i> is not sufficient for the members of the Local Defence Force. I would like to know if he would go into the question and try to increase that grant.  I know that, in some groups, at any rate, they are paying as much as 15/- for a pair of boots and the members also are getting a waterproof cape which will come to something <Col N="2339" /> like 12/6.  They will have to find the difference between £1 and something like 27/6.  In Dublin, at any rate, we have a number of men in the Local Defence Force who are very poorly off and this £1 grant did not come before its time.  In the recent very bad weather, we had some unfortunate men who could not go out on parade because they had no boots.  Apart from that, they have no overcoats now.  The Minister should look into that and see if it is not possible to increase that grant, so that the more needy members of the Local Defence Force will be made comfortable&mdash;at any rate, while they are engaged in this service.</P>
      <P>I would also like to hear the Minister's intentions regarding the funds, if any, accumulated by some groups.  What will be the disposition of those funds now and in the future? Will they be taken over by the Army authorities or will any sum that now is in the hands of any particular group be left to that group?  Also, is it the Minister's intention to compensate a member or members of the Local Defence Force who might meet with a serious accident while on parade?  I have a particular case in mind&mdash; probably the Minister knows about it&mdash; where a man actually met with a pretty serious accident and spent a couple of months out of work, and where his family is in a pretty bad way on that account.  I should like the Minister to keep that man's case in mind, and I should also like to know if there is anything that can be done about such a case.  If the Minister has not power to deal with such a case, perhaps he will seek powers to enable him to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. A. Byrne Mr. A. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I had intended to raise the same point that the previous speaker has raised.  I am aware of the fact that a number of unemployed men who joined up with the Local Defence Force have been seen with very bad boots and without raincoats during the very heavy and bad weather that has just passed and some were unable to parade because of that; a number of them were without overcoats, and I think that these men who <Col N="2340" /> answered their country's call should get further consideration from the Minister.  There is another point upon which I wish to touch.  I wish to avail of this opportunity to pay a tribute, a tribute of the whole House indeed, to that very gallant man from the west, Corporal Cooney, who gave his life during Christmas week in trying to save others, when a motor car went into the canal.  I agree with Deputy Hickey in the point he has made when he mentioned a case in Cork where a man was killed and his widow and family were left totally unprovided for.  I should be anxious to hear from the Minister that, in the case of such a man as Corporal Cooney, to whom I have referred, and the young bandsman who risked his life on the same occasion, some tribute would be paid to actions such as theirs.</P>
      <P>Corporal Cooney was a Mayoman, and we in Dublin are very pleased and gratified and appreciate to the full that we have men such as he prepared to take such a risk when these accidents occur, but we do feel that a Government authority should provide for the widow and the mother in such cases. This young man, Corporal Cooney, gave up all thought of everything except the danger that he saw for others.  He had a young wife&mdash;he had only been married a week&mdash;and he gave up his life.  I think it was one of the bravest acts that I have heard of in this country for many years.  The man was unable to swim and yet, with that knowledge, he went into the canal on a cold, frosty night to try to save other lives, and I understand that, when holding on to a rope, he passed a remark to his comrade: &ldquo;Well, if this rope goes, I shall go to glory.&rdquo;  He was not thinking of his own life.  Accordingly, I appeal to the Minister to use his personal influence, his ability, and the great sympathy and admiration that I know he has, as we all have, to do whatever can be done in this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnLymbrickEsmonde" hpid="Mr. Esmonde Mr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>There are one or two points I should like to raise: first of all, in connection with the point already raised by Deputy Hickey, because I know of other cases similar <Col N="2341" /> to that, where a member of the Defence Forces has lost his life and there does not seem to be any provision for compensation for his dependents. We all know that in all forms of employment now the Workmen's Compensation Act applies, and there is a statutory right of employees to obtain redress in the case of accidents and a statutory right of the relatives of deceased employees to obtain redress. I do not know what conditions exist in the administration of the Army in that connection, but I do know of the case of a man who fell off a railway bridge on which he had been working in the course of his duty as a member of the Defence Forces and, so far, his widow has not been compensated. I am aware of other cases also, and I do know that that sort of thing is creating a bad impression in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second point to which I would like to refer is the question of the enlistment of married men.  There seems to be a general sort of confusion in the minds of the people down the country&mdash;in my constituency, at any rate, and in a particular area of my constituency&mdash;as to whether or not the Army are accepting for enlistment men who are already married.  I have a concrete case in mind, particulars of which I am sending to the Minister. I have the particulars here in a letter. This is the case of a former non-commissioned officer of the Army, with several years' service in the Army. Assuming that, as a matter of course, he had only to go up to the Curragh and present himself there to be accepted as a useful member of the Defence Forces, whether as a non-commissioned officer or even as a private, he sold the tools of his trade, went to a certain amount of expense in obtaining references and certificates of his age and the ages of his children and so on, and as an earnest of his intention to enlist he bought a single ticket to the Curragh and also incurred certain expenses in putting up at a hotel there for the night.  When he arrived there and presented himself to the appropriate official, he was told that his references and certificates were of no earthly use to him because <Col N="2342" /> he was a married man.  Now, there may be a rule not to accept married men in the Army, but if that is not so I think it would be foolish to refuse to accept the services of a man who was already fully trained, and not only fully trained but holding the rank and experience of a non-commissioned officer.  The people in the district who are interested in this case would like to know whether it is the policy of the Department of Defence or of the Minister to refuse for enlistment men who are already married because, if that is so, the sooner the public know it the better, and naturally, a case like that, where a private individual such as this man, an ordinary working man, sold the tools of his trade and incurred £2 or £3 in expenses in order to enlist, would not occur again.</P>
    <P>With regard to the point raised by Deputy Dillon, as to appointing chaplains to the Army and putting them into uniform, if I were to express an opinion on that point I should say that it would be highly undesirable to make a change from the present system.  Putting our chaplains into uniform would be the same as making them part of expeditionary forces, accompanying the forces as part of the battle order, and I think that if there is an emergency in this country there are plenty who would come forward to do their duty, uniform or no uniform. I do not think we should put ourselves on the footing that we are actually a nation at war.  It would be better to create the impression and continue the impression that we are a nation ready to defend ourselves but not at war.</P>
    <P>I should like to take this opportunity of paying a tribute, so far as an outsider can see, to the high state of efficiency and morale existing among our troops.  I have had the opportunity of seeing them in different places and on different occasions.  I met them and spoke with them, and if the occasion arises I have no hesitation in saying that they will be able to give as good an account of themselves as the army of any other nation in the world.</P>
    <P>There was an excellent entertainment <Col N="2343" /> produced by the Army at one of the theatres in Dublin, &ldquo;The Roll of the Drum.&rdquo;  It was also produced at other centres and reflected great credit upon members of the Defence Forces. Representations of historic scenes went back for generations, even to Fontenoy, and the attention given to detail and historical facts could not be surpassed. That production had a most excellent effect in Dublin.  I was present at a performance in the theatre where the audience was composed of people of every blend of political thought.  It would be an excellent thing if that entertainment could be sent to other parts of the country.  I am sure that it would not result in any financial loss to the State, as it would attract big audiences.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Minister for Defence (Mr. Traynor) Oscar Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Traynor)</NameTxt>
      <P>I think every Deputy of the House will agree with Deputy Dillon in his general opening remarks, and will also agree with him in his mild criticism regarding the control of expenditure in respect to the use of transport or the excessive use of petrol.  I can assure the Deputy and the House that as to the present use of petrol there is a most stringent form of inspection regarding the use of transport of any description in the Army.  It is quite impossible now for a car to be used for any purpose other than that for which it is strictly officially reserved.  I can also say that even in the past it was pretty difficult to have anything in the nature of what might be regarded as the irresponsible use of cars.  It is quite possible that in the past, and before the recent grave shortage of petrol, greater use was made of army transport to bring detachments of troops to various posts.  We are not doing that now.  If the posts are fairly convenient the men are marched to them.  In fact they are marched up to five or six miles, but whether that is wise or not is another matter.  Possibly we might err by going too far in that direction.  I can assure the House that the use of transport is strictly supervised right down from the highest to the lowest ranks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of the Local Defence <Col N="2344" /> Force uniforms is one about which I did not hear anything that might be regarded as a grave complaint.  The only complaint I heard was that the uniform was not waterproof.  It is quite true that it is not waterproof, but the uniform was got in great haste and we were facing a period when we doubted very much if the uniform would be ready for the Local Defence Force.  I am afraid it is not possible at present, but I should like to see the men dressed in a more substantial uniform than they have.  The uniform itself is all right, being the battle type of uniform, but if, as Deputy Dillon suggested, it is not designed to catch the eyes of the ladies, its utility no one will dispute.</P>
    <P>As to the question concerning chaplains raised by Deputy Dillon, strange to say I raised that question myself this week and the matter is under discussion. We hope in the very near future to have some decision come to, whereby we can have chaplains in an emergency travelling with battalions of the various commands.  One chaplain is at present wearing the uniform. Every chaplain, if he so desires, may wear the uniform but, as far as I know, only one chaplain is now doing so.</P>
    <P>Coming to the question raised by Deputy Hickey, to answer it accurately, or as the Deputy would like, would require some notice.  My memory of the particular case is that this unfortunate man was not on duty, being, in fact, on leave.  If that is so it raises a totally new aspect of the case, and, as far as I understand, his widow would not be entitled to any compensation whatsoever.</P>

      <P>Referring to the point raised by Deputy McCann as to the Capitation Grant of £1 per head, it is not necessarily intended that each member of the group will go out and benefit to the extent of that £1.  That is not the idea behind it.  It is believed that very large numbers of the Local Defence Force would not desire to participate in the Capitation Grant, and in that way it is hoped there will be a fairly large surplus of money, plus funds which were collected voluntarily. Large amounts of money have been secured as a result of concerts, dances, whist drives and entertainments of that kind.  These funds will be held by Local Defence Force groups until March 31st of this year.  They can be put to uses of the kind that the Deputy has in mind&mdash;the purchasing of boots for people who appear to be in necessitous circumstances, or the purchasing of a raincoat or something like that. After the 31st March, these funds will be taken in charge by the defence forces proper.  They will be accounted for and audited and the expenditure will be under the supervision of the Army authorities.  All the debts of these groups, if they are debts which have been incurred in a legal way, will be met.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>The initiation of entertainments will still of course be in the hands of the groups, but the funds so secured will have to be accounted for officially by the Army.  That is the only difference.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>I think so.  The funds will augment the Capitation Grant, and these things which are needed for men in necessitous circumstances can still be secured.  As to compensation for accidents, I am not certain of this, but I do not think that at present any man can be compensated for an accident in which he is involved.  However, we are looking into the matter. If the question of being called out on active service should arise, of course they will be treated as members of the Defence Forces and will naturally partake of all the benefits which the ordinary soldier enjoys.</P>

As to the case he mentioned about the man going to the Curragh, all I can say is that the man did not use very much foresight in taking the action he appears to have taken, selling his tools, and acting as if he were the sole judge of whether he should get into the Defence Forces or not.  Apart from anything else, it is possible that the man might be rejected for medical reasons.</P>

      <P>I am only referring to the unwisdom of what he did.  As to the marriage allowance, that is only given to people who were married before 1st July last.  We are endeavouring to put that date as far forward as possible in order to bring in large numbers of men who were married immediately after they joined the Army.  In order to make the case as strong as it was possible to make it we had to decide that after a certain date we would not take in any more married men.  Married men on unemployment assistance are a very heavy burden if they have a large number in family.  The same applies in the Army. Therefore, we had to decide, in order to make a strong effort with the Finance Department to have the date extended, not to take in any more married men.</P>

I can assure the Deputy that, if we can get this regulation I have mentioned passed, I will do what is possible to have her brought within the scope of the extension. Whether that is possible or not, I cannot say.  In regard to the Army proper, I think I can assure the House that everything possible is being done to bring it up to that high state of efficiency at which we would all like to see it.  The young men who have recently come in as officers have been undergoing an intensive course of training at the Curragh.  When they come out they undergo an intensive practical course in their units.  They have been given responsibilities which they would not ordinarily be given for a very much longer period.  The morale of the officers and men is, in my opinion, at the highest possible point.  The general feeling throughout the Army is that the freedom of this nation, if it is assailed by any other nation, will be defended in a way which will surprise the aggressor, and that the freedom which we have won after such long and arduous years will be retained.</P>

On the <Col N="2351" /> Second Stage, as Deputies know, they may discuss not only what is in a Bill, but what they would like to see in it.

Therefore, for any lacuna of deficiencies that there may be in it, we have got to look to the Minister to make them up, because it is now too late to alter the Bill itself.  If he is going to supply those deficiencies then, in my submission, he should proceed to equip himself to do so without further delay. The first step towards that end that I would suggest to him would be to go over to Glasgow and there visit a holy nun who is at present operating a children's clinic.  I suggest to him that he should go over to see how it is being operated, see the work it is doing, see how it is co-operating with the police courts, see how it is abating a large proportion of the evils associated with the administration of the Children Acts in Great Britain, and see the measure of appreciation that that nun's work has won from the Government Departments in England.</P>

      <P>That is really all I have to say.  I am simply asking that the Minister should go over to Glasgow and see there for himself the ancillary activities that are rendering the Children Acts in that area a success. If he does, I think he will come back with special equipment to administer this measure with results that we could not possibly hope for if he attempts to administer it with the information which, judging from his observations on other stages of this Bill, he at present has in respect to the whole problem of juvenile delinquents.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hurley</NameTxt>
      <P>Under Section 4 of this Bill, the Minister is given power to make regulations describing the remuneration of officers in certified schools as laid down in the section.  I take it that applies to the teachers in those schools.  I do not know what other interpretations could be put on it.  I should like to know if the section gives the Minister power to make regulations with regard to the conditions of employment in those schools, because in one big school here&mdash; Artane&mdash;the conditions of employment for teachers are shocking.  Those men work there from six o'clock in the morning until half past nine at night without a break.  They start at £1 a week, all found.  There is a regulation that if they get married they have to leave the service.  I hope that when the Minister comes to lay down conditions under this section, he will see that that scandal will no longer obtain in that school.  There are six men employed there.  One of them has 30 years' service, and has now the magnificient sum of £2 5s. 0d. a week.  I hope the Minister will take steps speedily to end that state of affairs, and see to it that something approaching Christian conditions will obtain in that school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think I am correct in saying that this section refers to the people I have mentioned.  If so, I would strongly impress on the Minister to see that that scandal is ended.  I was not aware&mdash;I am sure many members of the House were not aware, and I am certain the public were not aware&mdash;of <Col N="2353" /> the conditions obtaining in those schools.  The wage scale of those men is extremely low, so low that it is not comparable with any other scale that I know of.  They are not free for a single day in the week.  They are all the time on duty from 6 a.m. until 9.30 p.m.  I ask the Minister to see that that state of affairs is ended immediately. I desire to say that I shall take occasion to raise this matter again in the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Deputy Hurley is aware of the fact that we had in preparation a scheme for taking in teachers of literary subjects under the Primary Branch, Office of Education. These proposals are in abeyance for the time being, owing to the emergency. A considerable sum of money would be required to carry out this very necessary reform.  I am not in a position to carry it out at present, because, as has already been explained to the House, it is not possible, owing to the financial stringency, to make the necessary provision to do so.  I very much regret that these teachers, many of whom have given long and devoted service, cannot have the benefit of this scheme, but it is one of the disadvantages of the present position in educational matters, as I have said on more than one occasion in the House, that reform is bound up closely with the provision of the necessary finances, and if we can carry on our existing educational services without having to effect greater economies than we have so far effected, I think we will be doing very well, indeed, while the emergency lasts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The regulations under Section 4 were not intended to cover this matter of the recognition of teachers of literary subjects.  The intention was that regulations regarding the medical inspection and proper care of the children confined in these schools should be made according to them. However, I will look into the matter, but I fail to see what can be done, because the position in which the schools are is such that if I call their attention, as Deputy Hurley would <Col N="2354" /> have me do, to the necessity for improving the conditions of their employees, I will naturally be told that costs are rising in connection with the running of these institutions, that, as a matter of fact, they are running on a narrower margin, if not at a loss, in a great many cases, than before the war started and that it would be quite impossible for them to do so, so that again it comes back to a question of providing finances from Government sources.</P>
    <P>The matter raised by Deputy Dillon was discussed at length yesterday.  I would be very glad indeed to get any information I can which will tend to improve the treatment of juvenile offenders.  I am not quite sure that the conditions in Dublin are even like those in Glasgow.  I think there is probably a great deal more juvenile crime in cities across the water than here, but the matter concerns medical administration to a great extent also.  We have medical inspection of schools and any question which arises with regard, for example, to the treatment of mental disease, even in young people, would seem to be a matter for the Department of Local Government.  I am not losing sight of the matter and if anything can be done, we shall certainly try to do it, but, as I have said, I do not think the time is suitable, unfortunately, for making reforms which we should all like to make and which would be very desirable, but for which moneys have to be provided which at the moment are urgently needed for other purposes.  I do not know, either, what the trend of events in the future in that regard will be.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JeremiahHurley" hpid="Mr. Hurley Mr. Hurley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hurley</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Minister if the Conditions of Employment Act, or any of the similar Acts, could be usefully applied to such a place as the school at Artane in order to amend the scandal of the intolerably long hours which these people work?  The Minister tells me that he has no power under this section, but surely there should be some power to end that state of affairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyLinehan" hpid="Mr. Linehan Mr. Linehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Linehan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has made a very fine case for the juvenile courts <Col N="2355" /> so far as they apply to the City of Dublin.  I am aware of the good work done there; I am aware of the way the courts are operated, and of the good work of the probation officers. Would the Minister, at some future date, consider applying the same procedure to the country courts?  I think the Minister will agree with me when I say that, in the district courts in the country, unless the justice is a man with sufficient social outlook to understand that it should not be so, cases affecting children are tried in open court.  It merely depends on the individual justice.  The reason I raise this matter is that, since the Second Reading, I have seen one case where a father was charged with assault on a child and, based on the conviction in that case, the child was sent to an industrial school.  I think that even that case should not have been tried in open court because it showed everybody in the district the status of that unfortunate family and the fact that the child was being sent to an industrial school because the father was not a fit person to look after him.  If the Minister, at some future date, would extend the very good system in operation in Dublin to the district courts in the country he would be doing a great work.  Tributes have been paid, and rightly so, to the district courts in Dublin, but there is nothing to prevent a case affecting a child being heard in open court in the country, unless the child is actually prosecuted, and children may be just as much affected by a charge brought against their parents as by a charge brought against themselves.  Would the Minister consider adopting the Dublin system in respect of courts in the country?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Deputy mean that children's cases are heard in public?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyLinehan" hpid="Mr. Linehan Mr. Linehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Linehan</NameTxt>
      <P>No, not quite that, but there are cases affecting children in the country which could usefully be heard <i>in camera,</i> and a case in which a father or mother is concerned may have as bad an effect on children and on the reputations of the family as a <Col N="2356" /> case in which they are concerned themselves. I suggest that justices in Dublin go a little farther than they are entitled to by hearing these cases <i>in camera,</i> but only in very rare cases in the country do the justices do more than they are barely required to do. Matters will arise which may be detrimental to a child's outlook on life and these things will be publicised in the country papers and I suggest that that should not be so.  My second point, which may be slightly irrelevant, is: Would the Minister consider doing something to prevent children of tender years being sworn in open court?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>Are these points not really matters for the Department of Justice?  I know that that Department is at present examining closely the whole question of children's courts with a view to improving the existing system in every way possible.  I am not quite clear how what the Deputy suggests with regard to parents could be carried out, because, presumably, the conviction of any parent, no matter what the type of case, affects&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyLinehan" hpid="Mr. Linehan Mr. Linehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Linehan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister misunderstands me.  May I put this case of which I have personal knowledge? A father&mdash;the mother is dead&mdash;happens to be inclined to take too much liquor and he was charged by the Guards with an assault on the child.  He was convicted, and the conviction is a basis for taking the child from him. Unfortunately, before he is convicted, because there is a charge against the father, that child of seven or eight years is brought into court to give evidence against the father in front of the usual admiring multitude which is to be found in country courts.  A child of tender years should not be put on oath and exposed to the smiles of the gallery in country courts.  The reason I raise the matter now is to ask the Minister for Education, whose duty it is to look after young people, to catch the Minister for Justice as quickly as possible and make him see that the laws which are administered by his Department are amended in such a way as to bring about the situation which <Col N="2357" /> the Minister, as well as I, would like to see.</P>

    <Title>Private Deputies' Business. - Relief of Local Rates&mdash;Motion.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That the Dáil is of opinion that in order to reduce the heavy burden on local rates it is essential that all roads and hospitals which are at present maintained by the local authorities should be made a national charge.</P>
      <P>This motion was put on the Order Paper nearly two years ago, and a good many things have happened since which, to a certain extent, have altered the circumstances which weighed with the proposer and seconder of it.  Nevertheless, I do not think they have altered to such an extent as to necessitate the withdrawal of the motion.  I know that the chief source of income contemplated for road making when this motion was framed&mdash;road tax and licence duty on cars&mdash;has been very seriously jeopardised.  I know also that the chief source of income for the maintenance of hospitals&mdash;the Hospitals Trust Fund&mdash;has been greatly reduced since this motion was put down.  This motion, however, puts forward a proposal for permanent reform in our entire system of administration.  As permanent reform is needed and as the circumstances which prevail at present must be regarded as transient, this motion should be carefully considered by the House.  The whole question raised by the motion is whether the services relating to roads and hospital institutions are local or not.  I, definitely, hold that both road services and hospital services are national in every sense of the word.  We know that road traffic circulates from one end of the country to the other.  It may not move as quickly now as it did heretofore but it passes through different districts. Why a particular district should have to maintain roads in that district which are used by citizens of the entire State, I have never been able to understand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the State is to take over the maintenance of the roads, it may be asked <Col N="2358" /> what system of financing the work will be put in force.  I think that any reasonable person will agree that the most equitable system of maintaining any system of communications, or transport, is to charge the users of that system with the entire cost.  As the roads are being used by various types of vehicle&mdash;mechanically propelled and otherwise&mdash;the owners of such vehicles, and they alone, should finance the maintenance of these roads.  We know that the railways were built by private companies and that they have been financed and maintained out of revenue collected from the users.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyLinehan" hpid="Mr. Linehan Mr. Linehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Linehan</NameTxt>
      <P>And by reduction of the shareholders' capital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is true.  The fundamental principle on which the railways were established was that the users of the railway service should maintain that service.  We are asking that the same system should prevail in regard to the roads.  That can be brought about only by nationalising the entire road system.  It would not be possible for local bodies to impose any form of levy or tax in their own areas upon the local road-users.  Therefore, the revenue required for the maintenance of the roads must be collected by the central authority.  Up to this year, one type of road-users&mdash;the motorists&mdash;were contributing more than sufficient to maintain the entire road system.  The contribution of motorists through road tax, petrol and other duties amounted, I think, to over £3,000,000.  So far as I can ascertain, the entire cost of road maintenance does not exceed £1,700,000 per year. There is, therefore, a very wide margin between the amount contributed by one section of road-users and the amount required for road maintenance. In these circumstances, the financing of this proposal would not offer any great difficulty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It may be asked: what are the advantages of centralising control of the roads?  The first advantage is that there would be relief of direct taxation upon a heavily taxed section of the community&mdash;the ratepayers.  This raises the question whether national <Col N="2359" /> or local taxation is the more equitable. Anybody who gives a moment's consideration to the question will acknowledge that national taxation is, generally speaking, more equitably divided over all sections of the community than is local taxation, which is based on property-value which may or may not&mdash;and generally does not&mdash;bear any relation to the income of the ratepayer. In support of national control of the roads, we have the fact that the central authority has at its disposal greater resources than any local authority can mobilise.  In a time of national emergency, when great numbers of men in our larger towns and cities may become unemployed, roads, as a source of employment, naturally suggest themselves to the mind of any person who considers the matter. Widespread unemployment resulting from the present emergency and the shortage of supplies to industrial and other undertakings cannot be overlooked by the Government.  It will be necessary to plan&mdash;and plan very boldly and courageously&mdash;to meet that emergency.  One idea which should suggest itself to the Government is that of a big national scheme of road improvement.  It might be necessary&mdash; I think it would be necessary&mdash;to borrow very considerable sums to raise the standards of our roads but it is a work which, I think, should be undertaken in order to tide the nation over the present emergency.</P>
    <P>I may mention that in the Report of the Banking Commission, particularly in the Third Minority Report, certain recommendations were made to the Government which, I think, require very careful consideration, especially at the present moment.  One of the recommendations was that money should be obtained from the Currency Commission to finance works on a big scale, that that money should be raised by the issue of currency on the security of the work to be undertaken. If this State, having taken over the roads, embarks upon a big scheme of road resurfacing and permanent improvement, having regard to the fact that by such work there would <Col N="2360" /> be created in this country a permanent national asset, there is no reason why the Currency Commission should not be empowered to issue currency upon the security of that work, work which I consider would be of permanent national importance.  It may be suggested that roads, no matter how thoroughly they may be resurfaced or reconditioned, are not permanent but, at least, if a certain amount of improvement is effected, you will have roads which can be guaranteed to last for over 20 years.  Therefore, if you are to finance such a scheme by currency issued through the Currency Commission there is no reason why that money should not be repaid over a period of 20 years, and, assuming that the total cost was £10,000,000, it would only amount to £500,000 per year for 20 years.</P>
    <P>The present number of unemployed, particularly men who have been employed in fairly good positions and who have been fairly well paid, under no circumstances can be allowed to remain unemployed.  In a big national scheme of resurfacing and remaking our roads a considerable amount of employment could be given which would tide this country over the present emergency. I would further suggest that the whole scheme of resurfacing and remaking the roads should be based on a five-year plan, that is, the work would be carried out within five years.  In this way, at the end of that five years we would have roads in this country which would be second to none in Europe.</P>
    <P>Again, in connection with the suggestion for the nationalisation of roads, I may point out that in some counties there are very highly efficient county surveyors and if there were a central scheme one of these officials or some of these officials could be placed in charge of the entire road improvement throughout the country and thus you would have all the roads throughout the Twenty-Six Counties brought to a uniform and high standard.  I cannot see any reason why the Minister would refuse to adopt a suggestion of that kind, particularly as it tends to make the system of financing road administration more equitable than it is at <Col N="2361" /> present.  The ordinary ratepayer, living in the rural areas, who contributes the greater portion of the money at the present time for the maintenance and improvement of roads, derives very little advantage from that improvement or maintenance.  He could get on very well even if roads were far inferior to what they are at the present time. There is no reason why the greater portion of the cost of maintaining this service should be placed on his shoulders.</P>
    <P>In regard to hospitals, a considerable amount of money was raised through the Hospitals Sweepstakes and it is my opinion that a very considerable amount of that money which has been spent on the building of new hospital institutions has been wasted owing to the fact that the hospitals throughout the country are under the control of different local bodies.  I believe, before any scheme of hospital improvement was embarked upon, there should have been a detailed inquiry into and a detailed study of the hospital needs of this country.  The idea of making each county a separate, water-tight compartment for hospitalisation was, in my opinion, altogether wrong. Instead of that in the cities and in some of our larger towns we should have a complete hospital centre.  The county boundaries in regard to hospitalisation should have been completely ignored from the outset.  There is absolutely no commonsense or reason behind a system under which a hospital may be built in a certain town and a person living within a quarter of a mile of that town cannot avail of that hospital if he is seriously ill but must be taken a distance of 20 or 30 miles to some other institution.  If the hospitals were under central control we would have a system under which hospitals would be provided in the large centres of population and in addition we would have district or cottage hospitals in the smaller towns but each hospital would serve a radius of equal distance in every direction from the centre in which it was established. No question of county boundaries would be taken into consideration. If that were done, I think there <Col N="2362" /> would be a far more efficient hospital service.</P>
    <P>There are certain types of institutions for particular types of patients such as mental defectives or persons suffering from tuberculosis.  In regard to such institutions, it would be desirable perhaps in some cases to have four or five or six or seven counties grouped together, if the number of patients suffering from a particular disease were not very large.  It would be possible and desirable to have one big institution which would cater for a number of counties.  That, of course, would make for efficiency and would greatly improve our present system under which you have to endeavour to establish a number of different types of hospital in each county, no matter how small that county may be.  That is altogether a wasteful, uneconomic and inefficient system.</P>
    <P>I think, therefore, in the interests of justice to the general taxpayers and ratepayers, in the interests of equitable distribution of the burden of taxation over all citizens of this country and over all sections of the community and in the interests of higher efficiency both in road administration and hospitalisation, the Government should give serious consideration to this motion.  I want particularly to stress the importance of embarking upon a big national scheme of road improvement at the present moment. No time must be lost, I suggest, in providing employment for those who have been thrown out of employment by the present emergency.  By the improvement of roads you would be turning the unemployed of the present moment into a permanent national asset which will be valuable to this country when peace is restored.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyLinehan" hpid="Mr. Linehan Mr. Linehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Linehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I formally second the motion.  Deputy Cogan opened by saying that this motion had been on the Order Paper for two years, but he possibly overlooked the fact that that gave him quite an advantage.  If it lasted for another two years his case would be still stronger, because I think Deputy Cogan must realise, as we all do, that if the cost of main roads and <Col N="2363" /> the cost of hospitals form a great proportion of the burdens on the ratepayers of the country at the present time they must have contributed largely to the great increase in the rates in the last eight or nine years. If the trend of that increase in rates were maintained for the next two years Deputy Cogan's case would be still stronger.  This idea of making the roads and hospitals a national charge has been mooted by many public bodies in the past couple of years.  Different cases have been made for it.  At one period I myself was very much in favour of the general idea.  Having been looking at this motion on the Order Paper for the last two years, I thought we would get a much stronger case for it than we got from Deputy Cogan to-day.  I think he overlooked the really essential fact in regard to it.  The really essential fact is that, if we are justified in saying that roads and hospitals contribute largely to the burden of rates struck in any particular area in the country, every year that goes by means that a greater burden is being imposed on the ratepayers.  I think if Deputy Cogan looked into the figures of the general rates collected in every type of area in this country from 1931-32 to 1939-40 he would have discovered an argument for his case that is practically unanswerable, that is if he wants to relieve the local ratepayers of the country and make those charges a national burden.</P>

    <P>The position actually is that as far as county health districts are concerned the rates collected in 1931-32 were £2,445,269, and the rates actually collected in 1939-40 were £3,393,161, an increase of £947,892, or 39 per cent.  In urban areas the rates actually collected in 1931-32 were £556,236.  In 1939-40 the rates collected were £779,894, an increase of £223,658, or 40 per cent.  In the smallest areas of rateable valuation in this country, the town commissioner areas, the rates collected in 1931-32 were £6,586, and in 1939-40, £10,435, an increase of £3,849, or 58.5 per cent.  In county boroughs, the rates collected in 1932 were £1,669,476, and in 1939-40, the rates collected were £2,308,607, an increase of £639,131, or <Col N="2364" /> 38 per cent.  The total collected in 1931-32 was £4,677,567.  The total collected in 1939-40 was £6,492,097, an increase of £1,814,530 over all, or an average of 39 per cent.</P>
    <P>If the people in favour of this motion contend that the maintenance by the local ratepayers of the burden of charge for roads and hospitalisation is a big item in this bill, their case is being strengthened every day in this country, because surely the amount expended on roads and the amount expended on hospitals must have formed a very large proportion of the general increase of 39 per cent. in the rates paid in 1939-40 as against 1931-32.  Actually, there may be one peculiar feature about those figures, and it might not be altogether in complete agreement with the case made by the mover of this motion, because, if you take the smallest areas for rateable purposes, the town commissioner areas, which are the only urban areas, their proportion is by far the highest. In the areas of the town commissioners the rates increased by 58.5 per cent. In the areas under the county health districts they increased by 39 per cent.; in other words, they increased just the average, but in the areas of the town commissioners the increase was 58.5 per cent., so I do not think it is exactly true to suggest that the rural dwellers, in the sense of the people living outside the smaller towns and cities, are bearing a terribly undue proportion of the maintenance of roads and hospitals.</P>

      <P>The fact is that from 1931-32 to 1939-40 the rates increased by 58.5 per cent.  I do not think, mind you, that Deputy Cogan or the other movers of the motion could suggest that the dwellers in rural areas are not anxious for good roads, or that they would be quite satisfied with a fairly good road.  How often do county councils and various other public bodies find themselves faced with a demand from somebody or other in a purely rural area to steamroll a road towards a particular creamery or something like that?  Apart entirely from my own views on this subject, one of the real troubles in this country is the fact that, once money is to be spent on anything, that is money out of the taxpayers' or the ratepayers' pockets, every section of the community think they are the people upon whom it should be spent.  If ten miles of a road is steamrolled in one district 20 miles long by 40 miles wide, every public representative in that district and every T.D. in that district will be fighting tooth and nail to justify his own existence by having all the other roads steamrolled.</P>

If you steamroll one road and it is the only main road in that area, every ounce of heavy traffic in the district will be immediately diverted to it and that road which should last for at least ten years is worn out in three.</P>

      <P>Another justification of the case made by the movers of the motion might be this.  Deputy Cogan touched upon it when he referred to the position of the Road Fund. Actually, that is even worse than the road position.  The gross receipts of the Road Fund in 1937-38 were £1,125,232.  Out of that sum there was expended on roads £673,556, leaving in the hands of the Government, to be utilised for some other purpose, £451,676.  In 1938-39 the amount collected was £1,174,700; the amount expended on roads out of that sum was £771,172, leaving £403,528 to be retained. In the last year for which figures are available, 1939-40, the gross receipts going into the Road Fund were £1,133,808.  Out of that there was expended on roads £744,794, leaving a sum of £389,014.  In that period of three years there was a difference of £1,250,000 between what was expended out of the Road Fund and what was collected.  That £1,250,000 would make a terrific difference if it were available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2368" /> Sooner or later a stop will have to be put to this gallop.  If the increase in rates which I have indicated continues in the same proportion we will eventually reach the stage when the people will be asking us to make the roads and hospitals a State charge.  In fact, it may come to pass that they will be anxious to have everything made a State charge because they will not be able to cope with the conditions in their own localities.  I imagine that people like Deputy Allen feel they are of greater advantage in this House to their constituents than in the county councils, and that if the Government had the administration of all these funds they might get more out of them. Is Deputy Allen prepared to say that, apart from roads and hospitals, value has been given for the increase of 39 per cent. in the rates collected for the last nine or ten years?  I am sure there are thousands of people engaged on road and other work on which the money collected by way of rates is expended who would not agree that they are 39 per cent. better off compared with their position nine or ten years ago.</P>
    <P>Is Deputy Allen prepared to say that there is an increase of 39 per cent. in connection with employment on road work or an increase of 39 per cent. by way of home assistance in rural areas? That 39 per cent. must have gone somewhere. Did it go into roads, hospitals or any other undertakings?  You have the fact that £1,250,000 was retained out of the Road Fund for purposes other than that intended by the people who paid that money into the Road Fund.  I imagine that if Deputy Allen owned a vehicle for which he was subscribing to the Road Fund and found himself on a bumpy road, one of his greatest grievances would be that he was paying road tax to the county council together with a petrol tax and yet his road was not being properly maintained.</P>
    <P>Have the movers of the motion ever considered this, that what we have been doing in this country is picking out trunk roads here and there, making wonderful jobs of them and leaving thousands of small roads improperly maintained and never steamrolled?  I <Col N="2369" /> will give you one instance.  The one fine road in my constituency is that which runs directly from Mallow to Killarney.  It is a grand tourist road, but it happens to avoid all the small towns in that area, whether by accident or design I cannot say.  At any rate, there are two towns on the right-hand side and two towns on the left-hand side, but the road avoids them.  When that road was steamrolled every ounce of traffic that normally passed through those towns, with a certain amount of benefit to the townspeople, was diverted.  The long 40-mile stretch got it all and the little towns suffered.  If you are going to pick out roads here and there in that fashion, you might as well drop the scheme altogether, because you are really hitting the people who pay the rates and who are deserving of some consideration.  There is an idea abroad that when people want to go to Killarney they should be provided with a steamrolled road, while there is no necessity at all to provide a steamrolled road for the person who wants to visit the local town.  I believe Deputy Allen mentioned a figure of £100,000,000.  Suppose we look at this matter as a business proposition.  If every road in Ireland were steamrolled, and if the money could be made available for it, would it not mean that everybody would use, whether with a donkey cart, a bicycle, a motor car or a lorry, his own natural road, and that the traffic would not be all diverted to one road?  No matter what the expense might be, you might arrive at a position in which it would be better to have all roads pretty well done and you might save money hereafter.</P>
    <P>As far as the hospitals are concerned, we have the Hospitals Commission which is supposed to provide funds, and we have money taken also from ratepayers and taxpayers.  The authorities build magnificent hospitals for us.  The Minister's predecessor was very nice to us in North Cork, and built the finest looking hospital one could wish for in Mallow.  That building has been completed for quite a long time, but it has been left lying there unoccupied.  I believe the reason it was not utilised was the fact that some additions by way of nurses' quarters had to be built.  We <Col N="2370" /> have been looking at this glorious edifice with its hundreds of windows for years.  I do not know whether it is the Department or the North Cork Board of Health that is responsible, but that magnificent building has been lying there for quite a long time without the slightest benefit to the people of the district.  It has been completed and, as I am informed, it is equipped as far as operating theatres are concerned, in a very modern manner, but for all the use it is to the ratepayers, the roofs might be off it and the crows might be nesting there.  I believe it could have been utilised had arrangements been made to make it available, because, when the necessity arose, the military were able to take it over and to use it as a central hospital for the Southern Military Command.  As far as hospitals are concerned, I do not believe that either the Minister, Deputy Cogan or myself knows what is happening. Deputy Cogan suggested that county boundaries might be abolished in the administration of hospitals. That, I think, is an idea worth considering. Occasionally you will find a hospital built within a couple of miles of a county boundary.  People residing within a few miles of that hospital, if they require hospital treatment, must travel 40 miles or more to get to their own county hospital.</P>
    <P>One suggestion I would make to relieve the rates is to cease building cottage hospitals.  There is no doubt that cottage hospitals are very nice looking buildings, but the number of beds which they provide is altogether too small.  They are perhaps quite capable of coping with the normal flow of patients, but in a time of epidemic, or when there is any widespread outbreak of illness, these places are absolutely incapable of dealing with them.  A worse feature is that some of the cottage hospitals are situated in what might be called fairly wealthy areas, while others are placed in poor areas.  There is a custom growing up in some parts of the country under which certain patients are sent to one cottage hospital, while other patients are transferred to another cottage hospital because they are not paying patients or are not of the same social <Col N="2371" /> standing as the people treated in the first cottage hospital.  Another objectionable feature is that the medical officers of these cottage hospitals are paid small salaries, and part of their perquisites seems to be a number of free beds for the treatment of private patients in these hospitals.  That is my information and if it be correct, I think the system is entirely wrong.  It may be that there are 35 beds in one of these local hospitals.  That number is quite small enough for the needs of the district and that a doctor, who is a paid servant of the State, should be entitled to retain a number of these beds for his own private patients seems to me altogether wrong.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is not now dealing with the Local Government Estimate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyLinehan" hpid="Mr. Linehan Mr. Linehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Linehan</NameTxt>
      <P>These beds are being utilised by the doctor to augment his own private income.  If the Department feels that a doctor is not being paid a salary sufficient to provide him with a livelihood, they ought to pay that man a salary which would be commensurate with the work he has to do and make him do his job, but they should not allow him to augment his income by providing him with accommodation for private patients.  I think there is much to be said for the point made by Deputy Cogan, that since this idea of steamrolling roads and fine-spraying them has come into existence, there is certainly some case for investigating the incidence of the charges for the upkeep of these roads.  I shall not deal further with the question of hospitals because it is a question that is much too involved for me.  I just want to say to Deputy Cogan that the weakest point in his argument was his reference to the Great Southern Railways. He said that the Great Southern Railways started as a private concern and that they had to pay their way, that the people who are utilising the railways had to provide the money.  I am afraid that if he utilises that argument the freight receipts of the Great Southern Railways would not sustain it Everybody knows that the railways are not paying their way and <Col N="2372" /> the people who realise it most are those unfortunates who had their £100 shares reduced to £10.</P>
      <P>The one aspect of the motion that frightens me is this.  There may be a case for establishing a national system of administration but I do not think anything in this country was ever improved by centralising it.  You may have a general scheme for the whole country but everybody knows that when it gets into the hands of the gentlemen here in Dublin, when it is centralised, you will get less out of what you are paying than you do at the moment.  When these people get their hands upon it you will get less of the money you contribute than you do at the moment.  No matter what happens, I do not think you should allow the people here in Dublin to get their hands on anything more than they have at the moment, because the more they get their hands on it the less the people will get out of it.</P>

      <P>Whether the money comes out of the pockets of the ratepayers or the taxpayers, it has to be provided by the people.  I think the question of whether the roads should be made a national charge is at least worthy of examination.  The only thing I am afraid of is letting the money get into the hands of the people in Dublin.  They would say that we in the country may pay away and we would not get back half of it.  I am <Col N="2373" /> sure that Deputy Allen would be as horrified as I am to hand over two or three million pounds to the people in Dublin rather than leave it in our hands.</P>

      <P>If Deputy Allen wants to make an answer to a case for the nationalisation of roads, it is not wise that he&mdash;and all the other county councils in the country who pretend that they are anxious to provide employment for the people&mdash;should forget that.  It is not that they are so anxious to provide employment for the people, but they put £400 or £1,000 down and then come here looking for a new subsidy, simply in order to justify their political existence as purely local representatives.  If Deputy Allen can tell me that an increase of rates by 39 per cent. has increased employment on the roads in a fair percentage, I would say that that is good.  I doubt if an extra ten have been employed on the roads in the last ten years, as I know it was roughly the same.  I do not think that the 39 per cent. which we put on has put 39 per cent. more on the roads.  I suggest that there is a case for examination.  I am sure that Deputy Allen, until he heard Deputy Cogan talking, did not know what the amount was.  I am prepared to support any request for an examination that anybody makes.  And I am not prepared to object to such an examination by saying that it is not a solution.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGovern</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this motion, not because I believe that it is a proper solution, but because I believe &ldquo;half a loaf is better than no bread&rdquo;.  The only solution that will do justice in this case is derating of agricultural land.  I am sure that that is what Deputy Cogan had in mind. However, as we cannot get the Government to regard the equities of the case and treat properly the farmers who have to bear the burden, it is better to get relief in some direction.</P>
      <P>In regard to Deputy Linehan's point, I agree with him when he says he does not want centralisation.  I do not want centralisation either, but what is the case for centralising in this instance? The case for centralising in this instance is that there is an attempt to increase the taxation that is raised centrally&mdash;that is, the general taxation or national taxation.  There is an attempt to increase it equitably but there is no attempt to increase rates equitably, because there is one section of the community&mdash;the farmers&mdash;taxed in the shape of rates out of all proportion to income.  Everybody is aware that people who are paying income-tax are always allowed a certain living income before a shilling is imposed upon them, whether the rate is high or low.  What is the position with regard to this, which is really a direct form of taxation, similar in all respects to national income tax?  It is raised on an income-basis, but they are not allowed one shilling to live upon.  People with £20 of an estimated income have to pay anything up to £20 a year on that income and are left with nothing at all.  That would not be done with any other section of the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to take this opportunity to impress on the Minister and on all concerned, that there never can be an equitable or just solution except that <Col N="2375" /> of derating agricultural land altogether. If that were done, I would not stand for centralisation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGovern</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that this motion proposes to transfer to the Exchequer the responsibility of keeping the main roads and the hospitals. That would be as far as it goes.  It would relieve the ratepayers.  While it would not be giving justice to a section of the ratepayers, it would be some relief and, therefore, I support it.</P>
      <P>Apart from that aspect of the question, I wish to impress on the Minister that, if he has any desire to do justice to the farmers of this country, he must relieve them entirely of their rates, so far as the land is concerned, and tax them the same as other sections of the community, on what they are drawing out of it. There is another matter.  Anybody who takes up the accounts of county councils from year to year knows that rates have increased on each occasion until they have become an unbearable burden.  The ability of the farmers to carry this burden now has diminished in proportion as the rates have gone up.  I am afraid that we are coming to a point in which there will be a complete break-down of our local bodies owing to the inability of the farmers to pay their rates.  All that is necessary is one bad year: if a bad harvest came, or a stoppage on our cattle exports or of anything that has been doing well for the past two years, it would make things impossible for them.  They would be unable to procure the necessities of life for themselves while paying the ever-growing burden of rates that is crushing them down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Something will have to be done to relieve the ratepayers of this burden. Every grant that the Minister gives towards unemployment is given on condition that the local body would pay a certain proportion, and in this way he is inducing them, and is throwing a responsibility on these local bodies <Col N="2376" /> that does not belong to them, but to the Government, and one which should be borne by the National Exchequer. That charge is thrown upon local bodies and upon the rates, which means that it is thrown principally upon the poorest and hardest-working section of the community.  They are being goaded in all directions.  Their produce is being controlled.  The price is being kept down deliberately.  For instance&mdash;and I only refer to this as an instance&mdash;the price of butter and milk is kept down by control below the world price, to less than it is in Northern Ireland, while the prices of the goods the farmers have to buy&mdash;which are produced by industrialists&mdash;are double what they are on the other side of the Border. That is just an example of what is being done to this section of the community.</P>
    <P>When you come to the question of taxation, the only principle&mdash;or lack of principle&mdash;is to throw every possible burden on the farmers and take everything out of them, until they are squeezed out and are fleeing from the land.  Everybody deplores the flight from the land, but it is being done deliberately by the policy of the Government. I have been trying from time to time to impress on Ministers that this is the real cause, and that they are really responsible for the flight from the land, which everybody knows is going on.  Unless there is a change, it will go from bad to worse.  This proposes some relief, and I would ask the Minister, if he is not prepared to go further, at least to accept this motion. There are just one or two other points to which I should like to refer.  I have called the attention of the Minister's predecessor to the slippery condition of the roads.</P>

      <P>Very well, Sir.  Deputy Linehan gave figures of the amount that the Minister has taken off the Road Fund in motor taxation. That at least should have gone back to the roads in relief of the ratepayers to that extent.  It is not really from the Road Fund but from the ratepayers that that sum of £1,000,000 over these three years was taken, along with the rest.  If the Minister would restore that to the relief of rates this year, it would go a certain length towards the relief of the unfortunate people who are overburdened, and if he were to accept this motion and relieve them of the cost of the roads and the hospitals it would go some way but certainly it would not go far enough.  It would not by any means <Col N="2378" /> meet the equities of the case or do justice to the section that is most crushed and that, I feel, is most concerned in this, because after all it does not matter whether it is paid in rates or in general taxation, so long as these local rates or local taxation are imposed in an equitable manner and applied equally to all having regard to their incomes.  If that were done I would not mind whether it was local or central.  I would prefer the local to the central administration. Taking all into account, however, I support the motion because it will relieve the ratepayers to a certain extent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. Everett Mr. Everett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to support the motion for the reason that I am satisfied that if the roads and the hospitals were made a national charge public representatives would then be in a better position to cater for the poor of the areas they represent, because we find that when the estimates for roads and hospitals are passed it is generally at the expense of other social services. Even if the Minister is unable to agree that all the roads should be made a national charge, I think that there is a special case to be made for the main roads.  In the constituency that I represent we have a special claim that at least the main roads and trunk roads should be a national charge.  We, in County Wicklow, are in such close proximity to Dublin that we have motors from practically all over Ireland passing over our main and trunk roads.  Of course, the Minister may put up the case that these people leave some money or that they leave something there.  Well, we have heard the views of hotel-keepers and owners of property there, and their reply to the Minister would be that the only things these people leave there are empty mineral-water bottles, waste paper, and litter of all kinds, that they have brought down in their motor cars. Very few of these people enter the hotels, so it is no personal gain to the hotel-keepers or ratepayers in County Wicklow to have these people travelling through, and they have to spend a large sum of money for the maintenance of the roads.  It is most unfair for a man in a rural area to have to <Col N="2379" /> pay for the upkeep of roads over which he never travels, while the roads in his own areas, the by-roads, are left, and the public boards, after providing for the trunk and main roads, have very little money left for the improvement of the county roads.</P>

      <P>I wish to point out the necessity to give a larger grant for main and trunk roads, at least.  On the question of hospitalisation, I do not suggest that there is any inefficiency, but I think the Minister will agree that a special case can be made to relieve the ratepayers of the cost of the maintenance of patients in mental hospitals. The Government at the present time do not give the same capitation grant that was given at the time of the commencement of the Local Government Act.  We all know the cost of maintaining patients in our mental hospitals at the present time and, therefore, I think there is a special case for the Government to make some arrangements to increase the capitation grants of public hospitals so as to enable them to maintain these patients in mental hospitals. With regard to the matter of roads, other counties have their claims, of course, but I say that the County Wicklow has a special claim for consideration in the matter of giving larger grants for the trunk and main roads.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. Ruttledge)</NameTxt>
      <P>From the way that the debate on this motion was opened by Deputy Cogan, it was quite obvious that very little consideration was given to it, although he complained that the motion has remained on the Order Paper for two years.  The Deputy has given the House no indication as to how he proposes that this transfer will take place.  He does not tell us, in regard to the transferring of <Col N="2380" /> the hospitals and the roads, or at least transferring the liability for their upkeep, who is going to administer them.  Does he propose that these services should be taken over by the central authority and that they should be run from Dublin?  Certainly if the central authority is going to provide the money it must be on some such lines as that it must be done.  When the County Management Bill was before the House there was a good deal of criticism about the inroads it was going to make in local government.  If by this proposal the Deputy means that these moneys are to be provided by the central authority, then the administration of the money must rest with the central authority, and it means the end of local government.  He has not told the House what way he proposes it should be administered.  Does he think the central authority would be so foolish as to provide money required by county councils, no matter what fantastic schemes were put up, without having control of it?  When a motion like this is put down, one would expect that the proposer or seconder would have some clear cut ideas as to how it should be carried out.  It is obvious that the Deputies never considered it from that angle.</P>
      <P>To deal with the roads first.  In 1938-39 in county boroughs the cost of roads was £283,931; in urban districts, £52,348; in towns, £646, and in the counties, £2,602,882.  In the counties the rate levied for roads varied from 2/8 in Westmeath to 4/10 in Galway and 5/11 in Donegal.  The rate in, at least, half the counties is below 4/-.  Of the expenditure in the counties, amounting in 1938-39 to £2,602,882 a large proportion was, in fact, met out of Government grants.  The net charge in that year on rates would appear to be £1,262,009.  Out of the Road Fund the county councils received £340,687 in respect of the maintenance of main roads, and £477,775 for road improvement works.  There was also approximately £400,000 paid to county councils in respect of employment schemes on roads, so that approximately one-half the expenditure on roads in 1938-39 is represented by Road Fund and other Government grants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2381" /> The cost of maintaining main roads is approximately £840,000.  The Road Fund meets 40 per cent. of the cost of maintenance and approximately £500,000 is met out of the rates.  The improvement grant for some years past averaged £400,000 a year.  In the present year it has fallen to £208,000. The full cost of improvement works, as distinct from maintenance, is met out of grants, so that practically no charges fall on local authorities for the improvement of main roads.  It is necessary that there should be an improvement of roads to meet changes in traffic, to provide for road widening and road surfacing.  With something like 1,700 miles of roads scheduled for steamrolling still incomplete, it is necessary to go ahead with that work.</P>
    <P>One would imagine from what has been said that the roads were provided only for motor-cars and tourists. Roads are provided largely by local bodies.  A meeting of every county council is held before the final estimates are submitted, at which county councillors submit various works and roads that they want attended to. Roads that have been talked of as being suitable only for tourists are roads that were put up by councillors as being required in their areas to meet local needs or to give local employment. The great volume of road expenditure is largely due to the provision made by county councils in that way.  Of course, the chief engineering inspector carries out certain planning of road improvements financed out of the Road Fund in conjunction with county surveyors.  The maintenance of main roads is submitted to the county councils to decide whether they wish them done or not.  Consequently county councils have a big say in fixing the roads that they consider necessary.  I do not want to go into the uneconomic side of the question, but I believe it would be inadvisable to transfer from local bodies the powers that they have at present of making provision for these roads and deciding on those they consider to be most necessary.  They are acquainted with local conditions; they are conversant <Col N="2382" /> with the people, and they can decide for themselves.</P>
    <P>County councils are heard complaining from time to time, after the estimates are passed, about the high rates, but the time to remember an increase of rates is when they have the estimates before them.  They should not be talking about that at the end of the year.  If Deputy Cogan has it in mind that, at the same time as the central authority would take over or finance the roads, a free hand was going to be given to local authorities to deal with what roads they liked, one can imagine what sort of an estimate would be before the House if the local authority had no responsibility for providing the money.  It is quite obvious what proportions the estimate would assume if the money came from the Central Fund.</P>
    <P>Proposals have been put up from time to time by the general council of county councils that the road tax and duties on imported motor vehicles should be applied towards the provision of roads.  Whatever has been taken from the Road Fund has been taken to provide for other social services.  If the House wants to provide more money for roads, then money for other social services will have to be found in some other way.  It can only be found by taxation.  Even if there were no difficulties at the moment, I do not think anybody would consider increasing the tax on cars or petrol, or increasing the duties.  If you do not do that, you have to fall back on increasing the taxes on something else which would probably fall more heavily on the farmers.</P>
    <P>Taking the hospitals position, you have mental hospitals under one head, and the district, county, and fever hospitals under another head.  Mental hospitals get a capitation grant of 4/- per head and they are costing something like £1,000,000.  The average expenditure for the whole country for the maintenance of mental hospitals would be approximately 1/4 in the £.  If you <Col N="2383" /> take into account the Agricultural Grant in relief of the rates on agricultural land and if you deduct that, the net charge on land would be approximately 9d. in the £.</P>
    <P>The total expenditure on public assistance is approximately £2,250,000. Of this amount at least 25 per cent. represents the expenditure on home assistance.  The next big item in the expenditure is represented by the expenses under the Medical Charities Act, and on medicines and medical and surgical appliances, which approximate to £400,000, and these with home assistance would work out at practically one-half of the total expenditure of the boards of public assistance. Again, dealing with hospitals, are you going to take away the administration of them from the local authorities?  If the financing of them is to be taken over by the central authority, surely the central authority is going to see how they are administered. I think that the representatives in the counties would be more conversant with the conditions than any people in Dublin could ever hope to be.</P>

      <P>If the roads and the hospitals are to be financed by the central authority, has Deputy Cogan in mind that the Agricultural Grant will still continue, or will he abandon the Agricultural Grant and allow it to be taken into consideration in dealing with this?  If he means that the Agricultural Grant should continue and that these other services will be financed by the central authority, we will have a very peculiar position. Let us take the position in Wicklow and the position in Cavan, because Deputy Cole's name is also down to this motion.  The following shows the position in Cavan and Wicklow for the past three years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Wicklow the rate for roads was 3/7.25d.; for county services, 3/3; for poor relief, 3/6; for health district charges, 2/0.75d., making a total of <Col N="2384" /> 12/5.  In Cavan in the same way the total comes to 11/10.25d.  Then take the Agricultural Grant.  The primary Agricultural Grant provides 5/10 in Wicklow and 5/9 in Cavan; for employment it is 5/9.75d. in Wicklow and 5/9.50d. in Cavan; for the supplementary Agricultural Grant it is 3/- in Wicklow and 3/4 in Cavan.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. Everett Mr. Everett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>Why do you not pay us what you stopped for the last three years?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>In Wicklow County 60 per cent. of the holdings are under £20 valuation and 80 per cent. in County Cavan.  If you total it up, you will find that the relief under the primary employment grant would probably be greater than the cost of the services that would still be left with the local authorities.  There have been proposals here from time to time about derating, but such an outlandish proposal as this has never before been made in this House.  If you want to hold on to the Agricultural Grant, not only are you giving derating but something in addition as well.  That proposal was never made before.  That is one of the reasons why I say that this motion has not got any consideration whatever in the two years from the Deputies who put their names to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to waste the time of the House in dealing with this matter considering the way it has been put down and the little consideration that was given to it by those who put their names to it.  I suggest, however, that if Deputies are considering some such motion in the future and want to become acquainted with the facts concerning it, they should read the reports of the Derating Inquiry of 1931.  They will find the findings in relation to mental hospitals and roads on pages 39 to 47.  In that report the reasons against it are set out.  They say that it is uneconomic.  They point out that there are very different conditions in the various counties; that there is a bigger mileage of roads perhaps in one county than in others; that the thing would not work out satisfactorily and that it would work out very unfairly. <Col N="2385" /> They do not deal with hospitals in general.  In dealing with mental hospitals, they point out the disparity that exists between one county and another.  There are different conditions of service and different dietary scales without any detriment to the patients.  There are big differences between the costs in one county and in another.  You also have different scales of pay in the different counties. If you bring all these under the central authority, you will not have the flexibility that exists at present.</P>
    <P>You will have to make uniform the payment of salaries, and so on, to officials.  You will have practically all of them on more or less the same scale through the country.  That would mean a big increase in the rates in some counties.  No argument has been put forward in favour of this motion.  If Deputy Cogan insists on getting the agricultural grant as well, I think he is only wasting the time of the House, and making a laughing stock of the whole position.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is probably one of the ablest debaters in the House, and in his own quiet way gets his points across better than any other Minister.  He has made the case against this motion that some of us have, from time to time, tried to make against the Government with not, perhaps, the same effect.  He made the point that acceptance of the motion would practically mean giving a blank cheque to the local bodies to carry on their work.  Some of us here have made that case on the question of derating. I, and other Deputies who understand the question, have always held that if derating came there should be a change in the system of local government, and that the Government which paid the piper should have the right to call the tune.  But the Government themselves, while proceeding along the line that local bodies must provide the money, have been gradually stealing the tune until they have got not only the air but all the music as well.  Those of us who voted against the Managerial Acts did so for practically the same reason that the <Col N="2386" /> Minister has used in objecting to this proposal of Deputy Cogan.  My objection to them was that they gave the Department of Local Government 95 per cent. control and left the unfortunate dupes, the local bodies, to provide the money.  I have always objected to local bodies, or anybody else, being called upon to provide money for others to spend.  I hold that at the present time it is the Central Body that is spending the money, most of it at any rate, raised locally.</P>
      <P>The Managerial Acts have given practically full control over all expenditure for the Department of Local Government.  The Minister, for example, asked what would be the position of the hospitals if he were to take over control of them, leaving the obligation on the local bodies to provide the necessary funds.  Under the Managerial Acts the local bodies have practically no control over mental hospitals.  As regards hospitals and other services, the Department of Local Government have, at the present time, full control to all intents and purposes.</P>
      <P>The Minister said that local bodies can do what they like in the case of roads.  That is not so.  If they had freedom in that matter they would make roads that would be more suitable than the roads we have for the horse traffic, making it easier for the farmer to carry on his operations.  The local bodies are practically compelled to make modern roads suitable for motor tourist traffic.  They are told that, if they fail to do so, the grants they are entitled to will be transferred elsewhere.  To say that the local bodies had a free hand as regards the roads was, I suggest, rubbing it in a bit too hard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am in favour of the motion.  Long before there was ever any agitation for complete derating, I had always held that the cost of the roads and of mental hospitals should be a State charge. Any proposal introduced into this House to make them so will always have my support.  I agree that, in order to put this motion into effect, some difficulty might arise.  There would have to be certain changes in <Col N="2387" /> administration, but these need not necessarily be of the radical nature indicated by the Minister.  Reference has been made to the Agricultural Grant.  I was not present when Deputy Cogan referred to it.  The Minister did make reference to the Deputy's statement.  I do not know if the Deputy suggested, as the Minister seemed to indicate, that farmer ratepayers, in addition to getting derating, should have the Agricultural Grant handed over to them as a bonus.  I would be surprised if Deputy Cogan made such a suggestion.  It is one that I certainly would not make.  Everyone knows the purpose for which the Agricultural Grant was given originally in the last days of the past century. It was to relieve the ordinary farmer ratepayer of the liability that he otherwise would have incurred for the landlord's share of local expenditure. Unfortunately, a great portion of the landlord's liability is still there, but in different hands.  At any rate, until the farmer is in free possession of his land it cannot be said that he is not entitled to the compensation given to him for that purpose.  I do not think the Minister was quite fair in his application of the saying that the people who pay the piper ought to have the right to call the tune.  He and his predecessors departed from that long ago.  They have run away completely from that, because they have forced upon us not only the tunes but the pipers as well.  I am prepared to vote for the motion.  I realise that there might be some difficulty in putting it into operation, but, in my opinion, the difficulties are not insurmountable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister talked about the intention of the proposers of the motion to transfer all power over the administration of roads and hospitals from the local bodies to the Central Government.  In view of the fact that we passed an Act last year depriving local authorities of all power, I think that question does not arise at all.  By the Managerial Bill, a permanent official is appointed to perform all the functions of the local authorities, <Col N="2388" /> except the striking and levying of a rate, which is, of course, the most objectionable function of local authorities. That is the only function that has been retained.</P>

I am a member of a county council at present, and I can see the very little power which local authorities have in the matter, for example, of road administration. We try from time to time to reduce the estimates submitted by our local officials, but the net result is that, in some way or other, our officials compel us to embark on that expenditure the following year, because they will produce to us certain of the main roads which are in such a condition that we must provide increased expenditure or lay ourselves open to the charge of neglecting the roads.  Under the Managerial Bill managers are to be appointed, and all the services at present administered by local authorities, with the exception of the striking of a rate, which is a reserved service, will be transferred to the managers, the local authorities being given the amusement of providing the money.</P>

      <P>I am definitely satisfied that since the local authorities have no power at present, they will not suffer any disadvantage by the transfer to the Local Government Department of the power of administration over roads and hospitals.  I even suggested in my opening remarks that it might be possible to secure greater uniformity of administration in respect of roads and greater efficiency in the administration of hospitals by having central control, particularly in view of the fact that we have a form of central control now which is inefficient.  We have a small dictator appointed in every county who may have his own ideas which may not conform at all with those of rival dictators in other counties, and this may result in considerable inefficiency and over-lapping I think it better to let one dictator take charge of all the roads.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred also to the fact that the cost of administering the services left under the control of the local authorities, if this motion is carried into effect, will not exceed their present Agricultural Grant.  The Minister evidently visualises a time when there will be a certain surplus of the Agricultural Grant which will have to be distributed by the rate collectors.  It will, according to his ideas, be necessary to send the rate collectors around to distribute this surplus.</P>

      <P>It may achieve a little additional relief for ratepayers other than agricultural ratepayers, and if a case was established for derating agricultural land, I think there would be a case established for relieving to a certain extent other ratepayers, and that is what this motion would, in effect, achieve, because obviously the same case which can be made for derating can be made for a certain amount of relief for other ratepayers, inasmuch as the case for derating is based on the fact that the present system of financing local administration is inequitable, and if it is inequitable for the farmer, there is a certain amount of inequality and injustice in respect of rates on other property.  For example, the owner of a factory or business house may be deriving very little income from that factory or business house.  Yet, he is compelled to pay a fixed charge to the local authority.  I am using that argument in support of this motion, and I suggest that the present system of financing the Central Government is more equitable than local taxation.</P>

      <P>I do not suggest, as the Minister evidently thinks, that the rate collector should go around paying back some of the exorbitant rates collected during the past few years.  Deputy Linehan drew attention to the enormous increase in rates which has taken place, and, as a matter of fact, that increase is one of the grounds upon which this motion is submitted to the House.  Rates have increased by over £1,000,000 during the past ten years and there is a probability that they will continue to increase, with a consequent deterrent effect on industry, commerce and agriculture.  I ask, therefore, that the roads be financed out of national taxation and that they be entirely financed out of taxation collected from the users of the roads.  I suggest that central control of our hospitals would make for efficiency inasmuch as the county boundaries would be brushed aside and you would have hospitals built to suit the needs of the community and not with a view to securing&mdash;as has happened during the past few years&mdash;as much of the Hospital Trust funds as possible for each locality.  I have asked for a national scheme of hospitalisation and a national and urgently-needed scheme of road improvements which, I think, would involve the raising of money by borrowing.  In view of enormous and increasing unemployment, the Minister should have no hesitation in recommending to the other Ministers the adoption of such a scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister suggested that I should read the report of the Derating Commission, which sat during the previous <Col N="2392" /> régime.  On a few occasions, I have attempted to read those recommendations but I have never been able to muster sufficient patience to wade through the absurdities dished up&mdash;particularly, in the majority report.  Only one sensible report was submitted by that commission and that was a minority report by Mr. Greene.  The other reports were sheer absurdities. The majority report was signed exclusively by permanent officials, professional gentlemen and civil servants who know absolutely nothing about the condition of the agricultural community or the ratepaying community. As a matter of fact, they mentioned in their report that they were not concerned about the equities of the present rating or taxation system.  Therefore, their approach to the whole question was absolutely immoral, and I do not think their report requires any serious consideration.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I move the motion standing in my name and the name of Deputy Keyes:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That having regard to the serious financial condition of the Great Southern Railways Company, its inability because of financial stringency to afford to the public the transportation services essential to satisfactory economic activity under conditions of transport monopoly, and the dismissal from the service of the company of numbers of men who have no prospect of obtaining alternative employment, Dáil Eireann requests the Government forthwith to publish for the information of railway-users and of the general public the reports presented to the Minister for Industry and Commerce in August, 1939, relating to the circumstances which led or contributed to the present unfavourable financial position of the Great Southern Railways and of the other railways operating within the State.</P>
      <P>I want to assure the Minister and the House that this motion is not put forward for the purpose of gaining any Party advantage, but for the purpose of forcing the Minister and his colleagues, if we can succeed in doing so, to face the facts.  What are the facts? In 1932 and 1933 we had public declarations from the Party now in office that on the question of transport they were in favour of the policy of public ownership. I feel certain the Minister will not deny that statement or contradict it in any way, because there are many quotations from speeches made by his colleagues in this House, and from public announcements issued by the Government Party previous to the elections held in 1932 and 1933 to confirm that statement.  In 1933, very shortly after the Government were returned in the election which was held early in that year, legislation, not on the lines of the publicly declared policy of the Fianna Fáil Party, was introduced.  I think there is nothing wrong in my quoting from the speech made by the then Minister for Industry and Commerce when he was speaking on the concluding stages of the Railway Bill of 1933.  On the Final Stage of that Bill, on the 3rd May, 1933, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, amongst a number of other very interesting statements, made this statement:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The position that will be created <Col N="2395" /> by these Bills will be one that will ensure that traffic will be carried on the railways, and on the roads, at the lowest economic rates; and that the receipts will be sufficient to pay all charges for organisation and administration, while giving a reasonable return on the capital invested.  That is what we set out to achieve and that is what these Bills will achieve.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I would like to hear from the Minister, if he will be good enough to go into that aspect of the matter, whether he is satisfied that the Act of 1933 has been administered in accordance with the intentions of the people who were responsible for its passage.  Many questions affecting the financial position of the railways and the chaotic position of transport generally have been brought under the notice of the Government during the intervening years in this House, but the most important thing that took place during the four years subsequent to the passage of the 1933 Act was a motion moved in this House, on the 7th December, 1938, by the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  He came to this House and he moved a motion which is fully quoted in column 1401 of the Dáil Debates of the 7th December, 1938, for the establishment of a tribunal:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That it is expedient that a tribunal be established for inquiring into the following definite matters of urgent public importance, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  the present position of public transport (other than air transport) within the area of jurisdiction of the Irish Government, and</P>
    <P>(b)  in particular, the circumstances which have led or contributed to the present unfavourable financial position of the Great Southern Railways and of the other railway companies operating within the said area, and</P>
    <P>(c)  whether any and, if so, what measures are necessary or desirable in order to secure efficient and progressive public transport (other <Col N="2396" /> than air transport) in the said area, and</P>
    <P>(d)  in particular, whether&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  any further transport legislation,</P>
    <P Just="Center">or</P>
    <P>(ii)  any changes in the ownership or in the methods of administration or both in the ownership and in the methods of administration of existing transport undertakings,</P>
    <P>are necessary or desirable.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Speaking to that motion, the Minister made a number of statements which, in my opinion, have a direct bearing on the motion now before the House. As reported at column 1402 of 7th December, 1938, he said&mdash;and this is a very important statement&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;...the Government are satisfied that a major decision on transport policy must now be taken.  It considers, however, before decisions are made, that a review by a tribunal, established under the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Act, 1921, should be made, for the purpose of getting a complete picture of the position, and obtaining the recommendations of such a tribunal as to the line of action to be followed.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Concluding, the Minister said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Certainly, it is my expectation that we should have the report of the tribunal before us when we meet again after the Christmas Recess&rdquo;,</P>
    <P>that is to say, he expected that the report of the tribunal would be in his hands on 8th February, 1939.  The report of the tribunal&mdash;or the reports of the tribunal, because I understand two reports were submitted to the Minister &mdash;were submitted not on 8th February, 1939, but on 4th and 11th August of the same year.  Numerous questions, innumerable questions, have been put on the Order Paper not alone by members of the Labour Party during the intervening period but by other Deputies in this House asking the Minister to state the reasons, if any, why he was refusing to publish reports of that very important body.  It is hardly necessary for me to say&mdash;at any rate, it is unnecessary <Col N="2397" /> for me to tell the Minister&mdash; that the reports of commissions set up by this House and of public tribunals on matters of national importance are always furnished to the members of the Parliament responsible for the establishment of such bodies.</P>
    <P>If the Opposition here in this House has any function it is surely to make their contribution to the good government of the country.  We were returned here at the last General Election with the knowledge that the Government had a clear majority, but still the Government which has that clear majority will not and cannot deny the right of the Opposition Parties in this House to criticise the policy of the Government in a constructive way, and to help the Government to implement its own policy in accordance with the wishes of the majority of the people. How can we exercise our duties as Deputies in this House, whether or not we sit behind the Government responsible for the implementation of a particular line of policy on transport or any other matter, unless we are put in possession of the valuable information which must be contained in the reports of all public commissions set up by this House at the taxpayers' expense?</P>
    <P>The Government has declared its policy of public ownership.  In 1933, in the Minister's own words, they put the private ownership system on trial for the last time.  The Minister at the time stated that if the Acts of 1933 failed to come up to expectations of the Government at the time there was nothing facing the Government in the future except to implement fully and without qualification their declared policy of public ownership of the transport services of this country.  A tribunal was set up.  Two reports are lying not,  I hope, in the wastepaper basket, but in some pigeon-hole locked with the personal key of the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  I do not know why the Minister refuses to give to the elected representatives of the people of this country the reports which were submitted by experts appointed by this House for the purpose of inquiring into a matter of great public and national importance.  On that point, I think I <Col N="2398" /> had better quote as a partial explanation&mdash;it is certainly not a satisfactory explanation&mdash;from the latest statement made by the Minister for Industry and Commerce in the House.  In reply to a question addressed to him on Wednesday, 5th February last, as to why the Minister had not, so far, authorised publication of those reports he said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The reports of the Transport Tribunal were submitted to my predecessor just prior to the outbreak of the present war.  The examination of these reports has been proceeding in my Department and in the other Departments of the Government concerned in the light of the continuously changing conditions which have been experienced since then.  It is clear that until there is some stability in the circumstances in which our transport undertakings have to work, final decisions as to the recommendations in the report cannot be arrived at, and that, indeed, the whole position may require to be reviewed afresh when trading and transport conditions become normal.  In this situation there would seem to be little public utility in publishing reports which were based on circumstances which have altered materially&rdquo;&mdash;</P>
    <P>those are very important words&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;since the outbreak of war and which will, no doubt, continue to change during the whole period of the present emergency.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>What are the circumstances referred to by the Minister in his reply, or what is the meaning of the suggestion in the latter portion of the reply that the circumstances had altered materially? Does he suggest that the financial position of the principal railway concern in this country has in any way altered during that period?  This tribunal was set up on 7th December, 1938.  The total net receipts of the Great Southern Railways Company for the year 1938 were £351,113.  The Minister, in moving here in this House for the establishment of the tribunal, expressed the opinion&mdash;and he had inside information on this matter&mdash;that it was owing to the serious financial position of the company that he was asking the tribunal <Col N="2399" /> to submit their report to him within such a short period.  What is the position to-day?  The net receipts of the company for the year 1940, as published by the directors a few days ago, were £358,856.  The details published, which I am sure are in the Minister's possession, will show that in the working of the company there was a net deficiency of something like £7,700 for the year 1940.  There is very little to justify the argument put forward by the Minister in his reply, so far as any material alteration in the financial circumstances of the company for the year 1940 as against the year 1938, when this tribunal was established, is concerned.</P>
    <P>The position of the principal railway concern in this country is much worse than it was in 1938.  I will tell you the reason why.  I am sure the Minister has access to the information that was produced by the chief accountant of the company in support of the case made before the Railway Wages Board.  I hold that information, but I am not at liberty to quote it.  I have reason to believe that the Minister has the information in his possession and if he examines it he will see that at that period the chief accountant of the company foreshadowed a deficiency of £17,000.  The actual figure turns out to be £7,701, but in a company where the gross revenue amounts to the high figure of £4,568,604 a difference of £10,000 is not very much one way or the other.  Giving evidence before the Railway Wages Board, the chief accountant gave estimates that to me appear to be very surprising.  I had a doubt about their accuracy.  They indicated that there would be a huge increase so far as the cost of materials was concerned.  In the report published, the figures certified by the auditor of the company show that there was an increase in the wages bill, compared with the previous year, of £85,669 and the increased cost of materials over the previous year amounted to the alarming figure of £186,597.</P>
    <P>The report contains a reference to the fact that the Ministry has been repeatedly approached, and apparently <Col N="2400" /> suggestions have been made for the introduction of amending legislation. Quoting from the report of the directors, it says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Government have not yet declared their intentions regarding the report submitted by the Transport Tribunal to the Minister for Industry and Commerce in August, 1939. Representations have been repeatedly made by the company to the Minister stressing the importance and urgency of and the necessity for the enactment of remedial legislation to deal with widespread evasions of the Road Transport Acts, 1933 to 1935, but so far without result.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I am not very well acquainted with the details of the suggestions submitted by the railway company to the Minister, but perhaps the Minister might indicate, if he is in a position to do so, what these suggestions were other than the suggestions that there should be certain amendments made to the Road Transport Acts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not like to discuss that with the Deputy who, I am <Col N="2402" /> sure, is a brilliant lawyer.  I do not say there are many such cases, but I do know that cases of this kind have been submitted to the Minister's Department. I do not think he will contradict that.  I am aware that some of these cases have been submitted to his Department by secretaries of railway trade unions.  I have been informed that innumerable other cases were submitted by the railway company, a company that has been brought to the borders of bankruptcy as a result of this kind of uneconomic and unfair competition.  If the company is in the low financial state indicated by the report issued by the directors a few days ago and if, as I know, there is a large percentage of rolling stock in a bad state of repair, surely there is a necessity for remedial legislation, or some form of assistance, or direct State intervention, or the implementation of the public ownership policy of the Fianna Fáil Party?</P>
      <P>I am aware, and the Minister cannot contradict it if he will read the reports of his own officials, that a large portion of the main lines of the company is in a bad state, and certain renewals which would cost large sums of money have had to be suspended by reason of the bad financial position of the company. The cost of materials has considerably increased.  That cannot be disputed.  I do not know the exact quantity of coal in the possession of this principal transport concern at the moment.  It is a very vital matter at the moment, especially in view of the petrol shortage.</P>
      <P>If the Minister has made up his mind not to disclose or not to authorise the publication of these reports, I dare say that I could talk here until Tibb's Eve without any effect, because I know that immediately the division bells ring here, if we are to have a division on this motion, the pro-railway Party Deputies&mdash;and there is only one of them sitting in this House with the Minister just now&mdash;will march in here like merry men, all smiling, prepared to walk into the same division lobby as the Minister, although they have not listened to one speaker making a case for or against the motion.</P>

      <P>In all seriousness, I suggest to the Minister that there is no case for his refusal to publish these two reports, or his decision to keep them locked up in his own private locker. I daresay I must give him credit at any rate for being sufficiently active to submit these reports to his colleagues in the Cabinet.  As a matter of fact, in reply to questions from myself and some of my colleagues in this Party on previous occasions, he stated that the reports were receiving Departmental consideration.  I want to know, and I am entitled to know, why any civil servant should have the right to see these reports before I see them?  I may have some knowledge, perhaps a little knowledge, of the contents of these reports. I do not know whether Deputy McGilligan, a former Minister for Industry and Commerce, would say that a civil servant has a right of access to these reports when not one of the people's representatives can get access to them.  If the Minister and his Party are incapable, as they appear to be, of making up their minds on the policy to pursue in connection with the chaotic position of the principal railway company, then for goodness sake let us look at the reports and we may be able to give them some assistance.  I contend that we are entitled to see these reports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope the Minister, on reconsideration of the whole matter, will decide to release the reports for the information <Col N="2404" /> of the large number of people who are deeply interested in the solution of this pressing problem.  We have in or about 18,000 working on the railway and on the road section of the railway-owned road services.  We have, roughly, about 14,000 shareholders who, naturally, would be very largely interested in the financial future of this concern if it survives the state of bankruptcy which it appears to have reached.  If the railway company is bankrupt, it is bankrupt because the private ownership system has failed to provide an efficient system of transport for the community. Then let us have a trial of the next best thing, the policy of public ownership, which the Minister and his colleagues advocated so eloquently in the years 1932 and 1933, and which the Minister for Industry and Commerce in his speech in this House on the 7th December, 1938, did not repudiate.</P>
    <P>During the last few weeks the position of the railway may have improved as a result of the muddling and mismanagement of the Ministry of Supplies. As a result of the petrol shortage, certain uneconomic sections of the Great Southern Railways road services have had to be shut down.  I daresay those indicated by Deputy Corry here in this House have suffered in that respect.  The Minister knows that the policy of co-ordination which was hoped for as a result of the passing of the 1933 Act was not carried out by the Great Southern Railways Board. I can tell the Minister&mdash;and I think in his Department he will find evidence in support of what I say&mdash;that rail sections of the Great Southern Railways were actually competing with road sections for traffic over many years.  We had the case quoted here by Deputy Corry where 11 or 12 services ran alongside one another from Cork to Cobh, looking for the same limited amount of traffic.  No company could hope to maintain an economic system under such conditions of muddle and mismanagement.</P>
    <P>I know of cases, and people working on the railways know of plenty similar cases in this country, where preferential consideration was given to travellers by the bus section of the railway company as against the railway <Col N="2405" /> section.  That was done for the purpose of helping to close down these branches of the railways.  Naturally, if a traveller gets a preference, if he travels by a railway-owned bus rather than by train, he will use the road as against the rail because it is cheaper.  He will also get better facilities from the point of view of the availability of the ticket. This is all done for the purpose of closing down the railways.  At least, I suggest that is the reason; if not, I do not know what is the reason.  I should like to hear what other Deputies may have to say on this motion.  I hope that in the long run the Minister can at least admit that the public interest would not be injured by the publication of the reports which he has for so long in his possession, and that even members of the Opposition Party may be able to make valuable suggestions as to the best solution that can be found to save the transport industry in this country from chaos.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to second the motion.  I do not want on the motion to argue that the Government should now, nine years afterwards, fulfil the election promises which they made in 1932, when the Minister's colleague and predecessor announced at Athlone that the Fianna Fáil Party was a railwaymen's Party.  Then, bursting with radical enthusiasm, he told all and sundry that when the Fianna Fáil Party got into office they would nationalise the railway services of the country, and would bring local transport services in the cities under municipal control.  For the last nine years we have waited to see promises of that kind implemented. Now, in 1941, looking back at 1932, we cannot get the Government which gave utterance to these radical views even to do such a tepid thing as to publish the report of the tribunal set up by the authority of this House.  The Minister is not being asked in this motion to nationalise the railways.  He is not being asked to bring the city transport services under municipal control.  Instead, he is being asked merely to publist the report of the tribunal which was established with the authority of the House, and for whose activities, its printing activities at least, this House has been compelled to vote money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2406" /> Let us get a picture of the whole circumstances surrounding this case, in order to ascertain whether we are making any unreasonable demands upon the Minister.  In December, 1938&mdash;two years and three months ago&mdash;the then Minister for Industry and Commerce introduced a motion in this House authorising the establishment of a tribunal to do certain things in connection with the railway and transport services.  In the preamble to the motion, it is set out &ldquo;that it is expedient that a tribunal be established for inquiring into the following definite matters of urgent public importance&rdquo;. So, in December, 1938, it was a matter of urgent public importance that the position of the transport services in the country should be inquired into by a tribunal.  That was the reason given by the Minister for the establishing of a tribunal of the kind indicated.</P>
    <P>In the course of the brief speech which he made on that occasion, the Minister acknowledged that an efficient service and a satisfactory method of administration were matters of considerable importance, and he admitted at that time that he had been largely influenced in deciding to establish a tribunal by reason of the representations made to him by railway companies to the effect that they had reached positions of acute financial stringency and would find it extremely difficult to carry on their activities unless provided with some substantial relief.  The Minister stated then that, having considered these representations from the railway companies&mdash;and presumably being aware of the position through his occupation of the office of Minister&mdash;he felt constrained to have the whole situation reviewed by a tribunal, and he thought that course was desirable so that they could ascertain the whole facts surrounding the railway transport position. He concluded by saying: &ldquo;I hope the inquiry to be undertaken will be completed as soon as possible. Certainly, it is my expectation that we should have the report of the tribunal before us when we meet again after the Christmas recess.&rdquo;  Therefore, in 1938, the Minister hoped that the report would be completed as soon as <Col N="2407" /> possible and that we&mdash;the House&mdash; would have the report before us on reassembly after the Christmas recess of 1938.  There was here an indication that the Minister for Industry and Commerce of that period felt that it was necessary&mdash;urgently necessary&mdash;to set up the tribunal, that it was of &ldquo;urgent public importance&rdquo; that the tribunal should examine the position of transport in the country.  If that speech means anything, it means that we were assured by the Minister for Industry and Commerce that the House&mdash;&ldquo;we&rdquo; can mean nobody but the House, in the sense in which it is used there&mdash; would have the report before it on reassembly after the recess of Christmas 1938.</P>
    <P>The report, of course, was not available when the House reassembled in February, 1939.  I think the first report&mdash;the majority report&mdash;was not presented to the Minister until August, 1939, and some days later the minority report was presented; but a few months after the Minister had received those reports&mdash;the majority report and the minority report&mdash;questions were addressed to him in this House, the first being, I think, in October, 1939. The Minister then stated that the report was under examination.  In the following month, another question was put to him and he replied that the report was still under examination.  The emergency situation having supervened, the Minister added, in reply to the second question, that it was necessary to consult departments before a decision, even on broad principles, could be taken.</P>
    <P>It can be seen by these statements by the Minister that he was not at all considering the question of releasing the report.  What was troubling him then&mdash;and apparently what is troubling the Minister now&mdash;is that he wishes to know what he will do with the report, what action he will take upon it.  He is not at all concerned with releasing the report to the public, so that they may ascertain the facts of the transport situation in this country, and so that on those facts impartially ascertained they might form some opinion, and so that they might then apply the information <Col N="2408" /> thus gleaned to a consideration of whatever proposals the Government have in mind for reorganisation of the transport services throughout the country.</P>
    <P>Questioned in February, 1940, as to whether the consultations with other departments of State concerned had concluded, the Minister said that they had not concluded.  In February, 1940, the examination of the report had not concluded, although we were told by the Minister for Industry and Commerce in December, 1938, that we would have the report before us in February, 1939.  Yet, twelve months afterwards, the Minister's successor was informing us that, not only would we not have the report before us, but that the examination of it by a number of departments had not then concluded.</P>
    <P>The Minister budged a little on the 21st February, 1940.  He was then asked when it was likely that the report would be published, and he said:&mdash;&ldquo;I hope it will be published at an early date.&rdquo;  In February, 1940, we were promised that the Minister hoped it would be published at an early date. Twelve months have passed since that date, yet there is still no sign of the report.  The Minister is playing with words.  He tells us in 1940 that the report will be published at an early date, and declines twelve months afterwards to release it.  So, having spent the latter half of 1939, and the whole of 1940, in suppressing the report &mdash;that is what the Minister is doing; he is deliberately withholding this report from the public&mdash;the Minister is still unable to indicate when the report will be published.  This is the kind of conduct being carried on by the Minister in face of a declaration by his predecessor that it was of urgent public importance to establish the tribunal, and that we would have the report in our hands in February, 1939.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Davin has rightly said, this is a matter of very vital concern for over 18,000 workers who have, economically speaking, dedicated their lives to the railway service; it is a matter of vital importance to railway shareholders also, and both of them represent a very substantial section of <Col N="2409" /> our relatively small community.  But it is of even more vital importance to the community at large who must inevitably, in modern civilisation, concern themselves with the maintenance of an efficient transport service.  In face of all the talk of two years ago about the urgency of an inquiry into the transport services of the country, in face of all the promises of the nationalisation of the railway services, in face of all the promises that the railways would be put on a satisfactory basis, our position to-day is worse than it was when the Government assumed office.  The financial position of the railways to-day is very serious indeed, and thousands of railway workers are standing from week to week in fear of being paid off in large numbers by the railways because of the present unsatisfactory financial position.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>Large numbers have been paid off.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>If one can read the signs aright, a substantial number of additional workers will be paid off.  The uncertainty caused by the Minister's suppression of the report is adding largely to the unfortunate position of those workers whose services are being terminated by the railway companies.  I put it to the Minister that he is not playing fair with this House by adopting this unreasonable attitude in connection with this report. After all, this tribunal was established by Parliament.  The expenses of its activities were defrayed by Parliament. Its expenses were defrayed out of the public purse, and on such a vital matter as transport services the public are entitled to know what are the facts. They are entitled to know what situation has to be dealt with in respect of the transport services, and they are entitled to expect the Government to lay the facts before them and to allow them to come to a judgment on the information available.  Instead of being assisted in that way, however, instead of being encouraged to bring in an informed view on the transport position in the country, instead of being encouraged to take an active interest in the necessity for the application of <Col N="2410" /> remedial legislation to the railways and for a comprehensive organisation of the transport undertakings in the country, the Government proceed to assume that the less the public know the better, and that the more you can suppress reports and keep the information from the public the better it will ultimately be&mdash;for whom, I do not know, but certainly not for the railways.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is endeavouring to fortify his present line of attitude by saying that the policy which has been adopted in connection with this report was adopted in respect of other reports&mdash;all other reports.  If he would take the trouble to look up certain reports, at least I think he will find that their publication was not related to a Government decision as to their intentions.  If the Minister will look up, for instance, certain relatively recent reports, he will find that that position was not adopted by the Minister concerned&mdash;even by his own predecessor.  For instance, there was a report of the Commission of Inquiry into the Civil Service.  The publication of that report was not delayed until there was a Government decision upon what it intended to do, because the Government, of course, did nothing.  In connection with the report of the Banking Commission there was no declaration of Government policy before releasing the report for publication.  In connection with the report of the Committee of Inquiry into Bankruptcy Laws there was no declaration of Government policy accompanying the release of the report.  In connection with the report of the Commission of Inquiry into the Registration of Shops or the report of the Ports and Harbours Tribunal, there was no declaration of Government policy accompanying the release of the reports.  In this case, however, the Minister, for some reason of his own&mdash;a reason which, apparently, he alone can appreciate&mdash;is deliberately suppressing this report, and his attitude in suppressing it is only causing the gravest misgivings to railway shareholders and railway workers in general.  If he continues to adopt this policy in respect of railways, if <Col N="2411" /> he continues to adopt the present Micawber policy of just waiting to see what will turn up in connection with the railways, he will find himself with more industrial headaches than he has to-day, and I think he will not be long in realising that the numbers of people registering at Gardiner Street and at the Labour Exchanges throughout the country are going to increase to his own discomfiture, because nobody can read the evidence which was tendered to the meeting of the Railway Wages Board, which was held in October, 1940, without being gravely concerned as to the ability of the railway companies to carry on.</P>
    <P>If the Minister will take the trouble to read the evidence that was submitted there on behalf of the railways &mdash;evidence which is open to check, which is open to the simplest form of check, and evidence which is the result of the everyday experience of persons concerned with the railway industry&mdash; he will see that the railways are facing a very serious situation indeed.  In respect of the arrears of maintenance at that time, the Railway Wages Board were informed that, in the case of the Great Southern Railways Company, in January, 1940, the arrears of maintenance amounted to £180,000, and the railway company's advocate before the board said that in 1942 a sum of £637,000 will fall due for repayment.  If I had any portion of that £637,000 due to me from the railway company I would assign it for a penny, because there is not a hope in the world, in the present financial position of the railways, that they will be able to repay sums of that kind.  All the indications are that the position of the railways will steadily deteriorate and, in the face of that position, which is growing more alarming every day and every week, the Minister, sitting in Government Buildings on the report of the Transport Tribunal, feels, apparently, that so long as he can rest on that report, everything is going to be all right with the railways, that the shareholders need not worry, and that the workers may put up with weekly notices of dismissal for large numbers <Col N="2412" /> of persons who have given a lifetime of service to the railway companies.  I think the Minister ought to realise that he has now carried on this ironic game of his far too long, and that he ought to avail of this opportunity to indicate when the report will be published so that we may know what problem is to be faced in respect of the railways, and so that an informed public opinion may be created for facing up to whatever responsibilities are involved in the implementation of that report.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to say much on this matter.  In the first place, I do not see what use a report on such a matter as transport is at the present day.  I do not see what use would be the report of the Railway Tribunal to-day, a report that was down up on evidence taken in normal times and normal conditions. What would be the effect of such a report on transport affairs in this country to-day?  Whatever recommendations they may have made with regard to railways or anything else, where is the use of talking about them to-day in the present position of transport? Deputy Davin spoke of the bankruptcy of the railways being brought about through the evasion of the Transport Act.  He was good enough to call attention to a statement that I made previously in connection with the railway and bus time tables of this country.  I stated that case here in the House three weeks ago, and I stated it before the Railway Tribunal two years ago, and quoted the same time table and gave the figures, and when I was asked did I suggest any cure that would put the railways on their feet, I told them &ldquo;Yes.  Go down to the national schools and get a couple of young fellows with their Leaving Certificates and put them in charge, and kick out the supposed businessmen.&rdquo;  That is the cure for the railways and it is the only cure. Can you imagine any businessman to-day, in any city, who, wanting to go from here down to O'Connell Bridge, will hire two taxis to go down there, one to ride in and the other to look at?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is what the business men in the railway company have done.  I gave an instance a fortnight ago of what happens in my own constituency.  I <Col N="2413" /> produced a time table before the Railway Tribunal and I made the same statement.  That time table showed that 11 buses and ten trains ran into a cul-de-sac of a town with 5,000 inhabitants.</P>

      <P>The reason I intervened was because of a statement made by Deputy Davin.  The railways come along now about the report of another tribunal as if we were living in normal times.  What does the company come along for now?  To choke off the other end, and prevent the transport of agricultural produce to the cities and towns at reasonable rates.  That is what is wrong with the railways this time.  What is the use of considering a report of a transport tribunal that was prepared in normal times when there was plenty of petrol, plenty of lorries and plenty of transport available? Let us remember the condition of things to-day, when lorry owners are to get only four gallons of petrol this month.</P>

      <P>In 1939 the railways said that owing to the way they had to carry on they would be bankrupt&mdash;no more and no less.  I do not believe the railways can become bankrupt even if they do their best to do so, in view of present conditions, because the whole transport of the country is being thrown at them, whether they like it or not.</P>

      <P>The railway companies can get the buses now and attach them to the engines.  I will lend them an old horse if necessary.  The position in which the railways are now is due to pure mismanagement on the part of the railway companies, nothing more and nothing less.  I understand the shareholders have the appointment of directors, who in turn have some control over policy and officials.  I have no sympathy for shareholders who allow such a condition of affairs to prevail.  I could not have sympathy for them.  What <Col N="2416" /> sympathy is there for the inefficient farmer who goes &ldquo;broke&rdquo; in his farm?  None.  He is thrown out. What sympathy is there for a business man who goes bankrupt?  None.  He is fired out.  What sympathy can you have for the railways?  What sympathy could there be for public companies that deliberately carry on transport services in a way that no decent school boy would run them?  Nobody with any common sense could have sympathy for them.  I see no use in considering a report of a tribunal that has been rendered useless by present conditions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnLymbrickEsmonde" hpid="Mr. Esmonde Mr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I think this is an eminently reasonable motion.  Taking a detached view, it seems to me that if there was any reason for the report being made, and evidence taken, it follows as a matter of course that such report should be made public.  The onus is on the Minister to show why, on grounds of high national policy, the report has not been published.  I do not know if the Minister is aware of the great interest that has been taken in this report by large sections of the community.  I have had a number of letters and I have also had interviews with persons interested in the report. There are large numbers of people drawn from all sections who are keeping their eyes open awaiting production of the report.  The report deals with the Great Southern Railways, which is the biggest non-Government concern in the country.  It is a concern that through the medium of its railway and road system serves practically the entire area of the State in one form or another, reaching from the centre of the city to practically every corner.  It owns property that pays rates in practically every county.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition it has in its employment large numbers of workers skilled in different ways and of different kinds and grades who are living in practially every portion of the State.  It also is the vehicle by means of which the public travel to and fro to different parts.  In addition, it serves the people who carry on business in the various counties.  Then there is, lastly, the group of persons vitally interested <Col N="2417" /> who own the railway, and these are the shareholders.  So, no matter what way you look at it in practically any house you go into, whether in the country districts or in the towns, there is not a responsible citizen who is not interested in the production of this report.  It creates, to say the least of it, a very bad impression indeed that the report has not been made public.  I urge on the Minister to accede to the terms of the motion and let the public know exactly what is in the report.  By not doing so, the impression is created that there is something very gravely wrong in connection with the running of the railway and the circumstances under which it is controlled.</P>
    <P>I do not want to make use of this debate for the purpose of making an attack on the railway concerned.  I think everybody agrees that there is room for very great improvement.  I suppose there is no concern in the country, outside a Government Department, in which every member of the public has a greater interest than in the true findings with regard to the activities, capabilities, and position of the Great Southern Railways.  They have all an interest in that, and any Minister who withholds information that he has, and that is alone shared by his officials, is creating, to say the least of it, a very bad impression in the country.  In addition to that, he is not doing the railway itself any particular good.  All those persons I have referred to are all vitally interested in the publication of this report, and the sooner it is published the better.  In regard to Deputy Corry's contention, so far as he made any case, that this is not a suitable time to publish the report, we all hope that we are not always going to live in a state of emergency, and at least people can be thinking out ways and means of meeting the problems that the report will produce.  Certainly, the delay so far has done incalculable harm, and the sooner it is published the better.  I, therefore, think that this motion should be accepted by the Minister.</P>
