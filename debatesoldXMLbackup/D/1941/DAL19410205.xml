      <P>There are 51 unstarred questions on the Order Paper.  Owing to the circumstances of the times, I propose to extend question time up to 4 o'clock.  Questions not reached by that time will be reprinted on to-morrow's Order Paper.  Deputies, in putting supplementary questions, should bear in mind the fact that questions are to-day abnormally numerous.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Neill</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for External Affairs if he is aware that the motor vessel &ldquo;Lock Ryan&rdquo; (registered at Skibbereen) was bombed and machine-gunned off the Irish coast when engaged in bringing a cargo of an essential raw material for an Irish industry and suffered damage to the extent of £1,700; whether representation was made to the German Government for compensation, and if the reply was to the effect that the German Government would accept no responsibility for Irish ships in waters designated by them as a blockaded area; whether any further correspondence was entered into asking the German Government what were the limits of the waters so designated by them and with what result; whether, also, the Irish Government has made, or will make, any provision for payment of compensation to Irish vessels that may meet the same fate as the &ldquo;Lock Ryan&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for External Affairs (The Taoiseach)</NameTxt>
      <P>My information, which is based on a statement by the Master of the vessel, is that the attack on the &ldquo;Lock Ryan&rdquo; took place not off the Irish coast, but at a point 40 miles north-west by north of Land's End in Cornwall.</P>
      <P>The matter was taken up with the German Government, and in December a reply was received to the effect that, as the &ldquo;Lock Ryan&rdquo; was not in Irish territorial waters but in the blockade area, and as no guarantees had been given to any country as regards shipping in this area, the German Government could not accept responsibility.</P>
      <P>With regard to insurance, that is a matter for the owner.  It would appear that in this case the precautions taken by the owner in regard to insurance were not adequate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the Minister's reply, do we admit the right of foreign Governments to open fire upon our ships and our nationals, and does our failure to make any rejoinder to that reply by the Government of the German Reich imply our consent to the outrageous proposal that the German Government or any other Government can open fire on peaceful merchant ships and destroy them on the high seas?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>No, but I am asking the Minister does his failure to make any rejoinder to the German Government's refusal to accept liability for this murderous attack on a ship on the high seas imply that our Government thinks no protest is proper against attack upon a peaceful Irish merchant-ship and its crew, sailing the high seas, by the armed forces of the German Government?</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether, in view of the recent air raids, there is any fund available from which compensation to life or property can be made; whether the question of compensation depends on the responsible country acknowledging liability, and agreeing to pay for the injury caused by air raids; whether, also, damage to decoration, electrical wiring, fittings, carpets, linoleum and furniture is included in the compensation referred to in the recent Government statement.</P>

      <P>I propose to answer Questions 3 and 4 together.  I would refer the Deputies to the public notice issued on the 11th January, 1941, that the Government takes responsibility for making good the damage caused by the recent dropping of bombs on this country.  That responsibility is assumed irrespective of the outcome of representations to any external Government. In due course, the Dáil will be asked to make the necessary financial provision.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if he will state whether it is intended to introduce proposals for legislation to enable local authorities to provide plots for cultivation in rural areas on the same lines as such plots are provided in urban areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>In rural areas boards of health already possess powers under the Labourers Acts to acquire tracts of land for the purpose of providing allotments and some of them have, in fact, provided allotments in past years.  The attention of boards of health has been drawn to the necessity for increasing food production in the country and I am aware that increased provision for allotments in the present year is already being made.  The facilities for obtaining seed potatoes under county council schemes will be available in the case of rural allotment holders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it proposed to permit boards of health and county councils to provide these plots for unemployed persons on the same terms as they are provided for similar persons in urban areas, namely, no charge but the rent, and the provision of seeds and implements?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>It would not be possible to have that done this year.  We have asked local authorities in rural areas to try to provide plots at appropriate rents, and then they can avail of county council schemes to secure credit facilities for seeds and manures.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>Except in a few cases the position is not the same as in areas controlled by urban councils or town commissioners.  Land is more easily obtained.  We feel that with the enforcement of the tillage order land in many cases will be more easily obtained in rural areas adjoining smaller towns.  The number of unemployed will not be perhaps, as numerous. There may be very few.  In addition you have labourers' cottages adjoining these towns where they have allotments.  The position has not the same analogy to urban areas.  In order to facilitate those concerned we have asked boards of health to try to provide land for those employed as well as those unemployed, where they can get allotments under the Labourers Acts in smaller towns.  One of the difficulties about operating such a scheme in the same way has been administration.  The Deputy is aware that it is very difficult for boards of health to operate in the same way as urban authorities.  The latter are local authorities on the spot, and they can verify the claims of the various people interested.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>In the rural areas unemployed people, if they want to come under the county council loan scheme for seeds and manures, will have to provide two solvent securities and repay the loan and interest within 12 months.  That makes it awkward for unemployed people to benefit by such a scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>It depends on the way the local authorities carry out the scheme.  It has not been usual to require two sureties.  In most cases one surety sufficed.  We have not had any experience that any difficulty was found by the county councils.  There has not been very much lost on the schemes and we have not pressed the local authorities, where they exercise reasonable care, and met a loss.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TimothyJMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>As the words &ldquo;rural area&rdquo; cover a very comprehensive term I wish the Minister to bear in mind what the position is.  For instance, there is virtually no difference between conditions in Naas and in Kildare.  In the town of Naas a man can get a plot from 1/-, with free seeds and implements, but in the town of Kildare, where there is no urban council, but where the condition of the unemployed is the same, a man will not be able to get a plot on the same terms as the man in Naas.

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health whether he is aware that patients are unable to obtain essential supplies of protamine insulin, that their lives are thereby endangered and whether he will undertake to issue temporary import licences to these patients when supplies are not available from the regular licensees in Eire.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>The reply to the first part of the question is in the negative. There appears to be some misapprehension as regards the import of insulin.  Insulin is a therapeutic substance and its import is governed by the provisions of the Therapeutic Substances Act, 1932.  Import licences can only be granted to the persons specified in Section 12 of the Act and there is no authority to give any exemption therefrom.  Any patient requiring insulin should be able to obtain a supply through his medical adviser.  It is not possible under the Act to grant licences for the import of <Col N="1752" /> insulin direct to patients, but I am prepared to facilitate as far as possible the grant of import licences to registered medical practitioners to meet the needs of such persons.  There are also reserve stocks of insulin in the public institutions throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Parliamentary Secretary aware that at the moment certain persons find it impossible to get insulin with which to preserve their lives; that, in fact, supplies of insulin, having been secured from Great Britain, are held up at our ports and that persons in need of them are refused access to them because they will not be given a licence to bring them in; and that a firm in Cork, who are licensees under the Therapeutic Substances Act, have not got the insulin and cannot get it?  Under these circumstances, surely people who stand in need of it for the preservation of their lives ought to be facilitated in getting it.  If the Parliamentary Secretary will say that, if anyone in Cork wants insulin and can get a doctor's certificate, he will license the doctor to get it, that is all I want.  Am I to understand that, if the person whom I have in mind goes to her doctor, that doctor will be licensed to take the insulin out of detention in Cork and give it to the patient?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, that is the position. In fact we have no power within the law to issue a licence for the import of insulin to anybody other than the classes specified in Section 12 of the Act.  There are in fact adequate supplies of insulin in the country.  If there has been individual hardship, as I understand there has been, it is because the person concerned was unaware of the proper procedure to adopt.</P>

      <P>I am not aware that the person whom Deputy Dillon is interested in has been in correspondence with the Department for nine months, or even nine weeks.  On the 28th January, an application for a licence was received from this person's private doctor, and on the 29th it was issued to the address given on the form of application.  It appears that the address was inaccurate or incomplete and the licence was returned marked &ldquo;not known&rdquo;.  On the 31st, the licence was re-issued in Cork to the patient, and apparently it reached its destination all right.  But I am not aware that there has been any prolonged correspondence with that particular individual or with anybody else on the matter.</P>

      <P>I do not wish to leave the House under the impression that I am suggesting the Parliamentary Secretary withheld supplies, because the Department up to recently had proved accommodating and facilitated the issue of special licences. Apparently, however, the patient was not informed of the correct procedure. The Parliamentary Secretary now says that if an application is made through her medical officer she will be facilitated. That is ample and very fair.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>The import of insulin is regulated by Statute and there is no power to depart from the statutory conditions.  Persons who have come to this country from England and who were attached to clinics there should get a registered medical practitioner to apply for an import permit on their behalf.  It is not possible under the Act to grant licences for the import of insulin direct to patients but I will gladly do anything to facilitate the issue of import licences in such cases through medical practitioners.</P>

      <P>With regard to the Parliamentary Secretary's statement about adequate supplies of insulin being available, I am afraid it is like the tea and the petrol.  Will the Parliamentary Secretary believe me when I say that I have at the moment in my possession correspondence from a large firm of distributors in town to one of the distributors in Cork saying that they have been writing for six weeks to one of the insulin agents in Dublin for a supply, and not only have they been unable to get a supply but unable to get a reply to their letters?</P>

      <P>I am quite prepared to give all the petrol required for the purpose of starting tractors used for agricultural purposes.  I am aware, however, that the allowance at present given, namely, eight gallons per month, is adequate for the purpose and, in fact, very few tractor owners have ever applied for more than this quantity.

      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 31 and 32 together. The reports of the Transport Tribunal were submitted to my predecessor just prior to the outbreak of the present war.  The examination of these reports has been proceeding in my Department and in the other Departments of the Government concerned in the light of the continuously changing conditions which have been experienced since then.  It is clear that until there is some stability in the circumstances in which our transport undertakings have to work, final decisions as to the recommendations in the report cannot be arrived at, and that, indeed, the whole position may require to be reviewed afresh when trading and transport conditions become normal. In this situation, there would seem to be little public utility in publishing reports which were based on circumstances which have altered materially since the outbreak of war and which will, no doubt, continue to change during the whole period of the present emergency.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. Ruttledge)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Cork City Management Act of 1929 was the first of a series of Acts providing for the adoption of the council-manager plan of local government. In the 12 years that have elapsed since it was passed the system of local government which it embodied has been extended, first to Dublin and Dun Laoghaire, then in succession to the Cities of Limerick and Waterford and, finally, by the County Management Act of last year to the counties.  As experience was gained provisions were inserted in the later Acts which were not included in the Cork Act and the purpose of this Bill, stated briefly, is to bring the Cork Act of 1929 up to date.  The views of the city council have been obtained and it will be found that the Bill gives effect to most of the recommendations that have been made by the council.  It provides for triennial instead of annual elections to the council, for the consolidation of the existing rates into one municipal rate, and for an extension of the reserved functions of the council.  It also places an obligations on the manager to attend the council meetings and arrange for the attendance of such other officers as may be necessary, and gives the council the same power as other city councils with respect to requiring the manager to exercise functions not reserved to the council subject <Col N="1821" /> to the usual conditions.  There is also included a simplified procedure for boundary extension.</P>
    <P>Provision is made for combining the office of town clerk with that of city manager.  Cork is the only county borough in which these offices are not held by the same person.  The existing town clerk will, however, not be disturbed, but on the first vacancy in the office of town clerk the provisions of the Bill will come into force.</P>
    <P>With regard to Section 4, which deals with the electoral area&mdash;at present the city forms one electoral area&mdash;the council do not wish to have it divided, but are of opinion that there should be power to do so at some future time if it is considered advisable.  The Bill makes provision for that.  It also, as I have stated, provides for triennial instead of annual elections.  Under the Act of 1929 one-third of the members of the council was to be elected annually. This provision was in the nature of an experiment designed to prevent a complete change of membership in any one year.  The precedent has not been followed elsewhere and the council wish to abandon annual elections, which are expensive.  New provisions for the filling of casual vacancies on the council are necessary in view of the cessation of annual elections.  The council will elect a person to fill a casual vacancy. Section 7 provides for certain additions to the functions reserved to the council.</P>
    <P>In Cork County Borough there are several rates&mdash;improvement, borough, library, water and poor rates&mdash;and each has a separate fund.  The Bill consolidates all these rates except what is called the contract water rate, which is in the nature of a rent or payment for a purchase of water, and creates a single municipal fund.  The incidence of the rates will not be altered but wherever necessary adjustments will be made.  Where premises are unoccupied for a reasonable cause a limited refund can be made.</P>
    <P>It was originally intended to include in this Bill provisions relating to the superannuation of whole-time employees of the corporation, but it has been decided to deal with this matter <Col N="1822" /> in a Bill of more general application to be introduced later on.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I think before the Bill passes, a word of congratulation should be given to the former Minister for Local Government, who had the courage and the foresight to make this remarkable improvement in the matter of local administration which has now become so universally popular.  I recollect that when those Bills were first introduced here they occasioned something very little short of a riot, but the people who then ran a very high temperature over them have now become converted.  The Bill, is, however, an improvement upon the original Bill, but it is some satisfaction to the former Minister to notice that it has taken 12 years to find out that it could be improved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one point which I should like to raise on the measure; it is in connection with the agricultural grant.  In the First Schedule, I think, provision is made for assessing at half rates agricultural land and so on.  I presume that the corporation will get, both now and in the future, whatever proportion of the agricultural grant they would be entitled to by reason of whatever land would be within the area of their jurisdiction.  Let us assume, for the sake of comparison, that at the moment there are 200 acres of land which in the normal course is entitled to its proportion of the agricultural grant in relief of rates.  If my recollection is correct&mdash;I have not had time to look the matter up&mdash;there is some amount of money earmarked for the various boroughs in respect of payments out of the agricultural grants in relief of rates.  In the event of an extension of the boundary, if that 200 acres of land should run out to, let us say, 1,200 or 2,000 acres, will there be corresponding provision made in the extension for payment of an extra slice of the agricultural grant?  It would be equitable that there should be, because the grant is paid in respect of lands.  If the County Council of Cork has not to make any relief out of, let us say, £<i>x</i> that they get, and if the land they have is reduced by £<i>y</i>, their liability then is £<i>x</i>-£<i>y.</i>  By reason of <Col N="1823" /> the addition of the lands to the valuation of Cork, under the terms of this Bill, the rates would be assessable only on half of the valuation.  I take it then, that in any extension which will take place there will also be provision for payment of an extra slice of the agricultural grant in relief of rates.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid Deputy Cosgrace is not quite correct in assuming there is general agreement about the Bill.  I think that the same opposition which there was to the Bill some time after it was introduced is definitely there to-day, due to the fact that there is too much executive authority centred in one man.  Even those of us who are not opposed to the managerial system, are definitely opposed to one man being given such executive authority over the citizens of Cork as one man has at the moment.</P>

      <P>In regard to the matter which the last Deputy has raised, the power is there for the Minister to do it by provisional order, but those provisional orders are not and will not be made until some inquiry has been held.  Deputy Cosgrave referred to the agricultural grant.  That is a matter which I will have looked into. I think the feeling is in the direction stated by the Deputy, but in order to be quite clear I will let the Deputy know before the Committee Stage is reached, so that if the Bill does not meet the point sufficiently he will be afforded an opportunity of putting down a suitable amendment.  I do not want to go into the principle of the Bill as raised by Deputy Hickey, except to say that I think Deputy Hickey should be very satisfied in the sense that, if it goes far, it gives more power to the local body than it had up to the present.  This Bill has been put together on suggestions or recommendations made by the local body themselves. It was largely on their recommendations that this Bill was framed. Since the Bill has been put into draft embodying those recommendations of the local body it has been <Col N="1825" /> submitted to that local body, and while they may be preparing amendments we have not heard from them that they were in any way dissatisfied with the terms of the present Bill.</P>

I think there is a case for that.  I know the Minister's argument will be that there must be some finality, and I think everybody will agree with him that there should be some finality.  I think that if he gives another year from the passing of this measure there could certainly be a finality then, because very nearly 20 years will have expired since the Civil War.</P>

      <P>I have gone as far as it was possible to go in the circumstances to meet Deputy O'Higgins's wishes; I could not go all the way. The cases which will be dealt with under this particular amendment are mentioned in the first paragraph of the amendment&mdash;&ldquo;Every application for a grant of a disability pension shall be made within 12 months after the date of the passing of this Act.&rdquo;  No person whose case has already been dealt with can come forward under this.  If we do not have some finality in these cases they will be like the famous brook, going on for ever.  We cannot permit that.  All this matter was discussed on a previous occasion; arguments were put forward and carefully considered and it was not found possible, in the circumstances, to meet all the cases referred to by various Deputies.  This is the limit to which I found it possible to go.</P>

      <P>Every application shall be made within 12 months after the <Col N="1829" /> passing of this Act.  If a person has had his case already examined and if, after it was thoroughly investigated, he was turned down for a pension, he cannot apply again under this legislation. But if he had an application in and it was not reached, that case can be heard now under this legislation. Any individual who feels he has developed a disease, arising out of his service, which was not noticeable before this, can now apply under this particular section.</P>

      <P>That is the point I was anxious to make.  Suppose a man who was turned down under the 1927 Act, or subsequent amending Acts, has now developed a disease which, he contends, arose out of his service, is he to be excluded by reason of the fact that his case was determined at a time when he was not, perhaps, able to put it so convicingly as he could now?  I have one particular case in mind.  It is the case of a man who has been already in touch with the Minister for Agriculture.  He is a good friend of the Government Party, and was a prominent supporter of theirs during the Civil War.  To my own knowledge that man in recent years developed very serious nervous tremors.  I think it can hardly be doubted that these developed through the extraordinary hardships that man went through, both in pre-Truce and post-Truce days. Under the Minister's amendment that man is precluded from applying again. The actual wording of the document refusing the pension precludes him because it says that he was not a person to whom the Act applied.</P>

It is the case of a young man who has been in touch, I believe, with every member of the House, judging by the amount of correspondence that I have received from him.  He is a man who served in the old days, and was turned down on a claim for a disability pension based on tuberculosis. To meet him in the street one would think that he could not live very much longer.  He claims that the disease arose out of his service.  His application for a pension was turned down on <Col N="1830" /> more than one occasion, but he still persists, and he has hopes that he might have his claim reheard under this legislation.  Is it likely that this case could be reheard under the terms of this Bill?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before section 6 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  The managers of a certified school shall, from time to time as occasion requires, appoint a person to be responsible for the immediate control and supervision of such school, and every person so appointed shall be known and is in this section referred to as the resident manager of such school.</P>
      <P>(2)  The resident manager of a certified school shall reside ordinarily on the school premises.</P>
      <P>(3)  The managers of a certified school may authorise the resident manager of such school to exercise and perform such of their powers, functions, and duties (including in particular their powers, functions, and duties under Sections 52, 53, 67 and 68 of the Principal Act) as they think fit.</P>
      <P>(4)  If the Minister is satisfied that the resident manager of a certified school has failed or neglected to discharge efficiently the duties of his position or that he is unsuitable or unfit to discharge those duties, the Minister may request the managers of the school to remove such resident manager from his position and the managers shall comply with such request (unless withdrawn) within one month after receipt thereof.</P>
      <P>(5)  Every appointment of the resident manager of a certified school shall be made either&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  if the appointment is a first appointment and the school is a certified school upon the passing of this Act&mdash;within one month after the passing of this Act,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(b)  if the appointment is a first appointment and the school becomes a certified school after the passing of this Act&mdash;within one month after the school becomes a certified school, and <Col N="1834" /> (c)  if the appointment is not a first appointment &mdash; within one month after the occurrence of the vacancy calling for such appointment.</P>
    <P>(6)  The managers of a certified school shall, within ten days after appointing a resident manager, notify his name to the Minister.</P>
    <P>Section 5, as originally drafted, was based on a recommendation contained in the Report of the Commission of Inquiry which stated at paragraph 70:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We recommend (a) that the appointment of managers should be subject to the approval of the Minister for Education, and (b) that it should be within the competence of the Minister to report to his or her superior with a view to the replacement of a manager who was found unsatisfactory.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think it is clear from that recommendation that the commission had in mind the person actually having direct and immediate control of the school. I feel that, as the Bill stands, the section may have been too wide, and that the new amendment makes matters much more clear.  What is now proposed is that the person in actual charge of the industrial school or reformatory will be known as the resident manager.  The expression &ldquo;managers&rdquo; is used throughout the Principal Act, and I am advised that probably that word connotes religious Orders, for example, having charge of the school.  Of course, it was not at any time the intention that the Minister should take powers with regard to a religious Order in that sense.  All that was sought was what, in fact, is now being made quite clear, that in the event of the resident manager, as we propose to call him, being found unsatisfactory, the Minister should have power to ask that he be changed.  Sub-section (1) deals with the appointment of such resident managers.  Sub-section (2) provides that he shall reside ordinarily on the school premises.  Sub-section (3) provides for the delegation of their powers by the managers of the school to the resident manager.  Sub-section (4) is the important clause.  It states:&mdash;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1835" /> If the Minister is satisfied that the resident manager of a certified school has failed or neglected to discharge efficiently the duties of his position, or that he is unsuitable or unfit to discharge those duties, the Minister may request the managers of the school to remove such resident manager from his position, and the managers shall comply with such request (unless withdrawn) within one month after receipt thereof.</P>
    <P>It has been pointed out that, with regard to the principle in the existing Draft of the Bill&mdash;that the Minister should approve the appointment of the manager, now called the resident manager&mdash;the Minister might not have sufficient knowledge at his disposal to enable him to say whether the person to be appointed was suitable or not. Moreover, there is the question of the internal arrangements within a religious Order which might demand that the nomination of the manager lie in a certain direction, or that a certain person might have to be appointed.  I think that the schools and all concerned will be satisfied with the new arrangements, whereby it is provided, as set out in sub-section (5), that the new appointment or first appointment is made with the least possible delay, within one month, and under sub-section (6) that notification shall be made to the Minister of such appointment within ten days.  The resident manager will function, and if it is found that, for some reason or other, the resident manager so appointed is inefficient or unsatisfactory, the Minister can take steps to require that a change be made.  That is really the essential thing that the commission recommended&mdash;that the Minister should have power to make a change or to recommend that a change be made, and it is thought that we should have legal sanction also to enable us to make such a change where the Minister considers it necessary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I have reason to believe that the schools will not offer any objection to this proposal.  In fact, no great difficulty has arisen up to the present.  The Department has been anxious, as far as possible, not to interfere except in cases where it was found absolutely necessary to raise this question of the removal of a manager.  I find that the schools have been agreeable and anxious to cooperate, even to the extent of changing the manager, where the inspector felt that, for example, the manager might be getting rather old.</P>

      <P>Personally, I think it would be considered as interference with the Reverend Mother or Reverend Superior.  If they are getting old, that is a matter for their own Orders and not for the Government.  I believe it would be resented very much.  We are discussing this in a very small House, but I certainly think it would be resented.  Government interference with the hospitals controlled by Orders <Col N="1837" /> was resented and will be resented for all time.  Therefore, I take objection to any Government interference with these orders, either male or female. They have done splendidly up to the present.</P>

      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That Section 7 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1840" />
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>On Section 7, Sir, I want to raise a matter which might properly be raised either on Section 3 or on this section.  This section provides that &ldquo;the reference in Section 55 of the Principal Act to the buildings of a certified school shall be construed as including a reference to any grounds and premises used for recreational purposes in connection with such school.&rdquo; I want, on this section, to make the case for something that would attach some value to this Bill because, as it stands in its present form, I think it is barely worth the consideration it is getting, for it does nothing.  The whole problem of juvenile delinquency in this country is involved in this Bill, and while we retain that fact in our minds we have got to remember also that the children in industrial schools are, in the vast majority, children who have been convicted of no delinquency whatever. The delinquents in industrial schools are a microscopic minority, but they are the problem children.</P>
      <P>Now, I was privileged, during the lifetime of the late Mr. Cussen, who was the magistrate presiding over the Children's Court, to attend, from time to time, the proceedings in that court, and I watched with particular interest the method of dealing with delinquent children and saw many of them committed for delinquency to industrial schools.  Again and again I was struck by the fact that the industrial schools did not provide one adjuvant to enable the magistrate presiding over that Children's Court to do substantial justice to the children before him, and that there were no premises where a child charged with breaches of the law could be put for the purpose of observation and medical report.  Now, I am prepared to vouch to this House that six out of ten children convicted of delinquency before the Juvenile Court in this city and committed to industrial schools were not delinquent children but sick children, and that, instead of committing them to industrial schools as delinquents, they should have been sent to hospitals as sick children, there to be cured and restored to their families.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, do not let us in this house over-sentimentalise <Col N="1841" /> this problem.  Many of the children brought to that court are &ldquo;tough eggs&rdquo;, and you have got to remember that fact.  City children of 14 and 15 years of age are very often as cute, as troublesome, and as corrupt as adolescent youths of criminal tendency of 18 or 19 in the country would ordinarily be, but, in addition to those &ldquo;tough eggs&rdquo; who want discipline and who have got to get it if they are to be protected from themselves, there are the children who are suffering under nervous strains of one kind or another and who manifest the symptoms of that nervous strain by delinquent conduct of a recidivist character.  And we ought to remember this: that gravely as I have had to complain of much that went on in the Children's Court from time to time, as a general rule no child is taken from its parents and sent to one of these schools unless the child has been before the court again and again, and that is as it should be.  The trouble, however, is that when the magistrate hears the story of this child's repeated offences he has nobody to whom he can turn for information as to whether this repeated return to misconduct on the part of the child is due to some physical or health defect or is due simply to chronic lack of discipline in that child's home, which discipline must be provided in an institution.</P>
    <P>I put it to the Deputies of this House: supposing a Deputy of this House had a thirteen-year-old son who was not only mischievous but apparently vicious, and who, on being subjected to the normal correction of a Christian parent, returned to his vicious practice again and again, would any Deputy in this House send for the Guards, consign the child to Summerhill and thence to an industrial school, or would he go to the family physician and say: &ldquo;Which is the best paediatrist in this city to examine my child and determine what it is that makes the child behave like a young savage?&rdquo; Of course, the family physician would name two or three physicians in Dublin who specialise in the treatment of children's complaints, psychological and physical, and say: &ldquo;If you bring him to that doctor he will probably <Col N="1842" /> prescribe a course of treatment that will make that child all right; or perhaps it is something wrong with yourself and you are not treating the child the right way, or there may be some inherent defect in the child's constitution which needs correction, and when that is corrected the child will become a normal kid like other children and you can send it to school in the ordinary way.&rdquo;  If that would be the attitude of every Deputy in respect of his own children, what right have we to establish a system of industrial schools or reformatory schools in this country which does not permit the children of the poor to get the kind of treatment our own children can get? Surely, as the trustees of the poor in this country, we have no right to withhold from the children that which we assume to be essential for our own children.  That is all I am asking.  I am not asking that a bold child should be elevated up and given opportunities and advantages that the well-behaved children of respectable or wealthier parents would not be able to get.  I am not asking you to equip the industrial schools, in this country like a fashionable secondary school.  I am not asking for any concession at all. Indeed, at this moment there is no question of mitigation of the rigours of discipline obtaining in any institution in the country.</P>
    <P>All I am asking is that machinery and premises will be provided which would separate a child who requires discipline, and for whom discipline would be good, from a child who does not stand in need of stricter discipline, and to whom stricter discipline will do irremediable harm.  I want to say at once that I have always received every courtesy and every facility I asked from the Minister for Education, or the Minister for Justice, to visit institutions such as the Borstal, or the reformatory and other institutions where delinquent juveniles are treated. Having visited them, I think it is true to say that the principals, certainly the principal of the Borstal and the reformatory, would agree with my contention, that a large proportion of the inmates of these institutions should be <Col N="1843" /> in curative establishments rather than in semi-penal institutions.  The principals have to take those who are committed there and do the best they can with them.  This Bill does not deal with reformatories and with the Borstal, but it deals with children who will end up in the Borstal, or in reformatories, if we do not take proper measures to provide, in their malleable age, either the treatment which will switch them away from what appears to be possibly criminal tendencies and restore them to the paths of normalcy and decent citizenship.</P>
    <P>I appeared before this commission when it was sitting and I pressed that viewpoint upon them, at least to give us some kind of establishment where we could differentiate between the sick child and the bold child who requires discipline.  This wretched commission, this incompetent, futile, hopeless, obscurantist body wrote the most idiotic report that ever disgraced a body of people that sat round a table to enquire into a grave social problem. There is not a country in the world, where the treatment of juvenile delinquents requires any attention that has not established a clinic.  You have the Tavistock in London to deal with delinquency in juveniles, advising the magistrate who deals with charges.  In New Jersey even under Boss Hague you have a most elaborate system of enquiry into the physical and psychological circumstances of the child before it is committed to a reformatory.</P>

      <P>Deputy Byrne reminds me of Glasgow.  In Denver, Colorado, there is a well-known institution.  The same is true of Chicago.  I have no doubt that New York has a similar institution, and I know that San Francisco has one.  With the continental system I am not as familiar as I am with that of New Zealand and Australia, where I know that such assistance is forthcoming.  I do not know about Canada.  Here in this country, which thumps its craw about a Christian Constitution, and where we hold ourselves up for our ultra-Christian <Col N="1844" /> development, the neurasthenic child which, as a result of neurasthenia comes into conflict with the law, can rot in institutions which have no facilities for dealing with that particular problem.  We close our eyes to that.  We simply do nothing but shake our heads.  I often wondered what the Minister says to himself. Does he ever go and ask the heads of the Borstal, the reformatories, or the industrial schools about these children?</P>

Does he lose interest in their future the moment they are shovelled into reformatories, or put into industrial schools?  Does he ever sit down to ask himself when he is dealing with children of 11, 12, 13 and 14 what is the effect of the treatment going to be on them when they are 21 or 22 years of age?  Is not that his problem?  Ought he not go to the Principals of the Borstal and say: &ldquo;Do you get many of my boys here?&rdquo; Ought he not go to the reformatories and say: &ldquo;I am very anxious to know what becomes of industrial school boys who are committed for delinquency.&rdquo; He gets up here and boasts of the fact that he has never done that, and that it is unfair to ask him to do that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

They are in the Borstal because no premises were provided in which these children could be looked after when there was still time to look after them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that.  I am putting the responsibility on him, and I am asking that he should go to the Borstal, that he should go to the slums, go to the hospitals, or anywhere he thinks these children at adolescence may find their way and ask: &ldquo;Has my treatment of these children during their childhood been responsible for putting them into the Borstal at 21?&rdquo;  It is the obscurantist idea that there is no responsibility for them that I inveigh against.  Take my case.  What responsibility have I for the Borstal; what responsibility have I for Mountjoy, what responsibility have I for Maryboro'?  Is it a criminal offence on my part to interest myself and to be solicitous as to how these places are carried on?  Should the Minister not be the protector of these children?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Should he not interest himself in their subsequent history, and if he discovers that a great many of them, who <Col N="1846" /> were under him in industrial schools end up in the Borstal, should he not have that inquired into?  Should he not ask himself: How is it that my treatment did not prevent that?  Then I think he would learn that a great many of his charges who end up in the Borstal are mentally deranged.  I do not mean that they are mad, but I say that they are suffering from some psychological maladjustment which could more properly be set right in their childhood by adequate medical treatment.  The fact that they are denied medical treatment in childhood when there is still time to give it, is the Minister's responsibility.  The reason they are not getting it is, that no provision is made to provide the kind of institution that I want, where a sick child should be segregated from the vicious child and treated properly.</P>

      <P>Of course not.  Deputies may ask why I get so vehement about this.  Because, for the last seven or eight years, year after year, I have raised this question.  Then when the commission was set up I was at once challenged: &ldquo;Will you go before the commission and give evidence?&rdquo;  I said, &ldquo;Certainly.&rdquo;  I was asked: &ldquo;Do you want to give evidence in private?&rdquo;  I said: &ldquo;No, I want to give evidence in public; I want to be cross-examined in public, and I want every member of the commission to cross-examine me in public.&rdquo;  Year after year after year, I have raised this question, and year after year after year, every futile, obscurantist and blind opposition is given to a proposal of this kind, God only knows why.  It will not cost us as much as one day's operation of the maddest of the Government's schemes. The cost will be trivial; it will be impossible to devise a tax small enough to be appropriated exclusively to this service.  It is going to save for this country dozens of children who will otherwise be converted into criminals through no fault of their own.  Surely it is time for the Minister to face his responsibility in that matter, and to provide in this Bill, or some Bill, accommodation where the work I have outlined can be effectively done.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. A. Byrne Mr. A. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>During Deputy Dillon's speech I was almost breaking the rules of the House by loudly applauding his statement on this matter. It is one in which I have taken a very great interest, and probably by now I can nearly show a bias against every Bill brought into this House dealing with children.  I am glad that the children have at last found a vigorous advocate.  I have had many cases brought to my notice of boys and girls who are sent to an industrial school for periods which I and their parents and those who knew their cases thought were unjustifiable.  The petty offences that they commit could be dealt with in an institution such as Deputy Dillon has outlined, and which are to be found in other countries.</P>
      <P>I was brought into such institutions in various parts of America.  I was brought into an institution in Glasgow such as has been outlined by Deputy Dillon.  It was a large private house, and was controlled by nuns.  When a child commits some small offence, instead of being brought to the police court, the parents consent to let the child go into this institution for a few weeks or months.  Most of the rooms contained different types of toys and books, which would appeal to the children according to their age, and there was a medical officer attached to the institution.  At the end of a month or so the child's mother would be told that the child had been cured.  As a result of the work done in that institution, the parents were saved from having the children taken from them and put into an industrial school for five years.  I do not want to be misunderstood, because I was misunderstood once before, as to what can be done in industrial schools.  These schools are doing great work, but at least 25 per cent.  of the children sent to industrial schools in Dublin City, if they were treated as Deputy Dillon has stated, would be sent back to their parents within a month.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Take school attendance cases.  Is it right that a child who, owing to some special circumstances, is prevented from attending school, should be taken from the parents and put into an industrial <Col N="1848" /> school?  I know of cases where poor parents could not provide boots or clothing for their children, and, in order to preserve their health, they kept the children from school in wet weather.  Eventually they found themselves in the police court.  If they could afford a solicitor or a counsel to appear for them, the case could be properly explained and the child sent home.  Only last week a school attendance officer found a remedy for a child not attending school.  Out of his own pocket the man, who has only a small salary, purchased a pair of boots for the child and got the child to go to school.  If we give these children boots and clothing, and if they can get a breakfast, the majority of them will go to school.  I would make an appeal on behalf of that class of people who are not able to defend themselves.  There is no use in hiding the fact that most of those sent to industrial schools belong to the poorer classes.  I appeal to the Government to establish an institution such as was outlined by Deputy Dillon.  The late Mrs. Maud Walsh, who was a well-known advocate of the cause of children, several times suggested the establishment of such an institution.</P>
    <P>Might I briefly cite a case which happened two years ago when I was Lord Mayor?  A girl of about 16 came to the Mansion House with a large bag of books at least half a stone weight. I found from examining the exercise books that splendid marks had been gained in every subject and I said to her that they were very good.  I thought she was going to ask me for a reference, as hundreds of others had, in order to get employment.  I was about to write a reference for her when she began to cry, and said these were her sister's school books, that she was aged 13 and that she had been taken up for not attending school.  That child had excellent marks, as I say. She was in the fourth or fifth book and, I think, had a medal for Irish.  It was necessary to keep that child at home from school as her mother was ill.  That child was taken away from the parents and put into an industrial school, and it took me three months to get the <Col N="1849" /> Minister to investigate the case and release the child.  Is that a proper case for an industrial school?  If such an institution as Deputy Dillon suggests was in operation, the committee would say that it was only necessary to caution the mother, and the child.  I am afraid of going too far in connection with this matter, as I am very interested in it.</P>

      <P>Borstal is a penal institution, pure and simple.  If the court considers that reformatory treatment would be more suitable for boys or girls between the ages of 16 and 17, we think that it should have a discretion to send them there.  Personally, I would have no objection to making a similar change in the case of industrial schools, but the feeling of these schools is against it. Those in control of industrial schools feel that, after the age of 16, it would be impossible for them to deal with offenders.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister consider modifying the section to this extent: to allow the age of 17 years to stand for industrial schools, subject to approval being given by the managers? As the matter stands, we are applying here a kindly, beneficial corrective.  We are saving a boy from Borstal by allowing him to be sent to a reformatory. As regards industrial schools, it might be quite proper for the managers to refuse to take a boy after the age of 16, but cases might arise in which it would be better for a boy to be sent to an industrial school than to a reformatory. I am thinking now of the case in which a boy was being committed for a first offence.  In such a case the manager of an industrial school might be prepared to take a boy even though he was over 16 years of age.  I would like to know if the Minister has considered that aspect of the matter: of allowing the beneficial effect of this raising of the age to apply to the industrial school as well as to the reformatory.</P>

It could always be argued, no matter what age limit you fix, that boys or girls, up to the age of say 15 years and 11 months, would be committed, but that boys or girls who had reached the age of 16 years and one month would not be committed.</P>

      <P>What I was going to point out was this: the industrial schools say that, in the treatment of boys or girls over 16 years of age, quite different considerations have to be borne in mind.  I gathered from them that they feel that a different industrial school system is necessary for boys or girls who might be committed after the age of 16 years from that provided for those under that age.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 3, to delete in lines 25 and 26 the words &ldquo;for any reason&rdquo; and substitute the words &ldquo;by reason of negligence, inebriety, immorality or other similar cause.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Instead of giving the court power to commit &ldquo;for any reason,&rdquo; as was laid down in the original draft of the Bill, I now propose to amend the section by inserting the words set out.  It was indicated, on the Second Reading of the Bill, that the term &ldquo;for any reason&rdquo; was too wide, and that specific instances of parental shortcomings ought to be set out in the Bill.  I have since carefully considered the matter. I have been in touch with the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children&mdash;the Society, I may say, has been very helpful in this matter&mdash; and I feel that the new amendment will meet the situation.  If the court is satisfied that the &ldquo;negligence&rdquo; is serious, then, obviously, that ought to be a ground for committal.  Similarly, with regard to &ldquo;inebriety and immorality.&rdquo; The phrase &ldquo;or other similar cause&rdquo; means any other reason which would follow from the three set out in the amendment.  The expression in the original Children Act of 1908 was &ldquo;by reason of criminal and drunken habits&rdquo;.  Having considered the matter carefully, I felt that the section ought to be tightened up somewhat. Amendment No. 2, which we are now discussing, with Amendment No. 5 will, I think, cover all the cases that I have in mind, the types of cases in which I think there is a <i>prima facie</i> case for bringing the matter before the court and giving the court discretion to consider whether committal to an industrial school would not be in the best interests of the child.</P>

      <P>My amendment No. 3 reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In paragraph (c), lines 25 and 26, to delete the words &ldquo;for any reason&rdquo; and substitute the words &ldquo;by reason of reputed criminal and drunken habits.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister and I agree that the original words &ldquo;for any reason&rdquo; are far too wide and should be deleted. The words I propose are &ldquo;by reason of reputed criminal or drunken habits,&rdquo; the words in the old section being &ldquo;by reason of criminal or drunken habits&rdquo;.  The objection found in the working of the section, and the only reason for an amendment of it, was that it was very difficult, unless there had been an actual conviction, to prove that a person was of criminal or drunken habits.  It was the matter of proof that gave rise to any difficulty, and my suggestion to put in the word &ldquo;reputed&rdquo; before the words &ldquo;criminal or drunken habits&rdquo; means that if it is generally known in the neighbourhood that a person is of criminal habits, or generally known that a person is of drunken habits, a child should be taken away, but there is no necessity for widening or enlarging the words.  The Minister's amendment, to my mind, is shocking.  What is meant by &ldquo;negligence&rdquo;, as used in the amendment, in looking after a child?  If a mother is negligent because she does not darn the child's stockings, is a child to be taken away from the mother?  If a mother neglects to wash a child's face or darn a child's stockings, is the child to be taken away from her?  That is the suggestion the Minister puts forward.  His words are altogether too wide and I suggest that the word &ldquo;reputed&rdquo; is <Col N="1855" /> quite enough to deal with any difficulty that may arise, or has arisen up to the present.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the views of Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney on this matter.  The only improvement on the Bill as it stands is that, for a phrase which openly challenges the attention, a word is substituted which gives the same powers to the court but does it in a way that will not be so much noticed by those who read the Bill.  Not merely is the phrase altogether too wide, but it is altogether too vague, and it leaves it to the whim, if I may say so, of a district justice to interpret it in any way he likes.  The chances are that it will be interpreted in one way in connection with poor parents and in an entirely different way in connection with rich parents.  Where rich parents neglect their children, there will be no question at all of their being brought before the court because the children are well-dressed and their material welfare apparently looked after, but there may be a great deal more neglect in their case, so far as the proper bringing up of the children is concerned, than in the case of poor parents, but we need not be in the least afraid that the Act will be invoked against them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What I object to in the Bill as it stood, and still object to in this amendment, is that it goes out of its way, quite unnecessarily, to meet the few cases the Minister referred to on Second Reading, to tighten up the Bill and to interfere more with the rights of parents.  Again, I put it that the Minister approaches this whole question from a different angle from that from which I approach it.  His idea is to find reasons for committing children to industrial schools; my inclination is to find reasons for leaving them with their parents.  I do not want to find additional reasons for committing children, however high an opinion I may have of some of these industrial schools.  Prior to the right of the State, prior to the right of industrial schools, and prior to the discretion of a district justice to interpret such a vague word as the word &ldquo;negligence&rdquo;&mdash;which, I presume, has reference even to the <Col N="1856" /> child, although it is so vague that one cannot be sure&mdash;is the right of the parent, and surely the Minister must be aware that the whole tendency of our modern life is to cut in on and interfere with the rights of the parents. Here we deliberately go out of our way to find further ways of doing it.  That is the reason I object to the amendment.</P>
    <P>If there is to be power to commit children more or less for the reasons which stood in the original Bill, I would want a narrower definition and not a wider definition.  The Minister said&mdash;quite justifiably, but I think he was indulging in understatement when he said it&mdash;that the term was reason ably wide.  It is so wide that it is quite as objectionable as the phrase in the Bill.  I have not the remotest idea of what negligence may mean, and I have less idea of what a district justice may make out of it.  Much will depend on his attitude as to the relative rights of parents, the State and children and we have no means of determining as between these rights in the Bill as it stands.  I hold that the rights of the parent are fundamental, and that the very best of reasons must be given for interfering with or cutting down those rights, but if it is left to a district justice, who may be under the impression, as some of them are, quite honestly and <i>bona fide</i> under the impression that it is much better for a child to be sent to an industrial school, if a man in the office of a district justice approaches a case brought before him in that spirit, how is he bound by his conscience to interpret the word &ldquo;negligence&rdquo;?  He is bound to interpret it practically in the very way in which he would interpret &ldquo;for any reason&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to consider this amendment further.  It does not meet the objections I personally have against this section, and I ask him, too, to note that we have solemnly recognised the rights of parents in our Constitution.  I cannot say whether it is one of the phrases in the Constitution which was an expression of pious opinion, or one binding on future legislation.  If the latter, you are deliberately violating the principle laid down there.  Perhaps it was not meant seriously.  I gather that <Col N="1857" /> it was not meant seriously, if such a vague word is to be used, and if district justices are to be given this immense latitude and power.  There are district justices who believe that children ought, in their own interest, to be taken from their parents and sent to industrial schools.  They are bound to give what is, in my opinion, a very objectionable interpretation of this word &ldquo;negligence&rdquo;.  There may be more negligence in the case of parents whose cases will never come before the court.  I am very much afraid that &ldquo;negligence&rdquo; will be interpreted in a purely economic sense&mdash; the provision of proper clothing and food for the children.  There are other important things in which a parent might be negligent.  The word &ldquo;negligence&rdquo; may mean anything, and for that reason I object to it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>Cases have come before the courts in which, if the district justice had had discretion, he would have sent the children to an industrial school, feeling that it was in their own best interest that that should be done. There is a great deal of exaggeration in Deputy O'Sullivan's contention that the courts will interpret the word &ldquo;negligence&rdquo; in the widest possible way, and that there is a genuine risk that, under our present system, justices will commit boys and girls without proper cause.  My anxiety is to give the justice sufficient discretion in a case which may not be covered by the 1908 Act.  In my opinion, &ldquo;negligence&rdquo; covers a large number of cases, some of which might not be serious and others of which might be quite serious. For example, so little attention might be given to the cleanliness of children that a serious outbreak of skin disease might occur, affecting the members of the household.  That has happened. There are also cases in which parents, even though in receipt of reasonable remuneration and in constant employment, do not look after the interests of their children in what members of this House would consider a reasonable way.  If I were asked whether I would rather that the court should have discretion to deal with such cases&mdash;though they might be very few&mdash;at the risk of <Col N="1858" /> some justice making a blunder, or that, unless some definite offence had been proved against the parent, he would not be considered unsuitable, my inclination would be to take the first course, and to give the justice the greatest discretion possible.  As I explained on the Second Reading, this amendment is on the lines of recent legislation in other countries.</P>

      <P>Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney has referred to the difficulty of interpreting the phrase &ldquo;criminal and drunken habits&rdquo;.  An attempt is being made to get over that by inserting the word &ldquo;reputed&rdquo;.  I believe the word &ldquo;reputed&rdquo; will not carry you any further. On the contrary, I hold that it will bring in a certain amount of vagueness, and might easily create a situation that, merely because of a parent's ill-repute, he would find himself in court.  It seems to me, not being a lawyer, that the word &ldquo;reputed&rdquo; is rather vague, and might involve all kinds of considerations.  The word &ldquo;negligence&rdquo; would, to the ordinary justice, suggest the consideration whether the parent, having regard to his circumstances, was fulfilling his duty to his children.  I ask the House to accept my amendment, which has been carefully thought out.</P>

      <P>The word &ldquo;reputed&rdquo;, which I have adopted, is not being used for the first time.  If a Guard is in the witness box, you cannot ask him what his opinion is of the prisoner's character, but you can ask him what is the prisoner's character according to general repute.  &ldquo;General repute&rdquo; is the only way in which the courts arrive at knowledge of what the character of a person is, that is to say, what the neighbours and people who know him intimately think about him. If it is found that drunkenness or criminality is difficult of proof because of absence of convictions, a person can say: &ldquo;All the neighbours think that that person is of drunken or criminal habits.&rdquo;  On that evidence, though there may never have been a conviction against the parent, the child might be <Col N="1859" /> taken from him.  The Minister's word is altogether too wide, and I think my amendment would satisfy everybody.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to get this question into its context.  As I understand, the difficulties facing the promoters of this Bill are mainly founded on a conflict between two principles, one of which is that the family and family rights should be safeguarded. That recognises that the family is the best place for the upbringing of children.  In the Constitution, it was laid down that, in exceptional cases, where the parents, by reason of some kind of physical or moral defect, failed in their duty, the State might intervene and take charge of their children.  The second principle, which is contrary to the first, is that, on occasions, because the home is derelict or because of bad or evil influence, the State might come in, take young people out of the control of their parents&mdash;that being regarded as the proper method for the bringing-up of children&mdash;and hand them over to some outside influence.</P>
      <P>I read the debate on the Second Reading of the Bill and I noticed that a laboured attempt was made to get these industrial or reformatory schools looked at in a newer light by applying to them the term &ldquo;boarding school&rdquo;, as if the changing of a word in the case of these schools would change their type.  I have had some experience of boarding schools.  I know of no boy who came through a boarding school who was as good at the end as he was when he went in.  I am not talking about industrial or reformatory schools.  I am referring to the ordinary boarding schools in the case of which parents would have the youngsters under their eye when they went home at intervals on holidays.  I do not think we gain anything by refusing to face the facts, by slurring over the difficulties of this question, by putting the term &ldquo;boarding schools&rdquo; on these places.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What are the circumstances in which children may be sent off to these industrial schools?  I understand the complaint made by Deputies on this side to be that the Minister is for the first <Col N="1860" /> time introducing a new term, &ldquo;negligence&rdquo;. In addition to that, for some reason, he has gone away from the term &ldquo;drunken habits&rdquo; and has introduced the term &ldquo;inebriety&rdquo;.  I do not know whether there is a distinction.  I understood a man was described as inebriated when he had not gone the full length of being drunk and that inebriety is a slighter term and may result in more children being sent to these industrial schools than if the other term were kept.</P>
    <P>Again, a memorandum was sent out with this Bill and on pages 1 and 2 of it we were given in series the grounds upon which people may be committed to industrial schools.  The full grounds are not set out there.  The full grounds are set out in the report of the Commission of Inquiry into the Reformatory and Industrial School System.  As far as that report goes there is a number of lettered paragraphs down as far as the letter (n), showing the grounds on which people may be committed to industrial schools. The first one is (a) if found begging or receiving alms; or frequenting any street, premises, etc., for such a purpose; (b) if found wandering and not having any home or settled place of abode, or visible means of subsistence; or if found wandering and having no parent or guardian, or a parent or guardian who does not exercise proper guardianship; (c) if found destitute, not being an orphan and having both his parents or his surviving parent, or in the case of an illegitimate child, his mother, undergoing penal servitude or imprisonment; (d) if under the care of a parent or guardian who, by reason of criminal or drunken habits, is unfit to have the care of the child; (e) if the daughter, whether legitimate or illegitimate, of a father who has been convicted of an offence under a particular Act; (f) if frequenting the company of any reputed thief, or of any common or reputed prostitute; (g) if lodging at a house which has been used for the purposes of prostitution; (h) if found destitute and if the parents are unable to support him, provided the parents consent.  So it goes on, with one general provision&mdash;if it be shown to the satisfaction of the court that the parent or guardian is unable to control the <Col N="1861" /> child.  Surely that is a wide enough circle within which to have the district justices operate their discretion in regard to this breaking up of family life.</P>
    <P>The Minister, despite all these reasons why people may be committed, now proposes to introduce two new terms.  Instead of the &ldquo;drunken and criminal habits,&rdquo; which was previously in, we get &ldquo;by reason of inebriety or other similar cause.&rdquo;  The criminal habits, of course, are left out of these matters because criminal habits are referred to in the original Act, but two new phrases are introduced, negligence and immorality.  What is the reason for having immorality put in here seeing there are so many grounds turning on the point of immorality for which a child may be committed?</P>
    <P>In regard to this term, &ldquo;negligence,&rdquo; the Minister says he prefers to give district justices a discretion.  With all respect to them&mdash;and they are a group to be definitely respected for the way in which they have generally handled the law&mdash;there is no doubt about it that all justices and all members of any court develop idiosyncrasies.  Are we going to break up family life just because of a particular view a district justice may take, or because he may operate his discretion in peculiar ways in certain districts?  You give him a lead by this &ldquo;negligence.&rdquo;  What does it mean?  The only example the Minister was able to give by way of concrete case was the situation that might arise where a child was living in a house where there was some infectious disease, and where the parent was not taking care to prevent that child developing a contagious disease. It is peculiar that in the report on which this Bill is supposed to be founded the only allusion made to contagious disease is made in regard to industrial schools, that owing to the way in which children have been sent to those schools suffering from contagious disease they have given the disease to children there.  A recommendation was made to have a medical board set up to prevent the spread of contagious disease in the industrial schools.  That recommendation has not been carried out.  The committee found that there were industrial schools in which contagious disease was prevalent <Col N="1862" /> because children going there were infected. They asked that that should be stopped.  Instead of that, no medical report is being asked for, but the Minister tells us that one of the reasons why children are to be committed is the very thing reported against&mdash;that the child may have developed a contagious disease.  Such a child is going to be packed off to an industrial school to infect the rest of the children there.  No medical examination is required.</P>
    <P>I suggest, unless the Minister can give us some more concrete and more appealing reason for the introduction of this term &ldquo;negligence,&rdquo; it at least should be dropped.  As far as the word &ldquo;immorality&rdquo; is concerned, I want to find out what particular type of immorality does he contemplate that is not covered by the other clauses of the 1908 Act, which allow the sending of a boy or girl to an industrial school? I do suggest until we know and get a sort of court decision on the effect of the word &ldquo;inebriety,&rdquo; it would be better to keep the word which has very often come before the courts for adjudication&mdash;&ldquo;drunkenness.&rdquo; As regards the adjective which Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney suggests should be put before these two words, if the Minister would take them back to his legal adviser he would find the addition of the word &ldquo;reputed&rdquo; undoubtedly eases the situation.  I think it meets the difficulty set forth in the Report of the Commission of Inquiry.  It may not meet it completely, but it is not for the Minister merely to say, &ldquo;I am not a lawyer; I do not know what the full effect of this word is, but I am not going to have it.&rdquo;  I suggest he should find out what is the meaning of it, and see the effect of it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister may not be a lawyer, but we are passing laws and he is sponsoring laws, and he ought to know the meaning of the laws he is sponsoring.  He does not seem to mind.  If he finds it necessary &mdash;as may be possible&mdash;to tighten up the powers, let him enumerate them. I wish he could recognise&mdash;he does not seem to recognise&mdash;that there is a big principle at stake.  I am surprised that others who continually insist on the <Col N="1863" /> sacredness of that principle have made no objection and have not raised their voices in this particular matter.  But there is a big principle at stake, and he should not be allowed to violate that principle by a general term.  There are objections, I know, to particularising, but if you are sincerely attached to the principle this is a case in which you ought to particularise and leave no vague terms.  The Minister accused me of being guilty of exaggeration because I said a district justice would do so-and-so, would interpret the word &ldquo;negligence&rdquo; in a very wide sense. He must realise that what I objected to was that he could do that, that we are giving power into his hands which morally I do not think we have the power ourselves and, therefore, morally I do not think we have the power to give it to a district justice.  I do not think we have morally the right to give one more blow to family life. I do not think morally we are entitled to help to break up family life as we are doing.  I think on the contrary our efforts should be in the opposite direction, that we should face in the opposite direction, not in the direction mentioned by the Minister.  I confess that though I have many things in my mind as to what a district justice might do and how he might interpret the word &ldquo;negligence&rdquo;, I was still more alarmed at the defence of the section put up by the Minister.  I find that disease&mdash;not merely dirty heads, but disease&mdash;can now apparently easily be a ground for taking a child away from the parents and sending it to an industrial school. That is the implication of the Minister's statement, and that is the Minister who objects because I refuse to hand over those sacred rights to the idiosyncrasies of any district justice.  I share with Deputy McGilligan the greatest respect for the way in which that body of men have performed their duties, but I refuse to give to them or anybody else rights that I do not think they should have.  The Minister said that he was only following the example of other countries.  By interjection, I had to remind him that <Col N="1864" /> they are not blessed with such an important Constitution as ours; that they are not blessed with a Constitution which lays down as something to be revered those principles which the Minister now so light-heartedly proposes to violate.  I am surprised, seeing that the Constitution was mentioned in the previous statements by some of us, that he justifies himself by turning to those countries which are not so happy as to live under such an ennobling Constitution as ours.</P>
      <P>He says at the end of his speech: &ldquo;The district justice has to determine whether the parent is doing his duty to his children&rdquo;.  Now, that is the interpretation we have got from the Minister of what he means by his change in the law.  It is now to be in the power of a district justice&mdash;I am giving the Minister's interpretation&mdash;to determine whether the parent is doing his duty to his children.  That is certainly carrying us very far.  If a district justice, for any variety of reasons, thinks that a parent is not doing his duty to his children, according to the district justice's view, he can take the children away from the parent, on whom rests the primary responsibility for the bringing up of the children, and send them to an industrial school.  We have no right to give those powers, and I certainly say that bad as I thought the clause was before the Minister's explanation to my mind it is still more alarming now.  He says there will be a few cases only.  A little earlier he said that negligence covers a large number of cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On which leg is he standing&mdash;that the word &ldquo;negligence&rdquo; will refer only to a few cases, and therefore we need not bother our heads about it, or that it covers a large number of cases?  I think the more considered statement of the Minister was that it covers a large number of cases.  But supposing it covers only a few cases; why go out of your way, then, to interfere with an important principle merely to embrace those few possible cases that are not covered at present?  If the parent&mdash; another phrase of the Minister's&mdash;does not look after the interests of his children in a reasonable way, the Guards can bring that parent before a district <Col N="1865" /> justice, who can interpret the law in that particular way.  Surely the case made by the Minister is one that should condemn the clause.  I would ask him to take seriously that principle of the rights of the family, and, instead of widening his Bill, to narrow it.  I made that appeal already on the Second Reading.  I made it in connection with another clause, that when he is administering the law, for instance &mdash;it is the same principle that is at stake&mdash;as to whether or not he will let a child out of an industrial school, his effort ought to be to find reasons for letting the child out and not for keeping the child in.  I see the contrary attitude in the few clauses that this Bill contains.</P>
    <P>As I am on my feet, may I make another suggestion?  First of all, we, as Deputies, are in the unfortunate position that we get a series of amendments to a list of amendments to the original Bill.  That may be technically excellent drafting, but it puts every Deputy in this House who is interested in the matter at a great disadvantage. If the original section had been repealed and re-enacted with the changes in it, things would be clearer, but what is the unfortunate parent whose rights are handed over to the mercies of the district justice&mdash;though ten of them may be quite reasonable, the eleventh may not be reasonable&mdash;to think when he gets a Bill like that into his hands? How can he find out what his rights are?  It would be much better from the purely drafting standpoint had the other procedure been adopted, both from the point of view of the House and from the point of view of the people who will afterwards have to interpret this particular Act.  May I ask, Sir, what is to be our procedure on this particular matter?  There are two amendments.  Both of them propose to delete the words that are actually in the Bill.  I am against the Minister's, which is the less general amendment.  I am in favour of Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney's amendment.  Will both be put to the House?</P>

      <P>I think there is a good deal of substance in the arguments which have been put forward, and I will consider introducing an amendment on the next stage on the lines of Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney's amendment. Deputy McGilligan referred to the boarding-school system.  In referring to the industrial schools as boarding-schools on the Second Stage of the Bill, I, like other people, wanted to remove the impression which seems to be abroad, and which a good many Deputies in the House still seem to hold, that those institutions are purely penal establishments.  I think if they are examined quite independently and free of prejudice it will be found that the persons in charge of those institutions are giving the very same type of education, for example, as is being given in more expensive establishments to which parents send their children and will continue to send them. Furthermore, with regard to the health and training of the children, I think everything possible is being done.  I am not saying that as much can be done by the managers of those schools as by the parents in the ordinary household where the parents are fulfilling their duties, but I think there is no comparison whatever between the way the child is looked after in an industrial school and the way in which it would be treated, for example, in the great number of cases of destitute children which come before the courts.</P>
      <P>I think there is no comparison whatever as regards the improvement of the position of these children when they are committed and I think the House ought to bear in mind what I stated on the Second Reading, that really it is largely destitute children and children committed under the 1929 Act who form the vast bulk of those sent to our industrial schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1867" /> With regard to diseases, lest there might be any misunderstanding I should like to say that we have a medical inspector who visits the schools frequently.  Each school has its own doctor and children are examined when they are sent to the industrial schools by the courts.  Of course, the managers of the schools take every precaution to see that contagious disease is not introduced.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1869" /> Part II of the Principal Act covers offences such as cruelty, allowing to beg, exposing children to risk of burning, allowing children or young persons to be in brothels; causing, encouraging or favouring seduction or prostitution of young girls.  The offences mentioned in the First Schedule of the 1908 Act are taken from three Acts, the Offences Against the Person Act, 1861, the Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 1885, and the Children (Dangerous Performances) Act, 1879.  I do not think it is necessary for me to enter into any details about them.  We have discussed this matter with the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children and I think in all cases where a parent is convicted of an offence under one of these three Acts mentioned in the Schedule of the 1908 Act, or in Part II of the Act, it is clearly a case where the court ought to be given discretion to commit the children of such parent.</P>

The Minister says that he has been in communication with the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children. So have I, and they brought under my notice a particular case in which children were sent to an industrial school because the father had committed incest with the daughter.  The object of this is that suppose a father commits a criminal offence in relation to any one of his children, he is unfit to have custody of all the children.  I think the words &ldquo;to any of his children&rdquo; would be much better.</P>

      <P>Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney is suggesting that if the Minister substituted the words &ldquo;in relation to any of his children&rdquo;, it would be much better.  The father commits an offence against the person. I think that is one of the offences that the Minister read out.  I shall just put this point.  Of the three classes of offence which the Minister read out, one dealt with an offence against the person.  In other words, if a man is put in jail for an assault on somebody and the mother is alive, can the child of that man be sent to an industrial school?  Surely some reference as to the person against whom the offence is committed is relevant?  The Minister proposes to delete certain lines but Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney suggests that something should be substituted for these lines.</P>

      <P>In page 3, to delete lines 47 to 55 and substitute the following:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(ii) the Court is satisfied that owing to incapacity or desertion on the part of the child's parents or his surviving parent or, in the case of an illegitimate child, his mother, the consent of such parents or parent may be dispensed with, or</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>It is considered that the clause covered by lines 47-55 in the existing Bill should be deleted and that the amendment should be substituted.  It <Col N="1872" /> is recognised, and it was pointed out on Second Reading that the existing clause would be difficult of interpretation and of enforcement.  The amendment is simply a compromise which it is hoped will meet the feelings of Deputies.  The first clause in the 1929 Act prescribed that, in case of destitution, the consent of both parents should be obtainable, or, in the case of a sole surviving parent, of that parent, or, in the case of an illegitimate child, of its mother.  We are now seeking to have two further clauses inserted.  The first provides that where the court is satisfied that owing to incapacity or desertion on the part of the child's parents, or his surviving parent, or, in the case of an illegitimate child, his mother, the consent of such parent or parents may be dispensed with.  The second deals with a case where one of the child's parents consents to such order being made, and the court is satisfied that, owing to incapacity or desertion on the part of the other parent, the consent of that parent may be dispensed with.</P>

      <P>My difficulty about the amendment is that it may happen that a child may not really be living with his parents.  The child may be living with a grandfather or a grandmother. The guardians may be looking after the child reasonably well, and yet it is to be taken away.  Therefore, I should prefer the whole provision to go out so that the child can only be taken with the consent of the parents.  I am sure most Deputies know that it very often happens that the mother of an illegitimate child leaves the country, and that some relation takes charge of that child and really makes a home for the child.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course the grandparents may be very poor.  Remember, this is dealing entirely with the sending of children to industrial schools, not through any fault of the parents, but merely because of the <Col N="1873" /> poverty of the parents.  This is solely a poverty section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister spoke about a compromise, but I am not sure between whom the compromise is intended to be made, or what two principles it was intended to meet. My objection on the last day, as well as I remember, was that you were fixing the time down too closely.  From another source it was intimated to me that they want a strengthening of the power of committal, and to throw the onus on the parents to object.  I think that is what the Minister is doing.  He is throwing the onus, practically speaking, on the parent to make a case, to turn up at the court and to prove that the child should not be committed.</P>
      <P>I referred already to this power of taking a child away from the parents because they are destitute.  Apart from destitution, there may be cases in which, for instance, a man whose wife is ill, may find it impossible for the moment to deal with the children.  He will go before the justice and ask that they should be sent to an industrial school.  It is reasonable that such parents should be facilitated if the court thinks fit to do so, but I do not think there is any justification for the proposition that the children should be sent to an industrial school merely on account of the poverty of the parents, against whom otherwise no objection could be made, or merely because, in the opinion of the district justice, they cannot support the children up to a standard that the district justice thinks proper.  I object to that, and I should prefer to see that section out altogether and nothing substituted for it.  Surely the poverty of the parents alone should not be a ground on which power should be given to anybody to take away children without the consent of the parents?  I presume the first duty to look after the interest of the children is that of the parent.  The first duty does not lie with the State.  If parents are poor or destitute, I must assume that they have, nevertheless, the interest of the child at heart, and I do not think power should be given in that case to commit the child to an industrial school, unless consent of the parents is forthcoming.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1874" /> Then there arises a question as to the interpretation of the term &ldquo;incapacity.&rdquo; I do not know what the section means in that regard.  One expects &ldquo;owing to incapacity&rdquo; but here it is &ldquo;owing to incapacity or destitution.&rdquo;</P>

You are doing this to (h) shown in Section No. 9 of this Bill, where there is destitution and the mother or surviving parent is not able to support the child.  Down further, the amendment would mean &ldquo;the order shall not be made unless the Court is satisfied that, owing to incapacity or desertion, the consent of such parents may be dispensed with.&rdquo; If &ldquo;incapacity&rdquo; there means &ldquo;mental incapacity&rdquo; it is a different thing.

Below that, there is a phrase &ldquo;that the Court is satisfied that the child's parents...cannot be found.&rdquo; If they cannot be found, how can one determine that they are unable to support him?

      <P>I move amendment No. 9:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 4, to insert a new proviso after line 8 as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;And provided always that when it shall appear good to the Court the Court upon an application to commit a child to a certified Industrial School may in its discretion order that the child be returned to his or her parent or parents as the case may be, and that there be paid out of public funds to the said parent or parents for the maintenance of the said child a weekly sum equal to the average weekly cost payable out of Public Funds for the maintenance of a child in a certified Industrial School.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am endeavouring to introduce a new principle into these Industrial Schools Acts altogether.  I am not going to labour the point which my friend Professor O'Sullivan has made already and which really does not require any stressing on my part&mdash;that the correct and proper place for rearing a child is the home, the foundation of Christian society, and that it is a wrong thing that persons should be penalised for poverty or that a family should be broken up merely because it is poor.  It is a wrong thing that a parent should be deprived of his or her child merely because they are poor <Col N="1877" /> and it is an injustice to the child itself that it be deprived of the advantages of parental training.  Nothing can make up to a child for the loss of its home.  It is all very well for people to say that these schools are excellent and are well run.  They may be.  I am not suggesting that they are not, but there is not found there that affection which the child has for the parent.  That cannot be instilled into him in a school. Unselfishness, the putting of other members of the family before oneself, cannot be instilled into him in a school. It is really a desperate thing that families should be broken up for mere poverty and that a child brought up in an industrial school should be in the position that it is a lone unit fighting with its hand against everybody's hand and everybody's hand against its hand, instead of regarding itself as a member of a family with brothers and sisters to whom it can look for help and sympathy and to whom in turn they can look for help and sympathy. My suggestion is that when, on the grounds of mere poverty of its parents, the child is brought before a court, the court should have power to order that that child be returned to the custody of its parents and that the parents be paid each week the sum of money which would be paid for the upkeep of that child in an industrial school.  If I am not mistaken&mdash;and I am sure the Minister will put me right on this&mdash;the average cost of the upkeep of a child in an industrial school is something like 15/- a week.</P>

      <P>Not one ha'penny more.  I am only dealing with the money which would have gone to the institution and asking for its diversion to the parents of the child.  It would be better to give the parent what it would cost to keep the child in an industrial school, and let the parent keep the child at home.  Of course, I am only referring to cases in which the parent is entirely destitute.  I am not suggesting that children should be sent to unworthy parents, nor am I suggesting that this should be done where there is a ground, other than poverty, for taking the child away.  This amendment is simply referring to the children who are being sent away solely on the ground of the poverty of their parents.</P>

      <P>I do not think I can accept that amendment.  It does not seem as if the Deputy himself would be prepared to agree that it should come in properly as an amendment to this Bill.  It seems to raise a very fundamental question, which might affect the continuance of these industrial schools altogether.  Obviously, if there was a large number of district justices who had the same opinion as the Deputy, the children would all be sent home with a subsidy; whether by way of encouragement or otherwise of their parents, I do not know.  It seems to me that the amendment involves the question of a new social service, and in connection with that we have already this system of industrial schools and also the system of boarded-out children, and the local authority very often deals with the problem under its boarded-out children scheme.  The Deputy seems to desire to create an entirely new scheme.</P>

      <P>Well, in any case, there is a social service there, dealing with the problem under the local authority. Why the Deputy should imagine that the local authority, whatever the Government and the Minister for Finance might have to say about the creation of this new service for the assistance of parents, would agree to this I do not know.  I do not know why he assumes that the local authority would be prepared to pay more in the case of these children.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not asking for more.  I am only asking for the same sum.  I want to make my position clear, and it is that when a district justice says that a child is a case for an industrial school, then a certain sum becomes payable to the industrial school if the child is there. Now, if the district justice can say: &ldquo;I shall send this child back to its parents,&rdquo; let exactly the same sum be paid to them as would be paid to the institution if the child were there.  He cannot do it except in a case where he would send a child to an industrial school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>The grant from the Government and the local authority is supposed to cover not alone the clothing and feeding of the children, but their education and training, and also to cover the expenses of the institution. These are the only funds available to these institutions, and the Deputy suggests that the full extent of the money which goes for the maintenance of the child in an institution should be made available to the parents.  Even if the principle were agreed upon, and we should embark on this new policy, I do not think that you could possibly contemplate giving the same allowance for the child being maintained at home by its parents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that under the widows' and orphans' pensions scheme and the other schemes I have mentioned provision is being made already, and I do <Col N="1880" /> not think this is the way in which this matter ought to be tackled.  If the Deputy feels that more ought to be done for destitute children in another way I think he ought to raise the matter in a different fashion.  At present he wants to benefit these children, assuming that his own theories are the right ones, at the expense of the industrial schools and possibly at the expense of closing down all the industrial schools altogether.  Of course, I could not stand for that, and I am satisfied that the schools are carrying on an essential work and carrying it on satisfactorily. We are not able to give them the grants that are given to similar institutions in neighbouring countries. If we were, we would probably be able to do much better.  With regard to vocational training, for example, we do not give them anything like the grants they give them in Great Britain. The Deputy suggests that even what we are giving them, with whatever financial advantages are conferred on them for having the number of children committed to their care, ought to be taken from them altogether.  Accordingly, there is a fundamental disagreement between us, and I could not possibly accept the principle of the amendment, which simply means that parents who are destitute would get the State to give them a subsidy for the maintenance of their children at home&mdash;something that was never contemplated under the Children Acts.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should recommend the Minister to read over what he has just said and see whether this is not the conclusion to be drawn from it: children must be sent to industrial schools, not because it is best for them, but to keep up the schools; the schools are not there for the children, the children are there for the schools. Apparently, it is quite irrelevant whether the best thing is to have the child educated in the home.  It may be. After all, Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney's Christian view may be correct: that the best place is the home.  But we cannot acknowledge that because we must postpone the interests of certain children and subordinate them to the necessity of keeping up the institutions. That, to my mind, is an amazing defence. <Col N="1881" /> I used to be under the delusion that the principle was that the schools were there for the children.  I do not say that that was universally accepted. I know that there was a drive to get children into the schools, and very often the means were rather inclined to submerge the end that was to be served, but that the Minister could calmly come down here and say: &ldquo;It does not matter what is best for the child. I have to think of the schools and keep them up, and because the State cannot afford the money, therefore, I must sacrifice the interests of the child, or at least what some Deputies think are the interests of the child, to the upkeep of the schools because the State cannot give sufficient grants such as they give elsewhere.  The problem might be different if the State could give these grants, but since the State refuses to give more grants I must see that the schools are provided with a sufficient number of recruits in order to keep the schools going, or else they will almost collapse.&rdquo;  I must say that I was absolutely amazed to hear that particular case put forward.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hurley</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the amendment might be open to abuse.  Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney has in mind the institution of family allowances for children, which would be the way to meet the situation.  The very fact of bringing in such an amendment might be open to abuse, and would not meet the point that the Deputy has in mind, that proper provision should be made, by means of family allowances, where parents have no wages or are unemployed. The kernel of the whole question is that there is no provision in the Unemployment Acts or in the Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Act for the proper upbringing of children, the amounts allowed being too small.  To put in this amendment would not meet the definite need for the proper care and upbringing of children whose parents may have small or, in some cases, no means.</P>

      <P>According to the statistics for 1939-40 given by the Minister on the last occasion, 37½ per cent. of the committals were on the ground of destitution, not being <Col N="1882" /> orphans or whose parents consented to committal.  That meant that there were cases where parents consented to children being sent to industrial schools because they could not support them. In regard to that particular percentage, this amendment does not represent Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney's last word.  He wishes to divert the State grants to let us see how many parents afterwards, on the grounds of destitution, agreed to let the children go.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>It is either going to be confined to destitute children who come before the courts in the ordinary way, or extended to the whole country. Supposing, for the next month or two, if this provision were in operation, all the parents brought before the courts under the provisions of the Act of 1929 met with district justices who gave them grants which would be given to the industrial schools if the children were committed and told them to go home, is it not obvious that there would be hundreds or thousands of parents clamouring to get into the court under the 1929 Act to get the district justices to give them the subsidy? As Deputy Hurley pointed out, if we want to give that type of assistance to the parents of destitute children, the obvious way is to institute family allowances.</P>

      <P>I explained on the Second Reading or in the explanatory memorandum that there does not seem to be any legal definition of the word &ldquo;wandering&rdquo; given in the Principal Act.  I am advised that this provision has been generally interpreted as if the word had no material effect to the contrary. I have given the matter a good deal of consideration, and I feel that leaving out these words would help to improve the law and give some further discretion to a justice in border-line cases, in fact, that it should not be necessary to prove that &ldquo;wandering&rdquo; has occurred.</P>

If we strike out the words &ldquo;wandering and&rdquo; where they occur at the end of page 13 and at the top of page 14 we get this, &ldquo;if found not having any home or settled place of abode, or visible means of subsistence, or if found having no parent or guardian, or a parent or guardian who does not exercise proper guardianship&rdquo; would that mean that merely having no parent or guardian is now a ground for consent to be sent to a school?

      <P>A case has actually occurred where a father in penal servitude refused to give his consent.  The district justice felt that the child should be committed, and where a district justice, who is in constant consultation with his probation officer and, generally, with the officers of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children also, considers it would be to the child's advantage that it should be committed, I am prepared to accept his decision.  I do not know whether the child in that case was eventually committed or not, but, at any rate, the father refused to give his consent for a considerable time.  The number of those cases is small, but on balance, as I said more than once, my feeling is in favour of giving the discretion to the district justice.</P>

      <P>(1)  The documents referred to as licences in Sections 67 and 68 of the Principal Act shall be known as supervision certificates and the said documents shall be framed accordingly.</P>
      <P>(2)  This section shall be construed as effecting no more than a change in the name of the documents to which it relates.</P>
      <P>I have just explained that we are altering the expression &ldquo;licences&rdquo; in Sections 67 and 68 of the Principal Act to &ldquo;supervision certificates&rdquo;.  Deputy Hickey and other Deputies seemed to think that the term &ldquo;licence&rdquo; was opprobrious or carried a stigma.</P>

      <P>This section provides for the deletion in Section 73 of the Principal Act of the reference to State assistance towards the expenses of disposing of children in certain schools by emigration.  It was never intended, I think, in this country that Government assistance should be given to enable children to emigrate from certain schools.  We are deleting that and also the proviso limiting to 2/- per head per week the amount of assistance payable from State grants in respect of children committed to industrial schools at the instance of their parents.  There are a small number of children in industrial schools at the instance of their parents.  I should have mentioned that to Deputy McGilligan when he asked the question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A small number, at any rate, have their children there at their own desire, and pay something towards their maintenance.  Under the Principal Act, this contribution is limited to 2/- per head per week.  The schools, in fact, would not consider 2/- as being a reasonable contribution, and hence <Col N="1888" /> we feel that the proviso should be taken out.  If parents wish to contribute towards the upkeep of their children, well and good.</P>

Take the case of a child's uncle who is in a good position in Australia or New Zealand.  If he desires to take the child out from an industrial school here, would the Minister not think it a proper thing to permit whatever was the old system to rule in that exceptional case?

      <P>I move amendment No. 12:</P>
      <P>Before Section 20 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 75 of the Principal Act is hereby amended in the following respects and shall be construed and have effect accordingly, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  by the insertion in paragraph (b)  of sub-section (2) before the words &ldquo;chief inspector&rdquo; of the words &ldquo;local authority responsible under this Act for the maintenance of the offender or child or of the&rdquo;,</P>

      <P>(c)  by the addition at the end of sub-section (4) of the following words and paragraphs, that is to say, &ldquo;and where any such application is made, fourteen days' notice thereof shall be given&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  in the case of an application by the person on whom the order is made, to the chief inspector,</P>
      <P>(b)  in the case of an application by or at the instance of the chief inspector, to the person on whom the order is made, and</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1890" /> (c)  in the case of an application by or at the instance of the local authority responsible under this Act for the maintenance of the offender or child, to the chief inspector and to the person on whom the order is made&rdquo;, and</P>
    <P>(d)  by the deletion in sub-section (7) of the words &ldquo;All sums received under this section shall be paid into the Exchequer&rdquo; and the substitution in lieu of the words so deleted of the words &ldquo;Every sum received under this section shall be apportioned between the Minister for Education and the local authority responsible under this Act for the maintenance of the offender or child in such proportion as the said Minister, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, directs&rdquo;,</P>
    <P>(e)  by the deletion of the words &ldquo;paid into the Exchequer&rdquo; where those words occur at the end of sub-section (7) and the substitution in lieu of the words so deleted of the words &ldquo;apportioned as aforesaid&rdquo;, and</P>
    <P>(f)  by the insertion at the end of the section of the following sub-section, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(12) Every sum apportioned to the Minister for Education under sub-section (7) of this section shall be paid into or disposed of for the benefit of the Exchequer in such manner as the Minister for Finance may direct.</P>
    <P>The object of this amendment is to provide for an apportionment of parental money contributions between the Department of Education and local authorities.  When children are committed to industrial schools or reformatories, the court sometimes fixes parental contributions, and these moneys are collected by officers of the Department.  They do not amount to a very large sum.  Representations have been made to us by the local authorities that an endeavour should be made to make an apportionment of these appropriations to them.  Under this Bill we are taking power to make regulations imposing certain contributions on the local authorities for the <Col N="1891" /> upkeep of these schools.  I have already pointed out that the present contributions are not considered reasonable.  In order to meet the point that the local authorities should receive some apportionment of the parental moneys, I have introduced this new section.  Paragraph (d) of it gives the Minister this power:</P>
    <P>Every sum received under this section shall be apportioned between the Minister for Education and the local authority responsible under this Act for the maintenance of the offender or child in such proportion as the said Minister, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, directs.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It would be quite impossible to set out in the Bill what proportion of these moneys, if any proportion, is eventually going to be repaid to the local authorities.  It is a matter in which the Department of Finance is interested. Negotiations, which may occupy some time, will have to take place regarding the matter.  All that I can do at the moment is to take power to make the apportionment with the consent of the Minister for Finance.</P>

      <P>I move the following motion which stands in the name of Deputy Cogan and myself:&mdash;</P>
      <P>While, recognising that the area under tillage, particularly the area under wheat, should be further extended in the present emergency, Dáil Eireann is of opinion that to induce and compensate the farmers for growing a sufficiency of wheat to meet the nation's requirements this year the fixed minimum price for good millable wheat should not be less than 50/- per barrel for the 1941 crop.</P>
      <P>At the outset, I wish to draw particular attention to the phraseology of the motion, as play has been made with it in this House and outside, to the effect that its object is to increase the price of the loaf.  May I say that the object of the motion is to lower the price of the loaf of good quality?  I am sorry that when the House is about to discuss a motion like this, the whole Government Front Bench should be empty, and I refuse to proceed with my remarks until somebody representing the Government is here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>And talk to empty benches?  I have more respect for my <Col N="1893" /> intelligence and for the importance of what I am going to say than to do that.  Now that the Minister is here, I want to draw his special attention to the phraseology of the motion.  The Minister and his colleagues are out on a campaign to get a sufficiency of wheat and on that point we ought to have agreement at the beginning.  Is it 600,000 acres or 700,000 acres the Minister wants?  Either acreage means a doubling this year of the area under wheat last year, and, to get that area under wheat, the Minister first offered a minimum price of 37/6 per barrel. Since our debate on 13th January on the original Tillage Order, that price has been increased to 40/-.  Speaking with regard to price on 12th December the Minister said:</P>
      <P>If we paid 40/-, we would probably get more; if we paid 50/-, we would get more; and if we paid £3, we would get more; but I am not sure that even £3 a barrel would bring us 100 per cent. of our requirements.</P>
      <P>The Minister says we must have 100 per cent. of our requirements, but&mdash;I am not impugning the Minister's personal honour or honesty&mdash;is he honest in regard to this?  He does not believe that we will get 100 per cent. of our requirements even if we pay £3 per barrel and the price he is offering is only 40/- per barrel.  Our requirements are 600,000 or 700,000 acres.  Both figures have been mentioned by the Minister and let us split the difference and say 650,000 acres, which would produce on an average crop 650,000 tons.  That is what we want to accomplish this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That represents a sufficiency of wheat and we want to induce the farmers to grow that sufficiency.  For oats, there will be a free market, and for barley, there will be a free market. It was stated here to-day that there would be a price of 30/- per barrel for barley.  Does the Minister consider that in a free market this year wheat would sell at as low as 40/- a barrel? Does he think that it would sell at even as low as 50/- per barrel?  He knows that during the last great war, when wheat was pretty freely imported into this country, Irish wheat sold for over £3 per barrel, and does he not know <Col N="1894" /> that if barley is to fetch 30/- per 16-stone barrel, wheat cannot compete at 40/- per 20-stone barrel?  Last year, on the basis of a price of 35/- per barrel, we got 300,000 acres, representing 40 per cent. of our requirements, and we imported the balance. This year, we want more than twice that acreage, and, if we are to get it, are we not to offer a price or a free market in order to get it?  I submit that, in a free market, for the coming harvest, the price of good millable wheat might reach £5 per barrel.  The Minister looks up in surprise at that statement, but if there were a free market for wheat, if the millers were free to mill any kind of flour they wished and if there was a mill permitted to mill wheat on the basis of a 70 or 75 per cent. extraction, that mill could buy all the wheat it could get at £5 per barrel and sell all the flour milled from it.  I challenge contradiction on that.  Why?  Because wheat growers are growing a crop this year that will fall short of requirements.  I am not saying that that would be an equitable price to give but, when any commodity is scarce in the market, especially a commodity so essential to the human life as wheat, people will pay any price for it.  I want to emphasise one point because I do not want a repetition of the cleavage that manifested itself in the recent debate on supplies.  Every Deputy who represented an urban constituency spoke against any increase in the price of bread.  The alternative is not an increase in the price of bread.  The alternative is inferior bread or no bread. That is the alternative which is facing us.</P>
    <P>When we put down this motion, with the approval of organised farmers, suggesting a minimum price of 50/- per barrel, we suggested a price about half that which the commodity would fetch in a free market next year.  I want that to go home.  Can the Minister expect to get wheat cheaper next year, following this year's crop, with a world in arms and a world at war, than it was obtained at when, on a previous occasion, we had a world at arms and a world at war?  At that time, we had <Col N="1895" /> not a submarine menace half as intense as the menace of to-day.  We had no aeroplane menace whereas we have a very serious aeroplane menace now.</P>
    <P>We are told by the Head of the Government that we must go back and rely on our own resources.  Even if it were possible to bring wheat into this country, can we imagine wheat coming in more cheaply than it did during the last war?  We know that the standard which obtained in the last war was £3.  In this motion, we are not asking for £3 per barrel.  We are asking 50/- and we are satisfied that, at that price, foreign wheat could not be bought next year.  We ask the authority of the Dáil to tell the Government that they should make the price of 50/- the minimum standard for the farmers who grow wheat.  If that is done, you will be sure of the crop.  I cannot emphasise too much that the object of this motion is not to get a price but to get the wheat.  The Minister said that he did not expect he would get the necessary amount at £3 a barrel.  If the Minister advances to 50/-, he may say that he will not get all the wheat he wants at that price.  I would not guarantee that he would but I would guarantee that he would get a greater sacrifice from the farmers if he and his Government showed their sincerity.</P>
    <P>When the Minister was speaking the last day, he mentioned about barley being withdrawn from the maltsters at 36/- a barrel and being mixed with the wheat.  A price of 36/- for a barrel of barley amounts to 45/- for 20 stones. You are putting an inferior cereal into your flour and paying 45/- for it while you will not give more than 40/- for the real article&mdash;wheat.  The Minister is a farmer and comes from, perhaps, the first farming county in Ireland. Owing to his environment, he ought to know this subject better than I do and I am not saying that he does not. He knows that, as a business proposition, the growing of barley at 36/- and the growing of wheat at 40/- cannot be compared.  I challenge any farmer Deputy to get up and say that, as a business proposition, he would rather grow wheat at 50/- than barley at 30/-. I am not saying that 30/- is too much <Col N="1896" /> but that price has been accepted by the Government.</P>
    <P>Why not make the drive necessary to get our full requirements of wheat?  It may be good business, if you have no alternative, to take 90 per cent. extraction from wheat.  Let us say there are 600,000 tons of wheat to give you flour of 70 per cent. extraction and we have a 90 per cent. extraction.  That involves 120,000 tons of bran and pollard. I think I am right in quoting the Minister as saying the other day that 50 per cent. of our cattle feeding stuffs have to be imported.  Here, he is going to turn back into flour, as if it were a windfall, 120,000 tons of animal feeding stuffs at a time when we are depending entirely on our own resources to provide food for man and beast. How does the Minister propose to make up for those 120,000 tons of animal feeding stuffs on top of the 50 per cent. of imports?  Are we to slaughter our live stock as we slaughtered the calves?  Shall we, this time, slaughter the stores which we cannot fatten? The situation is terribly serious.  In a leading article in the <i>Irish Press</i> on the 1st January, it was stated that the Minister's policy was quite simple, that he merely says to the farmers: &ldquo;Grow all the wheat you can to ensure bread for yourself and your families and then grow all you possibly can to feed the others.&rdquo;  If that is the national agricultural policy in this emergency, it is a blue look-out for the city folk.</P>
    <P>Our view as farmers is that a duty falls on the farmers now to feed the nation.  And they will feed the nation, but let the Government take them into its confidence and see what is an equitable price for providing bread for the nation.  That has not been done yet and no moves have been made in that direction. It is time there were.  No spokesman on behalf of the Government has claimed that a full supply of wheat will be grown in this country at 40/- a barrel.  I asked the Minister on the day the House debated the question of supplies how much was sown.  He could only reckon roughly by saying there were 300,000 tons of winter wheat in the country for seed.  He knew that.  I do not know how he knew it.  No census was ever taken of my seed and I sowed <Col N="1897" /> 150 acres with my own seed.  Nobody knew what seed I had.  I did not know myself until I had finished my operations.</P>
    <P>Why does not the Minister know exactly?  I suggest that the Civic Guards should be taking a census every week.  They should know what land is being prepared.  They should know how much is sown every week, so that we may be sure we will have our requirements. It seems to me that the policy of the Government is to shout: &ldquo;Grow more wheat.&rdquo;  At the end of January, when there was a snow-storm on, to ask us to prepare to grow twice as much wheat as we grew last year is not cricket; it is not hurley; it is not playing the game.  Why was it not done last September?  It was not done, and nobody should be blamed for it but the Government.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the question of wheat-growing should be taken up seriously. At all costs we should grow our requirements. The offals from the usual extraction are required for their own job, and that job is twofold.  We have to feed livestock.  We have to sell livestock. Why have we to sell it?  I am not so sure that, if everything was told, the cause of the real crisis in this country is not a shortage of foreign exchange to buy our requirements.  I am not going to discuss petrol here at this stage, but I am not so sure that if we had plenty of foreign exchange we would not have more petrol.  How are we going to get foreign exchange?  By selling in an outside market.  If we do not produce the food here to fatten our livestock and prepare them for an outside market we will have no foreign exchange to buy the things we do not produce at home.</P>
    <P>It is as important for the survival of this nation that we should have adequate food for our livestock as that we should have food for ourselves.  The food for human consumption is wheat. I suggest strongly to the Minister and his Government that they should not think in terms of substitutes for wheat, but in terms of wheat alone.  And the price?  The price would not be more. Wheat at 50/- a barrel would be £20 per ton.  Barley at 30/- a barrel would <Col N="1898" /> be £15 a ton, and oats at 26/- a barrel would be £15 per ton.  I put it to the Minister that wheat at that price would produce as cheap a bread as he can get.  The all important thing is that we will not get our requirements if we do not offer proper inducement, because the farmers cannot afford to grow it.  It takes too much out of the soil.  It is too late in the year.  They have to sow it on ground that is not 100 per cent. suitable.  The yield will be so much less.  All these things considered, the farmers cannot grow wheat at less than 50/- a barrel.</P>
    <P>If you leave the fixed price for wheat at 40/- with a free market for barley and oats to supplement wheat for human food and also to provide feeding stuffs for live stock, barley and oats will be the paying crops for the farmer this year, not wheat.  I say that without fear of contradiction.  Why not at least put wheat on a competitive basis with the rest of the crops? It is the crop that is most directly available for human food and, as I said before, all the offals are required to do their job.  You cannot take them for human food because you will lose 50 per cent. of your cattle feeding stuffs as there will be no imported feeding stuffs.  The Minister knows that quite well, better than I do, because he has at his elbow a Department. All he has to do is to press a bell to get most reliable and first-hand information.  I suggest to the Minister that the cheapest ingredient he can buy for bread is wheat at 50/- a barrel and at that price he will get a considerable quantity of it, perhaps nearly all he requires.  If he does not expect to get it all, the fault is his.  He should offer such an inducement as will get for him all the wheat he requires.</P>
    <P>I do not want to take up much time in opening this debate.  I am sure there are many Deputies here who are interested in the subject who wish to give their views.  But the Minister is the Minister for Agriculture.  He is not the Minister for a wheat drive. When he asks a farmer to double his area under wheat he knows that, according to the ordinary rules of husbandry, he is asking that farmer to follow a rotation for four or five years. <Col N="1899" /> Instead of calling for a wheat drive for this year he should be putting up a five-year tillage plan, embodying rotation, fixing prices for that period. Farmers have a bitter recollection of the last war, when they had their land tilled to provide food and found they were undersold in their own market by Russian oats and German wheat. They got protection when they were wiped out.  We know that the blisters put on Irish agriculture during the last war and during the aftermath of the last war are there still, and no Government relieved the land of this country of that burden.  We are told now of little petty loans that will be given.  I said in this House before that loans would get the farmers nowhere except into debt, and I am glad that a very distinguished writer has quoted that, a Cork man at that.  The late John Mackey has quoted it in his &ldquo;Rape of Ireland&rdquo; and has supported it.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to consider what it means when he asks farmers to grow twice the area under wheat if the farmers are to follow a reasonable rotation. He is asking the farmers to double their area under tillage at a time when no provision whatever has been made for fertilisers.  There we are in the dark.  The increase in food production this year must come from the big farms.</P>
    <P>The Tillage Order will not affect the small farmers, because they are tilling more than the percentage required by the order.  The increased production must come from the big farmers; it must come from the tractor farmers, and I have very grave doubts as to what the tractor position will be when the harvest comes.  If the Government are wise and prudent, and are going to take the necessary precautions to save the harvest&mdash;some may laugh at the suggestion I am about to put forward&mdash;they should make sure that there is enough scrap iron here to make reaping-hooks to cut the harvest.  We may not have tractors; we may not have plough parts; we may be thrown back to the conditions which obtained 70 years ago in the period so often quoted by the Minister when we grew our own requirements of wheat.  Yes; <Col N="1900" /> and we sowed it with the shovel, and we cut it with the hook.  That is why we were independent of other countries. We cannot plough with the tractor, reap with the reaper and binder and thresh with the threshing mill if we have not got access to the outer world. What provision is being made for reaping-hooks? Is the scrap iron to make them going to be held in this country? Those are things that we must consider now.  We were not considering petrol some months ago, a year ago.  Tankers came into this city, discharged some of their cargo, and had to take away the balance because there was no storage accommodation for it, and responsible Ministers warned the country against hoarding of any kind when they should have been telling us to fill every tin can in the country with petrol.  Now they wake up and say: &ldquo;Boys, buy all you can&rdquo; when we cannot buy anything.</P>
    <P>There are labour battalions in the Army.  I hope they will be trained to save the harvest if we cannot use our machines, and I hope those who are getting home assistance and unemployment assistance will be available to save the harvest and prevent famine, because it is famine we are faced with, famine for man and beast.  Now is the time to guard against it, even at this late hour in spring.  Of course, it is winter yet, because we are told to sow winter wheat.  I suppose it is winter while we are sowing winter wheat, and when the last grain is sown spring will dawn.  Anyway, let us sow some kind of wheat.  It has been suggested that the price is a bit high.  My answer to that is this: If the Minister can get up here and state that he is assured of our full wheat requirements at 40/- a barrel, I will withdraw this motion.  If he stands over that statement, if he takes responsibility for the statement that he will get what wheat we want at 40/- a barrel, I will withdraw this motion and support the Minister.  Our object in putting down this motion is to get the wheat, not the price.  If it can be got at a lower price than 50/- and if the Minister says: &ldquo;I take the responsibility and the Government will take the responsibility before the country; there will be no danger of famine; <Col N="1901" /> there will be no black bread; there will be a good loaf at 40/- a barrel for wheat,&rdquo; I will withdraw the motion. Further, I will add 20 per cent. to my present acreage under wheat&mdash;I have 150 acres under it&mdash;and so will my colleague here.  But let the Minister take that responsibility.  It is all very well to say: &ldquo;We will not put up the loaf,&rdquo; but we will put up all kinds of stuff and say to the mob: &ldquo;Here is cheap bread; those farmers wanted to increase the price.&rdquo;  You may have cheap bread, but you will not have cheap wheaten bread.  That is the proposition I put to the Minister on the question of price; if he is satisfied that he will get our full requirements at 40/- a barrel he would be foolish to offer a penny more.  I do not think he will.  I am sure he will not.</P>
    <P>I am sorry that we are not dealing with the other motion, the motion on credits, and I have no doubt as to the reason why it is held back.  We have been talking of starvation.  We have been talking of the black forties when we had famine.  The cause of that famine is still here.  The cause of that famine was that this country did not control its credits.  This country does not control its credits to-day, and the same danger is staring this country in the face, with this difference, that we are now on our own and cannot blame anyone else if we starve.  Then we were able to blame it on the &ldquo;famine Queen&rdquo;.  We cannot do that on this occasion, and in order to save the honour of this country and the honour of the Irish race we should be up and doing.  We should see to it that nobody will starve, and that we will not have to kill off all our livestock through shortage of food.  This country can supply all the food necessary for twice the population, three times the population that is here, if it is managed properly. The people will rise to the occasion if they are taken into the confidence of the Government, and if they are told the truth.  No matter what the position is, no matter how bad it is, tell us what it is, and you need not fear that the Irish people will not rise to the occasion.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I want to say that this <Col N="1902" /> motion is prompted by a desire to offer sufficient inducement to get our full requirements of wheat, and the provision of those full requirements of wheat will prompt the cultivation of other crops.  It will start a four or five or perhaps six years' rotation, which means the potential doubling of the area under tillage.  In return for that private enterprise, the community in general should say to the agricultural community: &ldquo;Go ahead.  Give us the food for man and beast during this emergency, and we will guarantee that for four or five years subsequent to the emergency the food which you produce for man and beast will be consumed here instead of the food sent by foreigners from the far ends of the earth, so that after this war you will be saved from the terrible aftermath from which you suffered when the last war ended. You do the job for the nation now and the nation will not let you down.&rdquo;  But is the Minister saying that?  Will he say it?  If he does, he is on the road to success.  If he does not, he will be disappointed, and his Government will be disappointed.  I hope the country will not be faced with starvation, but we will be down to hard fare, and will surely be back to the hair shirt era.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>In seconding this motion I think it is hardly necessary to say that there is not a farmer in this country who does not realise the gravity of the emergency through which we are passing.  There is not a farmer in this country who does not realise that it is his duty to do everything possible to co-operate with the Government in this drive to increase our supplies of wheat.  But if the farmer is to cooperate with the Government he has the right to expect the Government to co-operate with him.  He has the right to expect that the Government will take an intelligent interest in the farmer's costs and the farmer's progress.  When the farmer is faced, as he is to-day, with the question as to how he will utilise his land, he has to consider the possibilities of other crops as well as wheat.  No farmer can be expected to sacrifice everything he possesses, including the fertility of his soil, in order to save the nation.  He is entitled <Col N="1903" /> to full compensation for his labour and risk, and that is all that this motion seeks.  When the farmer contrasts the price of barley to-day with the price that he is to be offered for wheat next year, he is inclined to doubt whether it would be wise to grow wheat instead of barley.  When he contrasts the price of oats with the price offered for wheat, he is also inclined to question whether it would be wise to go in extensively for wheat growing.</P>
      <P>I do not think that the Government have ever made an accurate calculation of the costs of producing wheat per acre.  On several occasions I have asked the Minister for Agriculture if he had made an investigation into the cost of production of grain crops and he replied that he had not.  That is a serious mistake.  Any prudent or practical farmer will acknowledge that the cost of growing wheat is far in excess of the cost of growing barley.  I estimate that the cost of growing an acre of wheat would be £4 more than the cost of growing an acre of barley.  You must take into consideration the deterioration in the soil which will result from the growing of wheat.  It must also be remembered that barley-growing is more remunerative than wheat-growing. For the coming year we are offered £2 a barrel for wheat, or 16/- a cwt., and we are offered 35/- a barrel for barley, which works out at 17/6 per cwt.; that is, ? a cwt. more than the price guaranteed for wheat.  There is no reasonable inducement being offered to the farmer to go in for the cultivation of a crop which is hardest on his land. That is one of the facts that may be adduced in support of this motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This intensive drive for increased wheat production was started too late in the year.  I asked the Minister for Agriculture last October if he was prepared to offer some special inducement to farmers to expand the acreage under wheat; particularly autumn sown wheat, and he replied that he was offering an increase of 2/6 a barrel.  That was not, in my opinion, a sufficient inducement to the grower, having regard to the enormous increase in the cost of production, and particularly <Col N="1904" /> in the cost of artificial manures. When it was too late to sow autumn wheat, the Government offered an additional 2/6.  To-day, when the time for sowing winter wheat is almost exhausted, we are offered a price which is less per cwt. than the price which can be obtained for barley.  These considerations should influence the Minister towards accepting this motion.</P>
    <P>The farmers have an adequate answer to those who claim that our demands for an increase in the price of wheat will add a substantial burden on the people, increase the cost of living, and especially the cost of the loaf on the poor man's table.  If we do not get a sufficient wheat crop the Government may find it necessary next autumn to purchase barley and oats at a higher price than they are now offering for wheat in order to mix them with the wheat crop and they will thereby provide an inferior loaf at a higher price than would be the case if they consented to the 50/-.  As Deputy Belton pointed out, the world market price for wheat may be 100 per cent. higher than the price which is being asked by the farmers, as very little wheat may be obtainable.  All these things should induce the Minister to reconsider his decision in regard to the guaranteed price.</P>
    <P>It must be remembered that the land available for extending the acreage under wheat is mainly being utilised at the moment for grazing purposes.  I believe that it is largely in areas where farmers concentrate on rearing cattle, leaving their lands under grass, and also in areas where farmers concentrate upon dairy farming, that the chief amount of land for our increased wheat production will be found.  If the farmers in such areas, who are not accustomed to tillage farming, who have not the experience or the equipment necessary for tillage farming, and to whom tillage farming will constitute more or less a step into the unknown, have to decide between oats, barley and wheat, they will be more inclined to concentrate upon the safer crops, such as oats and barley, rather than on wheat.  For that reason, and because the cost of production will be much <Col N="1905" /> higher on those farmers than on the ordinary tillage farmers, having regard to the fact that they will have to purchase their equipment and embark on an entirely new system of farming, justice, apart from expediency, would dictate that the Minister should offer a more reasonable price.</P>
    <P>When we are told that we should consider the interests of the consumers, we are inclined to ask, have the interests of the consumers been considered in the past?  Have the interests of the consumers been watched when the millers were making enormous profits and when one middleman, as Deputy Corry pointed out in a recent debate, could make £66,000 on a parcel of wheat?  In view of what has happened in this country in recent years, I think the interests of the consumers have not been carefully watched.  If those who are exploiting the farmer's produce and making exorbitant profits out of it were carefully watched, it would be possible to give the farmer a much more reasonable price without increasing the cost to the consumers.  If the Minister will give careful consideration to those facts, I believe he will have no hesitation in altering the guaranteed price to 50/- a barrel.</P>

      <P>I regret that I cannot support this motion and I honestly think it would be wise of Deputy Belton to withdraw it.  I do not think that the agricultural community are prepared to hold the nation up to ransom.  I believe that Deputy Belton threw out a challenge to the Minister a while ago.  Is Deputy Belton prepared to state that, if the farmers were guaranteed 50/- a barrel for wheat, this country is going to get its full requirements in wheat?  Is he prepared to stand up and guarantee that? He is not, for he knows he could not.</P>

      <P>I am going to do my part, and I hope every other Deputy will do his part, in the campaign to produce more wheat but you are not going to get your full requirements.  You could not get your full requirements produced in this country owing to the campaign against wheat-growing that was carried on in this country from 1932 to 1940.  That is the reason you cannot get it.  Face up to the problem and look it in the face.  I have gone into the costings very carefully indeed. Men who grow wheat at 40/- are not going to become millionaires but neither are they going to lose anything at 40/- a barrel.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>No matter how much they grow, they are not going to lose on any single acre of it, if they get 40/- a barrel and I know that.  I have been at it long enough to know it.  I am not a farmer who stands on the fence; I work myself.  What I should like to see, and what I think the country and this Dáil should insist on, is the publication of the costings of that wheat from the time it leaves the farmer's hands at 40/- until it is delivered in the form of loaves of bread to the poor. Let there be an end to the £66,000 robbers, the leeches who are battening on the unfortunate farmer and on the poor of the country as well.  Imported wheat which was bought last harvest in Britain at from 37/6 to 40/- per barrel was sold here at 60/- to 65/- per barrel&mdash;roughly about £10 per ton profit.  Who got that £10 profit?  How much of it went in freightage and how much went into the merchants' pockets? That is what the farmers of this country want to know.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1907" /> Last harvest those of us who sold wheat to the merchants were paid only 37/6 for it.  Recently when we ran short of wheat for seed purposes, we had to pay 65/- to the merchants for the same wheat.  If there is to be a fixed price at which the farmer is to sell wheat, let there be a fixed price at which the merchant will sell it&mdash;a squaring up in the profits and a prevention of the fleecing that is going on in this country without any consideration for the general interests of the people.  There is supposed to be a Prices Commission operating in this country.  Who are they, where are they and what are they doing?  Are they paid public money?</P>
    <P>Let us know where we are, and let the Minister under his emergency powers step in to prevent profiteering. Unfortunately he did not step in in time.  He had a right to step in last October when he fixed the price which the farmers were to get for the wheat they sold.  That wheat was bought by the merchants at 37/6, and he had a right to say then that they would not be allowed to sell it at any price higher than 40/-.  He would then be getting nearer the mark.  If the farmer was to get only 37/6, the thief inside the counter should not be allowed to get £10 or £12 a ton profit on that wheat to put into his own pocket.  That is where the trouble lies.  If there was anything that would induce me to support Deputy Belton's motion, it is that mismanagement on the part of the authorities here.  I cannot call it by any lighter name.  It was mismanagement that allowed wheat for which the fixed price was 37/6&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>37/6 for seed wheat.  That was the price fixed for wheat that had been re-winnowed and re-cleaned, special samples.  It was taken in by the merchants at 37/6, and sold a few months afterwards at 65/-, allowing them over £10 a ton for throwing it into a loft for two months.  If a farmer wishes to buy a ton of superphosphates he has now to pay about £8 10s. for it.  It has jumped up recently from £6 <Col N="1908" /> odd.  If there is to be a restriction in profit for farmers who grow wheat, then I think these farmers are definitely entitled to demand that the costings of that wheat should be provided on a printed form from the day it leaves them until it is handed out again to the poor in the form of loaves of bread. We shall then see who is getting exorbitant profits.  Let those inspectors who are overpaid and underworked in this country get into the mills and into the merchants and see what their costings are.  If there is a Prices Commission in existence, let the members of that commission get out and get to work, and let the fleecing stop.</P>
      <P>Deputy Belton alluded to a certain matter here to-day, and I give him every credit for it.  I do not expect that all the scrap-iron of this country should be turned into reaping hooks, but I do know that there is lying in Haulbowline since before the war started machinery for turning that scrap-iron into billets, and for making plough-shares, etc.  It is lying there idle.  Why?  Because the owner of that plant is the sole person who has a licence to export scrap-iron out of this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am also concerned with the means of harvesting it and that is why I alluded to the other matter.  If the farmers of this country are to be tied down definitely to a price, if we are to be told that next harvest we are to get 40/- for our wheat and other gentlemen can come along and get 43/- for last year's wheat, it is a bit of a joke.  At the last meeting of this House I had occasion to call attention to that. In fact, one gentleman had demanded 43/3 for last year's wheat which he bought from the farmers at 35/-.  If the farmer is to be tied up in strings and told he will be paid a price made up of the cost of production plus a very small profit&mdash;if that is to be the position of the agriculturist&mdash;then let that go on. The bread of the poor is not a thing for profiteering in.  Let the middlemen be taken out of it this time and let it go direct from the farmer to the miller. Let profits be watched strictly and controlled. Let it go from the miller to the baker and from him to the people. Let there be the same watching and control over the profits of others as there is over the profits of the farmer. That is not an unfair thing to ask.  We are entitled to that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1910" /> The position to-day is ridiculous.  I grow wheat and when I am ready to harvest it I go to the local publican, who knows nothing about it, but who will get sixpence or a shilling more.  If the price is fixed at 40/- for the ordinary farmer, I will get 40/6 because instead of selling myself I get the local publican to do it and he puts sixpence in his pocket.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, I am quite satisfied to get 40/- and let the wheat go straight to the miller.  These leeches are sucking the blood out of this country. They can get a shilling more.  I believe two shillings can be got by the man who is a little bigger in the trade than the local publican.  One of those can get 2/- a barrel for the loan of his name on Corry's wheat going to the mill.  That is the way the game is worked until you come to the high priest&mdash;the fellow who buys at 35/- and sells at 43/3.  He is the high priest of the thieves.  They come along, they drive about in their Rolls Royces and smile at the man sweating in the field with his coat off to the harvest.  They say: &ldquo;When it is threshed we will send the bags around.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Let us have no more of that.  This House to-night should put its foot down and say there is to be an end to it, and that nobody is coming between the poor and the price of the loaf.  If that is done, I maintain that the 40/- wheat could be sold to the consumer at 1/- per 4-lb. loaf in the same way as the 35/- wheat was sold last year.  The only thing that prevents that is that the locusts must be fed.  Is this House going to stand by the locusts against the poor who sent us here?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I consider that the Government are to blame&mdash;and definitely to blame&mdash; for allowing wheat to be bought up by merchants at 37/- and sold now at 65/-.  I consider the Government definitely is to blame for allowing wheat imported from Britain and Scotland last harvest at somewhere between 37/6 and 41/- to be sold here <Col N="1911" /> at 65/-.  That is £25 for the seed alone of every eight acres in the ground.  I do not blame Deputy Belton and others like him for coming here and&mdash; seeing that others are getting all the fat&mdash;asking for a slice of the fat for themselves.  I consider it unfair and do not think the agricultural community as a body will stand over profiteering in the poor people's bread. That is the sole reason why I shall not vote for Deputy Belton's motion.  I believe this motion must be put through fairly quickly and will not delay the House.  I have gone into the cost and know we will not make any money.</P>

I am sorry that I cannot vote for the motion, but I will not make the agricultural community out as the body that are going out to fleece the people.  I think Deputy Belton would be well advised to withdraw the motion and to go on the lines of seeing that the wheat the farmer grows for 40/- will go to the consumer without anybody being turned into millionaires as a result of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>Speaking as a farmer, my first reaction to the demand for an increase in the price of any article produced by the farmers was that it should be supported, but taking the time and the circumstances in which we live, and the very serious national problems that confront the country, into account, we cannot risk thinking individually or even sectionally on any matter at the present time: we must think for the country and the <Col N="1914" /> community as a whole.  No person of vision will dispute the fact that we are facing in this country a period of grave economic difficulty and danger.  Apart from the normal number of people who are unemployed in this country, and that is a very considerable number, many more men, through no fault of their own, find themselves to-day in the unfortunate position that they are without any employment as a result of the petrol situation and other difficulties. From information available through a memo. published by the Federation of Irish Industries, many more people who are engaged in industrial occupations will swell the ranks of the unemployed as a result of the diminution or exhaustion of raw materials for industry in the next three or four months.  Those people are going to find it exceedingly difficult to live and they are facing very serious times for themselves and their families.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In our demand for an increased price we cannot lose sight of those facts, and I must say, judging by the attitude of the Minister and of the Government, from an agricultural point of view, I think it is not likely that the Government are going to agree to the demand put down in this motion, but I do suggest to the Minister, who has a very serious responsibility to face up to at the present time, that there are several factors that must be taken into account in assessing what price will induce the farmers to grow the maximum crop of wheat to meet our national requirements for the coming year.  For that reason, I say that I do believe that an adjustment of the price is necessary, if you take into account the fact that barley to-day is worth 35/- and oats worth 25/-.  In mentioning those two prices I might also refer, in passing, to the fact that there is a good deal of grumbling in the country by a number of people who feel that they have got a raw deal this year with regard to the price of barley and oats. The Minister was pressed time and again in this House to make some attempt to control the prices of barley and oats, and he knows that a big number of farmers sold barley at from 18/- to £1 per barrel.  We were also informed to-day that barley was being <Col N="1915" /> taken over for milling purposes and paid for on the basis of 30/- per barrel, and if a quantity was bought at 18/- to £1 per barrel it is obvious that some profiteering is going to take place and the farmer is not going to get anything out of it.</P>
    <P>I do not think anything can be done about it now, but if it were possible at all some compensation should be provided for the unfortunate people who suffered from the inability of the Minister or from the lack of willingness on the part of the Minister to step in and intervene in the matter and secure, for the man upon whom the nation is now depending to put his back into the job, the fair price for oats and barley that was available immediately after the harvest last year.  These men would be facing the situation now in a more cheerful frame of mind.  I suggest that 35/- a barrel for barley and oats leaves a small gap which, in the case of barley, amounts to 5/- a barrel, and in the case of oats to 15/-.  The guaranteed price now is scarcely sufficient to warrant the maximum effort on the part of farmers to produce wheat for the coming year.  We have been assured by the Minister for Supplies that from now until the end of the year there is no possibility of chartering any boat to bring cereals here, and that there is also no hope of any animal feeding stuffs reaching our shores. Bearing that in mind, barley and oats in a free market will not command lesser prices than at present.  Any keen agriculturist with any business capacity will appreciate the fact that present prices are bound to remain, and that barley, after next season, will be worth the price it is commanding to-day unless there is a complete change in the shipping situation, or Germany invades England and the war is at an end.  If that does not happen in the next few months, there is hardly any likelihood of any change in the war situation for the next two or three years.  That is the position concerning oats and barley which faces the Minister.</P>
    <P>There has to be taken into account also the fact that there is a serious <Col N="1916" /> shortage of artificial manures.  Any farmer who has had any experience of wheat growing realises the necessity for liberal, if not heavy, dressings of artificial manure in order to produce any kind of decent crops.  It must also be remembered that a great deal of our land, especially in tillage areas, is what I call marginal land, with very poor quality from the point of view of fertility.  That land requires a liberal dressing of farmyard manure as well as whatever quantity of artificial manure is available. Lacking sufficient artificial manure as a necessary adjunct to farmyard manure, I am satisfied that there will be a diminution in the yield of wheat for the coming year.  From statistics that are available about yields during the last war, we know that they flopped considerably.  The reduction is going to be greater now if the present situation continues, because we have been using artificial manures more extensively than was the case previously.  Consequently, the loss resulting from a shortage of artificial manure will show a greater diminution in yield.</P>
    <P>We are facing this position, that the campaign for the extension of tillage, and wheat-growing in particular, started about a month ago, and that we have to look to the big farmers to provide the extra acreage.  At this late hour in the season, turning up old grassland with deep turf, land that has not been exposed to atmospheric conditions for years, land that has not been properly aerated, that physically is not in best condition for any cereal crop without being exposed to the air for some time, the majority of farmers agree that the return from that type of soil, seeing that scarcely any artificial manures will be available, will not be satisfactory.  Another factor is this, that when that type of land is turned up, the distribution of artificial manure this season is to be based on the quantity that was purchased last year.  As the people who made the market for artificial manures are those who are entitled to whatever proportion is available, that may leave much of the land to which I am referring <Col N="1917" /> without any supplies.  It has been stressed by the Minister that that type of land does not require artificial manures.  I would agree with him if it had produced a second lea crop, or if it was old grassland turned up and exposed to the atmosphere but, speaking as an agriculturist, I would be doubtful about the yield.</P>
    <P>It would be different if that land had been turned up last autumn and properly aerated and consolidated by the reactions of the weather.  Then a fairly good return could be looked for.  It is doubtful what sort the wheat yield will be when that type of land is turned up now.  I would put the yield as low as 25 per cent. below normal.  That will be taken into account by agriculturists when they are making their arrangements, and they will probably produce oats.  I want to remind the Minister that he should bear in mind the difficulties that are going to be created as a result of a shortage of materials for industry, such as petrol, and that we are going to have a huge volume of unemployment. While I would be in agreement with Deputy Belton in his demand, surely the farmers have suffered long enough, as a result of the economic war and other unfavourable conditions, without being asked to make sacrifices now.  We must seriously face up to the present position.  The 50/- a barrel would be of very little use to farmers if, as a result, we had an upheaval, turmoil or revolution.  It would be better for them to have a price that would tide them over their difficulties, and also to have peace and order.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will there be enough wheat?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think we will have enough wheat, and I suggest to the Minister that an adjustment of price is necessary to encourage farmers to make a supreme effort in food production at this period of national danger.  I agree about that.  I also see the danger, from the Government point of view, of going too far there. I have no use for men who say that it is necessary always to appeal to the patriotic side of agriculture to do the <Col N="1918" /> job.  There is sufficient of the materialist in me to say that it is necessary also to appeal to the farmers' pockets.</P>
      <P>In discussing this inducement to farmers to put forward their best efforts, that type of land which has to be sacrificed in the national interest at present, possibly excellent grazing land that produces first-class cattle and which is to produce food for the nation, after the first year will have a big reserve of humus and plant food. In inducing farmers to break up that land, whether by compulsion or otherwise, some attempt should be made to compensate them.  One point that strikes me is that the farmer is entitled to an assurance that if he puts land of that sort under the plough he will get a profitable price for any crop he produces over a period of years.  I think we would not be far wrong if we adopted the British policy in that respect and guaranteed our people a good price for two years after the war.</P>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister a question on the matter of yield generally, because I am doubtful that we have got the right figures about it. We are told that last year the yield generally was one ton to the statute acre.  I have no doubt that many people did grow a ton of wheat to the statute acre.  Last year we grew 305,000 acres of wheat, and we are informed that so far the amount of wheat which has reached the millers is 200,000 tons, leaving 105,000 tons to be accounted for.  Let us assume we grew one ton to the acre.  Allowing for 50,000 tons of wheat held in reserve for seed, and I am doubtful if there is that amount held in reserve, there are still 55,000 tons to be accounted for.  It appears to me that the yield with which we are crediting this country last year is more than we got.  There is a considerable discrepancy to be accounted for, and I should like the Minister to give us some information as to how he accounts for the discrepancy between the 200,000 tons which the millers have received so far from last year's crop and the estimated yield of 305,000 tons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Corry that if agriculturists are asked in the coming <Col N="1919" /> year to grow wheat at a modest price we certainly ought to look after the handling costs of the wheat from the time it leaves the farmer until it reaches the consumer.  If we examine the balance sheets published by milling interests, we begin immediately to worry about their profits.  There is no justification for the profits shown in all these balance sheets.  It is time to get after that end of it if we want to keep the price of the loaf down.</P>
    <P>The farmers are quite willing to make this national effort to produce food for the nation.  They realise their responsibility in that respect, but they want certain help and assistance which ought to be forthcoming immediately from the Government.  I do not want to go into the question of petrol and oil again, but it is causing a good deal of trouble and irritation.  I am satisfied that the Minister for Agriculture is making every effort in regard to that. I think his Department and himself must find it very difficult to impress the Department of Supplies with the gravity of the situation.  It would be unfortunate if the Department of Supplies found that by saving a gallon a week per tractor they left tractors idle for one day in the week during the busy time that is approaching.  No risks ought to be taken about that.</P>
    <P>I suggested to the Minister before, and I now suggest it again, that some effort should be made by him to control the price of seed wheat.  If the Minister under his scheme licensed certain dealers to assemble Irish wheat and fixed the price they were to pay the farmer for wheat fit for seed at 37/6, surely the Minister has a basis there for fixing a fair price at which they should sell that back in seed to the farmer.  Even in my area I know there are certain people licensed under that scheme who are looking for well over 50/- for seed which they bought at 37/6.  In the non-wheat growing areas, where seed wheat is difficult to procure, I believe the price demanded for seed is far in excess of that.  There is no justification for that.  The Minister has licensed these people, he <Col N="1920" /> knows the quantity that is bought under his scheme, he knows the price that he agreed should be paid to the farmers for wheat suitable for seed, and he has the basis there for allowing fair handling costs, for taking out small grain, dressing, and that sort of thing. He has the basis right away on which he can fix a fair price for that seed. He ought not to lose sight of that, because there is some profiteering going on and it ought to be stopped.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corry made a very severe attack on middlemen.  Middlemen are very useful people in the community. Personally, I would not be inclined to rule middlemen out of the trade.  They are generally big merchants who are the only people to provide credit for the farmers at present.  To talk about credit for farmers through county councils is all eyewash.  There is no volume of credit provided in that way.  A considerable volume of credit is provided for farmers by big merchants who buy what is produced on the farm and provide anything that the farmers require.  They provide the seeds and manures, and they generally extend credit for these until the harvest.  If you cut them out from buying the wheat back from the farmers, how are they to collect their money from the farmers?  They have extended credit to the farmers all over the country by giving them artificial manures, seeds, etc.  Obviously, if you use them for the provision of that credit, you must not deny them the opportunity of buying back the produce so as to recover their money.</P>
    <P>There is another consideration, and that is, that I would not be inclined to reduce the element of competition that may be there as a result of leaving a number of individuals in the trade.  I know very well what would happen if you cut out all that competition and left it to the millers to buy the wheat.  They would get very particular about the quality and the bushelling, etc.  Except you had an excellent sample of wheat, they would tell you that it was not up to standard or in proper condition and would cut you 1/-, 2/- or 3/-.  If you maintain <Col N="1921" /> the element of competition that is there as a result of letting the middlemen operate, you will not be faced with that problem, because owing to the competition these people will not be nearly so particular as they might be if they had a monopoly.</P>
    <P>There is just one point that struck me about Deputy Belton.  He said that we should think in terms of wheat and wheat alone.  I see a real danger of this country thinking in terms of wheat and of wheat alone.  We have a certain standard here at present, and it ought to be our effort to try and preserve that standard for our people.  We can only do so by preserving our volume of exports.  We must make a determined effort to preserve that volume of exports and, if possible, expand it, although, with the situation that is now facing us, that does not seem likely.  At any rate, we should try to preserve our present volume of exports until the termination of the war, because in the post-war period there will be a scramble to get into the market where we sell our exports.</P>
    <P>The Dominions will be looking for trade there because they may feel, and feel rightly, that they have helped and participated in the war.  The only argument we will have in that period for the preservation of our quota of trade with Great Britain will be that we maintained that trade during the war period.  At least we can say to the people at the other side: &ldquo;You people were damn glad to get whatever food we were able to provide you with during the war period, and now, during the post-war period, we, at least, are entitled to get that quota of trade.&rdquo;  I feel that if our export trade diminishes between now and the termination of the war, we will have no real argument at all for an expansion of that trade in the post-war period. No matter what people may believe or say about a self-sufficiency policy for this country, there are a great many things that, as a civilised country, we must import.  We are not in a position to produce them ourselves, and the only way to pay for those imports is by what we export.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1922" /> Deputy Corry said that the reason why we cannot produce our national requirements in wheat for the coming year is because of the campaign that operated against the growing of wheat from 1932 to 1940.  I do not think that is so.  Rightly or wrongly&mdash;perhaps I am wrong&mdash;I am of the opinion that the Government have not made sufficient use of our position, as a food supplier to Great Britain, to bargain for alternative cargoes of raw material for the production of food in this country. We should have put it to them, that every cargo of raw material&mdash; of animal food&mdash;landed here meant the production of essential food for export from this country.  Every cargo of wheat that could be landed here during the coming year would mean releasing a certain amount of animal food for the production of essential food which eventually would reach their shores.  Therefore, I say that I do not think sufficient use was made of that bargaining weapon.  I do not think it ought to be lost sight of now. I have tried to impress on the Minister for Agriculture the importance of making full use of that bargaining weapon in the interests of agriculture and in the national interests generally.</P>

      <P>I am glad that Deputy Belton opened this debate by saying that we are all agreed that we want a sufficiency of wheat grown here to meet our requirements in the coming year.

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The first question that Deputy Belton put was, whether we could visualise wheat being sold here on a free market at the end of the next harvest at 40/- a barrel.  I do not know what exactly he means by a free market.  If we take what would be regarded as the world price for wheat. I do not think that wheat, in say Canada or the Argentine, is going to be any dearer next August or September than it is now, because we <Col N="1923" /> know that at the moment there is quite a lot of surplus wheat in both countries which they would be very glad to get rid of.  The question, of course, is whether we can get it across or not. The reason why we are anxious to get all the wheat we require grown here is because we may not be able to get that wheat across.  If we are not able to do so, then we cannot compare the world price with the price that our home-grown wheat should be.  If we could get that wheat across, and if by that time the shipping position is a bit better than it is now&mdash;if it is as good as it was, say, three months ago&mdash;then I am quite sure that wheat would be landed here at less than 40/- a barrel. The last cargoes of wheat that arrived here were landed at less than 40/- a barrel.</P>

      <P>Deputy Belton also said that, in all probability, we would be in the position next harvest of not having the wheaten loaf made from a 70 per cent. extraction of flour.  That is on the assumption that there is no wheat being imported.  Now, what Deputy Belton says is possible. Suppose some mill were permitted to buy all the wheat that is required and to mill all the flour that is required, with a 70 per cent. extraction, I do not believe that it could pay anything like 100/- a barrel, because I am sure it would not sell any bread if it did. The price of bread in that case would be ? per loaf instead of 1/-.  The loaf that is going to be produced from the 90 per cent. extraction is quite a good loaf.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1924" /> I think that Deputy Belton, or any other person in his normal health, would just as soon have the new loaf as the white loaf made from the 70 per cent. extraction.  It is only people who may have been reared in glasshouses that would yearn for the old white loaf.  The new loaf is not going to be a bad loaf.  It is not black.  It is a bit brown, and some people do not object to brown bread.  As regards the growing of wheat on barley land the price there is, of course, a factor.  Every farmer has his own ideas with regard to that.  I know farmers myself in the very best barley-growing districts, in districts where they are accustomed to get a very good yield of barley, and I think they would prefer to grow barley at £1 a barrel rather than wheat at £2 a barrel, certainly some of them would.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Those men have very good barley-growing land and you could not induce them to change over to wheat growing.  I would not try to induce them to do so, because if those barley growers can produce 30 cwt. of barley to the statute acre where they might only produce 20 cwt. of wheat, it would be a mistake to try to persuade them to change over.  It would be a mistake for this reason, that they are doing better for the country by growing good barley and getting a good yield than they would by changing over and getting just an average yield of wheat. That is the extreme case&mdash;the very good barley grower who is almost certain to get a very good yield. There are, then, the border-line cases, men who live on the rim of this barley-growing area, who have grown barley in the past but who have not grown wheat in the past, but who probably could get as good a yield of wheat as of barley.  They will compare the prices, stone against stone, and will make up their minds as to which crop they will grow.  It is a matter for them to make up their minds, taking <Col N="1925" /> into account the guaranteed price for wheat and the guarantee that all their wheat will be taken by the miller, as against a certain amount of instability so far as the barley market is concerned. Deputy Belton said that if we fixed 50/- as the price, he could assure us of our full requirements.</P>

Surely Deputy Belton could not be a logical man and, at the same time, be all his life an advocate of wheat growing, if he thought he was thereby asking the farmers to make a sacrifice.

      <P>The Deputy says that wheat takes too much out of the soil. That is one of the things said against wheat growing, but I thought that Deputy Belton, instead of using these old arguments against it, would have put forward some new argument in favour of it which could be put to the farmer and which would satisfy him that he was not doing anything wrong with his land by growing wheat, but that he was really doing good for his country and himself.  I am sorry to say that Deputy Belton's speech was not <Col N="1926" /> helpful in that respect.  The Deputy said a good lot about the danger of the farmer growing barley rather than wheat, and I must assume from that that what he had in mind was that if we gave a better price for wheat, we would have a turnover from barley and oats to wheat&mdash; a turnover and not new tillage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;then, I think we would be on better ground because that is what we want.  We do not want any man to grow less barley, oats or potatoes.  We want every farmer to grow more, and, at the same time, we want them to grow much more wheat.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought the Deputy was illogical, but now I am going to prove that he is logical, because he talks of the pity of taking some of the offals hitherto available for the feeding of animals and putting them into flour. It is true that when we have not enough wheat to get a sufficiency of flour on a 70 per cent. extraction, we must take more from the wheat.  We must raise that extraction to 90 per cent., and on that account we have only 10 per cent. of pollard and bran left for animals instead of the 30 per cent. we had hitherto.  Deputy Belton deplores that, and he is right, of course.  Naturally we must wait and see what acreage we get.  If we have sufficient acreage, we can go back to the 70 per cent. extraction, and if we have not got altogether sufficient, we must make the extraction somewhat higher, and we may be in the position that we will not get as high an output of offals for animal feeding as we had <Col N="1927" /> in normal times.  Wherever I have talked to farmers, I have tried to impress on them that not only must they replace the imported feeding stuffs for animals, but also the loss of offals for animal feeding brought about in that way.  As I say, if we get sufficient to go back to a 70 per cent. extraction, it will be all to the good, because we will be back to normal again, so far as offals for animal feeding stuffs are concerned.</P>

      <P>Yes, on the basis of 70 per cent., if we can.  I do not think the Deputy is right about foreign exchange.  I do not think the Ceann Comhairle would allow us to go into that subject because I would certainly become irrelevant if I did.  I would probably become irrelevant so far as foreign exchange itself was concerned, but I cannot see that it has anything to do with the want of petrol or wheat in this country.</P>

It is <Col N="1928" /> costing so much for seed and so much for manure, and then let us say that the land is costing, if you like, 30/- an acre, where the farmer pays his own rent and rates, £2 an acre, or, if you like, what I know at least one man in County Meath paid, £12 an Irish acre for land to grow wheat on and make a profit.  You will find the profit quite a decent one, and that of the sum total the farmers will get, if they grow a full wheat crop during the coming year, they will have about £4,000,000 profit which is not a small item, after paying all outgoings, rent, rates, wages, seeds and everything else, and not counting anything for wheaten straw.  We will give him that for nothing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I say that what the Deputy said is quite obvious and that is why, at some county committee meeting I attended, I pointed out that I would much rather see the farmers going through this war and paying off what they owe, than to owe more at the end of it, as was the case after the last war.  Somebody said he was very disappointed with my statement, but I think it would be a great thing if we kept our farmers from going into debt, if we could enable them to pay what they owe and enable them to face the peace, which will be a difficult problem for them, at least out of debt.  I do not think that we need go back to the reaping hook.  I cannot imagine our doing that.  In the harvest, we may meet unexpected difficulties.  But we have a number of reapers and binders.  They can be worked by tractors.  If the tractors cannot be driven, they can be worked by horses.  If we have to go beyond <Col N="1930" /> that, we have the mowing machines which were used 25 or 30 years ago and which are still used, to some extent, in the country.  If necessary, it would be better to cut down the corn with the bare blade of the machine than go back to the reaping hook.</P>
      <P>I am asked if I will take responsibility for having a sufficiency of wheat at the present price.  I have been around the country quite a lot and not a single farmer &mdash; Deputy Belton included&mdash;would say he would grow an extra acre if we made the price 50/-.  I should like to know if Deputy Belton or Deputy Cogan would tell me that they know a farmer who would grow more wheat if we offered 50/-.</P>

      <P>It is all very well for Deputy Brennan to ask: &ldquo;Why not fix a price?&rdquo;  I explained that matter some weeks ago.  Some wheat was imported from England at as high as £3 per barrel.  That could not be sold at 50/-.  Some wheat was brought in at lower prices and the price went down to 37/6.  If wheat is coming in at all sorts of prices and is being bought at all sorts of prices by the seed merchants, how can we fix a price?  In the case of winter seed wheat, the Prices Commission stated that they were prepared to investigate every single allegation of overcharge and see what the origin of that particular wheat was and what a fair price would be.  There is no use in Deputies coming here and making complaints when they will not go to the trouble of writing to the Prices Commission and getting them to investigate these complaints.</P>

      <P>They cannot act promptly when they are not asked to act.  That is the position.  Why does not Deputy Corry, who makes all these allegations, do something definite instead of coming here and talking about the matter?  I know Deputy Corry will come here and mention cases in the Dáil or to me outside and again and again when I ask him for specific figures, evidence, and so on, I do not get them. There was one case he mentioned here at a previous meeting of some particular merchant who had bought wheat at 35/- and who was trying to get 45/3 for it.  I pointed out here on that occasion that I am not concerned in the least whether he gets it or not because the miller, at whatever price he buys his wheat, will have to sell his flour at a fixed price.  It is his own look-out if he did not get the wheat in time and if one miller is looking for wheat now it is because he was not prompt enough at the proper time and, if he has to pay a bit more to this particular dealer, whoever he may be, it is the miller who is going to be at the loss.  The consumer is not going to suffer.</P>

He mentioned the question of credit.  I am not going into that at all.  Deputy Corry spoke for quite a long time and quite glibly about the Government and the Civil Service not doing their duty.  He went on to say that when the Cork County Council brought in this scheme of credit he saw smiles on the faces of all the down-and-outs.  Why was it not brought in three months earlier?  Why should Deputy Corry come along and talk about the Government not doing their duty?  Why do not the Cork County Council do their duty?  Why did they not bring in the scheme earlier?</P>

      <P>I want to say this, for Deputy Corry's benefit, that the Land Commission are doing their duty with regard to the Tillage Order.  Deputy Hughes referred back to a thing that is often referred to in this House, that the farmers are disgruntled because <Col N="1936" /> they did not get the price they might have got for their barley and oats for last harvest.  Nothing is to be gained by going back over that.  I could turn up Parliamentary Debates and could show that I was being pressed by Deputy Hughes and others all that time to allow all that stuff out of the country.  I was asked for export licences.  But look at the position now.  I tried to impress on Deputies that we would be short of feeding stuffs and that I could not let it out. Every time I spoke&mdash;I could turn up speech after speech in the Dáil&mdash;I said, let the farmers hold their grain and they will get the price they want later on.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is unwise for Deputy Hughes or anybody else to forecast that the price for barley and oats will be as good for the next harvest as it is now.  I would not like to say that.  Maybe it will.  Maybe it will be better, but I would not like to say that to any farmer because the farmers of this country may think that Deputies in this House have more knowledge of the world situation than they have.  They may think that when Deputy Hughes says that, he is talking from greater knowledge than they have.  I think it is a dangerous thing to say to the farmers they will get 36/- for barley or 26/- for oats for the next harvest, because they may not get that or anything like it.  The price is there for wheat which is a good price and guaranteed for any amount they may have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1937" /> I am asked by Deputy Belton and others what the Government thinks about this price and what I think.  I think definitely we can get sufficient wheat for an all-wheat loaf in this present campaign of appealing to farmers, not altogether on the price basis but on the basis of their sense of duty to the nation.  It is my firm belief&mdash; I think every Deputy here will agree with it too, because they all know the farmers as well as I do&mdash;it is my firm belief that by appealing to the farmers that it is their duty to grow this wheat rather than by appealing to them to come in and make plenty of money we are more likely to get the big acreage than by announcing a bigger price.  I think we will get quite a decent acreage, as I say.  I do not think we will be able to go back to 70 per cent. extraction, but I think we will be able to get an all-wheat loaf and I think we will be able to get that at the present price of 40/- a barrel.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>To go back to the 70 per cent. extraction, 600,000 acres.  I think we should get over 500,000 acres at this price.  Every place I went&mdash;and I travelled quite a lot&mdash;the farmers said that they would do everything possible to put down more wheat.  They did point out certain difficulties.  Some of them talked about credit.  Some of them talked about the difficulty of getting their tractors out and some of them talked about other things but in no instance, in all my travels through this country, did any farmer ever say 40/- a barrel was not sufficient.  They all appeared to be satisfied with that price. If you like, I put it up to them, because in my speech in any one of those places I never omitted to say that I thought 40/- was a good price, and I was never contradicted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Not one of them said that they would plant even an acre more if the price was increased.  It is not really a big matter at all.  Last year we grew wheat on 2.6 per cent. of the arable land of this country.  The arable land is computed to be about 11,500,000 acres. We grew 2.6 per cent. of that in wheat. We have to double that in order to be comfortable about wheat for the coming year&mdash;that is 5.2 per cent. of our arable land.  I do not think that all the land classed as arable in this country would be wheat growing.  On the other hand, take a county like, say, Donegal; in those returns we get 428,000 acres as arable, while the county contains 1,193,000 acres.  There is a little less than one-third of County Donegal put down as arable.  Take a county that might be better known perhaps to a number of Deputies, the County Tipperary.  There we have 843,000 arable acres out of 1,051,000 acres, that is four-fifths of Tipperary is put down as arable.  Those figures show that it is only the land which can be tilled that is classed in those returns as arable.  If we take as wheat growing even two-thirds of what is regarded as arable, it means that we need not grow wheat in this country on the same land more than once every 13 years, so all this talk about the fertility of the soil, or the difficulty about artificial manures, and so on, does not really deal with very serious matters in the growing of our wheat requirements.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;instead of being unhelpful about this wheat campaign. <Col N="1939" /> As I say, I am only talking from my own experience.  First of all, as I mentioned already, if we go on the experience of the South Dublin Union, taking their costs of working the land and their costs of seeds and manures, adding the average rents and rates which the farmer has to pay and adding the cost of harvesting the crop, the farmers of this country growing all the wheat we require are going to have £4,000,000 profit.  Why should we add another £2,000,000 by accepting Deputy Belton's motion?  That is the first point.  The second point is that I have not heard any farmer in this country saying he will grow another acre of wheat if we give 50/-.  But suppose we did get a number of farmers to do that, and suppose we were to push up our crop by, say, 50,000 acres&mdash;from 500,000 acres to 550,000 acres&mdash;by paying this 50/- a barrel, look at what the extra 50,000 acres is going to cost us.  It is going to cost us £2,000,000 in addition&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Whether it is going to be a 70 per cent. or an 80 per cent. or a 90 per cent. extraction, I would not like to forecast.  I am hoping it will be well below the 90 per cent. extraction.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the Minister would put me in the same line as Deputy Belton as having been a persistent advocate of wheat growing in this country.  I certainly was not, but I have been prepared, whatever my views were in previous years, to do my part in helping the Minister in this very critical situation in which we find ourselves.  Wherever it has been possible for me, I have advocated that in this emergency the people should follow the advice of the Minister in growing what wheat is necessary. Speaking a moment ago, the Minister asked us to face up to the real problem, and concentrate on what would induce a man to break more land to grow wheat.  He said that was the kernel of the matter.  The Minister said that whatever extra acreage of tillage we are going to get will mainly come out of the large farmers' land, the land in the counties where they had not tilled much before. I agree; it will come from my county and other counties like it.  What is going to be the inducement?  At this late hour of the day, with probably a fortnight available to put in winter wheat, the farmers are being asked to make this effort.  The Minister spoke of sacrifice, and said we ought not to mention the word in connection with wheat.  I am going to mention it.  It will be a sacrifice for some of those men to put in wheat in mid-February, because if they were left to themselves, having being compelled to till, they would grow mainly oats, in my county at any rate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If some of us appeal to them to put in wheat instead of growing oats, we have got to point out the advantages. Three or four difficulties will occur to Deputies who know anything about growing wheat at this hour of the day.  First of all, since the seriousness of the emergency was pointed out to the people nine or ten days ago, very little could have been done because of the weather.  Most of the south of Ireland is at the moment covered with a coat of snow.  It will <Col N="1941" /> be possibly another ten days, or perhaps in some districts 14 days, before the wheat can be put in.  It will then be on the border line of danger as far as winter wheat is concerned.</P>
    <P>Three or four factors will militate against the farmer putting in wheat instead of oats.  First, there is the possibility of a late crop, which means a light crop and probably a risky crop, because there is the danger of its eventually not ripening.  We have, as the Minister said, a guaranteed price for millable wheat.  I do not think anybody asked the Minister to say definitely if he would even go as far as making the price a guaranteed price for any wheat, because the farmer is going to take the risk that some of it may not be millable.  If we are to engage on the dangerous operation of growing winter wheat into March, there is a danger that much of it is not going to be millable wheat.  I want some intimation that the guaranteed price of £2 is going to apply to that; I am not at the moment talking of the extra price.  The Minister said also that he personally would like to give the farmers such a price as would leave them, after this emergency is over, in a position to face the world clear of debt.</P>
    <P>I am at one with the Minister there. I would welcome whatever advantages can be got out of growing wheat, even outside of the emergency, and I would like to see a desire on the part of the farmers to grow wheat.  I hope that the members of our farming community will emerge from this emergency free of debt.</P>
    <P>I spoke on this particular matter on the debate on supplies and I told the Taoiseach that I did not consider £2 a barrel a fair price considering the nature of the emergency, the risk the farmers had to run and the chances they were taking with regard to other crops.  I said that if we are to produce all the wheat that is required there should be some adequate inducement. I suggested a price inducement and I am again suggesting it to-day.  I do not suggest that we should go as far as Deputy Belton wants us to, but we <Col N="1942" /> ought to offer some inducement.  The Government should arrange that the guaranteed price will apply to whatever wheat is grown, whether or not it turns out to be millable.  The Minister gave some comparisons relating to the cost of wheat-growing.  One instance he gave was that of the Dublin Corporation.  I do not know how they are going to grow wheat cheaper than anybody else.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that the present guaranteed price would give the farmers a profit of £4,000,000.  I do not agree with his calculation.  A profit of £4,000,000 would mean, roughly, that the farmer is going to get a profit of £1 a barrel on his wheat.  A profit of £4,000,000 on 600,000 acres of wheat works out, roughly, at a profit of £7 an acre.  The return from each acre would be about seven barrels, so that on the Minister's calculation the farmer would get a profit of £1 a barrel.</P>
    <P>On the Minister's calculation it would appear that the expenses attending the growing of wheat, the expenses involved in the tilling, seeding, ploughing, rolling, cutting, stacking and threshing, will not exceed £1 per acre.  I do not believe all that work could possibly be done for £1. I will leave it to other Deputies to argue whether £1 would be a reasonable figure.  If any Deputy believes that the Minister's calculation is a fair one&mdash;that there is going to be a profit of £1 an acre&mdash;then my argument must fall.  I do not believe that the Minister's calculation is a correct one.</P>
    <P>When we ask for an increase in the guaranteed price for wheat the challenge will immediately be thrown at us &mdash;and perhaps it is a reasonable one &mdash;to indicate how the price is going to be borne.  We are told that it will increase the price of the poor man's loaf.  Any farmer who seeks an increase in the guaranteed price does not desire that ultimately the burden will fall on the unfortunate consumers. The original intention when the bounty on wheat was introduced was that the cost would be borne by the State.  We departed from that idea and the cost ultimately fell on the consumer, <Col N="1943" /> through the miller.  I am against the burden being placed on the consumer.</P>
    <P>So far as the wheat position is concerned, we are facing an emergency. We are making preparations to meet whatever contingencies may arise through the international conflict that is proceeding around us.  One might argue that a strong defence force is necessary now and that the cost must be borne by the ordinary citizen.  I suggest it could equally be argued that there is a great necessity for the growing of wheat by certain farmers who would not otherwise grow it, and whatever extra cost is involved it should be borne by taxation just the same as in the case of armaments or whatever else arises through this emergency.</P>
    <P>One does not like to say much about profiteering, but I think the farmer should be protected against the profiteers.  However glibly the Minister may try to get out of it, the fact remains that there has been profiteering. Last March I forecast what was going to occur in relation to another crop.  The oat crop was bought from the farmers at 8d. and sold afterwards at 2/6.  I warned the Minister to take precautions that that would not occur again, but it did occur.  I sold oats for 10d. and 11d. a stone and I saw some of my own oats being sold subsequently at 2/4 a stone.  It was sold for seeding purposes to farmers.  I am sure other cases of a similar nature could be quoted.  Then we are told that there has not been any profiteering.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe the price of wheat as seed has gone up to £3 or more.  I should like the Minister to submit a case to the Prices Commission in relation to the price that is being charged for seed wheat.  A stone of wheat cannot be got in Limerick under 3/-.  One of the best known farmers' organisations in the county is charging £3 3s. 0d. for seed wheat and, when asked why that should be, the <Col N="1944" /> explanation was that they could not get any profit even at that price.  I believe they are telling the truth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no profiteering, so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>There is profiteering somewhere when you compare 37/6 with £3 3s. 0d.  I do not say that that particular co-operative is profiteering, because I believe they cannot buy it now at a lower price.  If they cannot buy at a lower figure, with all the machinery at their disposal for purchasing, what chance has the ordinary farmer of buying it at a reasonable figure?  It just cannot be done.  I understand that as much as £4 a barrel has been charged for wheat seed and those who are selling it feel themselves entitled to charge the £4.  Just imagine the position in which the average farmer finds himself.  Very little time is left in which to sow winter wheat.</P>
      <P>There is every possibility that the farmer will have to rush the crop and put it into land which may not be in a reasonably satisfactory condition.  All farmers will have to take a risk.  There may be a late crop, there is the possibility that the crop will not ripen and farmers cannot be sure that the wheat when it is grown will be millable. Again, we have no guarantee even if it is millable that it will be taken.  In view of all these things we might reasonably expect that some adequate inducement will be offered by the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFagan" hpid="Mr. Fagan Mr. Fagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not believe that the Government are handling the situation in the right way.  I am not in favour of a minimum price of 50/- per barrel. I believe the wheat crop will pay the farmer all right, but the question is, will we be able to get enough wheat sown at the guaranteed price of £2 a barrel?  Take the position of farmers in the midlands.  I know quite a lot of them who are prepared to grow oats and barley instead.  Oats will make £1 a barrel and they will get at least 17 or 18 barrels off an Irish acre.  That means £17.  If they have eight barrels <Col N="1945" /> of wheat off an Irish acre that will amount to £16.  I do not think that anybody will contradict that.  Again, the farmer will have the oaten straw, which he can feed to his stock and it is much better for the stock than wheaten straw.  In addition to that farmers, for the purpose of growing wheat, will have to do a lot more with the land.  If they till a lot more it will mean a reduction in meadow land.</P>
      <P>The farmers will sow oats from which they can obtain fodder to replace hay which they formerly got off meadow land which has now to be tilled.  These are points the Minister should bear in mind if he wishes to be in a position to deal adequately with the crisis which is upon us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of farmers will sow as much wheat as possible but then there are many farmers in the midlands who are financially in a very bad position as the returns from the sheriffs' offices will show.  Many farmers who want to maintain their stocks would prefer to grow oats instead of wheat.  There are a number of other things which will militate against the growing of more wheat.  One is the price of seed wheat. The Minister may say what he likes but the price asked down in my county is as high as 68/- for spring wheat and 55/- for winter wheat.  One would be very lucky to get seed wheat at £3.  To mention a personal experience, I tried to purchase a quantity of Squarehead Master and I was told by certain merchants that they might give me some Squarehead Master at 55/-.  I approached a merchant in Mullingar.  He told me to see him on Tuesday, the fair day there. I saw him on that day and told him that I wanted 12 barrels.  He said he would be able to get only six barrels from the millers but the price, which he stated on Friday would be 55/-, on that day was raised to £3 per barrel. I took the six barrels and was glad to get them.  That is the position with regard to spring wheat.  In many cases a price as high as £3 8s. per barrel has been charged.  If the Minister says it is the duty of Deputies to report these increases in price, I say that it is the <Col N="1946" /> duty of the Government to look into the matter themselves to find out the cause of these increases and to control the price.  Give the merchants a fair profit.  They are entitled to a fair profit, but they are not entitled to profiteer at the expense of poor struggling farmers.  If you happen to be a poor struggling farmer, who has to go into a merchant without having ready cash to pay for the seed, you are very glad to get it no matter what the charge is.  If there were a controlled price, the farmers could not be victimised in that way.</P>
    <P>Take again the case of oats.  The Minister says that he advised people to keep their oats, but if he and the Government were doing their duty, they would have made it possible by paying a subsidy for poor men who had to sell their oats, to keep at least sufficient for seed purposes.  As it was, the poor man had to sell his oats.</P>

      <P>There is no use in sidetracking the issue by saying that farmers were told not to sell their oats at 12/- a barrel.  What could they do when they were being harassed by the sheriff's men?  Farmers who could afford to do so, kept their oats in their lofts but it was the small man and the poor man who had to part with it and who has now to pay an exorbitant price for seed.  The present Government were supposed to be a poor man's Government, but at every opportunity they have allowed the poor man to be squelched.  They are allowing the poor man, who has to go in begging for credit, to be squelched at present.  We are all anxious to help the Government in this tillage campaign, but at the same time we are anxious to see fair dealing between man and man.  We cannot forget that we have passed through seven or eight very lean years as far as the farmers are concerned and when, to-morrow, I get an answer to a question on the Order Paper, the <Col N="1947" /> number of sheriffs' warrants awaiting execution in my county which that question will reveal will open the eyes of some people.</P>
      <P>I should also like to refer to the question of vaporising oils.  The Minister for Supplies said to-day that tractors were getting a certain quantity of petrol.  I know that that is correct but at the same time there is a ramp being worked in the case of vaporising oils.  These oils are being used in lorries all over the country and the tractor men are not getting much of it.  A man is supposed to get a certain amount of vaporising oil in proportion to the area which he had under tillage last year, but the required quantity is not being supplied because lorries are using it.  I think that the Government should look into all these matters and try to help the people who are endeavouring to help them.  They should control the price of seed wheat right away and see that everybody concerned gets a fair deal.</P>

      <P>The purpose of this motion is one of inducement&mdash;to induce the farmers of the country to produce sufficient food.  I shall not concern myself with any interpretation of the wording of the motion.  I take it that its main purpose is simply to ensure that, in the national interest, a sufficiency of wheat will be grown.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Broderick Mr. Broderick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broderick</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister, alone in this House, has committed himself to the statement that, in his opinion, a sufficient quantity of wheat will be grown.  I feel that the Minister has a greater responsibility than any other individual in this State at the moment and as I say, he has committed himself to the statement that he believes that sufficient wheat will be grown.  I, for one, do not think so, for a variety of reasons.  I am not going to refer to the grain situation, but I shall state that in the last four years people have been growing wheat on land that was best adapted for that purpose and they have practically exhausted the potentialities <Col N="1948" /> of the land so far as wheat-growing is concerned.  They have now practically no reserve of such good land on their farms and any extension of wheat-growing will largely have to be carried out on land that was formerly regarded as unsuitable for the production of wheat.</P>
      <P>We must also allow for the human element in this question.  Every farmer faced with the problem of engaging in more tillage will consider the question of the production of wheat by relating the price of wheat to the price of oats and barley.  He will ask himself: &ldquo;Which is of greater advantage to me, wheat, barley, or oats?&rdquo;  Personally I should say that it would be far better, in his own personal interest, leaving out any question of the national interest, to grow either barley or oats.  I have been growing wheat for the last few years and if there were no question of national interest involved, I certainly should not grow wheat this year.  I feel there are a good many other farmers in the same position.  For any extension of wheat growing you will have to depend, therefore, on people who have not yet grown wheat and on land which has not yet produced wheat.  The people who are going to break up the lands are, to a large extent, inexperienced.  The Minister says that, of all the difficulties he has met, this is one of the greatest, as it is very hard to control them.  I am not going to refer to administrative difficulties, to the things which have been put as an imposition on the consumers of bread.  Nor am I going to deal with the references here to the enormous profits made by some sections and the difficulties of tillage. I say, however, that the Minister expects an increase in tillage from men who have neither the appliances nor the knowledge to give that increase.  The Minister has made one very strong point.  We cannot increase the price of wheat because we increase the price of the loaf on the poor person! It is extraordinary how that argument always is brought up when it refers to any assistance to agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1949" /> I think it is far more essential to secure the food of the people, to make certain that there will be no such thing as hunger or privation if it can be avoided.  That was the reason why I referred to the Minister as holding to-day the most responsible position in the country, because he is responsible for the averting of any such danger. When we come to contrast the Minister's attitude with making sure that there is no privation, then all the difficulties of finance are invoked and the great difficulties of putting up money of any kind.  However, if it comes to a question of defence, of protecting the people, millions can be passed in this House without criticism for that.  I hold strongly that it is far more important to make sure of overcoming the difficulty that will certainly arise&mdash;that of feeding the people&mdash;than to spend millions on what may or may not arise. I do not wish to delay Deputy Belton's opportunity to reply to the Minister's points, but I feel intensely for the position of the Minister.  I say quite clearly that he has the greatest responsibility in the State and is clearly entitled to the assistance, not only of this House but of every well-disposed person. In that matter the Minister has his responsibility, too, to give the people every assistance, to see that they are not exploited by any other section, to see that the production of their land goes directly from them to the consumer.  Above all, he has no right to censure anyone who cannot comply, unless he gives them assistance in seeding and tilling the land.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>This motion was put down for discussion in consequence of a circular issued by the Minister for Supplies on the 7th January last:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I am writing you to request your active assistance in an effort to secure a substantial increase in the acreage sown with wheat in your constituency during the present season.  The need for a considerable expansion in the quantity of wheat sown is very real and urgent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Present indications are that our available reserves of wheat will be completely exhausted by the time <Col N="1950" /> the 1941 harvest is garnered and that thereafter we will be wholly dependent on home-produced wheat. Efforts to secure shipping for the importation of wheat during this year have not been successful and it appears probable that no improvement in the position need be expected.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I need not point out to you the hardships that would result, particularly to poorer classes, if flour and bread supplies should be seriously curtailed.  I feel sure you will agree that this possibility must be avoided at all costs.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;My Department will, of course, take every course which may result in the importation of wheat from abroad, but our main hopes after August next are based on the expansion of home production to yield 100 per cent., or almost 100 per cent., of our requirements.  This involves an increase on the 1940 acreage of 300,000 acres.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is the problem&mdash;300,000 acres extra.  The Minister believes that he will get it through the inducements offered.  I believe he will not.  The Minister said that he once listened to me making a great speech in favour of increased tillage and of growing wheat. I practise it to-day to a greater extent than ever.  I have over 300 acres tilled and I have over 150 of wheat growing green now.</P>
    <P>The problem is whether we will get this 300,000 acres, or has the Minister abandoned hope of it?  Deputy Corry said he could not support the motion for 50/-.  He does not believe that we will get our requirements here.  Deputy Fagan said that he does not believe we will get our requirements, but he is against 50/- a barrel.  Are the farmers thinking rightly at all? Deputy Fagan said that £2 a barrel will pay the farmer.  If that were true, and the farmers of this country said that, I would say to the Minister that he should make them produce 600,000 acres.</P>
    <P>First of all, if 600,000 is sufficient for our requirements, get it at all costs. If £2 a barrel is enough, and if the <Col N="1951" /> farmers acknowledge that it is enough, they should be made produce it at that price, but the Minister has unequivocally stood over the statement that with the present inducements he is satisfied he will get the 600,000 acres.  I do not believe he will.  He spoke of a loaf at ?.  Calculate it any way you will, a loaf produced from wheat at £2 a barrel, as compared with the loaf produced from wheat at 50/- a barrel, would make a difference of only 25 per cent.  If he can produce a 2 lb. loaf at 6d., at £2 a barrel, it cannot be more than 7½d. at 50/-. There is no use in trying to delude the people by talk of an inflated price for bread.  What is all the talk about putting barley into it?  Is the Minister satisfied that he will not want barley, that he will have a wheaten loaf of 90 per cent. extraction?  We have not seen that loaf yet.</P>
    <P>I do not want to go over the ground I travelled in introducing this motion. The question of credits enters into it and it is a big one.  The Minister has said quite unequivocally that we will get sufficient wheat to give us bread, on the inducements offered.  The campaign has been started for another 300,000 acres.  Is the Minister able to tell us how much is sown now?  If 500,000 acres will give us a wheaten loaf of 90 per cent. extraction, is he able to tell us how much we have sown?  He should be in a position to do that.  He has the Guards at his disposal and they could take a census every week of what has been sown at a certain date and how much has been sown each week.  Then he could work out his returns and see from week to week how the position stands.  That could be done if this matter is taken seriously, but I am afraid it is not.</P>
    <P>I have been asked if I would guarantee that the full requirements would be grown if the price were 50/- a barrel.  Certainly I will guarantee that more than 25 per cent. would be grown at 50/- a barrel, and with proper co-operation, which this would bring, between the farmers and the Minister, generally, looking after and securing <Col N="1952" /> the credit position and also securing the return of that land to its original state when the emergency is passed&mdash; if confidence were given to the farmers on those points and 50/- a barrel offered I am satisfied that the 300,000 acres would be secured.  Will the Minister leave the matter open and go into conference with the farmers on this matter?  If not, I am going to challenge a division on this, and whether I can get four or five to stand up with me I do not care&mdash;if only the two of us stand up we shall do so, because we want to show the country that in putting down this motion we were inspired with the idea of securing a sufficiency of wheat to give a wheaten loaf to the people of this country at the lowest possible cost.  Nobody has got up and made a case against the case we have made.  Even though some Deputies said they were against an increase, yet their whole case was for an increase of the minimum price.  Will the Minister leave the matter open and confer with the farmers on this?</P>

      <P>Well, they are not satisfactory for the country because, if we do not decide now, there is no use in thinking after a month or two that we were wrong.  We are wrong enough now since we are tackling this matter so late in the season, and if we do not get the 600,000 acres the fault will not be that of the farmers; the fault will be on the shoulders of the Minister. The day may come when the Minister will have to dump barley into the flour and give the people inferior bread, and that will mean taking from the feeding stuffs pool the feeding stuffs required for our live stock.  That will be the case if the necessary precautions are not taken now to secure that an adequate amount of wheat is sown.  The Minister for Supplies, Mr. Lemass, stated at a meeting of the <Col N="1953" /> County Committee of Agriculture that he wanted 400,000 acres.  Surely, the Minister for Agriculture was not serious when he told us here in the House to-day that, on the costings of the Dublin Board of Assistance, £4,000,000 was to be made by the farmers?  Will he mention one individual, controlling this scheme on the Dublin Board of Assistance, who would know even how to tackle a horse?</P>

I will admit that a certain acreage of wheat, in your ordinary rotation, fitting in on nicely-nourished land where you are sure to get a good crop and be able to master it within your economy, can be got at that price; and provided overheads do not go up too high, £2 a barrel is a good price, but it is one thing to do what you have planned out to do, and another thing to come around, when the clock is striking 12, and say that in the national interest you want double the crop and that you want it produced on land that has not been properly nourished or encouraged for the growing of wheat.

During the spring tillage season of last year possession of six holdings was taken on my behalf and conacre lettings made. Sixty-eight prosecutions for breach of the Order had been brought in the District Courts prior to November last, when further legal proceedings had temporarily to be stayed, and in sixty-one of these cases penalties were imposed.  Since the end of December last arrangements have already been made for the institution of legal proceedings in eighty-one additional cases of default, and there are still others in connection with which the question of taking such action will be considered.</P>

      <P>Butter was exported by the Newmarket Dairy Company to Germany and Belgium in each of the years 1935 to 1938 inclusive, in accordance with arrangements made under the Trade Agreements with these countries.  The total quantity so exported was 162,868 cwt.  The returns received from Germany and Belgium in respect of this butter totalled £794,922.  It has been estimated that the transactions resulted in an advantage to the Exchequer of £140,280 by way of savings on export subsidies on the assumption that the butter if it had not been exported to these countries would have been exported to Great Britain.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1817" /> Prior to the Trade Agreements referred to the Newmarket Dairy Company exported to Belgium 17,866 cwts. of butter in respect of which it has been estimated that a sum of approximately £10,890 had to be paid by way of export subsidy in excess of the amount of export subsidy that would have been payable if the butter had been exported to Great Britain.  The estimated net saving to the Exchequer on all these transactions is, therefore, £129,390.</P>

      <P>Application for a service certificate under the Military Service Pensions Act, 1934, was made by Mr. John O'Mahony, Ahiohill, Enniskeane, County Cork, and was referred to the Referee.  On the evidence before him, the finding of the Referee on the application is that the applicant is not a person to whom the Act is applicable.  Statutory notification of the finding has been issued to the applicant, who has lodged an appeal for revision of the finding.  The Referee's decision on the appeal has been withheld pending the holding by the Referee and Advisory Committee of a session for discussion and verification of undecided applications and appeals from the Brigade area.</P>
