      <P>asked the Minister for Supplies if he will state whether, in fixing the price of turf for Dublin under Emergency Powers (Control of Prices) No. 106 Order, 1941, of the 1st November, 1941, at 64/- per ton, he carried out any examination with a view to ascertaining the price proper to be charged in Dublin for turf, and in particular if he examined (1) the price received per ton by the original producer; (2) the cost per ton of carriage <Col N="540" /> by railway, canal or other transport machinery; (3) the cost per ton of its distribution by Dublin wholesale distributors; (4) the profits per ton of Dublin wholesale distributors, and (5) the cost per ton of retail distribution, and (6) the profits per ton of retail distributors, and if he will state what these various amounts are calculated to be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to answer Question No. 5 and Question No. 6 together.  The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance fixed the price of turf in the County Borough of Dublin and in the County of Dublin by Emergency Powers (Sale of Turf in Dublin City and County) (No. 1) Order, 1941, on the basis of information supplied to him by my Department and all the factors mentioned in the Deputy's question were fully considered by my Department before advising the Parliamentary Secretary.</P>
      <P>The turf which was being marketed by Dublin merchants at the time the order was made was obtained by them from nearby counties at comparatively low freight rates and was not marketed in any considerable quantities, and for this reason a comparison cannot easily be drawn between the conditions prevailing at the time the order was made and present conditions.</P>
      <P>In so far as the data is available at the present stage an examination of the whole price structure of turf, in the terms indicated in the Deputy's question has been carried out in my Department.  The data available is, however, incomplete and the provision made at each stage in the price structure as well as the final retail price itself can therefore be provisional only.</P>
      <P>Turf for the non-turf areas is being procured through Fuel Importers (Eire) Ltd. from sources hitherto untapped, including the supplies made available, through local authorities and is being transported to the non-turf area from remote districts by varying means of transport.  For this reason both (1) the cost per ton to the original producer, and (2) the cost per ton for transport, are at present largely matters of estimation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="541" /> With regard to points at 3, 4, 5 and 6 of the Deputy's questions, the position is similar as, owing to the circumstances of the times, turf is being distributed in quantities never anticipated and by machinery never intended for this fuel.  Consequently the margin between the cost of the turf at Dublin and the price to be paid by consumers, which will be necessary to cover the costs and reasonable profit of distributors, including a provision for shrinkage, which is at present highly speculative, is also a matter of estimation.</P>
    <P>Since the primary considerations involved in this question of turf supplies are, firstly, to secure reasonably adequate supplies to consumers and, secondly, to provide these supplies at prices which will ensure distribution, the predominant factor which has determined the retail price of 64/- has been the maximum price which the consumer can, under present circumstances, be asked to pay.  The price of the turf delivered to wholesalers and retailers through Fuel Importers (Éire), Ltd., has therefore been so fixed as to provide provisional margins to cover the costs of distribution and profits of these traders, but this price will be subject to revision in the light of additional information which may be acquired.</P>
    <P>For the reasons I have stated it is not at present possible to provide accurate and detailed information of the nature requested by the Deputy, but I hope to be in a position to do so at a later date.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister take into consideration that when people are asked to pay 64/- a ton in Dublin it is important that we should know where that money is going, first, so that we might see that no party in the country was making an unnecessary profit out of the difficulties; secondly, so that we might estimate the efficiency of the machinery that is dealing with it?  Is the Minister aware that, while we cannot compare present days with the original days of the turf scheme, we had it stated here in the House that there was not a single part of the <Col N="542" /> country in which turf could not be sold to the consumers, at fair profit to the producer, to the railway company, and to the retailer, at 24/- a ton?  When one sees the difference between the 24/- a ton of those pre-war days and the price now it is terribly important to know where the money is going, as a test of where the profits are being made and as a test of administration. Would the Minister say when he hopes to be able to make a statement to the House that will give some clear idea as to where that 64/- is being distributed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The information which the Deputy wants is not available. Various estimates as to what the costs will eventually prove to be have been prepared but these estimates may prove in practice to be wrong.  One thing that appears reasonably clear is that the price at which Fuel Importers Limited are now selling turf to merchants will result in a loss to Fuel Importers Limited.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>If it is possible that the estimates are wrong then it is possible that this 64/- is unjust and wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>No.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely if the estimates at any particular stage are wrong it is likely that the price which is thus arrived at is wrong, and surely we cannot continue a situation in which either people are making unjust profits or people in Dublin are paying more for turf than they should.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I have explained that the price is not fixed on the basis of the estimate of the cost.  If it were, it would be considerably higher than 64/-. The price was based on another consideration altogether, which I explained in my reply to the Deputy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>

      <P>Is that person now being allowed to retail that turf at 64/- per ton, thereby getting £2 4s. for distributing the turf, while the cutter only got £1 per ton?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>A few months ago. The person in question enjoys an exceptional transport monopoly, as the Minister knows.  He paid no higher than £1 per ton for turf on road or on canal bank.  Is that person now getting away with 64/- for turf which he bought at 20/-?</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister will look up the <i>Leinster Leader</i> he will see advertisements offering to pay 20/- per ton for turf.  Surely he has sufficient staff in his office to do these things.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will state over what period since the year 1931 was an order by the Railway Tribunal in operation confirming the rate of 6/- per ton for the carriage of turf by rail; and if he will say over what period or periods since then the rate was actually in operation, and if he will state the rate or rates which immediately superseded the 6/- a ton rate.</P>

      <P>The Railway Tribunal fixed the 3rd August, 1933, as the date on which the uniform rate of 6/- per ton for the carriage of turf by the Great Southern Railways should become operative.  The 6/- rate ceased to operate on the 19th October, 1936, on which date the uniform rate order, under which it was fixed, was revoked. The rate was immediately superseded by exceptional rates varying from 4/- to 11/- per ton according to the distance involved.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for the Co-ordination of Defensive Measures if the permitted publication by <i>The Examiner</i> (Dundalk) in its issue of the 1st November, 1941, of the editorial entitled &ldquo;Roosevelt's Cock-and-Bull Story&rdquo; indicates a change in censorship regulations; if the revised regulations under which this editorial was allowed have been or will be circulated to the Press <Col N="545" /> generally; if the freedom of criticism granted to <i>The Examiner</i> will be accorded to writers in other newspapers, journals and books desiring to criticise the pronouncements of the Executives or members of Governments of States with which Eire has friendly relations, and if other newspapers may now publish such information as they may have as to the attitude of the belligerent Powers to religion and to Church institutions.</P>

      <P>The censorship regulations prohibiting the publication in newspapers and periodicals of offensive references to the heads and peoples of friendly States have not been revised and it is not proposed to change them.</P>
      <P>Publication of the article to which the Deputy refers was not permitted, as alleged in the first part of his question. It was published in contravention of censorship regulations without submission to the Press Censor.</P>
      <P>The moment the matter came to his notice the Chief Press Censor addressed a strong remonstrance to the editor calling for an explanation and directing that in future all editorial comment be submitted for censorship before publication.  The editor has since replied apologising for the publication of the article.  He stated that it was written in his absence and would not have been allowed to appear if he had an opportunity of seeing it.</P>

      <P>Has the Minister overlooked that other part of the question which has reference to the publication of information as to the attitude of belligerent powers to religion and to Church institutions in view of the fact that the newspaper in question recently published a statement that the Nazi organisation in Europe was looked upon in reliable circles as the natural protector of the Catholic Church?  In view of the permission to that newspaper to publish that statement, why have the sermons by the Bishop of Münster in Germany and pastoral letters by the Bishop of Achonry in this <Col N="546" /> country, and other statements from far more responsible sources, suggesting that the Nazi dispensation in Europe is the enemy of the Catholic Church, been suppressed?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the first part of the Deputy's supplementary, I have not the paper here, but I have no recollection of ever having seen such a statement made in that paper.  Certainly, if it was made, it was not called to my attention.  In regard to the second part of his supplementary, it has been our practice to prevent propaganda being made here for or against either belligerent on the basis that its enemy was anti-religious.  The Bishop of Münster's article came to this country in two parts, one part of which was supplied by the British Press Association, another part supplied by the German Press Agency.  Both portions were stopped.  My recollection of that statement is this&mdash;that one portion of it was a condemnation, starting off with a quotation from His Holiness the late Pope, condemning Communism, and going on to attack Communism and all its works and pomps, and claiming that one belligerent, the belligerent he favoured, was making a fight for religion.  We are not entering that question.  We are taking up the attitude that was taken up by Deputy Cosgrave on that point and we intend to stick to it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

      <P>Does the Minister advert to the fact that I now allege that this newspaper was permitted by the censorship to publish a statement that the Nazi Government in Europe was regarded in authoritative quarters as the natural protector of the Catholic Church?  If that statement were permitted to be published in this newspaper, is it just that an equally authoritative statement, pointing out that it is the irreconcilable enemy of the Catholic Church and of Christianity itself, should be suppressed?  If one tale is told, the answer should be allowed.  One side of the story, the lying side, should not be published while the truth is suppressed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>We are doing our utmost to keep the papers in the country from <Col N="547" /> making statements such as that the Deputy alleges this paper made in an issue which has not been brought to my attention.  If the statement quoted by the Deputy appeared in that paper, it was not permitted and it would not have been allowed if the censor had seen it.  The system of censorship is not that every editor in the country submits every point he is going to publish. If we were to adopt that system of censorship, it would be an undue burden on all the papers.  We cannot guarantee ahead that every editor in the country is going to comply with our regulations, but the few offences that are committed by an odd editor at an odd moment would not justify us in adopting the other system.  The editors throughout the country, thanks be to goodness, have co-operated very well.  We have adopted a system of regulations which we issued to them, in which we say that they must not talk offensively about either the heads or the peoples of foreign friendly States.  A few of them have at various times attacked the heads of friendly States and the same action was taken against them as was taken against this paper.  I think we shall have to be judged in this matter&mdash;and I think the Deputy and the people abroad will have to judge us&mdash;not in relation to a particular statement which slips through without being submitted, and against instructions, but upon the general tone of our papers.  I say this much, that the general tone of our papers is not that indicated either by what the Deputy refers to or by other cases which other people could bring up of similar mistakes.</P>

      <P>I was not aware that Mr. Gaffney's old age pension was withdrawn or of the consequent loss to him both as regards old age pension and value of food voucher, but I am advised that in law Mr. Gaffney cannot surrender his military service pension.  I cannot, therefore, take any steps to prevent similar hardships arising in the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister answer the last part of the question and state whether he will see that hardships of this kind will not be inflicted if similar cases arise in future?  This is the case of an old man in receipt of 10/- pension and a food voucher value 1/9, making a total of 11/9, who gets an I.R.A. pension of 9/3, and from whom the amount of 11/9 is stopped when he receives the pension of 9/3.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid the Deputy was not made fully aware of the facts of this case.  This man is drawing <Col N="549" /> another substantial pension, so that the military service pension is not altogether the point at issue.  He also recently drew a retrospective amount in respect of a military service pension of £160 odd.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has used words to suggest that I am not aware of the fact that this man is drawing another substantial pension.  The substantial pension to which the Minister refers is a sum of 6/- per week from the railway after 40 years' service.  Does the Minister consider 6/- a week a substantial pension?  With the 9/3 and this 6/-, the man has only 15/3 to live on, and if, with that 15/3, he could get his old age pension, it would help a little.  I ask the Minister to review the case.  We had this man before us at the Old Age Pensions Committee and his total means of livelihood to-day is the sum of 15/3.  He has lost 2/6 per week as a result of accepting the I.R.A. pension of 9/3, and he is aged 71.</P>

There is a very substantial amount of money for salaries involved and a very considerable amount in respect of bread, and I think the House ought to make up its mind now, if it does not conclude this to-day, whether it is going to sit to-morrow or next week to do so.  The House has a responsibility in the matter and ought to face it, particularly in view of the fact that the House is trying to meet the difficulties in respect of transport which various parts of the country are up against, and I think it is only the House as a whole can face that matter.</P>

      <P>Deputy Curran was hopeful that we might profit by our experience.  I think we should be able to profit by the experience we have had of this outbreak over the last eight or nine months.  As a matter of fact I intend, as I said when speaking last night, to put certain proposals before the Dáil to amend the Diseases of Animals Act. These amendments, of course, will be based on the experience we have gained during this outbreak.  Deputy Curran also asked why it was that we could deal so successfully with outbreaks in places such as Kerry and <Col N="553" /> Limerick as well as in Clare and Wicklow&mdash;there were only two cases in each of these areas&mdash;if we adopted the same measures as we had adopted in, say, Dublin and Kilkenny.  Well, of course, the same measures were adopted.  We were more fortunate in confining the disease in areas like Limerick, Clare and Kerry.  That may be very difficult to understand since the conditions were not very different in some of those areas where it was cleared up very quickly from the areas where it took a long time to clear it up.  Deputy Curran also gave instances of what he thought was evidence of indecision or bungling on the part of the Department. The Department issued an order to certain trainers forbidding them to send their horses to some race meeting, whether it was at the Curragh or some other place I cannot recall at the moment.  Deputy Curran said this order was withdrawn, and that the horses were allowed to go. What happened in that case was this: that, at least, one of the trainers who got notice forbidding him to send his horses to this particular race meeting telephoned the Department to say that the horse was on his way.  We were coming to the point where we would probably, in any case, have relaxed the restrictions in that particular area in another few days.  When this telephone message arrived at the Department we thought that it was hardly worth while to put the trainer to the inconvenience of bringing back the horse in order to have this particular order obeyed, and we thought that, on the whole, it was as well to rescind that particular order and allow this trainer and, of course, other trainers similarly situated, to send their horses to the meeting.  That, of course, would not have been done were it not for the fact that we were on the point, in any case, of relaxing the restrictions in that particular area.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That does not follow at all.  Any Deputy must see that, if he has a little bit of common sense and does not want to blame us.  As I have <Col N="554" /> said, we were going to relax the restrictions on a certain day.  It does not make a big difference whether you do that a day after or a day before.  I think any Deputy will admit that.  If we find that we are going to put one particular person to great inconvenience, well naturally we can advance a day and say: &ldquo;All right; it does not make a great lot of difference; we will relax the restrictions to-day instead of to-morrow.&rdquo;  I am quite sure that if we did the other thing and withdrew the restrictions two days later, we would have Deputies getting up and saying: &ldquo;Why did you put the man to the inconvenience of bringing back his horse when you intended to relax the restrictions a few days afterwards?&rdquo; There might be some ground for criticism if we had done that.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I admit that, but the matter was explained.  It was explained to the Deputy by letter.  When it is explained, I think any reasonable person will say that there was not very much in it one way or another.  Deputy McGovern made the point that I was responsible for any regulations or penalties that were made and not the veterinary staff.  It is true that I have to take responsibility for any regulations that were made, and I did.  I do not know what I may have said that drew that remark from Deputy McGovern.  I may have said, and I think I probably did say it here on more than one occasion, that anything the veterinary staff asked me to do in the way of making restrictions, I did it. I have never at any time advised or reasoned with the veterinary staff to relax restrictions one day sooner than they were inclined to do it themselves. In fact, any action that I did take was the other way&mdash;to suggest at times that perhaps we should be a bit more cautious before withdrawing restrictions than they were inclined to be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Reilly advocated a more general dissemination of knowledge of diseases of all kinds occurring in <Col N="555" /> animals as well as foot-and-mouth.  I quite agree with that.  As far as we can, we are trying to do that.  We have, I think, always tried to do that by the use of the radio, advertisements, and in every other way.  I think I mentioned in the Dáil on a few occasions that some years ago there was a special veterinary officer who did practically nothing else except to go around and give lectures to groups of farmers on diseases that were prevalent amongst animals and that were causing much worry to farmers.  We intend to revive that system in the near future.  We intend to make a lecturer of that kind available again.  His duty will be to go to country areas and lecture in the local halls to farmers on the various diseases arising amongst animals. Deputy MacEoin gave us a lecture on public morality which, I suppose, we can afford to laugh at.  There is no necessity to refer further to it.  Deputy Maguire following up that speech rightly said, I think, that if the discussion was going to develop into that sort of a debate, with a person on the other side of the House lecturing us on morality, we should first of all put our own house in order before we could expect the farmers to do their duty, and added that a debate of that kind was not going to do much good, because naturally it was going to develop into a political debate.  So far as publicity in connection with the foot-and-mouth outbreak is concerned, we made statements in every available way and through every available medium.  We used the radio quite a lot.  Night after night, I think, there was a long statement over the radio. The newspapers were used a great deal and, in some areas, we sent circulars to the parish priests, who were very helpful in speaking to the congregations on Sundays and appealing to them to co-operate, so far as possible, with the officers of the Department.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fagan and Deputy Belton spoke of the unnecessary loss sustained by farmers who sold cattle as beef cattle during the foot-and-mouth period.  There was a good deal of criticism in the beginning, but it gradually died away&mdash;it is, evidently, <Col N="556" /> being revived now&mdash;of the buyers appointed to supply Dublin City with beef.

      <P>For the first few weeks, they were working in the ordinary way as buyers, with their own money, selling and making a profit.  Their dealings during those weeks were audited and the amount of profit for that particular phase of their activities was shown in the balance sheet.  From that time until the Dublin market opened, they were working on salary.  On the day the Dublin market opened I intimated that I did not require their services further and I told the butchers of Dublin that they could go to the Dublin market and buy cattle as they had done in the past, but that they would have to get these cattle slaughtered in the abattoir.  The butchers themselves met and agreed to keep these buyers on as their agents.</P>

They said that the only way they could possibly carry on was to have one buying agency and they kept on the former buyers.</P>

What monopoly was there more than there is now or ever was, in a way?  Any man in this country was free to go in to the Dublin market and buy for export.  There was no monopoly.  The cattle were consigned to the salesmasters. The salesmasters sold these cattle and anybody could go in, buy them and export them.  There could not be a monopoly when you had exporters competing against one another.</P>

      <P>Sellers of cattle down the country had the option and I do not think anybody exercised it.  There was <Col N="562" /> the option to consign the cattle to Dublin and to be paid on the deadweight basis but they preferred to sell by hand.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Pigs and Bacon Board was operating pigs were weighed under the supervision of a semi-Government Department.  I never heard of the offer to which the Minister refers in respect of cattle.  It would be a different proposition if men were asked to send cattle to the big five.  What should have been done was that farmers should have been told that if they wished they could send cattle to Dublin, and if accepted, they would be paid on the basis of a Government weigh docket.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy Fagan pointed out, as time went on we tried to provide all these facilities.  Before I come to speak about the compensation in some of the later cases, I am having a point that Deputy Hughes raised examined.  I do not know if there is anything in the point that in earlier cases the compensation was higher, because the cattle were, I suppose, dearer, and that these men when restocking had a falling market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>And a restricted market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>And when the compensation was lower the others would have to restock in a rising market.  I am having that point examined.  Deputy Belton raised a few specific points.  I do not think there is much in them. One case concerned cattle at Gavin Low's.  The Deputy stated that I said here that these cattle had been slaughtered when in fact they were not. The Deputy may be right, because at that time I was getting reports from all parts, and I have a recollection of a report that these cattle had all been cleaned out on a certain date, but that that did not take place for some days afterwards.  When they were in contact with others we could not send them down the country and we could not keep them in the yard.  They were not affected in any way.  The only thing was to have them slaughtered and used as canning meat.  They were store cattle.  Possibly I made a mistake in <Col N="563" /> saying that the cattle were slaughtered that day.  If I did say that it made no difference.</P>

      <P>I want to go back to 1934 and 1935 and to suggest to the Deputy that he should withdraw a statement he made then.  At that time he said we had so few cattle after all the slaughter, that there would not be sufficient manure to carry on tillage. The argument cannot work both ways. After all if we have fewer cattle we must have more meadows and more manure.  It appears now, according to the Deputy, whether we have too few or too many cattle, we cannot have manure.</P>

      <P>Coming to the point as to whether a committee should be set up, I do not think it should.  I do not <Col N="564" /> see what a committee could do.  If a committee is going to investigate some of the charges made in this debate it is only going to do a great deal of harm.  I suppose it would not do me very much harm or Deputy Belton or Deputy Hughes but it would do very great harm if we brought the officials of the Department into it.  I do not want to bring them in.  At least, leave them out.  Do not let us bring them into these political matters.  I do not wish to have officials brought in to answer charges as to whether I lost a night's sleep or not&mdash;that was one of the charges&mdash;in connection with the foot-and-mouth disease.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It must blow out some time.  Or whether Deputy MacEoin is right or not, that we lack public morality on this side of the House. However, I do not see that we will gain much by a public inquiry at this stage, as it would mean inquiring into a lot of irrelevant matters.  I think there is a better way to deal with it. I have said that I intend to put before the Dáil proposals for amending the Diseases of Animals Act.  If a committee were to sit and make recommendations, the recommendations would mean in the end, I presume, amendments of the Diseases of Animals Act.  That is what would be done in the end.  The best thing to do would be that the officials in my Department who have had experience of this outbreak and saw the flaws in the Act-it must be remembered that we had to <Col N="565" /> change the Act by Emergency Powers Order: we may not have emergency powers the next time an outbreak occurs&mdash;should put before me the proposals they think necessary and I would eventually bring them before the Dáil.  It is better that the proposals should come from the Department first and then Deputies can do whatever they think best about them.</P>
      <P>Deputies may say to me in reply that there is no opportunity there for proper investigation.  We can get over that by having a special committee or a select committee, as the case may be, if that is found necessary when the time comes.  I would be quite agreeable to that, and in that way, when I put what I believe to be proper proposals before the Dáil on a Second Reading debate, Deputies can come along to a committee of that kind and investigate the matter as far as they wish.  I believe the matter would be best dealt with in that way.</P>

      <P>I am afraid not.  There are still about 20 veterinary surgeons engaged in clearing up the foot-and-mouth disease and at the same time we are back to full export so that we have a big staff on export work.  We have to find extra staff for this foot-and-mouth disease until it is cleared up and we would not have the time to deal with the drafting of Bill until the position improves.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Curran</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister say if any special steps were taken in connection with the disease in Carlow when it finished, such as the employment of the military or something like that?  Would he say if any extra care or attention was shown in Carlow which would mean the stamping out of the disease when the outbreak finished there?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That was a point that Deputy Curran raised.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardCurran" hpid="Mr. Curran Mr. Curran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Curran</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No extra steps were taken, but it was felt&mdash;and Deputies here expressed it&mdash;that if we could get it out of the County Kilkenny&mdash;out of the creamery areas&mdash;there would be a chance of clearing it up.  There is no doubt that the two big dangers were places like the City of Dublin, where yards were communicating with one another, and the creamery areas, the worst places where the disease could take a hold.  We felt that if we could get it out of the creamery areas in County Kilkenny, then, even if it did go to Carlow, we could get around it there and stop it.</P>
      <P>Generally speaking, Deputies will admit that it is a much more difficult matter to deal with the foot-and-mouth disease in this country than in England or Scotland, as in this country we have a lot of small farmers, and also the farmers here co-operate with one another; they are good neighbours and go back and forward to one another getting the loan of things.  The same thing does not hold in England or Scotland and there is not the same amount of traffic between farm and farm.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister give the House any light on the way the disease spread after being eradicated in Dublin and district?  Was the Department able to trace the causes of the spread down south?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Department has suspicions in some cases and does not know in other cases.  For instance, we do not know at all about Limerick, we do not know at all how it came to Laoighise in the beginning; we have suspicions about how it spread in Clare and how it went to Callan in the beginning.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not consider that the committee he is thinking of should be set up before the <Col N="567" /> time he suggests?  They could have a rough draft of the proposals he intends to embody in a Bill and they could examine those proposals and give their opinions to the technical staff of the Department of Agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Deputy to remember what I have just said&mdash;that we really could not spare the veterinary staff to go before a committee at present, until this is absolutely finished off.  We are doing a full export trade, and all the ports are manned by veterinary surgeons and extra men are necessary for clearing off the disease.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two dangers that occur to me&mdash;two things we must remember always.  As Deputies know, there were concealed cases, and there may have been a concealed case two or three weeks after the last outbreak. In that case, we need to be careful. The second thing is that, although it <Col N="568" /> is almost completely free as far as land goes and houses are disinfected, the danger remains, I think, in rubbish heaps and especially in waste meat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one comparison we can make on this matter of the Minister's objection.  I do not know if he is aware of the fact that the rule in England is that a man can restock when his farm is free.  In fact, the farm can be restocked in a month from the date of final disinfection, or in six weeks from the date of confirmation, whichever is the shorter period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Six weeks is the period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>It has proved a success in England.  The last outbreak here was on the 22nd September and this is the 13th November.  A county that has suffered more than any other is the County Carlow.  They are still restricted and have been denied any market for nearly 12 months.  I do not think there is any necessity for that at the present time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>

      <P>On sub-head O (6), Sir. Yesterday the Minister mentioned the price allowance for seed wheat as being from 12/6 to 15/-.  How does he justify an allowance of from 12/6 to 15/- a barrel of wheat?  I suggest that 10/- should be ample to cover the storage and cleaning of wheat, particularly as he mentions that he is guaranteeing a price of 50/-.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The maximum price is 62/6, and it is presumed there that the seed merchants will buy that wheat for about 45/-, as spring variety wheat, and there will be a certain amount of cleaning and so on to be done.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I do not think so. This, however, provides for seed merchants who do a first-class business in a first-class manner, that is, a merchant who takes in the wheat, cleans it, distributes it, and so on, and in that way there is a certain amount of loss.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, the Minister must understand that anything screened out is sent to the mill to be milled afterwards.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not suggest that the price should be so narrowed down or curtailed as to have the effect that the seed might be improperly handled.  I agree that a reasonable margin, should be left there, but I think that 10/- should be ample to cover all the operations necessary to deal with seed grown and stored properly, and, although the Minister suggests that the amount he mentions is a maximum amount, I am afraid that it will be fully availed of, and that the farmers will be compelled to pay the maximum amount.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it may be availed of by the really big seed merchants, but the ordinary trader down the country would sell at less than the maximum price.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, after all, if it is too high, there is no reason why there should not be a certain amount of competition, and if any seed merchant sees a big profit in it, he will probably sell at a few shillings less in order to get trade or business.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>In connection with the Flax Act, I think there is a very important matter that has arisen which ought to be dealt with.  In the old days, before the flax industry in this country dwindled away as it had before this war emergency arose, the practice was that the farmer brought his flax to the mill and had it scutched there, and when he got it back from the mill he got, in addition to the flax, the proper quantity of tow, and when he went into the market he would find buyers for flax and also buyers for the tow.  He would have the advantage of cashing both parts of the crop with the appropriate buyers.  For some years <Col N="574" /> before the war, for a reason that I do not fully understand, the market for tow dwindled away, and the farmers found, if they brought tow to the market, that there was nobody there to buy it.  In that situation a great many farmers simply stopped taking tow from the miller, and left it on the miller's hands, because it was valueless as far as they were concerned, the market for it having apparently disappeared. Certainly the buyers had stopped coming to the local markets, and the small farmers had no means of sending it to the centre of consumption.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The question is whether £700 should be given to guarantee a co-operative society for the importation of flax seed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, and I want to argue that if you are going to subsidise the importation of flax seed you ought to see that the flax seed is to be used to the best advantage, and the way to get the best advantage is to secure that the person who sows the flax will get the full return.  Owing to a practice which has grown up in the country, the tow which will be produced from this flax seed for which we are providing £700 will be withheld from the farmers who sow this flax seed and who pull the flax that grows out of this flax.  I want to ensure that the Minister will say to this co-operative society: &ldquo;When this flax seed has been imported, and this flax seed has been grown, and the crop grown from this flax seed has been pulled, and those who sowed this flax seed and pulled the crop grown from this flax seed bring it to the scutch mill provided by you for the scutching of the flax grown from this flax seed, they will get back the tow and scutched flax.&rdquo;  I want the Minister to say: &ldquo;I will guarantee the farmer who sows this flax not only a market for the scutched flax&rdquo;&mdash;he has done that by making an agreement with the British Government for the purchase of flax at a given price&mdash;&ldquo;but I will arrange that there will be a market for tow on the same basis.&rdquo;  I advocate that because I know that since the beginning of the war the market for tow has recovered.  I want the Minister to say to the farmers that he will facilitate them in the same way in regard to tow as in the matter of the flax, so that the farmer can recover the tow from the scutch miller, sell it as he used to sell it, and get the additional cash return which he ought to get.  The system which grew up when tow was worthless has resulted in the flax miller not only getting paid for <Col N="576" /> doing his job of scutching the flax, but he can also cash the by-product of tow, which in my submission belongs to the farmer and not to the scutch miller.</P>
      <P>The second point I want to make in regard to this scheme of guaranteeing the co-operative society on the importation of flax seed for the growth of flax is that, while the Minister may do that with a clear conscience seeing that he has secured a guaranteed market for flax, he cannot urge the co-operative society to encourage their members to grow flax unless he is satisfied that the farmers will get a fair price for the flax, and that that price will leave to the farmer who grew the flax a fair margin of profit.  He cannot satisfy himself in that regard unless he satisfies himself that the charges for scutching are fair and just.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy must realise that the Chair has been very patient.  On a Supplementary Estimate not all matters may be raised as on a main Estimate.  The practice since the Dáil was founded has been that only the actual item and the actual purpose for which money is required may be discussed.  What price the farmer is to get, whether he should get both tow and flax do not arise now. If the line which the Deputy is following were permitted other Deputies might wish to discuss manures for flax, the pulling of flax, the cost or the price, and all matters which are irrelevant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>All I put to the Minister is that if we are to vote £700 for the importation of flax seed by a co-operative society, to guarantee them against loss and the payment of commission, that is part of a scheme for the promotion of flax growing in that particular area.  It does not seem to me to be commonsense to waste that £700 on a subsidy unless we take ancillary measures to ensure the success of the scheme.  There are two dangers to the success of flax growing, especially in the part of the country which this sub-head of this Estimate is designed to help, and I should be glad if the Minister would give us an assurance that <Col N="577" /> the matter of tow and scutching costs will be looked into, and substantial justice done to those persons for whose benefit this Supplementary Estimate has been introduced.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know what the remote history of this question is, but I believe that for some years past the general practice has been to leave the tow with the scutch millers.  Whether or not it would be very easy to change that now I do not know.  The whole question of tow is being considered by another Department as well as mine, with a view to seeing if it can be used in this country.  If we get a good use for it, the question as to how the tow should be marketed would naturally arise.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I put it to the Minister that it is not necessary to alter the practice of leaving the handling of the tow to the miller if the Minister will fix the price and say: &ldquo;It is worth so much&rdquo;?  The scutching costs would then be reduced by the value of the tow which the miller retains.</P>

I take it that the purpose of this expenditure <Col N="578" /> is to regulate and facilitate the equitable distribution of such oats and barley as are available?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>A situation obtains at present in which oats are being purchased by the licensed buyers appointed by the Minister.  So far as I know, any reputable person with facilities can get himself appointed a licensed oats buyer, but the Minister will not permit the transfer of those oats from the licensed oats buyer to the oatmeal miller, with the result that in a country where, by God's providence, we have an abundant crop of oats, you cannot get a stone of oatmeal from one end of the land to the other.  This situation has matured at a time when there is an acute shortage of flour, and anyone with a knowledge of rural Ireland will confirm me when I say that if you have, for a period, a shortage of flour, the attendant inconvenience can be greatly mitigated if you have a supplementary quantity of oatmeal to distribute, but if you have coincidentally a shortage of oatmeal and flour, a very acute problem has to be faced and it is a problem which bears most heavily on the poor of the community.  For the last month or so, I have seen women going into a shop in the country saying that they are mothers of seven and eight children, that they have neither flour nor oatmeal in the house and imploring the shopkeeper to give them something to keep the pot boiling, impressing on the merchant that although they may have potatoes, you cannot feed young children on potatoes and milk alone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understood from an answer the Minister gave me last week that there was some difficulty in his mind about allowing an oatmeal miller in one part of the country to start milling until the Minister was satisfied that every miller in the country had sufficient oats to go into production.  I could understand a delay of a few days or a week but, if it has failed the Minister so far to secure an even distribution of oats all over the country, I urge on him that the time is past for considering the convenience of individual millers.  The requirements of the people are so urgent that steps should be taken to <Col N="579" /> release oats in the shape of oatmeal, for human consumption at least.  I give the Minister the name of one firm I know which has oats in its granary purchased, dried and ready for milling. That is the firm of Mr. George MacFarlane, of Carrigans, in the County Donegal.  I mentioned this matter to the Minister a week ago and I understood then that a licence had been issued to go ahead.  I was informed yesterday, however, that the firm still has got no licence to convert oats into oatmeal.</P>
    <P>Now we come to the question of the barley distribution.  The Minister says that he does not foresee that any barley meal will be made available because barley will have to be held in case it may be wanted for human consumption as an admixture in flour at the latter stage of the year.  Has the Minister adverted to this thought: that the present price which he has directed the committee to pay for barley, if no barley meal can be obtained on the market, may mean that he will get no barley at all?  If barley is not going to be issued as a compound meal at 15/6 per cwt. as was anticipated when prices were fixed for oats and barley, the people will have no meal to buy from the shops at all except a mixture of pollard and such other constituents, which is at present being sold at prices ranging from 20/- to 23/- per cwt.  What reasonable farmer would use meal consisting of 60 per cent. pollard costing 22/6 per cwt. in preference to his barley, for which, if he were to sell it to the Minister's committee to be held for human food, he would only get 28/- a barrel? I remember the last day before the adjournment several of us on this side of the House pointed out to the Minister that you must face facts and I am now pointing out one fact that the Minister must face.  Remember that the price for barley and oats is a fixed price while the price for wheat is a minimum price.  A fixed price, for barley particularly, will not bring the barley out to the committee unless feeding stuffs are available to the farmer and unless it is made advantageous to the farmer to buy other <Col N="580" /> feeding stuffs.  I see no sane farmer coming to that conclusion in the present circumstances.  I think that is a problem that the Minister must face and face at once if he does not want to create a situation of very grave embarrassment for the farmers of the country at a later date.</P>
    <P>There is a last matter to which I wish to refer.  I take it that all this business about the distribution of barley and oats is covered under this sub-head?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a question of distribution. The committee assembles all the barley and oats and distributes it.  I think it is the only channel for trading in barley and oats, except as between farmer and farmer.  My impression is that there is a great deal of confusion in the public mind in rural Ireland at the present time as to what are the farmers' rights as between one another.  Everyone knows that there is a fixed price for oats and barley if you sell them to a merchant or if the merchant wants to resell to a retail customer. What is the situation when oats and barley are sold as between farmer and farmer?  May they charge any price they can get?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>No, Sir, but this is a matter which does arise I think.  Barley is going to be held off the market as a reserve for flour to the end of the year. I mean the Government are seeking to buy barley and lay it on one side lest it should be required later on for the composite flour which may become necessary next spring and summer.  If that has to be, it has to be, but it is going to create a very awkward situation for pig feeders in this country, inasmuch as there is no Indian corn to be had.</P>
      <P>Has the Government taken cognisance of the fact that, as from an early date, American ships will be free to call at European ports and will they at once open negotiations with American sources of supply and determine whether adequate supplies of wheat can be got over the year, thus enabling the Government to release the barley at an earlier date than they otherwise might, in order to save the pig and fowl industries of the country? It would be a tragedy if we destroyed either pig-rearing or fowl-raising owing to the shortage of barley meal and then discovered in spring that we were able after all to get sufficient wheat and that we need not have kept the barley in reserve.  That is a matter to which, I suggest to the Minister, the earliest possible attention should be given and courageous action taken in regard to it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardCurran" hpid="Mr. Curran Mr. Curran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Curran</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one point I want to put to the Minister.  I <Col N="582" /> happened to call recently on a merchant who buys oats and he told me that, although his customers were looking for oatmeal owing to the shortage of flour, he was not allowed to have the oats milled for human consumption. I had read the Minister's reply to Deputy Dillon a fortnight ago and I told this man that he was wrong, that the Minister for Agriculture said that oats was released.  The man told me that was not so, that only the day before two inspectors told him that he could not send oats to get it milled into oatmeal.  He told me further that, when the farmer from whom he purchased the oats and who lived a good way out, came to town, he could not sell that farmer a feed for his horse.  Something should be done about releasing oats to be milled into oatmeal for human consumption.  I think it would be reasonable that that should be done, whatever may be said about the releasing of barley or anything else.  I put that to the Minister, as this case came under my notice within the last few days.</P>

      <P>What I said to Deputy Dillon on the last occasion is the position.  Oats was released to oatmeal millers who were milling oats for human consumption, according to a list that was supplied to us by the Department of Supplies.  Of course, I do not know whether the person mentioned by Deputy Curran was on that list or not.</P>

      <P>It is only released to those who are recognised as oatmeal millers.  In addition to that, I hope in the very near future, in fact it may be within the next few days, that oats will be released also to grist millers for animal feeding.  That may make some difference in the situation and may relieve some of the difficulties that Deputy Dillon mentioned.  Barley cannot be released.</P>

      <P>They are different.  With regard to barley, I am afraid that we cannot yet, at any rate, release any barley for animal feeding, because there is the possibility that we may not get sufficient wheat for human consumption.  We are, of course, keeping in mind what Deputy Dillon mentioned, namely, getting as much imported wheat as we can to make up the deficiency.  If we see that we are safe between the home-grown and imported wheat, we can release barley also, but I am afraid we will not know that for another month or so, and we will hardly be able to release it before then.  As to the question of one farmer buying from another farmer, one farmer can buy oats from another farmer, subject to the fixed price.  He is not, however, entitled, under the order, to buy barley from another farmer for feeding.</P>

      <P>As to sub-head O (14), in connection with the land taken from tillage defaulters, it would appear that the expenditure was £2,276 and the Appropriations-in-Aid from the sale of crops £1,900.  I expect some Deputies will be surprised to hear that there was a loss of £300 but, personally, I am not at all surprised that there would be a loss when anybody tackles the business of farming, particularly a Government Department.  What I am interested in is this.  The Minister gave us no idea as to how the crops were disposed of.  I know of one or two cases where they were sold as growing crops.  I should like to know if in any case they carried the experiment to its logical conclusion until the crops were threshed and if the House could have a full explanation of the profits and losses.  The Department had an admirable opportunity, when they took over these lands, of giving a headline to the community as to the proper methods of cultivating wheat, oats, etc., and eventually disposing of these crops. They could have given a headline to the country as to the expense and trouble of growing crops and the eventual profit.  I should have liked the Department, when they got this opportunity, to proceed as an ordinary farmer would until the crops were disposed of and let the House and the country know what profit could be made out of a crop of wheat, oats or barley.  But it appears that this venture of taking over lands which farmers would not till has resulted in a loss of £300.  I am not surprised at that, because I am sure that if I took over these lands I, also, would lose £300.  If this is the glorious proposition for farmers that it is supposed to be, there was a grand chance for the Government to make a thorough experiment and to prove to the House and the country generally that there was a golden opportunity for any man who would plough up land and put in the golden grain.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to see Deputy Bennett's proposal pursued to a proper conclusion, namely, that instead <Col N="585" /> of waiting until March or April to find out whether those gentlemen are going to till their lands, the lands should be taken over in November.  I saw the Department taking over land in the month of May last year and ploughing it and expecting to get a crop of cereals.  I am surprised that the loss was so small.  I suggest to the Minister that he should see now whether the people are going to till their land and, if not, he should take it over now.  If he does take it over, he should hold it for the duration of the war and use it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCurran" hpid="Mr. Curran Mr. Curran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Curran</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will recollect that I asked him a Parliamentary Question in connection with the taking over of land in County Tipperary.  I have had letters to the effect that in one case the Department took over more land than they were entitled to take under the Act; that they took 50 per cent. of the arable land.  I am not inclined to believe that the Minister would authorise the taking over of anything exceeding the statutory amount in the case of any farmer.  I put that point to the Minister in reference to this particular individual and I would like the Minister to say if his Department has caused more than the statutory amount required by the Act to be ploughed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnLymbrickEsmonde" hpid="Mr. Esmonde Mr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder could the Minister give particulars of the number of holdings and the number of acres taken over and worked under these orders?  Deputy Bennett has referred to the loss.  The actual loss as shown on the working of these lands is £354.  That does not represent the real loss because I take it these lands were held rent, rate and tax free.  Am I right in that?  If that is so, the real loss would be very much more than that sum of £354.  I think it would be worth while to investigate how that works out with regard to the number of holdings and also with regard to the number of acres, to see whether it is worth while pursuing, at expense to the taxpayer, this course of procedure. I notice one item which seems very hard to reconcile with the tillage operations on land&mdash;the sum of £322 for travelling expenses.  That is altogether <Col N="586" /> apart from the item of £100 for miscellaneous expenses.  Between miscellaneous expenses and travelling expenses over one-fifth of the total Estimate is used up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to compulsory tillage, I am sure all Deputies are agreed that once a law is made it should be observed by everybody. Nevertheless, it has to be borne in mind that there are special circumstances obtaining in certain places which make compliance with the law peculiarly difficult for certain individuals. The plain fact is that those individuals must get over their difficulties in a time like this and even though they find the requirements of the law very arduous they have got to accept the rough with the smooth the same as everybody else has to do in these times. That is from the individual citizen's point of view.  But from the other point of view there is this to be said&mdash; that a bureaucracy may sometimes err on the side of tactlessness and, where a little patience and forbearance would secure conformity with the law, an abruptness is employed amounting almost to an ultimatum which gets men's backs up and forces them into follies that they would never have contemplated if they were approached in the right way.  All of us have our peculiarities and I myself have knowledge of cases where, on the merits, I think the men ought to have carried out the terms of the order, and if they were reasonable, level-headed men they would have done so, but being somewhat temperamental they got their horns locked with the Department and it ended by the Department bursting in on their lands, ploughing their fields and creating boundless ill-will and bad blood that I feel a more tactful and patient approach would have avoided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My experience of the officers administering this extremely difficult order has been, so far as I have come in contact with them, uniformly favourable. I recognise the difficulties with which they were confronted and my experience has been that those with whom I have had dealings felt how delicate this whole business was, how distasteful <Col N="587" /> it was to burst into any other man's holding and more or less expropriate him.  But, at the same time, I would press upon the Minister the necessity of urging that this order be enforced with firmness, yet with tact and forbearance, and a full realisation of the fact that it is a difficult order to enforce and that it can, in certain cases, give very bitter offence, more especially when it is not clear to the mind of the person against whom the proceedings are instituted that he is in the wrong.  I remember a case of a man who was required to till a certain amount of land.  He did till the land and he sowed oats in it, and instead of mowing the oats, he grazed them: he used them as a fodder crop, instead of allowing them to come to maturity.  I think that fellow was partially actuated by mischievousness&mdash;partially &mdash;but I think the proper course would have been in that case to say to this man: &ldquo;We do not want to humiliate you before all your neighbours and you have complied with what was, possibly, your conception of the law in the matter for this year.  We warn you that that will not serve in the future. When you are required to till land and plant a crop in it the implication of the order is that you plant a crop designed to come to maturity and then to reap it and make it available for consumption by the community in the form of the crop and not as a fodder.&rdquo; What actually happened was, I think, that they went in and ploughed the land to make up the area which he had put under this fodder crop of oats. That is the kind of thing I have in mind.  I believe that whole business might have been more satisfactorily settled by cautioning that man that in future years the interpretation he put upon the Act would not be accepted by the Department and I think the whole difficulty could have been overcome.</P>
    <P>Subject to that word of warning I feel&mdash;and I am sure all Deputies will agree with me&mdash;that, whether we like this kind of legislation or whether we do not, once it is made by the proper authority, under authority delegated by this House, it is the duty of every citizen of the State to comply with it. <Col N="588" /> If we do not like it, here is the place to alter it, and until it is altered then the rules of the law should run.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to make one suggestion to the Minister on this subject.  In cases where an individual has no tillage equipment and where hired plant is not available in certain areas in the country, his Department should offer to supply hired plant. Where the owner of land pleads inability to hire the necessary machinery and plant to do the work, sometimes the Minister's Department may be and ought to be in a position to provide the hired plant.  Before compulsorily entering on the land, I suggest that the Minister's officers and inspectors should at least make the offer to provide hired plant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>From my experience I am rather inclined to complain that the Department are not enforcing the order strongly enough.  I know of land that could produce wheat or barley that has not been touched upon at all. I am satisfied that it is the men with the small holdings, the middle-class farmers, who are supplying any large quantity of wheat for this country.  I think the Minister should be very firm in seeing that the order of the Government is carried out in regard to the tillage of land.  I have known places that carried 46 cows that have not produced two acres of wheat.  I am quite satisfied that they will try to evade doing it this year also.  I have travelled a good deal about the country in the last year and have noticed places where barley and wheat should be growing where these crops have not been sown.  I am afraid there is no good in Deputy Dillon suggesting that the Department should be more tactful.  I agree with being tactful at times, but I do not think this is a question requiring tactfulness but rather that the Department should exercise firm control, so as to provide food for the nation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is not much in the point about whether we lost money on this or not.  We did not actually lose because the travelling expenses do not refer exactly to these lands which were <Col N="589" /> taken over directly by the Department and tilled by the Department.  They are connected to a great extent with the lands that were let by conacre. Perhaps I might explain the various steps.  We first make an order.  Every farmer this year will be expected to till 25 per cent. of his arable land. Where the inspector has any suspicion that this order is not being complied with, he calls to the particular farmer, and I think Deputy Dillon and other Deputies may rest assured that he does use a great deal of patience and forbearance, because every case of entering on land must come before me personally and my signature is necessary before the entry is made, so that I have good evidence of the visits paid by the inspector, and perhaps the letters written by him, on the file that comes up in each individual case.  He calls and requests the man to carry out the order, and in most cases that is sufficient.  The order is complied with, but he may call back again just to make sure.  If, however, he comes to the conclusion that the order is not going to be complied with, he serves a notice on the farmer that the Minister will enter on the land and have direct operations carried out.  Probably in three cases out of four, when that notice is served, the farmer tills.  We give him a little time before we enter, and, if he does not till, after some little time, the entry takes place and an attempt is made to let the land by conacre.  The greater number of the cases of entry are let by conacre, and it was only in districts where there was, if you like, no tradition of tillage and where conacre tenants could not be got on that account, that direct tillage by the Department had to be done.  I think there were only something like 400 acres altogether involved.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, about that acreage was tilled by direct operations last year.  Deputy Curran said that he had been told that in some of these entry cases, we actually tilled more than the percentage.  We did.  As a matter of fact, when the Minister enters, he may <Col N="590" /> till 100 per cent., if he likes, under the order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCurran" hpid="Mr. Curran Mr. Curran">

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want the Deputy to remember that it may be very inconvenient to till the exact amount.  We may have to go into a couple of big fields and till the whole lot, and in that way the percentage may be exceeded. We cannot possibly stick to the percentage, and it is much better that we should have latitude, if we enter at all, to till whatever acreage we think most convenient.  These direct tillage lots were all sold, that is, the growing corn was sold in all cases.  The amount realised was not very good.  It was barely sufficient to cover the tillage operations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, we were late in going in, at the end of April or the beginning of May.  We had no manures, but most farmers were in that position last year.  The seed was got at the end of the season and was not the best, and the tillage operations were carried out hurriedly and not in the best way.  In view of the fact that they were areas where it was not possible to get conacre tenants to come along, they were areas where there would not be great competition for corn on foot, and the crop did not get a very good price.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">

We could not do any better than the people themselves.  There is no equipment to spare in practically any part of the country at the moment, and, if there is a tractor in a particular area, the person concerned is just as likely to get it as we are.

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Go ndeontar suim breise ná raghaidh thar £683,908, chun íoctha an mhuirir a thiocfaidh chun bheith iníoctha i rith na bliana dar críoch an 31adh Márta, 1942, chun Tuarastail agus Costaisí Oifig an Aire Soláthairtí, maraon le conganta áirithe airgid d'íoc.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That a supplementary sum, not exceeding £683,908, be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending 31st March, 1942, for the <Col N="595" /> Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for Supplies, including payment of certain subsidies.</P>
    <P>Deputies will see from the Estimate that the additional sum is required for two purposes.  A sum of £42,168 is required to defray the cost of additional staff recruited by the Department of Supplies and other sums in respect of telegrams, telephones, advertising and publicity are needed in excess of the amount voted for the year in consequence of the expansion of the Department's activities.  The main sum asked for is £550,000, for the purpose of subsidising the prices of flour and wheaten meal and an additional sum of £80,000 for the purpose of subsidising the price of bread.  To deal first with the amount required, over and above the Estimate, in respect of salaries, wages and allowances, it is, I think, unnecessary to inform the Dáil that there has been a considerable expansion in the activities of the Department since the original Estimate was framed.  Because of that expansion in its activities, substantial increases in staff were necessary.  At this time last year, only one commodity was rationed &mdash;petrol.  Since then, rationing, or control of distribution in one form or another, has been found necessary in respect of a number of other commodities&mdash;kerosene, mineral oils, coal, tea and sugar as well as a number of industrial materials, such as timber, cotton and woollen goods.  At this time last year, the staff serving in the Department numbered 157.  It has now reached 425.  The provision made under sub-head A of the Estimate for the Department of Supplies in the past did not, at any time, reflect the whole cost of the staff serving in that Department because, in accordance with the practice of the Civil Service, the salaries of officers who were on loan from other Departments were paid by the Departments from which they came.  It was only where officers were promoted that any provision had to be made in the Estimate for the Department of Supplies for any part of their remuneration.  While the staff serving on loan has increased, the main increase in staff has resulted from the <Col N="596" /> recruitment of officers from the usual Civil Service examinations for direct appointment to the Department of Supplies.  These direct appointments are responsible for a substantial part of the increased provision which has had to be made under sub-head A.  It has been found necessary for the staff of the Department to work overtime considerably in excess of the amount originally estimated, and provision has been made under sub-head A for the additional cost involved.  It is clear that the staff of the Department will have to be considerably augmented to deal with the further measures of control of the distribution of commodities in short supply and provision has been made for the substantial increase in the amount of clerical assistance which will be required before the end of the financial year.</P>
    <P>Because of the increased activity of the Department, the expenditure under sub-head D has also expanded. As Deputies will note, there has been a very considerable expansion, relatively speaking, in the estimated amount required for advertising and publicity.  To a much greater extent than was originally considered necessary, we have resorted to the use of display advertisements in the newspapers in order to bring to the attention of the public the regulations in force concerning the distribution of commodities, the fixation of prices and other matters of that nature.  These display advertisements, which are, I think, necessary to secure the requisite publicity for the matters concerned, cost much more than the usual formal type of advertisement previously used for the purpose of making Government announcements in the Press.</P>
    <P>As I have said, the main sum asked for is that in respect of the proposed subsidy to the prices of flour and bread.  As has been obvious for some considerable time past, owing to the great increase in the cost of importing wheat from abroad and the decision to increase the guaranteed minimum price for native wheat from 35/- to 40/- per barrel, a substantial increase in the price of flour and, consequently, of bread, could not be avoided during the present cereal year.  For <Col N="597" /> some time past&mdash;since the extraction of flour from wheat was increased to 95 per cent.&mdash;imported wheat has been allocated to flour millers by Grain Importers, Limited, at a price of 65/6 per quarter.  That price, it is true, contained an element which enabled Grain Importers, Limited, to accumulate some surplus funds.  A large part of the wheat allocated this year by Grain Importers was purchased before the war at pre-war prices.  From the point of view of the miller, the cost was 65/6 and it was, of course, that cost which had to be taken into account in determining the price at which the miller could sell flour.  It is now clear that a considerable part of the 80,000 tons of wheat, which it is considered it will be necessary to import this year, will not be brought in at a price much less, if less, than 120/- per quarter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The important point I want Deputies to note is that the allocation price of imported wheat this year may be practically double what it was last year.  Similarly, the price of native wheat has increased, and the increase in the price of native wheat will operate to increase the price of millers' grist and, consequently, the price of flour to a substantial extent.  These increases in the price of wheat mean that the subsidy which will be required to enable the price of flour to be maintained unchanged during the whole of the cereal year will be about £1,900,000. As I informed the Dáil some time ago, we estimate that we shall get for milling purposes 290,000 tons of Irish wheat.  If circumstances should arise which would prevent our getting that quantity of Irish wheat, then the various calculations we have made as to the cost of the subsidy will be upset. These calculations are based on the assumption that we shall have 290,000 tons of native wheat, to be supplemented by about 80,000 tons of imported wheat.  The average cost of <Col N="598" /> native wheat, dried and fit for milling, during the last cereal year, was 40/9 per barrel.  The price on the farm was 35/-.  Various additional charges had to be allowed for in respect of sacks, drying costs, agents' commission, and 10 per cent. loss on drying, which charges increased the cost of the wheat to the miller from the 35/- paid to the farmer to 40/9.  The corresponding figure this year will be 46/9&mdash;an increase of 6/-. The average price paid to the farmer will be 40/6.  Allowances in respect of sacks, agents' commission and drying costs will remain unchanged, but the 10 per cent. loss on drying will involve a higher figure because of the higher price.  Consequently, although the guaranteed price to farmers was increased by 5/-, the actual cost of dried wheat to the millers will be increased by 6/-.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That would involve a calculation into which I do not want to enter now.  Irish wheat, as the Deputy <Col N="599" /> knows, has a moisture content higher than that required by the miller, and, consequently, the cost of drying it must be added to the price of the wheat, but imported wheat contains an insufficiency of moisture.  Consequently, there is a gain to the miller because he adds moisture to the wheat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>The figure of 46/9 represents the cost in the miller's store.  The figure of 120/- represents the cost at an Irish port.  That wheat has to be transported to the miller's store.  There it has to be treated for additional moisture before it comes to the comparable point with the 46/9 for homegrown wheat?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The figure I have given will do for comparison purposes.  It is not necessary to go into pence.  The increased cost resulting from the increased price of native wheat will be roughly £700,000.  The increased cost of the 80,000 tons of imported wheat will be about £1,200,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Are you going on last year's figures?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The increased cost of native wheat will be £700,000.  We estimate that 80 per cent. of the total wheat used will be native wheat as against something below 50 per cent. previously.  The increased cost of imported wheat will be £1,200,000.  We estimate that the allocation price will be £30 per ton, as against £15 per ton last year, and that only 20 per cent. of the wheat used will be imported wheat.  That sum of £1,900,000, which represents the total increased price we will have to pay for wheat on the assumption that the quantity of flour to be consumed will be 2,700,000 sacks, means that, without any subsidy from any source, the price per sack of flour would be increased by about 14/-.  The port price of flour at present is 52/6 per sack and that would become 66/6. In accordance with the formula on <Col N="600" /> which bread prices are fixed, that would make a 4-lb. loaf 1/2 as against the present price of 1/-, even assuming there were no additional costs in the production of the loaf which would have to be offset by a higher price.  I want to stress that the increase in the price of flour&mdash;the 14/- to which I have referred&mdash;is attributable solely to the increased cost of wheat, both native and imported.  The other items going to make up the price of a sack of flour will remain unaltered.  In other words, I am allowing nothing for any possible increase in the cost of production or for any change in the remuneration of the milling industry, which is 6 per cent. on the capital employed in the industry as a whole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Six per cent. on the capital?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  There is, however, as Deputies know, available to offset the increased cost of flour a certain sum which represents the accumulated reserves of the Wheat Reserve Committee, that is to say, the body that bought wheat before the war and held it until required&mdash;it was not required until this year&mdash;and Grain Importers Limited, who have been in the position of accumulating reserves since the increase in the extraction of flour from wheat.  At the time that increased extraction was decided upon, it would have been possible for a short period to have reduced the price of flour, as more flour was being obtained from the wheat, but we decided not to reduce the price of flour but to hold the surplus funds accruing to Grain Importers Limited against this period when we knew that the cost of flour would have to be increased substantially. If we were to rely solely upon these reserve funds, which amount to £650,000&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>£650,000?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I should explain that it has been decided that £650,000 be used during the cereal year but in the period of the cereal year covered by this Estimate only £330,000 will be used.  That £330,000, if that were all that was available to reduce the price <Col N="601" /> of flour now, would reduce the 14/- increase which would otherwise have to be faced, by 5/3 per sack.  The net increase, therefore, would be 8/9 and the price of the 4-lb loaf would be 1/1½. If, on the other hand, we decided to use the whole of this reserve in this financial year, then the increase would be reduced by 10/6.  These figures will help Deputies to understand the magnitude of the decision which the Government took to maintain the price of flour and bread unchanged by the provision of a subsidy.  The price of flour at present is 52/6, as I have said, at four ports&mdash;Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Waterford&mdash;and elsewhere it is 52/6 plus the cost of transport by the cheapest method of transportation.</P>
      <P>These prices have been maintained unchanged for over 15 months, from September of last year, by various devices which it is not now necessary to enumerate.  They will continue unchanged in consequence of this decision of the Government to provide a subsidy.  It is intended to make an order fixing maximum retail prices for flour.  That order will come into operation in a day or two.  It is being made because arrangements have been completed which will permit of it, and I will refer to it again in another connection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that the Minister does not wish to mislead us.  The price is not being maintained at what it was, because heretofore the price of 52/6 was in bags: now that price is naked, representing an increase of 1/3 per sack.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>We have a motion by Deputy Dillon to reduce this sub-head F, that is, the sub-head which deals with flour and wheaten meal.  I do not know for what reason the Deputy has submitted that motion. Perhaps he intends to argue against the subsidisation of flour&mdash;I do not know&mdash;but whether he does it or I do it, somebody must give to the House the arguments that can be advanced against the subsidisation of flour. Those arguments are not inconsiderable. In fact, they are of such a nature that the Government spent a long time considering whether it would be wiser to proceed by way of subsidy or otherwise. Finally, we decided, for reasons which I can give, in favour of the subsidy, but I would like the House to understand that the decision was taken only after we had given full weight to the arguments in favour of another course.  It is obvious that subsidising the price of flour does not reduce the cost of it.  The cost of producing the flour required by the people of this country will increase in this cereal year by £1,900,000 over the cost of last year. That increase in the cost of providing the community's flour is due, as I have stated, to the higher price we are now paying for native wheat, which represents 80 per cent. of our supply, and to the very much higher price we have to pay for the balance, which we import in the form of hard wheats across the Atlantic.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The payment of a subsidy to maintain flour prices tends to conceal that increase in the cost of our flour.  The community will pay it as taxpayers and not as consumers.  It is essential that the members of this House and the public generally should understand that we do not avoid an increase by a subsidy arrangement&mdash;we merely transfer the main burden of the charge from one section of the community to another.  The community as a whole will have to pay the higher cost of the flour.  The payment of a subsidy may tend to conceal the fact that our flour will cost a great deal more, and it may lead also to extravagant demands for further increases in the costs now operating to raise the price of flour&mdash;increased demands in respect of wheat by the producers of wheat and demands from other people interested in the production of flour. These might be deterred or the demands postponed if the persons concerned realised fully that the granting of their demands would have an immediate adverse effect on the consumers of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If somebody proposed that the price of wheat should go up by 5/- a barrel to farmers, then everybody could relate that demand to the effect of an increase of a halfpenny in the price of the loaf; but when the element of subsidy is introduced, that fact does not become so obvious.  Consequently, the decision to pay a subsidy may result in demands by producers of wheat or other persons concerned in the production of flour, of an extravagant nature, which could not be resisted so easily, as the effect upon the consumers will not be obvious.  Furthermore, the introduction of an element of subsidy in the price of a commodity such as flour <Col N="604" /> tends to disorganise the relationship between the price of flour and the price of other commodities.  We could conceivably reduce the price of flour to a point at which we would be giving very definite encouragement to people to engage in the illegal practice of feeding flour to animals.  If, by subsidy, we cause a disrelationship to appear between the price of flour and other materials that could be used as animal feeding stuffs, we are clearly taking a risk which would be completely unjustifiable in circumstances like those now existing, when it is not yet clear that we will have a sufficiency of flour to maintain the minimum requirements of our people.</P>
    <P>I realised also, more particularly, perhaps, than other members of the Government, that a decision to pay a subsidy on the price of flour would lead to assertions that in some way flour millers were going to benefit by that subsidy and, in fact, that it was a subsidy to flour millers and not a subsidy to the consumers of flour. There is no gain of any kind to the Irish flour millers by reason of the decision to pay a subsidy.  The position that the flour miller will be in is that he will continue to receive his wheat this year at the same price as he paid last year.  He will have the same allowance in respect to cost of production and overhead charges, and he will be required to sell the flour at the same price.</P>

      <P>The flour millers are at present controlled at every stage of their activity.  The price at which they buy the wheat is fixed; the wages of the workers are fixed; the allowances in respect to overhead charges are fixed and their profit is fixed by my Department.  Thus, at every stage in the production of flour, from the growing of the wheat to its ultimate sale to the consumer, there is complete control and, so far as the miller is <Col N="605" /> concerned, his position has not been affected by the payment of the subsidy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The price of the flour is fixed by me, or by an officer of my Department, on the known costs of producing flour, plus an allowance of 6 per cent. in respect to the capital employed.  Furthermore, we had in mind, when considering this question of the paying of the flour subsidy, the fact that under the food voucher system the poorest sections of the community, those dependent for assistance on public funds of one kind or another, were, in fact, having their bread supply secured to them and the effect of an increase in the cost of bread offset by the allowance of bread free of charge which they get under that scheme.  The fact, therefore, that the subsidy concealed a real increase in the cost of flour, that that concealment of the increase might lead to extravagant demands which would tend further to increase the cost of flour, that there was a risk that the subsidising of flour prices might encourage its use as an animal feeding stuff, that there might be a misunderstanding as to the effect of the subsidy on the position of individual traders, and the further fact that the poorer sections of the community were already being protected by a Government scheme against a rise in price&mdash;all these were serious considerations against the payment of a subsidy, and I stress them here because I should like the Dáil to understand that this policy of subsidisation of food prices was not lightly embarked upon and cannot lightly be pursued without regard to other consequences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is the risk of which the Government were fully aware, that that policy, once started, might lead us into a position of considerable danger if it were pursued recklessly.  I do not want to be taken as saying that no expansion of that policy would be deemed possible in the future, but any proposal to expand it will have to have the same serious consideration which was given in the first instance to this particular aspect of it.  We <Col N="606" /> decided on the policy of subsidisation knowing what the risks were.  We appreciated that the community would be paying more for flour, even though they would be paying as taxpayers and not as consumers.  We did recognise that the burden of the additional charge would be transferred by subsidy from one section of the community to the other and that the effect of it would be, in part at any rate, to transfer it to the shoulders best able to bear it.</P>
    <P>In announcing the decision of the Government, I made it clear that the sum of approximately £2,000,000 which was being provided this year for the purpose was the utmost that would be provided and, if any additional costs arose, these additional costs would have to be reflected in the ordinary way by an increased price of flour and bread.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The total additional cost on flour in the cereal year will be £1,900,000.  We are providing in this Estimate the amount required to the end of the financial year.  It is, I think, necessary that we should follow up the decision to subsidise flour by exercising a more rigorous control over its distribution and use, and I want to urge on Deputies the importance of lending their moral support to the enforcement of the order which prohibits the use of wheat or flour or any wheaten product as a foodstuff for animals.  He have had occasionally reports of the scarcity of flour in many parts of the country.  These reports have been investigated and in some cases it is quite clear that the inability of numbers of human beings to get the quantity of flour required to maintain them was due to the fact that traders in the area had sold flour which they <Col N="607" /> must have known was going to be used by the purchasers as feeding stuffs for pigs.</P>
      <P>I think we should easily be able to get in the country the public spirit which will ensure that that practice will stop.  I realise, and I am sure Deputies do, too, the tremendous difficulty of enforcing completely an order of that kind.  It is almost impossible to get the evidence which will enable offenders to be convicted in a court, but if we get the public spirit aroused and get the public to understand that every person who offends against the order and uses wheat or wheaten products to feed to animals is depriving some human being of the appropriate quantity of flour, then we will get the kind of enforcement which will be most effective.</P>
      <P>No matter what we may do, we will not have more than sufficient flour for human needs in this year.  We may not have sufficient.  The estimated yield of 290,000 tons from the Irish wheat crop has not yet materialised; not more than 170,000 tons has yet come in.  There is, of course, still time for the balance to come in&mdash;the harvest was late&mdash;but if the full estimated quantity is not secured, then we will not be able to reach the end of the year with an all-wheaten loaf.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall deal later with the rationing of flour.  I think it is necessary that I should explain to the House the procedure that will be adopted for the payment of the subsidy. Let me say this.  I would have much preferred if we could, in this year, have paid the subsidy direct to the producers of wheat.  I think we would have settled a lot of argument and have made quite clear both to wheat producers and everybody else what precisely was happening. Because of the system of minimum prices in operation under the Cereals Acts, and for other reasons, it was not practicable to do it this year.  We are therefore subsidising the price of flour instead. <Col N="608" /> We are doing that through the flour millers.  We are doing it by arranging that the flour miller will get his wheat at the same price as that at which he got it last year.  We are utilising for that purpose the organisation of Grain Importers (Eire), Limited.  As Deputies are aware, Grain Importers (Eire), Limited, is a company, set up by the Government and financed by the Government for the purpose of buying wheat abroad for this country.  It is a non-profit making company, the directors of which give their services voluntarily.</P>

The money will be made available to Grain Importers (Éire) Limited, who will make adjustments in the allocation price of wheat to the millers in such form as to ensure that the total cost of the millers' grist will remain unchanged. That is, I think, the most effective method to ensure that the funds provided for subsidy purposes will be utilised to ensure that there will be no increase in the cost of producing flour.</P>

That committee will be known as the financial adjustment committee and will be presided over by an officer of the Department of Supplies.  As well as advising Grain Importers (Eire) Ltd. the committee will also advise me as to the nature of the directions to be given to the company.  It is proposed also to subsidise the price of wheaten meal produced by licensed wheaten meal millers for sale.  The cost of the subsidy in respect of wheaten meal is estimated at £33,000.  It is, of course, included in the figure mentioned in sub-head F.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  The subsidy, however, will not be payable to permitted millers, that is to say, millers who are grinding on a commission basis, and not for sale.  Neither is it intended to subsidise any flour of less than 95 per cent. extraction.  A limited quantity of certain types of flour is at present being produced under permit for use as altar bread, semolina, paste and starch.  Flour of 95 per cent. extraction used for biscuit making, will, however, be eligible for the subsidy.  Now, it is necessary also to provide a separate subsidy in respect of bread, if the aim of the Government to keep bread prices unchanged is to be realised.  Deputies might have assumed that the fact that flour prices will remain unchanged automatically involves that bread prices will remain unchanged.  But it is clear that other costs involved in the production of bread have risen as well as the cost of flour.  As the House knows, the price of bread was controlled before the war.  It was controlled under a special Act passed by the Oireachtas many years ago, following on a report of the Prices Commission, which prepared a formula designed to relate the price of bread to the price of flour.  The Prices Commission <Col N="612" /> drew up a table of flour prices and indicated the various points in the scale at which an increase or a decrease in the price of bread would be justifiable.  Ordinarily, the price of bread goes up by ½d. per 4-lb. loaf if the price of flour rises by 4/- a sack, or, at some point in the scale, if the price of flour goes up by 3/- a sack. 50/- and 53/- per sack of flour were two points in the scale.  If the price of flour fell below 50/- a decrease of ½d. in the price of bread would be involved; if it rose above 53/- an increase of ½d. would be involved. It is clear that, in preparing that formula, the Prices Commission had regard to the circumstances that existed at the time, normal circumstances pre-war, in which there was a continuous movement in the price of flour, the price of flour being fixed upon the world market price of wheat, which was continually fluctuating. Because the world market price of wheat was continually fluctuating, the home price of flour also fluctuated. In deciding upon that method of fixing bread prices, the Prices Commission assumed that that fluctuation in the price of flour would continue.  If a change in the price of bread is admissible when the price of flour falls below 50/-, or when the price of flour rises above 53/-, it is clear that it is only when the price is 51/6, half-way between the two points, that the formula is strictly accurate and that the price of bread is exactly relating to the price of flour.  The Prices Commission, however, assumed that the arrangement was fair to the bakers because they thought that, in the ordinary course of events, the price of flour would be as often below 51/6, as it was above it.  Therefore, they said: &ldquo;So long as it is at any point between 50/- and 53/- this price of 1/- a loaf should prevail.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the outbreak of the war, however, those circumstances ended.  When the Department of Supplies was set up, it took control of the price of flour, and, as I have already stated, for a period of 15 months the price of flour has been pinned at the point of 52/6, that is 1/- above the price which was intermediate between the two points at <Col N="613" /> which a change in the price of flour would take place.  It was contended by the bakers that that arrangement was unfair to them; that, in holding the price of flour at a point just below the point at which they would be entitled to an increase in price, we were in fact making it impossible for them to continue in production at a profit. Now, I am going to say a few words which the bakers of this country will not like.  The bakers contended that the arrangement was unfair to them, but they never proved it.  Any other manufacturer in the country who considered that he was entitled to charge higher prices for his products came to my Department, produced his accounts, and satisfied the accountants in the service of the Department that an increase in costs had taken place sufficient to justify his claim for a higher price.  The bakers never did that.  They contented themselves with making vague general statements, some of which were so fantastic as to invalidate their whole contention.  I took no action upon their claim because of their failure to make any attempt to substantiate it.  It was not until a tribunal was set up by the Department of Industry and Commerce to investigate a claim by bakers employed in Dublin bakeries for an increase in their wages that the Dublin bakers produced their accounts.  As Deputies who are familiar with the report of that tribunal will remember, those accounts showed in some cases&mdash;and showed to the satisfaction of the tribunal&mdash;that some at least of those bakers were selling bread at that time at a loss, or at any rate, not at a profit.</P>
    <P>Now, I know that the price of salt and of yeast and of fuel and of petrol and of feeding stuffs for animals, and the cost of vehicles and repairs to vehicles and the like, have all increased and because I know those things I am assuming that the bakers are entitled to some increase in the price of bread, even though we disregard their claim in respect of our action in holding the price of flour at 52/6 for a period of 15 months, but the only positive information I have is the accounts submitted to me by those <Col N="614" /> bakery firms in Dublin, and one out of 1,000 firms in the rest of Ireland. The various associations of bakers were asked to see that certified accounts were produced by their members, and they failed to do so.  Outside the City of Dublin, out of 1,000 firms engaged in the bakery industry only one firm produced accounts.  As a result of the information available to me, the examination of the accounts which were presented, and the knowledge, which is in fact common knowledge, as to the increase in the price of other commodities in addition to flour required in the manufacture of bread, I am satisfied that there has been an increase in the cost of baking bread equivalent to ½d. in the 4-lb. loaf.  If, therefore, we wish to implement our decision to maintain the price of bread unchanged, this subsidy arrangement must include a provision to offset those higher costs of bakers. Under a recent order, all bakers of batch bread must be licensed, and I want to make it clear that this subsidy will be paid only to licensed bakers. The idea of licensing bakers has the official support of the three main associations of bakers.  I want to mention, however, that, despite the publicity which was given to the matter, and despite the fact that the various associations of bakers were informed of the steps to be taken, the number of applications for licensing seems to be far below the number of bakers of batch bread.  It must be clear that those who have failed to apply for their licences under the order will not qualify for and will not receive the subsidy.</P>

      <P>Yes, because the higher costs are in operation.  If we did not make it retrospective to 15th October we would now have higher prices of flour and bread in operation.  Arrangements were made with the bakers to ensure that those records would be kept.

      <P>From time to time we have had it urged here that we should reconsider the question of maintaining the extraction of flour at 95 per cent. It has been decided to retain it at 95 per cent.  If we were to reduce the extraction of flour, say to the pre-war level which gave us white bread, not merely would the effect upon the price of the bread be very substantial&mdash;it would amount to 3d. or 4d. per loaf&mdash; but we would have to supplement the native wheat harvest to a much greater extent than we now contemplate.  The attempt to give the community that white bread again would involve the importation of an additional 150,000 tons of wheat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree, but 85 per cent. bread is not white bread.  We could reduce it, as the British have done, to <Col N="617" /> 80 per cent., and call it white bread, but over 80 per cent. the bran gets into the bread, and it does not make much difference from a dietetic point of view whether the extraction is 85 or 90 per cent.  In respect of the keeping quality of the bread, the dietetic value of the bread, and so forth, the difference is not very significant.  It is only when you get the extraction so low that there is no bran in the flour that there is any noticeable difference.  At any rate, I am so advised by bread experts. I do not claim to be an expert myself.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Roughly half 150,000 tons&mdash;75,000 tons.  We have, as I say, a very limited amount of shipping at our disposal.  The total amount of commodities which all those ships, worked to their fullest capacity, can bring in in a year is very limited.  Every ton of wheat which we bring in, in excess of the minimum required to maintain the quantity of flour required by our people, can only be imported by stopping something else, and there are many other commodities, essential commodities, which are in such short supply that we must avail of these shipping facilities to bring them in.  I mention tea as a case in point.  There are many people who will urge, and rightly urge, that it is more important to increase the ration of tea, if we can, than to maintain a full supply of flour.  Certainly it is much more important to increase the <Col N="618" /> ration of tea than to reduce the extraction of flour from wheat.  There are also industrial commodities upon which the livelihoods of many thousands of people depend, and if we cannot import these commodities, the industrial activities of which they are the raw materials must cease.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>We can discuss that at another time.  I should hate very much to contemplate the quantity of goods we would have to bring in if Deputy Dillon had his way for the past ten years.  The position is that we must utilise our limited shipping space to the best advantage, and in order to enable us to import as many and as much of the commodities of which we are now short as we can get.  Of course, in the circumstances of the world to-day, there are many commodities of which we are in need which cannot be got.  It is not a question of shipping facilities at all; it is a matter of the unavailability of the commodities themselves, but there are many commodities still procurable in the world which must be imported through the medium of these limited shipping facilities. A decision, therefore, to reduce the extraction of flour from wheat means that we decide to utilise 75,000 or 150,000 tons, or at least the shipping space capable of carrying that tonnage of wheat, to carry wheat instead of some other commodities.  I think that would be a very unwise decision.</P>

The price we pay to the foreign producer is about 15/- per barrel.  In fact, the Deputy can take it that there are countries in the world to-day where you can get wheat for nothing, merely for the taking away.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">

      <P>That is the cost of bringing it in here, not the price paid to the foreign producer.  As I have said, there are countries where we could get wheat almost for nothing if we could take it away.  That has no relation to the cost of the wheat delivered in this country.  It is a very interesting fact to bear in mind, however, that the enhanced price we now pay for home-grown wheat is very much below the price at which in present circumstances we could buy wheat of other origin.  Deputy Dillon has referred on more than one occasion to his suggestion that we should ration flour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy made suggestions besides that seemed even not so intelligent.  From time to time during the course of the last few months I have had complaints from different parts of the country that there was a shortage of flour.  I want the House to believe me when I say that, to the best of my knowledge, every single one of these complaints was investigated and as a result of the investigation of the complaints I want to make the definite statement that nine out of ten of them were bogus.  These shortages of flour were either caused, or alleged to exist, by traders who had a very definite interest in getting an increased supply of flour through their shops. There were exceptional circumstances in Monaghan, in Cavan and in Leitrim. There were districts along the border of those counties where the quantity of flour of native origin sold was much less than the quantity consumed, because people in those districts bought flour on the other side of the Border.  In those districts there <Col N="620" /> was a definite shortage of flour from the time that deliveries to traders in those areas were related to the purchases last year, and special measures had to be taken in order to deal with genuine shortages in those areas.  In some other districts, or on some other occasions in particular districts, there were special and abnormal circumstances which caused real shortages which had to be made good by an increased supply.</P>
      <P>Over the rest of the country as a whole most of the allegations of shortages were created by traders who had a vested interest in the matter. I want to urge on parish councils and similar bodies who communicate with me and my Department alleging the existence of flour shortages to investigate these things for themselves before making the allegations. In a very large number of cases which we investigated we found that there was in fact no shortage or should have been no shortage, if the traders concerned were not interested in creating one.  Either there was no shortage at all and the trader was hoping to get an additional supply to sell on the black market or the trader had deliberately caused the shortage by selling exceptional quantities of flour to individuals.  Furthermore, it is interesting to note that, even in the Border districts of County Monaghan, we have come across cases of traders who were sending flour out of these districts to other districts in the hope of getting a better price for it.  We came across one trader in Monaghan who was actually sending flour to Kerry at the time when some newspapers were reporting a shortage of flour in Kerry.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely you do not deny that there was a shortage of flour in Monaghan and along the Border?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy had just gone out when I was speaking of the question of the Border areas.  I told the House before that 48,000 sacks of flour were being released every week for consumption.  The fact is that, <Col N="621" /> taking the flour milling industry as a whole, for some time past they have not got orders for 48,000 sacks of flour per week.  That does not mean that in some districts there was no shortage, but it does indicate that the 48,000 sacks was sufficient to meet the requirements of the country, if distribution arrangements had been working perfectly.  I have mentioned already that we are going to fix the maximum retail price of flour.  That fixed retail price of flour will prevent any such transactions as that of the Monaghan trader to whom I have referred and will, I think, make it unprofitable for traders to do what a number of them have been doing&mdash;taking flour sent to them to supply the requirements of their area and sending it into other areas for sale at a higher price there, illegally.  Furthermore, we have made arrangements which will, I am satisfied, ensure that no genuine shortage can arise in any area.</P>
      <P>The institution of a rationing scheme for flour would be a very elaborate business and I think it would be entirely unjustifiable to impose all the inconvenience and hardship of a rationing scheme on the community as a whole because of the difficulties created by a few traders in a very limited number of districts. We can deal with these traders.  There are probably too many traders engaged in the flour trade anyway, and the country would be better off without some of them.  I want it to be known definitely that any trader who I find is not distributing the flour he receives equitably and fairly will in fact be put out of that business for the duration of the emergency or so long as I am in control of it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>In the diet of the poor, bread constitutes a much more important item than in the diet of the <Col N="622" /> rich.  In relation to the total quantity of food they buy, the poor buy much more bread than those better off, and to ration flour or bread&mdash;it would be very difficult to find an effective ration system anyhow&mdash;on a flat-rate basis would be unfair.  I am not going to do it so long as it is possible to keep up the supply of flour, even if it becomes necessary to mix barley or oats with the wheat in order to maintain the supply.  I think it is a much better policy to maintain a full supply of flour, even if it involves the use of other cereals, than to resort to rationing.  I am prepared to deal with any case of alleged shortage that may be brought to my notice.  The allegation will be investigated forthwith and, in any case where it is found there is a genuine shortage, additional supplies will be made available.  These supplies will be there, we hope.  In any event, we can, within the present total distribution, make available a surplus which is not now in demand in order to meet the requirements of particular areas.</P>
      <P>I do not know if the Dáil expects me to deal with any other aspect of the work of the Department of Supplies other than this proposal to subsidise flour and bread.  I do not know to what extent it is open to the Dáil to debate the whole of the activities of the Department on the Supplementary Estimate, but I assume it is.  If it is desired that I should make a statement concerning the position of fuel, or tea, or sugar, or any other commodity, I am prepared to do it.  I have gone at some length into this one item and perhaps it will satisfy the House if I leave it at that.</P>

      <P>I have done that already; at least I informed the House that the price of turf was fixed without relation to its cost.  It was fixed on a basis of what it was considered people might be able to pay without interrupting or interfering with its equitable distribution.  The actual cost of turf delivered in Dublin, that is turf produced by the county surveyors and transported from Donegal and the West will, I think, prove to be high.  The <Col N="623" /> price of the turf which has been stored in Dublin and has been subject to storage charges will be high.  I doubt if the price at which Fuel Importers, Ltd. are now selling turf to merchants will prove to be adequate to avoid their incurring a loss.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know.  What it is going to work out at nobody can say.  In relation to this question of turf, which is now being distributed in quantities in which it was never distributed before and through an organisation not designed for that purpose, there are a large number of unknown elements.  We can estimate what their costs are likely to be, but even if we confine ourselves to the obvious costs, the cost of labour, which is by far the biggest item, the cost of rent, the storage, etc., we cannot arrive at a definite figure.  But, over and above those elements, there is one factor which is completely unknown, and that is the extent to which turf loses weight in storage.  If you put 100 tons of turf into a dump at the North Wall or elsewhere, you will not get 100 tons out. The Deputy knows that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Even in wet weather. There is the wastage of the turf, the loss of moisture content, and what weight will come out has yet to be seen. The same applies in relation to the merchants themselves.  In the handling of the turf, its stacking, delivery and unstacking, there is again wastage.  To what extent that will affect the cost of distribution it is impossible to say. Therefore, we had to fix a figure which had relation no doubt to our estimates, but which in relation to these estimates seems to indicate that a loss will be incurred.  That is all the information I can give the Dáil at present.  At a later stage, when the accountants will <Col N="624" /> be able to determine what in fact the cost was in relation to the turf actually distributed, I can give the Dáil much more definite information.  But, at the moment, the only information available to me is so vague and indefinite that we decided to disregard it in fixing the price of turf.</P>

All the turf, no matter what its quality, or its origin or its prime cost, will be sold at the same price and at the end there will be an averaging out of costs and of prices.

      <P>Certainly, and there is turf which cost in the bog less than 15/- which is costing over £3 a ton when it reaches Dublin because transport costs are very high and all the additional handlings which take place add to the cost of the turf.  We can <Col N="626" /> have this out more satisfactorily some other time, when I am able to produce more than provisional costings for the turf.  The Deputy can be certain, so far as this turf is concerned, up to the point where it leaves Fuel Importers' hands there is no private profit in it at all. No private enterprise has had anything to do with it.  It was produced by a public authority, transported at fixed rates and handled here by a non-profit-making organisation which is concerned only to recover its actual outgoings.  There is no element of private profit in that price at all until it reaches the distributors' hands and the distributors are allowed a margin to cover distribution costs.</P>

Surely the Deputy would not suggest that all those activities might be discussed widely on this Vote.  If the Deputy considers the amount of the Vote he will see things in their proper perspective.  Of the total Vote of £683,000, over £600,000 is required for <Col N="627" /> subsidies on bread or on flour and meal.  There is obviously not much basis for a discussion on turf.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>On sub-head A: from time to time we have had orders issued from the Department of Supplies to the effect that a certain maximum price has been fixed in respect of certain classes of goods.  These orders are issued in a manner that leads one to think that there is some seriousness in fixing these prices but on the issue of the order, apparently, no effective steps whatever are taken by the Department to ensure that these orders are complied with.  I do not know who is responsible for ensuring that the orders are complied with.  I do not know whether the Department has sufficient personnel at its disposal to ensure visitations to various towns regularly and surprise checks on traders, with a view to ensuring that these orders are not flagrantly disregarded, but I can assure the Minister that these orders are being disregarded and that there is widespread and growing indignation at the manner in which traders are, apparently, allowed to get away with any price they like. I attended a meeting last week in Newbridge and very strong and bitter complaints were made to me that certain traders in that town&mdash;I do not say all traders &mdash; were charging prices higher than those fixed by the maximum prices order.  As soon as complaints were made by people familiar with the circumstances in Newbridge, complaints were also made by people in other towns in Kildare <Col N="630" /> that they were experiencing similar hardships.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>What did the Deputy do about it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I was coming to that.  I tried to be helpful in the matter.  I suggested that an effective scheme of price control needs some form of co-operation from the consumer.  In saying that I was not unaware of the difficulties involved to the consumer in endeavouring to co-operate.  I was promptly reminded of the fact, which I knew from my own experience to be accurate, that if a consumer reported a trader for over-charging or refusing to give a receipt for a commodity purchased, that consumer would get no more goods in that shop.  Where a consumer happens to have an account at the shop and to depend on the trader for goods from Monday morning until Saturday night, he is not too anxious to incur the wrath of the shopkeeper. I do not say that that method of retaliation is practised by every shopkeeper, or that every shopkeeper indulges in the objectionable practice of exploiting consumers, notwithstanding the maximum prices orders, but I do say, definitely and deliberately&mdash;the Department's inspectors will get the evidence if they go there&mdash;that in the case of Newbridge and other towns in Kildare, prices in excess of the maximum fixed prices are being charged.  They are being charged, in the main, to poor consumers.  There is no effective control of prices, and although it is known that there is over-charging, no prosecution, so far as I can ascertain, has been instituted against a single trader in the whole county.  It may be difficult for the Department to exercise wide supervision over that kind of illegal activity on the part of traders, but some effort should be made to utilise whatever instruments of inspection are available. I cannot understand why it is not possible to employ the services of the Gárda Síochána for the purpose of ensuring some degree of compliance with the maximum prices orders or some fear of the consequences of noncompliance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="631" /> I had occasion to advise a person to go into a Gárda barracks and ask what the maximum price of a commodity was.  Not only did the Guard say that he had never seen a comprehensive list of maximum prices, but he told the visitor that his wife reported her inability to purchase paraffin from a trader to the Department of Supplies and her reward was to be refused further paraffin oil supplies by the trader.  Is not that a chaotic condition of affairs when we are endeavouring to secure some scheme of price control and to take some measures to protect the public from being fleeced by people who want to get rich quickly? Having issued a maximum price order, it is the Minister's duty to endeavour to secure compliance with that order, respect for his authority and for the authority of the Government.  The trader should be made aware that if he charges prices in excess of those fixed, his action will be punishable by severe penalties.  Fines imposed in cases where proceedings were instituted have been perfectly farcical and have not acted as a deterrent to traders against exploiting the needs of consumers.  The Minister must establish respect for his maximum price orders.  He must ensure that these orders, when issued, will govern the conduct of traders and every possible instrument must be utilised to bring home to the traders the seriousness of the offence of noncompliance. Any breach of the order should be punishable by a heavy fine and no flouting of the Minister's authority should be permitted.  I can assure the Minister, as other Deputies can, that notwithstanding the fixation of maximum prices, poor people particularly are still being fleeced.  The people who are being fleeced most are those with weekly accounts in shops, who are not able to bring their custom elsewhere and who are afraid to report cases of over-charging because of fear of retaliation by the shopkeeper.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I would welcome a debate on the subject of prices control because there is a great deal of rather careless talk which convinces me that a number of Deputies have not applied their minds to the problem at all.  It is not merely a question of administration. There is a question of policy involved and one must consider the objective behind it.  When one deals with the enforcement of maximum prices orders it is only a question of machinery, but behind the whole matter of price control there arise questions as to the aims to be achieved by that control.  I should like to give the Deputy a few illustrations to make clear what I have in mind.  The aim of price control could be&mdash;most Deputies speak as if it should be&mdash;to keep down prices to the lowest possible point.  Is that the aim of price control?  If a manufacturer says that goods cost him&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister allow me to say that I did not discuss the wide question of price control because I did not think that I would be allowed to do so?  What I ask is that if the Minister issues an order saying that the price of candles six inches, eight inches or 12 inches, is to be a certain amount, he should secure that no higher price will be charged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>We may have as the aim of price control the keeping down of prices, the maintenance of employment, the equitable distribution of goods or some equally desirable objective, but the whole thing breaks down unless there is proper enforcement. To secure enforcement of price control orders there is a staff of inspectors. No doubt the Deputy will say that that staff should be increased.  I shall not disagree with him, but there are problems about increasing the staff because the attitude of the Government as a whole is to keep down administrative expenses.  That is certainly the policy of the Department of Finance, and one must convince the Department of Finance before increased staff can be secured.  Even if the consent of the <Col N="633" /> Department of Finance is obtained there is the problem of selecting the proper type of person.  The type of person who can be entrusted with the enforcement of price control, which involves contact with shopkeepers who may have an interest in suborning officials, is not easy to get.  He has to be a trained officer, preferably a member of the permanent service, so that there will be no temporary inducement to him to take advantage of his position.  He has got to be trained in a definitely difficult class of work. We have got a number of inspectors. They are working very hard and have brought a very large number of cases to court.  A much larger number of cases are awaiting trial by the courts as soon as the legal department can arrange for their completion, but they fall down very frequently upon the question of evidence.</P>
      <P>Deputy Norton spoke about the inadequacy of the fines imposed upon offenders.  He knows, of course, that I have nothing whatever to do with the fines imposed upon offenders.  Under the Constitution of this State, the determination of the appropriate punishment for convicted offenders is a matter for the courts, and the courts are completely independent of the Executive. I have sometimes been amazed at the decisions of district justices in cases relating to price control offences. I have seen a case where a man was charged with selling milk at 1d. per pint above the fixed price.  When convicted of the offence he was fined 1/- by a district justice.  I have seen where district justices practically threw out cases on the point that, as everybody was making a bit, why should not those before them make a bit, too?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>District justices acting in that way should be interned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Whatever the explanation&mdash;there may have been details and facts that I am not aware of&mdash;a number of decisions by district justices have been rather astonishing, and certainly appear to indicate to me that the district justices attach much less importance to this matter of price control than the Government.  The function of <Col N="634" /> the Department of Supplies is to detect the offender, to bring the offender before the district justice, whose job it is to decide what the punishment will be; but in order to get a conviction in the courts, it is necessary to have evidence, and the obtaining of that evidence is often a most difficult thing.  In most cases the offences are committed without anybody being present as a witness. There is the individual who makes a purchase at an excessive price, and the trader.  It is only the individual who is the victim of the overcharge who is, in fact, in a position to give evidence, and in a great number of cases that individual will not give evidence.  Therefore, there are many cases where it is known to the officers of the Department of Supplies that an offence against a price order is taking place, and nothing can be done about it because of our inability to get legal evidence which will stand the test of examination in the courts, leading to a conviction in the courts.  These are problems which face those responsible for price control in every country.  In some countries they get over the difficulty by shooting people on suspicion, and sometimes even without trial.  If we did that here, no doubt we would get a much greater degree of compliance with our price control orders than we are getting, but I think that would be a dangerous departure from present practice.</P>

      <P>But in other countries, wherever they operate the same system that we have&mdash;that is, trial by independent courts and a conviction upon evidence produced in the courts&mdash;this difficulty in the matter of price control that we are experiencing arises also.  I do not think it is correct to say that there is widespread evasion of the orders.  It is true that every case of overcharging gets a great deal of publicity, and that individuals talk a lot about these things.  On the whole, the majority of traders are obeying the law, at least, obeying the law 99 times out of 100, and these price control orders are, in a very great measure, <Col N="635" /> effective.  I know that in many cases the overcharging complained of was part of an illegal transaction in which the customer was concerned. The customer went to a trader and said: &ldquo;Give me a quarter pound of tea above that to which I am entitled on my ration.&rdquo;  The trader says: &ldquo;Yes, but you will have to pay me for it at the rate of 8/- or 10/- a pound.&rdquo; The customer pays, and gets an illegal quantity of tea, and then proceeds to talk about the enormity of the offence committed by the trader in charging him that price for the tea.  There would, in fact, be little difficulty in enforcing all orders now made to control the distribution of commodities, or to fix the price of commodities, if there were not many people who, for selfish reasons, are prepared to condone offences committed by traders so long as they get something out of it.  That attitude towards the administration of control orders is widespread.  I think it exists amongst every class of community. The individual who goes into a golf club, a public house, or any other place where people foregather, and boasts to his friends of the fact that he has succeeded in getting more tea, or more sugar, or more petrol than he is entitled to, is not regarded as a sort of mean criminal who is depriving other people of their rightful share of the commodities available; but, instead, he is regarded as a smart fellow, and people clap him on the back, expressing the hope that the same opportunity will come to themselves some time.  It is that wrong spirit which exists over a large part of the community which is making it so difficult to implement these price control orders.  If, when men stood up in golf clubs or in public houses or elsewhere, and boasted of the fact that they were able to get more tea than they were entitled to on their ration, that they were able to get more flour or more sugar, or a few extra gallons of petrol, they were immediately denounced by those present as criminals of a mean type who should properly be in jail, then people would not be so keen to do those things, or to incur the disapproval of their fellows.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="636" /> I want to urge on public representatives, on newspapers and on everybody who is in a position to influence public opinion, that they should try to promote in the minds of our people that approach to this problem of enforcing these control orders.  They are made to protect the public.  If somebody gets more sugar than he is entitled to, then in some part of the country some other person is going to get less sugar than he is entitled to; if somebody gets more flour or more tea than he is entitled to, then somewhere else some other person is going to suffer.  The man who takes advantage of his wealth or of his personal friendship with traders, or of his contact with sources of supply in order to take out of the very limited pool more than he is legally entitled to, is properly to be regarded as a public enemy.  I would ask that everybody would try to promote that idea. If they do, then we will have less difficulty in enforcing these orders and people will be more willing to come forward and appear in court and give evidence to assist the Department in bringing known offenders to book.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Norton that it is a deplorable thing if any of the orders made by me or by the Government to control supplies or fix prices are being disobeyed and are known to be disobeyed, because it brings the whole administration of the Government and the whole democratic machine into contempt.  Therefore, we must try by every possible means to see that there is no evasion of any kind of any of these orders.  We know that sometimes there is evasion because we hear of cases. There is, in fact, definite knowledge, even in many cases where there cannot be legal proof, and it is bad that it should be so.  I can only assure the Deputy that, so far as it is possible to secure the enforcement of these orders by means of inspectors and by means of administrative action through the Department of Supplies, that action will be taken.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>On sub-head E&mdash;Advertising and Publicity&mdash;I have come across a number of cases of complaint arising out of the refusal of the Department of Supplies to issue a permit for the allocation of some commodities where the refusal, apparently, was based on the unwillingness&mdash;it may be on the unwillingness&mdash;of the applicant to comply with some regulation issued by the Department.  I know these regulations are published in the daily papers, and, to a limited extent, up to recently, in the provincial papers, but I think it desirable that, in existing circumstances, all advertisements for which the Minister for Supplies is responsible should be inserted in all papers with any kind of a decent circulation, and especially the provincial papers.</P>
      <P>I had a complaint some time ago from a newspaper owner in my constituency that, notwithstanding the fact that they could prove that they had a circulation of 17,000 a week, another newspaper, with an alleged circulation of 10,000 a week, had got the advertisement in that area.  Any paper which can prove a circulation of 10,000 or 17,000 per week should, in existing circumstances, get these advertisements, so that people living in the rural areas and who do not read the daily papers will be able to have access to the contents of orders issued by the Minister.  If that were done, there would be no good ground for some of the complaints I have received. If these advertisements are to be paid for at the public expense, and if citizens are to have access to the information contained in Government orders, I think every newspaper owner in the country has a right to expect that he should get some share of public money spent in this way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not raising this matter in the interests of any newspaper owner.  If all the newspapers were given the advertisements issued by the Department <Col N="638" /> of Supplies, there would be fewer refusals issued by the Department to either traders or consumers who have not complied with the requirements of the Department, and who give as their reason, rightly or wrongly, the plea that they had no knowledge of the requirements of the Minister in relation to the many orders issued.  I should like to hear what the Minister has to say in that regard and to hear from him the method adopted by the Department, or by the Department of Finance, if that is the Department concerned, in making selections for the issue of these advertisements, particularly in provincial newspapers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The truth of the matter is that the Minister gets the list of newspapers in which he puts advertisements from the Stationery Office.  The explanation of the strange discrepancy by which you find some insignificant rural rags included in the list, while substantial provincial newspapers are excluded, is that every Fianna Fáil T.D. has the Stationery Office warm to get any rag that will support them in their own policy put on the list, and they have succeeded in getting a good many.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  It applies to some of the ridiculous rags which have survived by licking the feet of the local Fianna Fáil T.D. in exchange for getting themselves put on the advertising list of the Stationery Office, where they should never have been put.  That is the explanation of the whole thing. The remainder of the list is an old list which has been there for the last 20 or 30 years and which is seldom changed, but, of course, everybody in Government circles knows the goings-on between the Fianna Fáil T.D.s and these half-bankrupt little rags which depend for their survival on these indirect Government subsidies, which I think the Government are very glad to pay.</P>

      <P>I hope to get a list of them one of these days, and I will give it then.  I agree with Deputy Davin that the right way is for the Stationery Office to fix some minimum weekly circulation at which the Government will give Government advertisements, and then let any newspaper which is in a position to produce an auditor's certificate that it has that average weekly circulation automatically go on the list. That is peculiarly necessary at present when, as Deputy Davin says, men depend for their livelihood very often on knowing precisely the terms of some Government advertisements or other which have been given publicity.  It is perfectly simple.  If a newspaper wants Government advertisements, it ought to be able to satisfy the Government as to what its weekly circulation is, and if it is able to satisfy the Minister that it has a circulation sufficiently large to justify insertion of Government advertisements in its columns, it ought to get Government advertisements as of right, without having to go round and court the particular Fianna Fáil T.D. who sits for the constituency in which the paper is published.  That is the plain, unvarnished truth of the matter. There will be loud howls of protest from the Government that such a thing never crossed their mind, but it is the truth, and I happen to know it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to give the House an illustration of Deputy Dillon's unvarnished truth.  He said that this list of papers was prepared by the Stationery Office.  It is not; it is prepared by me.  As far as the Department of Supplies is concerned, I list what papers the Departmental advertisements will appear in.  The papers were chosen by me on the basis of circulation, and in each case where there were two papers concerned, the advertisements are given to that which has predominantly the larger circulation. If there was any sort of close relationship between the circulations of the two papers, if they were near one another, both got the advertisement, but the aim was to ensure that in every part of the country the papers with the widest circulations would carry these advertisements.  There are in this <Col N="640" /> country hundreds of papers with very small circulations&mdash;sometimes less than 1,000 per week&mdash;and as all these papers adopt the uniform practice of charging double rates for Government advertisements, it would be obviously a misuse of the taxpayers' money to give them these display advertisements for which they charge these high rates and which would more than double the advertising bill of the Department.</P>
      <P>I do not know of a single case of a Fianna Fáil Deputy making representations to me on behalf of a newspaper. I know of cases of Fine Gael Deputies making representations to me on behalf of newspapers&mdash;and of Labour Deputies. One of them even raised the question of a newspaper in the Dáil, and he was right.  A particular Labour Deputy referred to a newspaper which had a wide circulation in a part of the country covered by no other paper to which we were giving the advertisements. When I examined the matter, I found that there was a deficiency in the list of papers and the deficiency was made good.  I have had a number of representations from Fine Gael Deputies about papers in their constituencies. Deputy Dillon will say that that was because the Fine Gael papers were left out, but it was not.</P>

      <P>No, halos; we will lend Deputies opposite a few, if they want them.  Departmental advertisements are published in 34 local newspapers and they may be all scurrilous rags&mdash;the <i>People's Press</i>, in Donegal, the <i>Sligo Champion</i>, and a number of other pillars of the Fine Gael Party. I do not know that the proprietors or editors of these papers would welcome Deputy Dillon's description of them. They are certainly not very friendly <Col N="641" /> to the Department of Supplies, or to the Government as a whole. In fact, even Deputy Dillon could scarcely rise to the levels of abuse sometimes achieved by the <i>People's Press.</i>  If the Deputy reads the <i>People's Press</i>, he will get a number of new ideas for his speeches in the Dáil, but they still carry the Department's advertisements.  I assure the House that the only consideration taken into account in selecting these papers was their circulation.  It may be that some papers claimed circulations which we doubted existed. Not all these local papers have their circulations certified, but in the case of the newspapers which have their returns certified, the advertisements are given to those in every case with the largest circulations in their counties. With regard to Laoighis, I do not know if there is any newspaper published in that county, but there are papers which circulate in Laoighis.</P>

I mentioned already that all the local papers charge us double the ordinary rates for advertising. The circulation of some of these papers is very small.

The total turnover <Col N="643" /> of the flour-milling industry in this country is in the order of from £7,000,000 to £7,500,000, so that the subsidy amounts to nearly one-third of the total turnover.  I am going to suggest to the House that the facts which I shall lay before it, will coerce Deputies to the view that we have reached the stage in this matter of flour manufacture, when the only proper method of maintaining manufacture, and protecting the consumers' interests is to establish a body, analogous to the Electricity Supply Board, to take over the entire flour-milling industry; to run it for the benefit of the people and not for the very restricted group of industrialists who have used it for the purpose of robbing and exploiting our people for the last ten years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not asking for legislation.  This is a scheme to supply £2,000,000 of a subsidy for flour, and I say that that subsidy should be used by the Government directly rather than be handed over to the millers.  I want to put it to the House that to give the £1,900,000 a year, which the Minister told us would ensure that the millers would secure 6 per cent. on their capital, and be able to pay shipping and other charges, is outrageous in the light of existing facts.  The millers are now going to be guaranteed 6 per cent. on their issued capital.  I want to tell <Col N="644" /> the House what the issued capital of one of these mills is.  There is a flour mill in this city which went into the courts about 1929, and having laid open the facts about its assets and circumstances, was ordered to reduce its capital by £3,000 to the figure of £17,000.  The decision of the courts was that the fixed assets of the company were worth approximately £17,000 and to that order that company readily submitted.  That company then sold itself to a new company and the new company emerged with a capital of £150,000.  In the interval between the writing down of the capital to £17,000, and the floating of the new company which took over the fixed assets for £150,000, there was doubtless some machinery added to the equipment.</P>

      <P>Let me tell my story and the Minister can then give his version. He has been the champion of these rogues for the last ten years.  He ought to be as loyal to them now as he has been in the past.  The sum of £20,000 was the sum for which the mill was capitalised, and that was written down to £17,000 three years previously.  Mark well what is going to happen.  The shareholders of the old concern received three new shares in the new company for every one they held in the old company. This company is going to be invited to appropriate so much of that subsidy as will give them 6 per cent. on their new issued capital of £150,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the reverse of what I said.  I made no reference to issued capital.  On the contrary, if the Deputy knew anything about the subject he would know that in the case of the flour-milling industry there is a considerable difference between the issued capital and the capital invested in the business.  It is on the capital invested in the business as ascertained that the calculation is made.</P>

      <P>It is going to have a statutory right to collect profits of £9,000 a year which represent approximately 55 per cent. of the original capital of the company.  They are to <Col N="645" /> be allowed to do that after they have employed high-power accountants to build up their depreciation, their overhead costs, and all the other charges that skilled accountants can incorporate in a profit and loss account in order to make the profits look less than they are.  We are asked to provide public money to maintain the price of the sixpenny loaf in order to secure that this transaction will continue unhindered. Never will it so long as I am in this House.

That is true of Ireland now, but so long as there are a few of us who can gather 8,000 votes, 8,000 bits of paper, they will not govern it in peace, because so long as they attempt to wrap their tentacles around the bodies of our people there will be a few individuals left in this country to expose them and to reveal the measure of their iniquity and of their unscrupulousness and to remind them day after day&mdash;no matter how little publicity these revelations may get&mdash;of the iniquities and cruel injustices they are doing to the people on whom they are living.</P>

    <P>That disposes of one company&mdash;one company which had the impertinence, on the occasion of this £150,000 flotation, to announce on the face of the offer for sale, that the secretary of the company had hoped to get £1,400 a year but that it had been decided in the offer for sale that he&mdash;the secretary of the company, not the general manager&mdash;who was secretary and a director, would have £1,200 a year as a condition of the flotation&mdash;and, so far as I am aware up to this day, he enjoys it.  I know men who are under-secretaries of State here and they never got that salary.  But the poor fools who subscribed to the capital of the company, and the unfortunate consumers of flour here and the legislators of Dáil Eireann, are going to contribute now to a system under which the <Col N="646" /> secretary of that company is guaranteed £1,200 a year, whatever the future of the country may be.  That is one company in respect of which there is a guarantee of 6 per cent.  Let us see the next.</P>
    <P>I remember the time when the people used to be told&mdash;&ldquo;that a Young Lochinvar is come out of the west&rdquo;&mdash; that Seán Lemass, the new Minister for Industry and Commerce, was to render Irish Industry independent of all external control, and the first firm down on his list for destruction was Joseph Rank of Liverpool.  What is the position to-day?  Who owns the flour-milling industry of this country? Who wrote the terms of that subsidy proposal?  Joseph Rank of Liverpool&mdash; the firm which was going to be chased out of this country.  Within three years of Fianna Fáil coming into office.

Shortly after this Government came into existence, Joseph Rank of Liverpool proceeded to sell that baby&mdash;with the co-operation of the Industrial Credit Corporation, I believe&mdash;to the Irish people.  The combined capital of the three firms in the amalgamation was £350,000.  What was the flotation to the Irish people? £700,000 was the nominal capital, the issued capital was £350,000 in 6 per cent. cumulative preference shares, to be purchased by the Irish people at 25/- a share and £350,000 in 5/- ordinary shares.  Eighty-eight per cent.&mdash; or over 85 per cent., perhaps I had better say&mdash;Joseph Rank of Liverpool retained in his possession, and the balance was sold to the Irish people at 15/- a share with an encouraging announcement in the prospectus that they might buy them safely, as he looked forward to having 39 per cent. available for distribution on the ordinary <Col N="647" /> shares after the preference dividends had been paid and all ordinary charges had been discharged.</P>
      <P>On the property, which was worth £350,000 before he floated it and now has a share capital of £700,000, of which 85 per cent. of the ordinary part of it is retained by Joseph Rank of Liverpool, we are now providing subsidies and benedictions in order to enable him to extend that strangle-hold on the milling industry.  Not only has Joseph Rank of Liverpool acquired complete and dominating control and virtual ownership, by his 85 per cent. holding in Joseph Rank Ltd. of Limerick, of all the Limerick mills, but he has also 50 per cent., or thereabouts, interest in the Cork Milling Company, so from the Shannon to the Lee the milling industry is virtually in the hollow of the hand of Joseph Rank.</P>
      <P>And that is not all.  If you follow the milling industry up to the palatial headquarters in Nassau Street, you will find the Irish Flour Millers' Federation with interlocking committees, and in the key position on each of these committees you will find some of the ablest men in this island.  They have been brought over from England by Joseph Rank and are being paid the salaries they earn and are worth them as watch dogs for Joseph Rank at every strategic position in the flour-milling organisation of this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I desire, once and for all, to counter what appears to me to be the hypocritical fraud of the Minister when he pretends to wax indignant about anyone referring to public-spirited gentlemen who come forward to assist him in forming independent bodies like Grain Importers, Limited and Irish Shipping, Limited.  The fact is that these gentlemen, many of whom are highly honourable men, formed these companies because the Minister induced them to form them&mdash;not, as they think, so that they may help him to do the work he has to do but, in fact, and perhaps unknown to them, in order to deliver the Minister from the necessity to answer for that part of his work here in Dáil Eireann.  If he can get a group of men to form Irish Shipping, Limited, <Col N="648" /> he is delivered from the necessity to answer to this House for the disposition of the moneys which this House provides for that company: if he can establish Grain Importers, Limited, as an independent company, then he can simply disown all further responsibility for what that particular body requires to do.</P>
    <P>I do not accept that view and I will suggest to this House that we ought to concern ourselves very intimately with every fact of the flour-milling industry and, having done so, to make up our minds that the time has passed when people should be asked to provide £2,000,000 a year as subsidy to that institution; and if its survival can only be purchased by public money, the time has come for this House to operate that company as they did the industry now controlled by the Electricity Supply Board.  That should be done, and done without further delay.  The Minister says to-day that the necessity for this subsidy arises from these two items&mdash;one, to preserve the millers' profits of 6 per cent., and, two, to enable the millers to pay the increased cost of importing foreign wheat.  Later, he told Deputy Belton that some of the foreign wheat was costing 15/- and that some of it could be got for nothing, that the great bulk of its cost was the freight charge for carrying it to this island.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister will agree with me that we look forward in future to carrying the bulk of the wheat that comes to this country direct in Irish bottoms recently purchased by Irish Shipping, Limited.  I strongly object to the taxpayers and bread consumers being required to provide a subsidy to permit of a price being paid for wheat used in our bread sufficient to amortise in four trips the entire purchase price of the hopeless hulks that have been bought by Irish Shipping, Limited, in different parts of the world.  Now, I know nothing of the qualifications of those concerned; I know nothing personally of any of the gentlemen associated with Irish Shipping, Limited; I am not concerned to suggest that they are in any sense <i>mala fide</i>&mdash;I am sure they are not.  But that does not mean that because they <Col N="649" /> are respectable men and because they have joined the board of this company, that every man must shut his mouth and never utter a word of criticism of what they do on the Minister's behalf, or of what the Minister makes them do, whether they think it wise or unwise.  I am sure some of the men in Irish Shipping, Limited, are men of the highest character and integrity, but, whoever they are, I say that the ships they have purchased are not value for the money, that they have been improvidently acquired.</P>

I submit that the Minister is trying to withhold from us the information we ought to have.  My submission is that if the Minister's estimates for freight on this wheat are correct, the freight charge is out of all proportion to what should be charged.  I want to know why are the bread consumers to be mulcted in prices and freight charges of this kind by a shipping company over which this House is supposed to have control? That requires explanation.  My submission is that the reason for that is that the ships are unfit to put to sea and are very much more expensive than the purchase price would suggest, and it is the cost in which these ships are going to involve the State that is responsible for the freight the wheat is going to bear and for which this subsidy is provided, in part, to pay. Those are the facts relating to this situation and I am putting it to the House that, with those facts in our possession, we ought not to allow this thing to go forward.</P>

Are Deputies not entitled to ask: &ldquo;Why do you want money from the public purse and the flour consumers to pay such freight rates?&rdquo; Is the Minister entitled to reply: &ldquo;We will not discuss that; I am not responsible for the freight rates&rdquo;?  If he is not responsible, who is?  Does he claim that these freight rates are not to be discussed here, when the House is being asked to pay for them?  I say they require not only to be discussed, but closely investigated.  I want the whole question of the freight burden on wheat to be examined closely and in detail by the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the Minister's interpretation of my words.  It would be most disorderly if I were to make that statement.  Somebody arranged the freight rates.  I want to know who, and why, before we pay.  Whatever mystery there may be about the freight <Col N="652" /> rates, there is no mystery about the profits that the flour mills have been making out of our people for the last ten years, and there is no mystery about the fact that the flour millers are to get 6 per cent. on the inflated capital which several of these mills have planned off on the Irish people, and a substantial portion of the subsidy is designed in order to ensure that that will be paid.</P>
      <P>The subsidy now amounts to approximately one-quarter of the milling industry's entire turnover in this country.  In that situation I say the time has come to do as they have done in Great Britain, and that is to take over the whole milling industry, at least for the period of the emergency, and operate it for the benefit of the Irish people.  There was no subsidy paid in Great Britain until the British Government had control of the milling industry for the benefit of the English people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Indeed they have.  The position here is that the Minister does not seem to know who owns a mill.  He does not know where Spillers are milling&mdash;Ranks he cannot disguise.  Many Deputies may not know that Spillers have a mill in this country.  I invite Deputies to apply their minds to the solution of the conundrum: Where is Spillers in Eire?  It will be as good as a crossword puzzle to them over the week-end.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not a secret.  It is necessary from time to time for Spillers to turn out flour with a round tower and a greyhound, a green flag and the shamrock&mdash;they appear in the guise of Cathleen Ní Houlihan.  The flour comes out of a very Gaelic mill&mdash; Spillers, in this country&mdash;all Gaels and all devoted servants of the Irish Republic.  I think the time has come to dispose of Spillers, the Gaels and <Col N="653" /> Rank at one blow, and substitute the plain, dull, unvarnished Irish people. They are the people who have to eat the bread and pay the piper.  They should get from now on whatever profits are going.</P>
      <P>The way I would like to see the profits distributed is on the same principle as that adopted by the Electricity Supply Board.  Those who use the bread should get the advantage of whatever profit may be made.  The unfortunate bread consumers in this country have been paying subsidies to the millionaires long enough.  It is time now that the millionaires would give some of that back to the consumers. When the time for taking those places over comes&mdash;and I think now is the time&mdash;it should be done on terms of justice and equity.</P>

      <P>I will tell you, and this is mighty important.  Remember that something happened in this country between the day when the Dock Milling Company was worth £17,000 and the day we woke up to discover it had increased in value to £150,000.  Something happened between the time when Joseph Rank's was worth £350,000 and the day it suddenly blossomed out into being worth nearly £1,000,000. Something had been added, something about a little tariff on flour, a prohibition upon imports of flour.  Before we proceed to value the assets of these millers let that tariff come off, and let us value these mills, not unjustly, not in a spirit of revenge, but let them get the full value of their tangible assets in this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I do not want any Emergency Power or Order.  I would much prefer if it could be done by arrangement.  I would much prefer if we had a proposal by arrangement to pay even £2,000,000 to buy them out, if that was the amount of their tangible assets here, but not to buy back from the millers the tariff and the monopoly that the Fianna Fáil Government gave them.  Eighty per cent. of the millers' wealth to-day is the monopoly that that Government gave them for nothing. Eighty per cent. of the millers' wealth to-day is the licence that they have from the Irish Government to plunder the Irish people.  I would never buy that back from them and I would never wish to see Dáil Eireann buy it back from them.  I would wish to see Dáil Eireann go out and take that back from them, and then I would pay them for their tangible assets in this country and would pay them a fair price for them.  I would pay them no mean, stingy or revengeful price, but the price that a fair arbitrator would fix between us and them as the value of the tangible assets which belong to them here, and I think that that should be done now.</P>
      <P>Is there a Deputy in this House, except the Minister, who is their spokesman and champion in this House for the last ten years, who will get up and maintain that this plundering monopoly should be further buttressed up with £2,000,000 of public money?  Is there a Deputy from rural Ireland in this House who will get up and champion the millers here before this House, or are they all so cowardly that they sit in silence here and growl their discontent in dark corners of their own constituencies?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not believe in giving them that, and I believe that this House should put an end to it now. The Minister said to-day that foreign wheat, he anticipated, would cost 120/- a quarter&mdash;that would be 70/- a barrel &mdash;in the coming year.  Surely, wheat imported direct from America to this country is not going to cost 120/- a quarter c.i.f. Dublin?  I have heard that quoted in connection with wheat transhipped from Lisbon to Dublin, but unless we are mad, we are not going to allow that in connection with wheat imported direct from American ports to Dublin.  If the Minister has consented to any such charge, then there is a matter requiring the most careful investigation.  Obviously, freight rates of that character are not designed to pay any reasonable insurance rates or expenses.  What is designed to be done with the immense fund which these freight rates will create in Irish Shipping Limited?  It must ultimately be used for some purpose, and this House has a right to know what that purpose is going to be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, some people in this House may imagine that the Irish flour millers have reformed, that they have changed their habits.  I want to direct the attention of this House to one of the slickest and meanest tricks that the Irish Four Milling Association has only just recently perpetrated.  They have induced the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Minister for Supplies to come in here and tell us that the price of flour is being kept down to 52/6 a sack.  The Minister may not know this, but that statement is not true, and the person who furnished the Minister with that information misled him.  The price of flour is not being kept down to 52/6.  It is being increased by 1/3 per sack, which money is going into the flour millers' pockets, and which amounts in 12 months to £150,000 which the Irish flour millers are collecting from the <Col N="656" /> consumers of this country.  Prior to the Sack Order, made by the Minister for Supplies about a month ago, every cwt. of flour came through the merchant to the consumer in a bag.  That bag was worth 6d. to the man who emptied it, whether he was a shopkeeper or a householder.  A month ago, the millers blandly announced that there were no more bags, that the householder would have to pay 5/- on his bag, and that he would only get the 5/- back for his bag when he returned it to the flour merchant in a perfect condition.  But if a mouse ate a hole in it, if a nail tore it, or if the wheel of the cart dirtied it, he would get nothing; so that instead of getting a bag, worth at least 6d., thrown in with his flour, he now finds that he has to deposit 5/- over and above the price of his flour and does not get it back until he returns the bag in good condition.  That humble bag represents £150,000 per annum on the price of flour consumed in this country, and the Minister says that it is not worth talking about, that it is irrelevant and that he is not interested.  I do not expect him to be interested because he does not understand, but he should not let these people pull the wool over his eyes in that way, and the millers need never hope, so long as there are Deputies from rural Ireland in this House, that they will be allowed to pull that kind of fraud on Dáil Eireann.  They may have the satisfaction of getting away with their ill-gotten £150,000, but at least they will be exposed with the swag as they get off with it.  The Minister should be ashamed to let them put that over on him and to attempt to let them put it over on our people.</P>
    <P>The sum of £1,900,000 per annum is going to be handed over to these gentlemen.  Is it conceivably possible that Dáil Eireann will stand for that? £1,900,000, 25 per cent. of their total turnover, is going to be given them as a present from the taxpayers and bread consumers of this country.  Is it conceivable that this House has sunk so low, has become so supine and slavish, that it will allow an organisation dominated by the English flour-miller dictator, Joseph Rank, Limited, to get <Col N="657" /> away with that?  I find it hard to believe.  I cannot believe that this Parliament will allow an industrialist to come in here and play the part of Undershaft, to run Ireland because he has got money.  I still believe that there is no man rich enough to buy this country.  I still believe that so long as our people have the right to use votes on polling day there is no fortune great enough to dominate Parliament in this country.  That is the attempt that is being made here now, and it is for Parliament to determine whether it or Joseph Rank Ltd. is the biggest power in this country.  I say the time has come to demonstrate to that combine that this Parliament is the biggest power in this country, and will brook no rival, however rich or however influential.  The only way to establish that fact now is to tell them that this was done once too often, and that, in future, the flour milling industry of this country is going to be run in the interests of no Undershaft but in the interests of the Irish people and the Irish people alone.  If you do not take the chance of doing that now, I warn you that the whole position will be so rigged that it will be a brave man or a brave Parliament that will undertake to do it later on.  It is now being made as difficult as it is possible to make it for any power in this country to challenge the vested interests of Joseph Rank, Ltd.  I say deliberately that at this hour an attempt is being made to complete the ascendancy of the Rank interests in the flour milling industry of this country.  Consciously or unconsciously, I believe that the Minister for Supplies and Industry and Commerce is helping in that enterprise.  I am telling this House, as I have often warned them of impending evils before, that if they do not grasp this nettle now they may find it a most formidable task to deal adequately with it in two or three years' time.</P>
    <P>Remember, a man who is not a citizen of your State, and who controls your bread supply, is a dangerous antagonist. Remember that he will never face you openly and above board.  His pressure is subterranean and devious, but it gets stronger and stronger as his monopoly becomes more firmly entrenched. <Col N="658" /> Remember this, that, acting together, there is no power equal to us, but money has corrupted and corroded the public life of many countries in this world, and Irish money is no different from any other money.  The love of it is the root of all evil, and there was never a great vested interest which did not know that and exploited that knowledge to the full.  Now is the time to meet money with votes, and demonstrate that, Bernard Shaw and Undershaft notwithstanding, no matter how powerful money is, little bits of paper&mdash;so long as free men have the right to make their marks upon them&mdash; are more powerful still, and that there are men in this country, fortified by such little bits of paper, who are a match and more than a match for the richest adventurer in this world, whencever he may come.  That is the part of this business that I feel most about, but there are two other details to which I wish to refer.  I take it that, for everyone's convenience, it is better that we should dispose of F and G together?  The Minister himself dealt with them that way.</P>

      <P>If that meets with the Chair's approval, I think we should take the two together.  I think the Minister said that he made exhaustive inquiries into the allegations regarding shortage of flour in certain areas, and that he was aware that difficulties had arisen along the Border.  So far, I do not think the Minister's efforts to correct the shortages along the Border have been very successful.  Complaints have reached me, and I have sent them on to his Department.  I am bound to say&mdash;I am glad to say it in public and I am glad to say it in the presence of the people of Monaghan&mdash;that so far as the Minister's Department could facilitate me in correcting the shortage of flour in Monaghan they showed themselves ready and willing and anxious to do whatever they could.  But, in doing whatever they could, it did not <Col N="659" /> seem to me that the flour was finding its way into the houses where the flour shortage was, and I will tell you the reason.  The kernel of the flour shortage problem along the Border was that the individual farmer was smuggling flour.  There were individual farmer householders along the Border who were themselves going across the Border, dealing with flour merchants in Northern Ireland, and bringing back the individual bag of flour.  That broke their contract with the flour purveyors in the area where they live.  You might send out more flour to those purveyors, but, when those individual farmers who had been smuggling for themselves went in to get a bag of flour, the shopkeeper said: &ldquo;I have not seen you in the last two years,&rdquo; and the man found he had no claim upon the shopkeeper.  The shopkeeper kept the flour for his own regular customers. They were very glad to get it, but the very individuals for whom special provision was made were very little better off than they have been heretofore.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to under-estimate the difficulty of the Minister in grappling with this particular problem.  The suggestion I put to him was that he should provide, in the electoral areas adjoining the Border, that persons with tea and sugar cards would be entitled to go and demand as of right from the merchants with whom they were registered five pounds of flour per week in respect of each person registered on their tea card, and that the merchant would have the right to bespeak from a miller indicated by the Minister a corresponding quantity of flour to meet those special customers over and above that which he was at present getting.  I think that would get over the difficulty, for the time being, in any case, until some permanent plan has been devised for the equitable distribution of flour all over the country. There is no use in saying to an unfortunate woman with eight or nine children that there is flour going into the area, because she simply says: &ldquo;Wherever it is going, I cannot get it,&rdquo; and she has no means of demanding it as of right.  If the Minister would say to her: &ldquo;Register with somebody <Col N="660" /> in the electoral area of Tydavnet&rdquo;&mdash; because that is one of the bad areas&mdash;&ldquo;and go to that man every Saturday and get 5 lbs. of flour for every person on your tea card,&rdquo; that person's record as a retail distributor of tea could be turned up, and he could be sent down, from a mill of the Minister's choosing, 5 lbs. of flour for each person on the tea cards which he sent in.  That is one way of dealing with it. I do not say it is the best way, but at least it will cure the evil which exists in that area.  If the Minister knows a better way of curing it, I am not particularly wedded to my plan.</P>
    <P>In regard to other areas, it is a complete illusion to imagine that there is no acute shortage of flour in certain areas in other parts of the country.  I sent a memorandum to the Minister on the question.  What has happened is this: In certain country areas you had what is called the travelling shop. Now, the travelling shop, when it was a motor lorry, went as far as 30 miles from the town in which its headquarters were located.  There was a variety of travelling shops in rural Ireland which would start out from the town in which their headquarters were located, drop bags of flour to customers along the road, and try to end up the trip at a flour mill.  Having sold the outgoing load of flour, they would take on a load at the flour mill and try to sell that load on their way home.  A great many people objected to that trade, and said it was ruining the towns.  I do not suppose it was doing the towns much good, but I could not find it in my heart to object to it; it was enterprising, and gave the country people an amenity which they had not hitherto enjoyed.  But, the minute the petrol shortage came, the lorry could not function.  Now, notice the snag. The merchant's quota of flour was based on the quantity of flour he had purchased in the previous year when he was distributing flour over a 30-mile radius.  With the lorry gone, he was only distributing round the town in which he lived, although he had got flour appropriate to a distribution over a 30-mile radius.  What happened?  The people in the far end of his 30-mile radius started going into the towns nearest to their homes, and found <Col N="661" /> themselves confronted by the fact that the shop whose business had been injured by the travelling shop last year was getting a proportionately reduced supply.  The shopkeeper was getting only 80 per cent. of the flour supply for his regular customers, and he was now besieged by a whole crowd of strangers who wanted to get a quantity of flour over and above that which he was entitled to get for his own customers.  In these circumstances, I do not think the Minister has taken any measures at all to correct the situation.</P>
    <P>I admit that if I were confronted with that problem, I would find myself in a considerable difficulty, too, because suppose the Minister said to the shopkeeper in the town where these strangers were coming in for supplies: &ldquo;I will give you flour to supply these people,&rdquo; from whom would he deduct it?  How would he know what travelling shop he could deduct the flour from?  Furthermore, suppose he does send extra supplies to the shopkeepers in that particular town, how can he be sure that it will reach these strangers, or that some shopkeepers will not try to enhance their reputation by giving their regular customers an extra supply?  That is why I come back to the thesis that the Minister should ration flour.  No doubt, as the Minister has often urged, there is a disparity in the consumption of flour as between the well-to-do and the poorer sections of the community, but the present situation is that the well-to-do never suffer from a scarcity of flour.  I never saw a man with plenty of cash in his pocket who could not get a stone of flour when he wanted it.  It is the poor person, who has to get &ldquo;strap&rdquo; or credit, that suffers.  There is no welcome for him in any shop where he is not well known and he finds himself unable to get flour from his regular merchant because the well-to-do fellow has been making a tour of the town, taking up a stone here and a stone there, and he has his little girl waiting for him at the end of the town with a bag into which he empties each stone or half-stone as he gets it.  Perhaps his wife will be doing one side of the street while he is doing the other, and his son will be at the far end of the town, collecting <Col N="662" /> the bits and scraps for which they are in a position to pay cash.</P>
    <P>Did the Minister ever get a complaint from a well-to-do-person that he could not get flour?  I am standing behind my counter in Ballaghaderreen and I never got a complaint from a well-to-do person that he could not get flour.  The people who do come to me and who give me sleepless nights are the poor, the people with six or seven children, who have no flour in their houses.  The poor come and tell the most pitiful stories of their circumstances which have been made more distressing still since the shortage of oatmeal arose.  It is for that reason that I suggest to the Minister that he should consider establishing a rationing system for flour in the conviction that the fact that he gave everybody the right to buy five pounds of flour would not induce the well-to-do person, who did not want flour, to go and buy it with the result that the poor person would certainly be sure of his full five pounds of flour from week to week.  The tendency would be for small surpluses to accumulate here and there, where the well-to-do people were not taking the full quantity which they were entitled to receive.  The Minister could say: &ldquo;I do not care what anybody does with that extra flour so long as everybody who has a ration card gets his five pounds.  If merchants have a surplus they can sell it to those who want more.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>At first glance this might appear to invite profiteering in what I might call the &ldquo;free&rdquo; flour, but competition will regulate that.  If there is &ldquo;free&rdquo; flour knocking about, no shopkeeper would dare to attempt to profiteer lest his neighbour would not do the same thing.  At any rate, once a person receives a ration of a commodity like flour, people are not going to pay fancy prices for any additional quantity they purchase.  I agree that a full and elaborate system of rationing, a national system, might be very expensive to administer, but what is the objection to saying that every shop where tea is sold must be prepared to supply those who deal with them with flour if they desire to obtain their <Col N="663" /> supplies there?  Is that an insuperable difficulty?  Surely to goodness, merchants are prepared to help to that extent and to act as distributors of flour if it is necessary in order to secure supplies for the poor.  It is a simple matter to provide that if five or six people are registered for tea with a merchant, that merchant would be entitled to receive 30 lbs. of flour for distribution to these same people. The Minister could issue ration books and the books could be distributed by the merchants to their customers. When the coupons were returned to the Minister by the merchant, the Minister could issue an authorisation to the miller to supply the appropriate quantity of flour for the succeeding week.  I know of no other way in which the Minister can deal satisfactorily with this matter.</P>

When you are about to embark on something, prudent counsel raises 1,000 objections. There are 1,000 objections to doing anything&mdash;there always are.

All I say is that, dealing with people from day to day and seeing the woman with the long family who can get no flour, any plan which will give her five lbs. of flour per week for her family is better than no plan. I only hope the Minister will work out something that is more efficient than the one I have suggested.  The Minister says that everybody comes in here and accuses him, but nobody makes a constructive suggestion.  I am making a suggestion, based on my own experience in the kind of trade with which I am familiar.  It is, at least, a suggestion and I await a better one from the Minister.  I will challenge a division on this, and I invite Deputies who want to perpetuate the cruellest monopoly that was ever established in Ireland, to go into the Lobby against me, because the day they do it they are presenting £2,000,000 to an organisation which believes that this country can be ruled with money&mdash;the votes of our people notwithstanding.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is interesting to find Deputy Dillon advocating what the Labour Party advocated long before <Col N="666" /> 1932.  He talks about the flour mills being run on somewhat similar lines to the Electricity Supply Board and we had the Minister asking how is it to be done.  The Minister will remember that in 1932 he had a proposal from the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union that these mills should be run by the State for the common good and that he told them he would consider it favourably.  I resent the attitude of the Minister in supporting the millers and his references to Grain Importers, Limited.  Somebody said that the directors of Grain Importers, Limited, were also the directors of the flour-milling industry and his reply to that was that these men have given better service to the country than any narrow-minded Deputy.  I deny that. I object to anybody saying that any director of Grain Importers' Limited, or the flour-milling industry has given better service than any Deputy.  When one man is drawing £7,000 per year out of a milling company and three members of one family, who had 18,000 shares in a company before it was floated as a new company, have now between them 54,000 shares in that company, I refuse to accept the statement of the Minister that these men are doing better service for the country than any narrow-minded Deputy.  I say again, and I defy contradiction, that the men whom the Minister is trying to justify here and who are directors of Grain Importers, Limited, and of the milling companies are simply doing their own business.  Why should they look for any salary or remuneration for that work?  If they were never connected with Grain Importers, Limited, they would have to do the work they are doing now.  This subsidy and the money got from the flour of 95 per cent. extraction are going into the hands of those whom the Minister talks about&mdash;the millers and Grain Importers, Limited.</P>

We have not got sufficient evidence to show that we are justified in giving this £2,000,000 to the millers.  I maintain that it is wrong to try to convey to this House that Grain Importers, Limited, shipping boards, Timber Importers, Limited, or Fuel Importers, Limited, are giving services to the country without any remuneration.  They are doing their own business and are well paid for it, and I object to the Minister saying that any Deputy has not rendered as good service to the community as Grain Importers, Limited.</P>

      <NameTxt>Colonel Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to this Vote, I have sympathy with the Minister, but I do not accept all that he has said at its face value.  There is something about this proposal to subsidise flour in order to give a cheap loaf which will make the people of the country think.  Two million pounds is a very large sum of money.  The real reason for this subsidy is because the farmers had to get an extra price for their wheat.  The Minister has stressed very strongly the question of the cost of production.  He said that if the cost of production were to rise they would not give a greater subsidy than £2,000,000; that it would have to go on to the price of the loaf.  Two million pounds divided over the amount of wheat grown in this country would mean a subsidy of about £5 per acre, which is equivalent to the price of 2½ barrels of wheat, and, on the average, you have not got ten barrels of wheat per acre.  Therefore, while the Minister may be right, I cannot at all accept his theory in this matter; nor can I accept his figures, because I feel that, if there is £2,000,000 being spent to subsidise a cheap loaf, the ordinary people of the country are not getting it; that somebody else must be getting the benefit of most of that £2,000,000. As things stand in this country at present, the Minister for Supplies enters into everything.  The Minister <Col N="668" /> has to work in with the Minister for Agriculture and the other Ministers and he is, to a great extent, responsible for seeing that people will be dealt with fairly.  Deputy Dillon said to the Deputies opposite that those things were not being done in a fair way, and I think he was appealing for some system of national registration whereby there would be some hope of an equal share for everybody.  Since the Department of Supplies was set up there is anything but an equal share for everybody.  There is nothing but confusion.  If you travel to every little village from Donegal to Cork you may find an over-supply in one village and in another village there will be nothing.  That disparity obtains through the whole country, from north to south, not in regard to one commodity but in regard to everything.  There has been absolute confusion with regard to flour.  It is extraordinary that since the wheat was brought in, threshed and milled, that confusion has appeared tenfold to the ordinary public.</P>
      <P>The same thing applies with regard to sugar.  We were told in this House several times that we had nearly enough sugar last year but that this year we would have plenty of sugar for the whole population.  There was never such confusion created throughout the country.  The Minister has told us that if we report to the Department of Supplies that people are not getting 80 per cent. of what they got last year, or 1 lb. per head for every consumer, the matter would be remedied.  No matter what we report, the question is becoming more confused and more troublesome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister referred to-night to a maximum price for flour, and I think he inferred that the Gárda might take up the matter to see no higher price was charged and that the price would be displayed in the shops.  I would suggest to the Minister that in all cases, instead of issuing orders through the radio or announcing them in this House, he should see that his orders are in some way made effective.  We have heard on the radio and we have heard here that all prices are to be <Col N="669" /> posted up publicly in shops.  I say here that not one price for anything the Minister controlled was ever posted up in a shop, and nobody took any notice.  Who was to take notice? Surely the Minister does not think that the ordinary public are going to say to the shopkeeper: &ldquo;Why have you not got your prices up?&rdquo;  There are Guards and investigation officers to do this work.  There is the Local Security Force, which has been used for other purposes, for collecting the census, for turf and all that.</P>
    <P>Why should not the Minister make sure that every order he makes in connection with supplies is carried out?  If he wants to have the people, whom he pretends to be troubled about, supplied, why should he not see that the law is enforced by all the other Departments of State, whether the Department of Justice or the Department of Finance or any other Department? He has never made any effort to do that.  I suggest that when the Minister for Supplies makes an order, he should see that it is carried out.  He should not wait for me or for the Deputies on his own side of the House or for the public to report to him any offences in connection with that order.  I suggest that he should act in conjunction with the other Departments of State and should see that each Department does its duty in the matter of having these orders carried out.  I refer especially to the order about displaying prices in shops.  I have not seen any prices displayed in any shop.  Yet we have an Emergency Order to the effect that the prices must be displayed and that it is an offence not to have them displayed.</P>
    <P>One thing that the Department of Supplies and the Government as a whole might consider is that those who produce the stuff in this country should get a reasonable price and that those who are buying it should get it at the price which the Minister fixes.  There is very little use in putting something on paper or stating it in this House or on the radio, and trying to pretend that we want to save the poor people from being mulcted or plundered, if we do not make that impracticable.  The Minister for Supplies has been all the <Col N="670" /> time working on theory without trying to put that theory in practice.  Every one in this House can work something out on paper but to put it into practice would be a different thing.  It should not be difficult for a Government Department to put into practice what they want done.  Each Department of State is in touch with all the other Departments and they can cooperate in carrying out the work that is to be done.  My great complaint against the Department of Supplies is that they have not been trying to do that.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Dillon that there is no hope for the poor people of this country, for the ordinary decent people of this country, until there is some kind of national register, and until everyone is put on the same level.  There should not be much difficulty about having a national register.  Even in 1918 or 1917 the British Government had not much trouble in introducing a national register for the things they wanted rationed and they got it working in this country.  It is suggested that it is impossible here, that if we divide sugar, somebody will get too much, and others will not get enough.  It is better that everybody should get something, even though it may happen that some people may get less than they require.  It is better that all should get an equal share than that some should get none while others get too much.</P>

      <P>There is one aspect of this subsidy question to which I would like to draw attention.  With all the ramifications of the milling trade one finds it difficult to discover wherein lie the possibilities for preventing increase in prices, but one thing that strikes me about the subsidy is that we are subsidising the millers on the basis of home-grown wheat purchased at £2 a barrel, converted into flour.  In the part of the world where I live, East Limerick, not one in ten of the farmers who grew wheat this year has got £2 a barrel.  In fact, the majority got something nearer 35/- a barrel.  I am one of those who predicted years ago that in East Limerick we could not grow the world's best wheat, and we do not one year out of three, but we <Col N="671" /> are growing the best we can.  It was a standing crop.  It did not fall.  We send it to Ranks or some other miller sends his lorry for it and takes it away.  Three days later we get a letter saying: &ldquo;We regret to say that your wheat bushels badly and we return a price of 35/-.&rdquo;  That happened in the majority of cases.  In some cases the price was 1/- or 2/- more.  In a good many cases it was considerably less.  I would be ashamed to say how much less.  In fact, wheat was bought that I thought no miller would purchase. It is going to be converted into something, either mixed up with the bread that the unfortunate people of this country have to eat or used for some other purpose, but whatever purpose it is bought for, it is not going to be sold at 1/9 a stone and the majority of the wheat that is purchased in one part of my county is being converted into flour and is being purchased at a price much less than £2 a barrel.</P>
      <P>This subsidy is based&mdash;I shall be corrected if I am wrong&mdash;on a cost to the millers of home grown wheat of £2 per barrel.  I do not know what occurred in other counties this year, but not in one case in ten has a farmer in East Limerick got £2 per barrel for his wheat.  There are possibilities there for the millers to enhance their profits without the benefit of this subsidy.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dillon pleaded for national control and I believe the time has come when we should have it.  There are so many possibilities for deluding the public, the Minister and the Department in the ramifications of the flour and milling trade, that whatever chances there are&mdash;and there are many &mdash;of making excess profits ought to be put into the hands of the people.  That is one of the matters in which there lies a distinct possibility of defrauding the public, because I think the Minister himself is satisfied that the millers this year are coming to ask him to base his subsidy on wheat bought at £2 per barrel.  The Minister is subsidising the millers on the basis of wheat purchased at £2 per barrel.  I say that they are not paying £2 per barrel for it this year, in my county, anyway.</P>

      <P>I am surprised to hear members advocating the nationalisation of flour milling.  I certainly do not.  We want no more inspectors, and no more Government control of anything, and if this motion to reduce the Vote is backed by national control, I propose to vote against it.  I am sure that those who have spoken here in support of national control do not really believe in it.  I do not believe, and never did believe, in control by the millers.  At a public meeting held in the Mansion House to support the demand for the milling arrangement we now have, I opposed it, and the majority of the meeting would have done so also, if they had got the opportunity of voting against the arrangement. It was there suggested, although never put to a vote, that the flour milled in this country should have a percentage of Irish wheat in it.  If that were ensured, there would be no need for any millers' control or any millers' monopoly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to draw the Minister's attention to certain aspects of the figures <Col N="673" /> he has given us, and to what they reveal. In the current year he expects to get 290,000 tons of home-grown wheat, and he built his case to-night on getting that amount of wheat from the current Irish crop at £2 per barrel. Foreign wheat imported&mdash;I hope this will not be censored and that the farmers of the country will be told about it&mdash;was purchased from the American and Canadian farmers at 84/- a barrel.  When I put down a motion here for a price of 50/- for this year's crop, I only got eight Deputies to support it, and every member of the Government voted against it.  But they gave 84/- a barrel to foreign farmers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>No.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said he got it from them at 15/-, but, of course, world war conditions have made the wheat crop a drug on the markets of the wheat-growing countries.  You could make roads and paths with it there, but to get it here cost 84/-, and we would not get 50/- for growing it here, and only eight members of the House voted for the proposed price of 50/-.  As I say, I hope that will not be censored, and that the country will be told it to-morrow.  I want the Minister to make a little calculation: 290,000 tons of home-grown wheat at £2 per barrel and 80,000 tons of foreign wheat at 84/- per barrel represent an average of 50/- per barrel.</P>
      <P>We had to put up with £2 per barrel. Deputy Bennett said that down in Limerick, where, as I learned from my geography, there is the best land in Ireland, the Golden vale, they were not able to bushel 60 lbs., and that no farmer in East Limerick got £2 per barrel on what is the best land in Ireland.  I do not know whether it is a case of the best land and the worst farmers or the worst land and the best farmers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I once heard Deputy Corry say that the farmers of Cork have to feed the farmers of Limerick, but I do not know how true it is.  I want the Minister to reflect on the fact that <Col N="674" /> the prices paid by the community of this country for their 370,000 tons of wheat average 50/- per barrel, according to the figures he has given himself.</P>
      <P>This is not the time to discuss a motion on the Order Paper in the names of Deputy Cogan and myself&mdash; the two Deputies who put down the motion for a price of 50/- last year&mdash; but that motion asks for £3 per barrel for wheat and, when it comes to be discussed, we shall see who will vote for it and who will vote against it.  We shall see whether the people who are producing are going to be encouraged to continue producing, and it must be remembered that once the wheat is produced in this country, you are sure of having it.  It will not be necessary to take the risks of 2,000 or 3,000 miles of sea voyage, and we shall be sure of a wheaten loaf.  I am satisfied that if the Minister gives a proper price&mdash;and by that I mean a price at which wheat can be produced, considering all the conditions surrounding agriculture at present, the absence of fertilisers, the shortage of farmyard manure due to the bungling of the cattle industry in relation to foot-and-mouth disease, and by all the mistakes of the Government by which the productivity of the soil of this country has been reduced&mdash;the crop will be grown.  If the Government want an adequate supply of wheat to give us either a 95 per cent. extraction or a 70 per cent. extraction, with a white loaf, it can be done, but the Minister must bear in mind the small yields we must expect because of lack of manure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dillon tried to ramble into a discussion of the hulks which were bought for importing the wheat.  This is not the time to start buying hulks when they have soared ten times beyond their value.  This is the time for us to produce in this country the food we want.  It is the only royal road, the only sure road, to safety.  I suggest to the Deputy who is now both Minister for Industry and Commerce and Minister for Supplies that in order to help the production of food here he should import fertilisers rather than wheat.  Every hundredweight of fertiliser that he can import will produce <Col N="675" /> a ton of food.  That would be the most economical use he could make of the boats that he has.  The fertilisers will cost less to import and will produce more food than he could possibly import in the ships available to him. I ask him to consider that aspect of the matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>What price will the Deputy pay for the fertilisers?  They cannot be got at less than £36 a ton.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>You cannot be said to be importing fertilisers unless you are able to import a balanced fertiliser, and if you cannot import potash, then you are not importing a balanced fertiliser. Even at £36 a ton, would it not be much cheaper and better to import fertilisers than wheat at 84/- a barrel?  I must compliment the Minister on his introductory statement in the course of which I put some questions to him.  He is proposing a subsidy of £80,000 for bread.  I can foresee terrible difficulty in administering that.  Why as I suggested earlier to him, not add that £80,000 to the flour? Even if some of it finds its way into other than batch bread, I think the saving on administration and the guarantee that it will get to the proper quarter will compensate for the little advantage that other than batch bread will get.  The Minister should also consider that there is a good deal of pastry cooking and a good deal of fancy-bread baking done in Dublin. What is he going to do with the confectioners who will be thrown out of employment?  The Minister is one of the representatives for the City of Dublin and should consider that the saving would be very little.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Because you are making the flour dearer by withdrawing the subsidy from them.  Can the Minister tell us if he has calculated the saving <Col N="676" /> that would be effected by excluding the bakers' subsidy from everything except batch bread?  Personally, I think it would be very small and would not be worth all the trouble it would cause.  The Minister told me earlier that all that had been considered, but the matter has struck me in the light that I have put it to him.  If the Minister has considered it and found that what he is suggesting is the best thing to do, I will leave it at that.  I would ask him, however, to make sure of his case.  From the rough and ready examination that I have been able to give it in the House, I do not think it is worth the trouble.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister's requirements of flour would appear to be 80 per cent. home-grown and 20 per cent. imported. What strikes me is that the Minister is probably aiming at 20 per cent. Manitoban wheat to mix with the home-grown wheat.  I admit it is good business, if he can get the 20 per cent. Maintoban wheat in here, to mix it with our own wheat, but the risk is so great that I think it would be better to bank on an all-Irish loaf.  I agree that we will have a better loaf with the 20 per cent.  Manitoban wheat and 80 per cent. Irish.  I am prepared to admit that at once, since I have some knowledge of the analysis of the milling qualities of both wheats and realise the necessity of maintaining a percentage of gluten in the grist.  The 20 per cent. Manitoban wheat will give us better gluten, and more of it, than a 100 per cent. Irish wheat.  But the times are risky and the battle of the Atlantic is still on.  I suggest to the Minister that, instead of laying his plans for 80 per cent. home-grown wheat and 20 per cent. foreign, he should lay his plans for 100 per cent. home-grown. In doing that he will have to reckon on an increased price for the following reasons: (1) we are short of fertilisers; (2) we will have to extend our area under wheat in the coming year; (3) although our land grew over 490,000 acres of wheat this year, you will not get an extra 190,000 acres to grow a good crop of wheat next year because of the absence of fertilisers. Therefore, we must be satisfied, from the facts of the case, that our productivity <Col N="677" /> will be less in the coming year, and in every succeeding year, as long as we are deprived of fertilisers.  Hence, to produce a greater amount of wheat we must have a wider area under the crop.</P>
    <P>Not only must we look for a wider area to produce a greater quantity of wheat than we produced this year, but if we are to go in for a 100 per cent. Irish loaf, we must rely on getting this greater production from land that will not be as well manured&mdash;there is no possibility of fertilising it&mdash;as the land on which we grew the crop this year. It is inevitable, therefore, that even with the best of a wheat season we will have to bank on a smaller crop, and the ploughing, sowing, reaping and threshing of the lighter crop will cost us as much as a large one.  Therefore, we will have to go in on second-rate land&mdash;land that will not be as suitable for wheat as the land that we have been growing the crop on.  All this combines to make it inevitable that we are going to have a smaller yield.  The only way that the smaller yield can be economically produced is by increasing the price of wheat to the producer.  I accept the Minister's figures for the subsidy for flour, as I do not know the subject in sufficient detail to contradict him &mdash; even if there is room for contradiction&mdash;but I know a little about the growing of wheat.  The Minister claims on behalf of the flour millers that they are entitled to this subsidy.  I do not contest that.  Farmers will produce wheat if their income is guaranteed.  I think it is up to the Minister to look to the production of an Irish loaf rather than to the problematical loaf that may be produced by trying to import 25 per cent. of the flour to make it in the coming year.  Supposing the 25 per cent. does not come in, and that despite everything the Minister has done that 25 per cent. is sent to the bottom of the Atlantic, where are we?  Already there is a 10 per cent. shortage.  That means that there is 10 per cent. less available than at this time last year.  The Minister is doubtful if he will be able to finish out this year with the wheaten loaf, even with 100 per cent. of an increase in production.  According to the <Col N="678" /> Minister he paid 15/- a barrel for wheat on the other side of the Atlantic.  Why was not that 15/- given here for a white loaf seeing that it would leave us with 30,000 tons of offal to feed live stock? The reason was that it could not be transported across the Atlantic.  The commonsense way of dealing with the matter is to pay farmers to produce our own requirements.  They can do it, and they will do it if they are paid to do it.  Farmers have as much right to be paid for growing wheat as millers have for milling it into flour.  Pay the price.  That would be the best assurance that the country could have.  Pay the Irish producer to grow wheat and if possible give the people an all-Irish white loaf.  If the price is paid the subsidy can be so arranged as to regulate the price to the consumer.</P>
    <P>The Minister talked of a 1/2 or 1/3 loaf being too dear.  I will bring the Minister to any Dublin Corporation housing scheme, and I guarantee that if I bring a load of white loaves there I will sell them at any price I ask.  The poor people are not unwilling to pay a price for a white loaf.  In fact they will go short of other things in order to get it.  The bogey of the low-priced loaf should not be tried on the poor.  The poor man and the rich man want the loaf as cheaply as they can get it.  Why not?  They are satisfied that they cannot get a white loaf now at the prewar price.  They are paying 7d. and 8d. a lb. for white flour in Dublin.  The Minister knows that.  Who is paying that price?  Not the wealthy people. It is the working class.  I challenge contradiction of that statement.  Consumers understand the difficulty of producing wheat and they will pay for it.  The poor people are not howling about the price of bread, but they are howling about the quality of it.  The Minister can make a test.  Let him get in touch with any shopkeepers selling bread in working-class districts, and I guarantee they will tell him that if they could supply a white loaf it would be bought.  If possible the aim now should be to supply a loaf that is nearly white. Tell the working people that the loaf is going to be diluted and they will shiver.  If they have to pay a penny or twopence more to avoid that they <Col N="679" /> will not mind doing so.  From the traders' point of view I know that what I am saying is an actual fact.  With regard to the flour market, and the reference to Ranks, or as some Deputies put it in this debate, Joe Rank, I say that Ranks or any other millers could not have got such a grip of the situation if the test had been that the flour should contain a percentage of Irish wheat, let it be from 1 per cent. to 100 per cent.</P>

      <P>Then what nursing of the millers is there?  Let them trade, but let there be 5 per cent. of Irish wheat in the flour.  What is the real emergency now?  It is to have the loaf. I suggest that the loaf should be as white as it is possible to have it, or as near to a 70 per cent extraction as it can be had.  If you ask farmers&mdash;I do not mean holiday farmers&mdash;who are tilling the soil to produce food, and tell them that if possible an all-Irish loaf is wanted, they will produce it. If that is done I suggest there would be no need to bother whether the old hulks, which have been bought, ever sailed the seas.  The farmers are as much entitled to be paid for their work as the millers.  Give them a return of 6 per cent. and they will supply the food.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>In my opinion, Deputy Belton has struck the right note on this question.  When this Party came into office in 1932, they determined upon a policy of insurance against the present position of food supplies.  That policy has made this country wheat minded, in order to supply our needs in bread and to put us in a position that no foreigner can hold out his hand and say: &ldquo;Give us 500,000 men and we will give you bread for your people.&rdquo; That is the reason the wheat policy was introduced.  As a result farmers here got a little more than they would ordinarily be entitled to, and the public have paid since 1932 a little more for bread.  I did not vote for Deputy Belton's Vote of 50/- a barrel for wheat, because I considered it too high.  I also expected to get eight barrels to the acre.  I did not get that <Col N="680" /> yield from my crops this year.  I will not vote for a demand for 60/- this year, because I consider it to be too high.  At the same time, I consider that farmers are not getting enough.  I want to warn the Minister that it is my honest conviction that we will not get 300,000 acres of wheat grown this year for 41/- a barrel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>With a definite knowledge of the position of farmers I say that that acreage will not be got this year.  If farmers can get £15 or £16 a ton for oats in the black market, I do not believe they are going to grow wheat.  The Minister is considering the importation of 80,000 tons of wheat at 84/- a barrel.  Roughly, that represents £1,360,000.  I suggest that this is not the time for doing anything but playing for safety.  I would like to see Manitoba wheat mixed with Irish wheat, because it would give us a nice loaf, but if the Yanks are in the war one of these days&mdash;as they probably will be&mdash;and if the Japs are also in, what chance have we of getting 80,000 tons of wheat across the Atlantic? Very little.  If we could get 80,000 tons of supplies across the Atlantic, would it not be better to get artificial manures?  That would be a better policy.  If, by means of an economic price for wheat, we get another 80,000 tons, and succeed in bringing it across the Atlantic, would it not be a fine thing to know that we have provided not only sufficient wheat for our people but for a white loaf?  That would be a real good insurance policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope the Minister will consider a subsidy that will give Irish farmers at least the cost of production, so that it will pay them to produce our full wheat requirements.  This month of November is the time to do that and not next February.  If we are to have full supplies this year, they will be got by fixing the price now, by making the price a right price, instead of waiting for February or March next, when it will be too late.  I firmly believe that the Irish farmer will do his part.  I believe that we could have 600,000 tons of wheat grown here next year if the price was right.  I would not look, as <Col N="681" /> Deputy Belton does, for 60/- a barrel. I do not believe there is any need to look for that price.</P>

      <P>I could give figures and Deputy Belton could give figures to prove that we are wrong.  That is what figures are made for.  With fixed prices for oats, barley and wheat for the coming year, the inclination, as well as the common sense of the ordinary farmer who is working for a living, will be to grow oats or barley as against wheat.  The Minister's offer is 41/- for wheat, and there are fixed prices for barley and oats.  Seeing that most farmers got 35/- a barrel for barley and £16 a ton for oats this season, I believe they will go in for barley and oats next season, unless there is some incentive to make them change.  I do not care how the Minister deals with the matter.  Let him give a bounty per acre for each acre of wheat grown, or otherwise increase the price.  I suggest that it is a far better insurance policy to work on the supposition that there will be no shipping coming in for the next 12 months and that, therefore, we must produce 100 per cent. of our requirements.  If there are 80,000 or 90,000 tons of wheat here next year I do not think anyone will blame the Minister.</P>

      <P>To-day Deputy Mulcahy asked on behalf of Deputy McGilligan permission to raise on the adjournment matters arising out of question No. 9 on the Order Paper. The Chair granted permission, but meantime I have given the matter some consideration and have decided that it is not to be taken as establishing a precedent.  If a Deputy desires to raise a matter on his own question on the adjournment he must himself in future request leave to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I had two questions on the Order Paper to-day.  The second one concerned the publication by a newspaper called the <i>Examiner</i>, Dundalk, of an editorial entitled &ldquo;Roosevelt's Cock-and-Bull story.&rdquo;  I founded certain demands for certain information on that and in so far as the answer dealt with the insult or <Col N="683" /> affront offered to the head of a friendly State by that particular type of editorial slogan, I have no fault to find. I understand the situation to be that the matter was published without the Censor having seen it and that it is regarded as a defiance of the censorship regulations and I am told that this particular paper will be under the same restraint in future as are other papers that have offended against the regulations.  I do not find that in many cases it has gone the length that has been gone in regard to other publications. I have been told that any future comment will be submitted.  I understand that not merely comment but all other matters have to be submitted in respect of a journal that has offended against the regulations.  I trust that the same punishment will be given to this particular paper as to the others.</P>
      <P>However, I referred in the end to the second part of the editorial under the headline, not having anything to do with the affront offered in set terms to the head of a friendly State.  I asked whether other newspapers may now publish such information as they may have as to the attitude of the belligerent Powers to religion and to Church institutions.  On that the Minister made, as far as I am concerned, no reply.  It may have been an inadvertence that he got away with that part of the question, and to that I have nothing to say except that if he hoped to do so it would have been evasive and childish and, at any rate, ineffective. A part of the article on which I founded the question&mdash;I do not say I took exception to it as I am not in favour of censorship, even of this type of rubbish&mdash;and to which I want to draw attention is towards the end of the editorial, where it was stated:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;For religion in general&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I am leaving out the earlier part of the commentary: the Minister can read it if he thinks it necessary&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;&mdash;&mdash;which is to be saved, we presume, by a combination of the forces of Soviet Russia and Freemason levies, lined up against such Godless countries as Catholic Italy, Catholic <Col N="684" /> Spain, Rumania, Hungary and the 48,000,000 of Catholics in Germany.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The last paragraph but one of the editorial says:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The facts are that the Catholic Church is still endowed by the State in Germany; that Hitler in <i>Mein Kampf</i> has proclaimed that there must be religious freedom in the Reich, that he has paid tribute to the Catholic Church, which, as he says, does not change her doctrines to suit the passing whims and fashions of the time; that the Church, as the editor of the <i>Catholic Herald</i> put it recently, flourishes in Germany.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I do not object to that being published in regard to one State if there is allowed to percolate freely through the country the answers to it also.  My objection in regard to the censorship is that it prevents people forming any opinion on the moral issues at stake in this war.  They cannot form much judgment on the moral issue.  Whether in the war or while preserving the strictest front possible in the way of neutrality it seems ludicrous to expect people now or hereafter not to be called on to form any judgment on what has happened leading up to the war and from that on.  Some two or three people, who I do not think would arrogate to themselves any superior intellectual power, say that they are not to read that matter or the material published in answer to it.  If the Minister tries to take refuge in part of what he said in answer to supplementaries, that the Censor tries to be impartial and tries to stop both being published, then he has not entirely succeeded, because one knows that comments have crept in of that type telling people everything is going to ruin so far as Bolshevist Russia is concerned and that England must be described as a Freemason country, that the Freemasons have come out in support of matters at the root of the war; and, on the other hand, you are told that the Church is marvellously preserved in Germany.  I do not object to that sort of thing being said, but I do object to that being allowed more occasionally than the answer to it.  I would much <Col N="685" /> rather see the situation where they were allowed publication until the people were tired of it all, and where the answers were also being published until people agreed to differ in the matter.</P>
    <P>On the question whether the Church is free or not in Germany, we are not without authority either.  The Pope published an Encyclical which has not been published in this country.  I wonder if the newspapers would be allowed to publish it, in serial form. The Pope had no doubt about where he stood with regard to the whole philosophy of the Nazi system.  The title of the Encyclical to the German Bishops is &ldquo;Mit Brennender Sorge&rdquo;. He says:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We have never ceased to represent to the responsible rulers of your country's destiny the consequences which would inevitably follow the protection and even the favour extended to such a policy&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is, the policy he is condemning is the racial policy that the Germans are trying to enforce in place of religion.  He has used this phrase in regard to Nazi Socialism in the same Encyclical:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;This substitute faith, that has nothing in common with the Faith of the Cross.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I do not know if words could be plainer.  He went on to say:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;None but superficial minds could stumble into concepts of a national God, a national religion or an attempt to lock within the frontiers of a single people, within the narrow limits of a single race, God, the Creator of the Universe, the King and Legislator of all nations, before Whose immensity they are `as a drop in a bucket'.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Can we have that published in this country?  I do not believe the editor of the <i>Dundalk Examiner</i> wrote this editorial, as I do not believe the individual who runs that paper is capable of putting together such an editorial, but I would like to see the <Col N="686" /> people who stand behind him having at least to write one or two other editorials in defence of their view of religion in Germany merely against half a dozen sentences in the Encyclical I have quoted.</P>
    <P>This is not the end of the matter of religion in relation to that country. One of my colleagues here asked what the situation was with regard to sermons preached by the Catholic Bishop of Münster in Westphalia.  As far as I can gather, the Bishop of Münster's sermon was given in two parts&mdash;one by the British Press Association and the other by the German Press Agency.  It appears that on July 13th he talked about an attack made by the British Air Force on the town of Münster a few days before and said that he was handing over to his flock some meditations on this attack by a war-like adversary, but he was stopped on that because he had other things to say.  He continued:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Münster had not recovered from the appalling devastation which the external enemy and military adversary caused us when yesterday at the end of this dreadful week&mdash;yesterday, on July 12th, 1941&mdash;the secret State police, the Gestapo, confiscated both houses of the Society of Jesus in the city&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>Then he mentions who they are:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;&ldquo;and forced the Reverend Fathers and lay brothers to leave without delay not only their houses, not only our city, but also the province of Westphalia and the Rhine province.  The same hard fate has overtaken the Good Sisters in Steinfurt street.  Their convent has also been confiscated.  The nuns are expelled from Westphalia, and must leave Münster by six o'clock this evening.</P>
    <P>He talks about some sequels to that. Then he adds&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;And so we see that the assault upon monasteries which has been raging for some time already in Austria, in southern Germany, in the recently acquired territories of western Poland.  Luxemburg, Lorraine <Col N="687" /> and in other parts of the German Empire, has now been let loose on Westphalia.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Then the Bishop goes on to say that the people must be prepared for the repetition of such terrible things.  He said that he had been threatened with arrest.  He has been arrested since. Yet this paper is allowed to publish this story about the way the Church flourishes in Germany and no opportunity is given to state what the Bishop of Münster says.  No answer is allowed. The Minister says that it was done in defiance of censorship regulations.  That is no excuse and no betterment of the harm done.</P>
    <P>The Government themselves are not without some concern in this matter. It is only in the month of October, by a publication that does come into this country that one learns that the Government Information Bureau sent a reply to an American journal over some comments that appeared in that journal with regard to the censorship in this country.  The article quoted statements; it talked of giving certain definite statements and talked about certain things that had been censored and the publication of which had been definitely prohibited.  This journal prints in full what they call an official reply received from the Dublin Government.  Now, this has been done without the knowledge of anybody here; it is done particularly without the knowledge of the Leader of the Opposition Party, who is quoted by the Government Information Bureau in terms which only mean that he is backing the censorship as it exists at present.  That is hardly a fair thing to do.  One would not call it an honourable thing to do, and it certainly is not true as it is represented here.</P>
    <P>One of the things they talk of is that here they did not allow the dissemination of a book published by Burns and Oates and distributed by the British Ministry of Information.  It is a book called <i>The Persecution of the Catholic Church in the Third Reich.</i>  Some of my colleagues asked about that and I asked about it a year ago and, so far as I remember, the excuse then given was not that it was a propagandist <Col N="688" /> work but that it made an attack upon the head of a friendly State, such an attack as the Pope himself has launched.  It is now known that the book was compiled by certain German priests whose names cannot be given&mdash; they are still in Germany.  If it were allowed to be circulated here, that book would be a complete refutation of the stuff carried by the <i>Dundalk Examiner.</i>  The Minister has allowed the <i>Dundalk Examiner</i> to get the start with this stuff, but he takes good care that the book which so completely disrupts the ideas conveyed in the published article will not get circulation here.</P>
    <P>I presume the reply to the American journal comes from somebody in the censor's department.  It was officially issued by the Government Information Bureau and the American paper says that it was received from the Dublin Government.  At the end it says that fair journalism requires that when various people, who are mentioned, are quoted, the official reply of the Government should also be quoted. Then there follow two quotations in justification of the censorship in this country.  One is taken from <i>The Leader</i> and the other is stated in this way:&mdash;&ldquo;The Irish attitude on the Christian aspects of the war was recently stated as follows in the Dáil by Deputy William Cosgrave, Leader of the Opposition.&rdquo;  Then there follows a distorted excerpt from a speech which that Deputy made in circumstances well known to the House.</P>
    <P>Decency would have demanded that before that script went to America Deputy Cosgrave should have been consulted about it.  At least he should have been allowed to see, when he was paraded in America as being behind the censorship here, what was quoted from his statement.  It is completely dishonourable.  I say it is an inaccurate quotation and it was torn from its context.  Deputy Cosgrave was the most astonished man in the world to discover that he was paraded there as backing the working of the censorship in this country.</P>
    <P>For some reason or other the Government have decided that they must clamp together the preservation of <Col N="689" /> neutrality and the censorship as it is at present being worked.  I am at one with them in stopping insulting remarks directed against the heads of other States.  I think that if the journal that published that article was worth anything, or if it was to be taken as representative of any body of opinion in this country, then the country would suffer lamentably, even from the headline.  I think it defames itself more than it defames the person against whom the article is directed.</P>
    <P>The Government are behind this kind of thing.  They will not allow the free dissemination of material which will enable the people to make up their minds on the moral issues in the background of the war.  I do not see how our progress towards war or our hesitation on the threshold of neutrality would be affected by allowing the people freely to discuss the international materialism of Moscow, the Fascist oath of Rome or the German philosophy of nationalism rooted in a racial stock.  The Pope has condemned all three, and I think it would be a good thing if the country could get to know the terms in which he has condemned them and the reasons given for the condemnation.</P>
    <P>There appears to be the view that the Government must be neutral, even on moral issues.  That matter has been referred to recently in another article which, I am sure, will not be allowed publication in this country.  I refer to the sermon which was delivered recently and which the Minister can get <i>verbatim</i> from our representative in Portugal, where the article is in circulation.  The sermon was preached by Cardinal Van Roey, the Archbishop of Malines, and in it he speaks in this way: He said the Church could adapt herself to many situations but she could not tolerate conditions which tended to stifle her.  Italy and Portugal, for example, were both dictatorships, he said, but how different were the conditions of life for the Church in those two countries.  As for Germany, she represented the rockbottom in this matter. One had only to read the Encyclical <i>Mit Brennender Sorge.</i>  And the situation was not improving.  Then he went on:&mdash;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="690" />&ldquo;It was unlawful for Roman Catholics to collaborate with an oppressive régime.  Indeed, they had an obligation to work with those who tried to resist such a régime.  It was sometimes objected that the Church was concerned only with souls&mdash;that the altar, the confessional-box, and the pulpit were the limits of a priest's domain, and that the rest belonged to the State.  That was not so.  The Church claimed to have an interest in all that belonged to God. One had only to take the case of Cardinal Innitzer.  On the day after the <i>Anschluss</i> he had written, `In present circumstances it is necessary to emphasise that the duty of the Church is the cure of souls&mdash; through worship, the sacraments, and preaching.  She must remain aloof from all else.'  But Cardinal Innitzer was recalled to Rome, where the Supreme Pontiff led him back on to the right path.  The next month Cardinal Innitzer spoke very differently. `The Church,' he then said, `must exercise her rights of proclaiming and defending the Catholic Faith in every department of human life.' &rdquo;</P>
    <P>Have not the Government in a Catholic country, where the majority of the citizens represent one Faith, an equal duty to see that people will be allowed to get the material on which they will be able to form a proper judgment as to the matters that lie behind the present conflict?</P>

      <P>One last thing. An Italian paper, the <i>Osservatore Romano</i>, publishes certain heads with regard to lectures to be delivered to the Catholic youth in Germany.  They contain such things as these:&mdash;&ldquo;Contrast how Christ died whimpering on the Cross and how Planetta died crying: ` Heil, Hitler; Heil, Germany' &rdquo;; &ldquo;The Ten Commandments are the deposits of the lowest human instincts,&rdquo; and finally: &ldquo;For us Germans the inactivity of eternal life is simply foolishness.&rdquo;  Those are all authoritatively backed.  I do not want these things to be given wide publicity.  I <Col N="691" /> think the Encyclicals, articles written by authoritative people in the Church, and particularly the Encyclicals of the Pope, ought to be allowed equal publicity to what the <i>Dundalk Examiner</i> gets.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Co-ordination of Defensive Measures (Mr. Aiken)</NameTxt>
      <P>We have a difficulty in the censorship in keeping the minds of our own people firmly fixed on the problems of this country.  This Dáil, which is the body with the authority and the responsibility of deciding national policy, has decided that we are to be neutral in the war.  Now, in modern times one of the principal weapons of war is propaganda, and we here do not know from day to day, we have no means of knowing&mdash;we are not prophets or magicians&mdash;or of judging the accuracy of statements or quotations or alleged quotations circulated by one belligerent and supposed to be coming from the citizens of its enemy. The Cardinal, to whom the Deputy has referred, Cardinal Innitzer, made statements as to the Church's duty and the duty of Catholics to defend morals in all circumstances, and he himself complained that utterances which he felt it his moral duty to make to the people of his diocese were twisted for propaganda purposes by the enemies of Germany. We all know that the &ldquo;words of wise men are often twisted to make traps for fools&rdquo;&mdash;I think somebody has said that somewhere before, and you all know it.  We have discussed this thing here time and again.  Personally, I think that the attitude of the vast majority of our people on this question of the moral issues could not have been better or more clearly stated than by the Leader of the Opposition on the occasion here when Deputy Dillon went berserker about religion. And if there is anybody in this House who is going to get up and say that this fight is a fight between the Cross of Christ and the cross of Nazism you will have somebody else the next day getting up and saying that it is a fight between the Cross of Christ and the Hammer and Sickle, or whatever the other symbol is.  We have prevented <Col N="692" /> both, and surely our people are well versed enough in international affairs to judge moral issues for themselves, if there are moral issues in this war.</P>
      <P>Deputy McGilligan has pointed out that we have censored statements of certain bishops and cardinals and other important people from time to time.  We have, but I say this much: that every night on the air, and every day in the newspapers, the chief spokesman of every nation in this world, who wants to speak, has direct access to the Irish people to convince them of his moral case for winning the war, if he has a moral case.  There is no head of a State, a religious State or a temporal State, whose pronouncements have been censored in our papers since the beginning of this war, not one.  If there are moral issues involved, these people should put them, and they are allowed to put them to the Irish people.  If anyone wants an intellectual exercise, he can have it by comparing, on the one hand, what Herr Hitler says with what, on the other hand, Mr. Churchill or M. Stalin says.  They are all free to do it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy McGilligan asked me about some Encyclical of the Pope's.  If that is presented as an Encyclical the Irish people are quite free to read it, as far as I am concerned.  But they are not free to read attacks on the Pope, such as were made in one Irish paper here which published a letter in which the Vatican was condemned as a small, little, Totalitarian State which was dictating to the people of this country and to this Government.  If I &ldquo;permitted,&rdquo; as has been alleged and as has been very gracefully withdrawn by Deputy McGilligan, the article in the <i>Dundalk Examiner</i>, so also did I &ldquo;permit&rdquo; the publication of this.  To answer Deputy McGilligan in regard to religion I say: that we did not permit that editorial and neither did we permit the few&mdash;thank goodness, they were few&mdash;editorials that were directed against the heads of other friendly powers, including the Pope.  We did not permit that&mdash;it was not submitted&mdash;and we did not change the regulations and do not propose to change them.  I personally believe, with the Leader of the Opposition, that <Col N="693" /> this war is not about religion, but if it is about religion, if it is about morals, it is up to the heads of the foreign States to prove it, and it is not up to us to circulate propagandist statements issued here by the publicity department of any belligerent about what the other side has said or is alleged to have said.</P>
    <P>Now, my belief is that the people of this country have a better opportunity of forming a calm judgment on this war than if the headlines of our papers were filled every day with the fiery abuse which both belligerents are using, one about the other.  This article in the <i>Dundalk Examiner</i>, like other articles that were published in other papers, did get a start, but up to the present time the <i>Dundalk Examiner</i>, like nearly all our other papers, has behaved in a very reasonable and correct way from the national point of view, and there was no cause for complaint.  But Deputy Dillon, in the House to-day, made an allegation about the <i>Dundalk Examiner:</i> that it had at some time or another stated that Nazism was the protector of the Catholic Church, of Christianity, in Europe.  I have had the <i>Dundalk Examiner</i> searched for the last two years, since the beginning of this war, and that statement did not appear in it.  That statement is like a number of other wild statements which Deputy Dillon makes from time to time&mdash;baseless allegations, which also get a start &mdash;and nothing that I say here, or that Deputy McGilligan said to-night in accepting my explanation with regard to that article, will ever catch up on that lie.  We will see that lie all over the world wherever it can be used as hurtful propaganda against the people of this country.</P>
