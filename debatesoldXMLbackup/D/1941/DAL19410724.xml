      <P>The normal annual consumption of coal for domestic purposes in the three areas mentioned would be about 450,000 tons of which about 300,000 would be consumed in the months of October-March and 150,000 tons in the months of April-September, i.e., about 50,000 tons per month in winter and about 25,000 tons per month in summer.</P>

    <P>Under the firewood scheme being carried out under the auspices of the Department of Supplies, 2,000 tons have reached the dumps in Dublin.  In addition 5,000 tons have been cut and stacked, awaiting transport.  This is all from State forests.  No information is available as to the quantity, if any, cut and stacked in privately owned woodlands.  No information is available as to the quantities brought into or destined for the areas in question by agencies not working under the auspices of the Department.</P>

      <P>Up to 22nd July, 1941, 152 applications were received to bring turf into Dublin City, and permits were granted in 14 cases.  Eight of these permits were granted to firms or bodies which had organised the direct production of turf within the turf areas; two were granted in cases where the turf was required for a special process for which no other fuel was suitable; two where the turf was required for experimental purposes; one where the turf was purchased and in transit on the date when the order was made, and one to cover the large scale transport of turf for storage in Dublin City.</P>

Arrangements are being made to ensure that supplies of coal will be available to meet threshing requirements, but in present circumstances there can be no certainty that the supply in each area will be adequate and turf or timber may have to be utilised.  The steps to be taken by farmers to secure supplies of fuel for this purpose will be announced in the near future.</P>

The Emergency Powers (Control of Coal) Order, 1941 and the Rationing Orders made by me from ration period to ration period are designed to distribute whatever coal supplies become available in the most equitable manner, but it is not possible to anticipate imports or to estimate future requirements throughout the country in such a manner as will enable one to arrive at an estimate of the quantities of native and imported anthracite likely to be available for consumers in Dublin City and county in the next eight months.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is probably aware fat cattle and sheep for the supply of meat for the Boroughs of Dublin and Dun Laoghaire are being purchased in the restricted area, including County Wexford, lying south of the Grand Canal. Substantial numbers of fat stock are also purchased in that area for export as dressed meat and for canning.</P>

Is he aware that many farmers in County Wexford have not sold a beast this year, and that until they get rid of the fat cattle they will not be in a position to buy other cattle from their neighbours?  I do not understand why these people are not allowed to sell in Dublin.  I would go as far as anyone to ensure that foot-and-mouth disease is stamped out, but I do not approve of football matches, greyhound coursing and dancing to which people are allowed to go from infected districts.

      <P>There is no immediate general shortage of medical anaesthetics, but I am <Col N="2379" /> aware that there is a danger that a shortage may develop.  The question of securing supplies from overseas sources has been, and is, receiving active attention, and consultations with the principal distributors of anaesthetics have already taken place.  Arrangements will be made for any other consultations that may seem to be required.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that, in addition to choloform and ether, there are a number of modern anaesthetics which are invaluable in the hands of trained anaesthetists, would the Minister consider summoning some of the practising anaesthetists, at least in the City of Dublin, with a view to hearing from them whether there are any special American anaesthetics which could be included in any consignment he proposes to bring to this country?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly.  We have been advised in this matter by the firms which are the ordinary commercial channels through which these supplies arrive.

I am informed that, in certain surgical conditions, while it may be impermissible to induce anaesthesia with either or chloroform, there are certain modern anaesthetics that may safely be used.  A shortage exists not only of the common anaesthetics like ether and chloroform, but also of these more specialised anaesthetics, and the danger is that if the Minister confines his consultations to wholesale distributors some of these others may escape his notice.  I suggest that he approach the Academy of Medicine and ask them to nominate some anaesthetist who will consult his Department with a view to making their case for the inclusion of these unusual anaesthetics in any consignment he proposes to bring in.</P>

      <P>In view of the length of the adjournment, would the Tánaiste not consider that it might be more desirable to fix a date in the first week of September for summoning the Dáil, even though the Government would not put any special volume of business before the House, because a large number of questions would normally arise upon which, in the public interest, we might desire to get information, and for which we would not wish to summon the Dáil specially. If the adjournment were until the first week in September, normal questions which would arise could then be brought up and dealt with, and the Dáil could then, if necessary, adjourn.</P>

In these times of anxiety about supplies and a variety of other domestic problems, questions begin to be asked and rumours get afloat, and very often the whole situation can be cleared up by a series of Parliamentary questions and a discussion on the adjournment, whereas if you have three long months when no official exchange between the Opposition and the <Col N="2381" /> Government can take place, a very undesirable situation may arise.

    <P>That is is expedient to authorise any payments out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas which may be required to give effect to any Act of the present session to make provision for the granting out of public moneys of compensation to dependents and partial dependents of members of the Gárda Síochána (whether serving or retired) who have died or shall die at any time on or after the 1st day of January, 1940, from injuries maliciously inflicted on them in the course of or in relation to the performance by them of their duties as members of the Gárda Síochána, and for the like granting of compensation to members of the Gárda Síochána (whether serving or retired) on whom personal injuries not causing death have been or shall be similarly inflicted at any time on or after the 1st <Col N="2383" /> day of January, 1940, and to make provision for matters incidental to or connected with the matters aforesaid, including the extension of this Act to other police forces.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I had better take advantage of the Money Resolution to raise a question in relation to Section 3, in the hope that the Minister may look into it between now and the time when the Bill is discussed in the Seanad.  In Section 3 we catalogue the persons who are entitled to make an application for compensation under this Act, and I do not understand why, in fact, we set out categories of people in the manner adopted in that section.  I think the old phrase in the Criminal Injuries Act, 1919, was &ldquo;personal representative&rdquo;, which seemed to give any person with any substantial claim the right to sue under the Act.  In this case, &ldquo;personal representative&rdquo; is omitted, and, instead, we get categories of persons entitled to make application.  The categories, however, are not as wide as the phrase &ldquo;personal representative&rdquo; in the Criminal Injuries Act, 1919, because, for instance, a Gárda officer might lose his life and he might be maintaining, for instance, a nephew or a niece.  He might have maintained them for a long period.  There might have been no doubt whatever of the fact that he was maintaining such persons.  Yet there is no possibility, under Section 3, of such a person being able to bring a claim for compensation. I do not know whether the Minister desires definitely to exclude such persons.  If they have no substantial claim, of course, they ought to be excluded, but if they have a substantial claim then we ought to allow the court to adjudicate on the point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>That point has been put to me also, with this further extension, that while provision is made for any dependency of a nephew or a niece and also of a sister of a deceased officer appearing either before the Minister or the court, as the case may be, there is no provision made in such a case arising where his sister dies and where the dependency of the nephew <Col N="2384" /> or the niece was partial rather than entire.  It was put to me that if &ldquo;personal representative&rdquo; were included in the list it would meet that case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I am told that the case of a niece or a nephew would come under the category of adopted children, if they were dependent.  I believe they are covered under clause (f).  So I am advised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, that is in cases where there was entire dependency but the cases that were mentioned to me were those in which the dependency was only partial, that is, that the officer had not undertaken at all times to contribute towards the maintenance of the nephew or the niece but that he had given some assistance towards it. It was a limited amount.  It may be that it is met under this but it was put to me in the same way as Deputy Norton has put it, that the Criminal Injuries Act set down personal representative and that that particular designation is absent from this list.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems rather unusual that an adopted child should include a niece or nephew because there may be no formal adoption at all.  There may be a sort of recognition of the fact that the niece or nephew is, through economic necessity, thrown with the deceased officer, and the Minister may discover afterwards that &ldquo;adopted children&rdquo; does not include niece or nephew.  I take it, from what the Minister says, it is not his desire to exclude a niece or nephew.  Would the Minister look into the matter between now and the time when the Bill comes to be discussed in the Seanad with a view to covering niece or nephew?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I am satisfied they are covered.  Representations were made on that point and I inquired into it, and I am given to understand they are covered.  As for Deputy Cosgrave's point, I think sub-section (1) of Section 8 would cover partial dependency&mdash;&ldquo;that the applicant was wholly or partly dependent.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">

    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>There seems to be a certain lacuna here, because though I think the words &ldquo;adopted child&rdquo; would be taken to be a child to whom the deceased person stood in what is called <i>loco parentis</i>, in the place of a parent, without any formal act of adoption, if there were one of these cases where a police officer has been helping some of his poorer relations, where he has been contributing to the schooling of a boy whose father and mother are still alive or something of that kind, they have suffered a very real material loss, and they would not be provided for in this Bill.  I understand it is such cases that Deputy Norton and Deputy Cosgrave referred to.  They would not be provided for. What the Minister says is that under Section 8 he must be satisfied that the applicant was wholly or partly dependent on the said deceased person, but then an applicant must be one of these persons who are mentioned in Section 3.  So that does not help.  The two things must combine.  The applicant must be one of the various classes mentioned in Section 3, and must also, under Section 8, be wholly or partially dependent upon the deceased person. In other words, Section 8 does not enlarge, but rather restricts, Section 3.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>My point was that it covered the partial dependency and I am advised that a niece or a nephew would be covered by that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  With great respect, I would suggest to the Minister that before a niece or nephew who was partially dependent came in they would have to be one of the classes set out in Section 3 and a niece or nephew partially dependent would have to be an adopted child and that is rather a contradiction in terms.  An adopted child, one might say, in most instances is totally dependent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I notice the Minister for Justice has assumed so benevolent an aspect in this House that Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney is tempted to address him as though he was a judge upon the <Col N="2386" /> Bench.  In fact, does not clause (f), sub-section (1)  of Section 3, meet the case because will not the court hold that, if you talk of an adopted child who is partially dependent on the deceased person, the words &ldquo;adopted child&rdquo; there are not to be taken in their technical meaning of a person who is related to the deceased person by a legal process of adoption but in fact a child for whom the deceased person has adopted partial responsibility? If a child were related to a deceased person by legal adoption the deceased person would have been liable for his total maintenance.  If you adopt a child legally you become as liable for its total maintenance and education as if you were the child's parent and if the paragraph of the sub-section speaks of an adopted child for whom the deceased person was partially responsible, that obviously means&mdash;&mdash;</P>

It seems to be much more comprehensive than the catalogue set out here.  It is much shorter and will allow the courts to determine who is the personal representative. The Minister ought to appreciate that this Bill arose out of a construction of the Grand Jury Act of 1836.  That construction, or misconstruction, necessitates this.  If we are going to remove whatever difficulties were experienced in the interpretation of the 1836 Act we ought to do it in some way that is clear, beyond all doubt.  I will be satisfied, knowing the Minister's mind on the matter, if he will look into it between now and the time the Seanad discusses it with a view to meeting the points which have been put to him here.</P>

      <P>There is another matter, though I do not know if this is the best time to raise it.  This proposed amendment by the Minister is making a very substantial alteration. As far as I understand the amendment &mdash;I have had it in hand only for the last few minutes&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and have not been able to give it very careful consideration&mdash;it is now changing the scope of the Bill.  If a Gárda receives any injury of any kind, he would be entitled to compensation.  That is being narrowed by this amendment, as I understand it.  If he receives injury of a minor character he will not receive compensation now at all, under this amendment.  Is not that so?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  The Minister defines that in one paragraph. Therefore a whole class goes out altogether&mdash;those with minor injuries, unless there is a special risk.  Then, when dealing with the question of special risk, you define minor injuries <Col N="2389" /> as something which the Minister will adequately compensate with a sum of under £100.  That means, as far as I can interpret this, that unless the Minister is satisfied that a Gárda has received injuries which would entitle him to compensation of a larger sum than £100, the Minister can fling his claim out altogether.  That is not good.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;In case the Minister is of opinion that, although such injuries are of a minor character, they were sustained in the course of the performance of a duty involving special risk and that a sum not exceeding £100 would be adequate compensation therefor.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Therefore, in that case an injury which would be compensated for adequately by the full sum of £100 is still regarded as a minor injury because, if you had &ldquo;minor injury&rdquo; in (b) (ii) having a particular meaning it must have the same meaning in (b) (i).  It is regrettable that the Bill should be narrowed down so that a Gárda injured in the ordinary course of his duty will receive no compensation unless he has been so seriously injured that he must receive a sum of over £100.</P>

      <P>It would be very unusual. I understood that the Minister agreed yesterday evening that, in questions of claims for compensation where there are injuries or in respect of death of a member of the Gárda, the Minister would throw the whole responsibility on the court and say that, if a Gárda is foolish enough to go to court with a minor injury, to try to sustain an action not legally sustainable because the injury is a minor one, the Gárda is going to pay for it.  The Minister comes along to-day and sets himself up as a judge in sub-section (1) (b) (i) and (i) (b) (ii).  In (1) (b) (i) he takes power to decide that injuries are of a minor character, and in (1) (b)  (ii) he takes power to decide whether the injuries sustained are of a kind that compensation should be paid up to a sum not exceeding £100.  These are functions which I do not think the Minister should exercise at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I heard the Minister say yesterday that he intended to throw the whole responsibility on to the courts, I had not an idea that he was still going to reserve to himself the right to decide what was a minor case, and what kind of compensation should be paid for a minor injury.  That is what the Minister is doing in (i) and (ii).  I suggest to the Minister that these are not Ministerial functions at all, and that it would be very much better, from his own point of view, and very much more equitable, if he were to allow the cases <Col N="2391" /> to go to the courts and let them decide. This is not at all in accordance with the spirit of the assurance the Minister gave yesterday.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister has walked into the very trap that he sought to avoid yesterday.  If a Gárda is injured and the Minister's advisers say that £50 would pay well for anything that has happened, pressure may be brought on the Minister to let this man go to court.  Remember, the man goes into court with an implied certificate that the Minister thinks he ought to get more than £100.  The fact that the Minister has permitted him to go to court is in itself a declaration that the Minister is of the opinion that he should get more than £100.  Pressure might be brought on the Minister to let So-and-so go to court, and let the court decide.  What is the point of this?  Is it to save money for the Gárda applicants&mdash;to avoid costs?  Is that it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>There is something being done here that never was done before.  Hitherto, if a man received an injury in the ordinary course of his work, he was not compensated at all. You may have a Gárda getting trivial injuries&mdash;say, in arresting a drunken man, he gets a kick in the leg or a black eye&mdash;and going to the court for compensation for that.  I would remind the House that, if Section 6 were to stand as it was, he would have to get some compensation.  Then there would be different witnesses of all kinds, saying that this black eye was of a different type from any other black eye and that it may lead to permanent injury.  We might have all sorts of <Col N="2392" /> frivolous complaints calling for enormous compensation, and costs out of all proportion.</P>
      <P>What I had in mind yesterday was that I would examine this and see whether anything of a major nature would be let go to the courts.  These things that arise from day to day should not have an automatic right to go to the courts: the Minister should have the right to say: &ldquo;This is a trivial thing.&rdquo; It may be a cut hand or a flesh wound which might be all right in a couple of days or a week. Surely no one here wishes the Gárda to have the right to go to the High Court for damages in a case like that? If I amended that section as was suggested yesterday by deleting the words &ldquo;in the case of death&rdquo; and leaving it &ldquo;for all injuries,&rdquo; every Gárda getting any slight injury would have the right to go to the High Court and claim compensation.  This was never done before.  The Guards got no compensation up to this for injuries received in the course of their duties.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I am differentiating between the risk which a Guard on ordinary duty incurs and the risk attending the arrest of a dangerous type of people.  A Guard might have to deal with the members of some illegal organisation.  Special risks might be involved in duty of that kind and an injury which turned out to be of a minor kind might easily have been of a major character.  In the ordinary course of duty, every Guard incurs risk. It is part of his duty to take the ordinary risk of assault and surely it would be most unreasonable to involve the State in special expense in connection with every small injury which a Guard receives by giving him the right to go to court.  Under Section 6, the judge would feel himself compelled to award some compensation in such a case and, probably, to grant costs.  I want to avoid that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us take this matter bit by bit.  As the Bill stood unamended, the Minister was <Col N="2393" /> bound to give compensation to the Guard in every case.  He is now taking that right away and he says that, where the injuries are of a minor character, the Guard shall not be entitled to compensation. But he defines &ldquo;minor character&rdquo; as injuries which can be compensated for up to £100.  That is what (b) (ii) says.  Quite clearly, that is his conception of what a minor injury is.  I do not suppose the Minister would award more than the Guard ought to get.  But look at (b) (ii):&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;in case the Minister is of opinion that, although such injuries are of a minor character, they were sustained in the course of the performance of a duty involving special risk and that a sum not exceeding £100 would be adequate compensation therefor&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Therefore, some injuries that call for £100 compensation are of minor character in the Minister's estimation. Since that is the case in sub-section (b) (ii) the same interpretation must be put on it in sub-section (b) (i).  Injuries of a minor character, therefore, mean injuries which can be compensated for by a sum not in excess of £100.  That seems to me to be absurd.  An injury for which a Guard is entitled to receive £50 or £100 is not trifling at all; it is a very substantial injury.  If the Minister wishes to work out this, he would have to allow every case, no matter what the injury is like, if sustained in the course of the performance of a duty involving special risk, to go to court. The Minister says the High Court is very expensive.  What ties claimants down to the High Court except this particular Bill?  Why go to the High Court rather than to the Circuit Court, if the High Court is too expensive?  I do not think that we contemplated yesterday that an alteration of this kind would be made in the Bill.  I understood that all cases were to go to court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>In cases of death.  I do not think that there would be any necessity to go to court.  These cases could practically all be settled, <Col N="2394" /> because the compensation payable on death is actuarial.  The only question which would arise would be in what proportions it was to be divided amongst the dependents.  That might be easy to arrange.  I do not like this amendment.  It is introducing an entirely new principle which, to my mind, is cutting out from compensation Guards whose injuries are of a nature that £100 compensates for them if they are sustained in the ordinary course of their duty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>What happens in the case of a Guard who meets with an injury, obtains medical advice, puts in a medical certificate to the effect that the injury suffered is of a type which ought to be compensated for by a payment of £500 and the Minister under b (ii) says the injury can be compensated for by £98 and no more.  If the Minister pays the Guard £98, there is no means by which he can get to the courts to appeal against the Minister's decision.  One may say that, in these cases, the Minister is the defendant. If there is anything in the theory of collective responsibility, the Minister cannot pretend to hold the scales evenly between the Minister for Finance, on the one hand, and the injured Guard, on the other.</P>

      <P>I should not like to see the Minister's leaning posture.  I think that it would be an optical illusion. Yesterday, a protest was made against the Minister acting as defendant and judge.  He introduced an amendment throwing responsibility on the courts. To-day he takes power to value injuries, and if a person makes a claim for £1,000, the Minister can say that the injuries will be adequately compensated for by a payment of £99 19s. 11d. If he does that, the person concerned cannot appeal and cannot get to the courts.  I think he should be able to get to the courts.  The Minister is taking unfair and arbitrary power, and I should prefer the old section to this amendment.</P>

      <P>Has the Minister any judicial experience?  I am not thinking of the Minister for Justice, Deputy Gerald Boland.  I am thinking of the ordinary Minister for Justice.  Is he in a position, or are the officials of his Department in a position, to decide how injuries are to be compensated? Have they the judicial training to do so?  Suppose a Guard has his leg broken.  He gets his pay and his hospital expenses are paid.  He is not under heavy, monetary loss, but he has suffered a very considerable amount of pain.  I put the plain question to the Minister: How much money should a Guard who has suffered pain for three months from a broken leg, mending slowly, receive?  That is the sort of question which the Minister will put before himself.  Is he trained to answer that question?  He may get the assistance of advisers in his Department, but he will have no trained evidence as to how the man suffered or whether he was malingering or genuinely in pain. When doctors are called in court, they express their opinions as trained men and their evidence can be sifted.  The Minister may not have the advantage of medical evidence.  If he has, it will be unsifted medical evidence.  I do not think that this section is at all satisfactory and I cannot understand the Minister's attitude in fixing £100 as the distinction between a minor injury and an injury which is not minor.</P>

There is no way of keeping these cases out of court except by introducing this provision.  We are giving the Guards something they never had before.  The Minister should certainly be able to say if a man gets a black eye, a bruise or a minor injury: &ldquo;That is not a case for the court at all.&rdquo;  Much as I should like to meet Deputies on the matter, I cannot give way on this.  We are giving the Guards a very good show and we are not prepared to give way any further.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>

The reason why £100 is mentioned in paragraph (b) (ii) is that if Gárdaí are engaged in work involving special risk one might be inclined to <Col N="2397" /> give them more money than the injuries received would justify.  We have done that in order to encourage them to go after a particular type of organisation.  Strictly speaking, the injured Guard might not be entitled to that amount on account of the injury he received at all.  The first paragraph deals with the type of case where a Guard gets a bruise or something of that kind which can be easily seen. There will not be any dispute between doctors about it.  In the other case if the man went to court he might not get as much as the Minister will allow him, but the Minister's attitude will be that, in view of the way he tackled that type of case, he will give him special consideration.</P>

The Deputy will probably <Col N="2402" /> remember, in connection with the amendments that were moved here yesterday, that I said that even if a case of that kind were admitted for compensation it should be brought under a special Act and it could hardly be brought within the ambit of this Bill.  A number of other questions would also arise as to various types of consequential compensation if that idea were accepted.  If it were to be accepted at all, it certainly would not be in connection with this Bill.</P>

      <P>This is a point I agreed to yesterday. I thought it would be included in the revised version of the Bill, but evidently it was not noted at the time.  Instead of one month it should be three months there.  I think it was Deputy Norton who was interested in that matter.</P>

      <P>That is in relation to another section, Section 5.  I did say that.  I made that offer yesterday, that we would try to get an answer of some kind duly made by the Minister. The section sets out that &ldquo;The Minister shall consider every application for compensation under this Act duly made to him&rdquo;.  Then the Deputy had an amendment.  I thought it would be possible to have all these claims considered in the Department inside 12 months, but I am told now that that would be entirely impossible.  There are at present listed with the Dublin Corporation over 2,000 claims, and they expect a great lot more.  We would need to set up a new section in the Department in connection with this, and the staff would be occupied for more than 12 months with the claims that have to be considered and investigated; that is, the claims that have been submitted up to the present.  I should like to assure the House that so <Col N="2403" /> far as I can, as Minister for Finance, I will see to it that no unnecessary time is lost in the investigation of these cases.

It would be a very happy thing for me to be able to say that all these claims will be finished, so far as investigation is concerned, inside 12 months, but between now and the end of the Recess we do not know that there may not be another 5,000 claims.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no doubt the Minister has had many of these cases brought to his notice.  I think he will agree that one of the most distressing features of many of these claims is that <Col N="2404" /> the extent of the bereavement is so great that the persons who have suffered the loss are really bewildered and they do not know what to do.  I am no different from any other Deputy who has met some of these unfortunate people who have suffered loss.  I met one woman who has suffered very heavily and what I felt most when talking to her was that her difficulty was that she did not know what to do and if she only had somebody to whom she could go, somebody who would bring her to where relief and comfort are available, a great deal of her trials and tribulations would be mitigated.  It occurred to me that what we want in connection with this business, in order to avoid undue delay and give these people the feeling, that, pending actual financial compensation, they are not forgotten and that people are not indifferent to their sufferings, is somebody who would stand in relation to them like an almoner, who would know all the available means of relief, the Red Cross and other organisations, and also the provisions of this Bill.</P>
      <P>He would be in a position to set the woman's mind at rest and to assure her there would be somebody to go into her story.  He might have to tell her that, so far as he knew, she could get nothing under the Act, but that if she were in immediate need he would take her round to the Red Cross headquarters and see what could be done for her.  When people are grappling with a large problem such as this there should be somebody to go into cases of exceptional distress.  What would be routine and reasonable treatment for a person who had met with some incidental loss might appear harsh and unsympathetic in the case of a person who had met with an overwhelming bereavement.  I suggest to the Minister that there should be someone to whom people in that condition could be brought, in the confidence that they would receive not only what the law intended them to get but a little human sympathy as well.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a good deal of sympathy with that suggestion.  I think something on that line has already <Col N="2405" /> been done by the city manager. In that connection, it appears to me that I should have taken the opportunity on an earlier stage in the discussions on this Bill to convey my own thanks and the thanks of the Government to the city manager and to the Dublin Corporation for the promptness with which they attended to these cases all over Dublin, after the bombing occurred, at the request of the Minister for Local Government and Public Health.  As I was saying, the suggestion that Deputy Dillon has made had already been brought to my notice, that some person should be appointed to act on behalf of the corporation in a capacity such as he has mentioned.  I understood that an inquiry office had been set up in the North Strand area to which people were recommended to go, where they could get relief forms filled and claim forms supplied.  I shall be quite happy, if nothing of that kind has actually been done, to bear the matter in mind and see if I cannot use my influence to get something done even now, although, as I have already indicated, I think steps on the lines suggested were taken.</P>

He busied himself about her case and did all that was possible to relieve her perplexity.  But I do feel that it would be unreasonable to be going to a busy Parliamentary Secretary with each individual case.  If some person were specially designated to do that service generally, it would be very helpful.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>On that question, we had some discussion on the point mentioned by the Minister that he might limit the time in which applications would be kept in his office.  I understood that an amendment was to be moved to meet it.  If I had known that one was not being moved, I would have put down an amendment to Section 6 to provide that a person who had waited 12 months, and whose application had not been dealt with, would be enabled to go to the courts.  If the Minister will review that particular matter in the light of the criticism he <Col N="2407" /> may meet with when the Bill goes to the Seanad he will, I think, be driven to see that there is a lot more in what Deputy Costello said yesterday than he seemed to think at the time.  On reconsideration, I think he will find that there is no more expeditious or satisfactory machinery for dealing with these cases than the courts.  The Minister could, I think, save a good deal of unnecessary Departmental examination of these cases by allowing them to go to the courts.</P>
      <P>The Bill, in its present form, makes no provision for consequential damage of any kind except in respect of alternative accommodation, living and business accommodation, the storage and removal of furniture.  Under these headings the Minister was prepared to pay compensation up to £30, but agreed yesterday to advance the figure to £50.  On an earlier stage of the Bill I presented a certain number of cases for the consideration of the Minister and of the House.  I quoted five in all. In the first case, the actual expenditure occasioned was £59, in the second, £69 10s., in the third, £40, and in the fourth case, up to date, £59.  That case is not yet wound up because the furniture taken away is still in a store and will have to be moved back.  I indicated that there were a number of cases from the Donore Terrace area alone in which people were dislodged from their houses in January last and have not yet been restored to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I give these as sample figures to the Minister.  I did not want to make myself a source of irritation or of agitation by looking for more information in regard to these matters than naturally came my way.  After the Minister had indicated his attitude on the Second Reading of the Bill, one could have gone to a very large number of persons and got particulars from them under certain headings with regard to their out-of-pocket expenses and so on, but I did not want to be an instigator of dissatisfaction since I felt that the Minister is quite convinced that there are a number that will have to be admitted.  He has now admitted that principle.  On further review, he will, I think, have to admit an additional number.  It seems to me that the <Col N="2408" /> Minister is cutting half a head off his principle by inserting any limit.  There is a natural limit to the amount of consequential loss occasioned to a person by having to get a temporary home, by having to remove his furniture and temporarily store it.  There is a very natural limit to that, and I think it is very much less than justice, it is a kind of additional positive aggression against those people, to say that you will admit the principle that they had to incur expenditure under this particular heading but you will limit it to £50.  In the cases which I mentioned to the Minister the details do not show, but there is a very substantial difference between the amount to which the Minister is prepared to go and the figure to which the costs amounted in those definite cases.  I think the Minister will admit that it would be a very severe hardship on people who lost their homes, and who had to incur expenditure to the extent of £69 10s. in addition to all the disturbance and loss of amenities, if the Minister comes along and says: &ldquo;We will pay you only £50 of that.&rdquo;  The amount of money involved is very small, but the amount of aggravation and irritation, and the amount of wrong which can be inflicted on a family like that by piling additional debt upon them, is very great.  Most of those are people who are living in difficult economic circumstances now as a result of the present emergency, as well as the great catastrophe which has befallen them.  It is at least due to them that their out-of-pocket expenses should be met.</P>
    <P>From a human point of view, I think that is the one blemish which sticks out, because it is a thing which affects the ordinary family.  There are business concerns which will be involved in other ways.  There are people with landed property who will be involved in other ways.  But they are the kind of people who will have their organisation or their legal contacts to enable them to be vocal in a way which will ultimately get their losses attended to.  This Bill has been rushed.  I am glad that it has been rushed, so that the Minister will have some kind of legal instrument in his hand to enable him to deal with certain <Col N="2409" /> things, but, if the Minister does not amend this Bill in certain aspects in the Seanad, then I feel that, very early in the autumn, when he has found himself up against the actual details of the different cases, he will forced to amend it.  I hope that in the Seanad he will at any rate let his imagination further run over the difficulties and the problems and the losses of those families, so that he will at least be able to tackle that problem unhampered in any way by any of those artificial restrictions which are definite sources of injustice in this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Hannigan</NameTxt>
      <P>Notwithstanding the inclusion of the amendments which the Minister deigned to insert on the Committee and Report Stages, as Deputy Mulcahy pointed out in his concluding remarks this Bill leaves much to be desired.  It is regrettable that the Minister should have made up his mind that if err he must it should be on the side of extreme caution as far as payments of compensation under the Bill are concerned, rather than on the side of generosity towards the unfortunate people who have been bombed out, and rendered homeless, penniless and workless.  The defence which the Minister put forward with regard to what I think was referred to in the course of the debate as his skinflint attitude towards compensation was to boast of his wide and just stewardship in relation to public moneys.  Let me remind the Minister that there have been numerous twentieth century equivalents of the South Sea Bubble.  There have been numerous discreditable instances where sums of money amounting to hundreds of thousands of pounds were poured into hare-brained ventures which gave no return, material or otherwise, to the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those matters indicate that the Minister's conscience has not been so strict in regard to the expenditure of public moneys on such ventures as it has been as far as the payment of compensation to bombed-out victims is concerned. The one type of property owner who comes out scot free is the ground landlord.  I must say it was a great shock and a great disappointment <Col N="2410" /> to me to learn from the Minister that it was not within his competence to introduce into this Bill some clause to protect town tenants from the further ravages of those gentlemen.  Of course, I accept the Minister's word that it was not possible to deal with that matter under the present Bill, but I say it was his business to see that a Bill covering that point was introduced contemporaneously with this measure.  I should like to compare for the Minister the position of the ground landlord with that of the ordinary owner of property.  The type of property owner with whom I am concerned is not the rich owner, but the poor owner.</P>

I think this is a great pity, seeing that in every bombing incident <Col N="2411" /> which has occurred here the identity of the aircraft has been established, not only to the satisfaction of our own Government, but to the satisfaction of the foreign Government in question, and the prospects of securing adequate compensation ought to be very good.  My submission is that the Minister should have been much more concerned with adequately compensating those who were the victims of the bombing here rather than concentrating his efforts on endeavouring to save money for the foreign Government in question.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. O Ceallaigh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Appropriation Act is a routine and an essential feature of our financial system.  In its general from it is stereotyped.  It serves the two-fold purpose of (1) authorising the issue from the Central Fund of the balance of the amount granted to meet the cost of the supply services for the current financial year, and (2) appropriating to the proper supply services and purposes the sums granted by Dáil Eireann.</P>
      <P>In the first respect this Bill is complementary to the Central Fund Act, 1941, which authorised the issue from the Central Fund of the proportion&mdash; £12,350,000&mdash;of the total of the Estimates for the current financial year which had been granted on account by the Dáil; the further release from the Central Fund provided for in Section 2 of the Bill will make available for the service of the current financial year the total amount asked for in the Estimates and Supplementary Estimates for the Public Services and granted for these purposes by the Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the second respect the Bill is designed to give final and statutory effect to the Vote on Account and to the Supply Resolutions agreed to on Report by Dáil Eireann following the detailed consideration of the Estimates and Supplementary Estimates in Committee of Finance; to that end it provides <Col N="2412" /> that each grant voted for the service of the current financial year shall be expended upon the service to which it is appropriated as set forth in the schedules attached to the Bill and in accordance with the Resolutions of Dáil Eireann.  The Bill also provides for the formal appropriation of such of the supplementary and additional grants for 1940-41 as were voted after the Appropriation Act of that year had been passed.  The present Bill covers, in addition, the issue out of the Central Fund of the sum of £20, being the amount voted by Dáil Eireann to make good excesses on the grants for Old Age Pensions, £10, and Gaeltacht Services, £10, for the year 1939-40.  The Appropriation Act, like the Central Fund Act, makes provision for borrowing by the Minister for Finance; the combined total up to the limit of which he is authorised to borrow is the total of the sums authorised to be issued from the Central Fund by both Acts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The subject matter of the various measures in this Appropriation Act has been so recently before the House that it is not my intention to detain the Minister or the House very long in the observations that I have to make.  After the report of the Banking Commission, it was the general impression that some alteration would take place in the terminology of this Bill.  If we take this Bill and the previous Appropriation Act&mdash; the one which was passed last March&mdash; we find that the Minister is entitled to borrow, in the whole year, something like £40,000,000, and his borrowing powers under this are something like £24,000,000.  That is a rather antiquated method of dealing with a matter of this kind, and it ought to be brought up to date.  I think that the Minister, or his predecessor, undertook to look into that matter within the last year or two.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second matter to which I wish to refer is the size of this&mdash;reference has been made to it already&mdash;which is £40,000,000, or almost £41,000,000.  It does not appear likely that the present position of industry or commerce in the country is equal to an expenditure <Col N="2413" /> of that amount, and the sooner the Minister takes the Government into his confidence, and gives them that information, the better.  By reason of our overspending for the last four years now, there has been a very considerable addition to the sum that has to be provided annually for interest and Sinking Fund.  It must be now somewhere in the region of £600,000, and when the sum here is added to it&mdash; that is, the sum that we spend this year and which the taxation will not bring into the revenue&mdash;you have over £1,000,000 to be provided annually until that overspending in these five years has been cleared off.  Almost every year I have referred to that, and I do not propose to say any more about it now.</P>
    <P>The final thing I would say is that during the last 12 months, starting some 14 or 15 months ago, there have been many addresses by Ministers, from the head of the Government down along the line to the last Minister who has spoken on the matter, and when they make their addresses they are usually very pessimistic.  They are always warning the people, exhorting them, telling them that there are worse times coming and generally, giving them the &ldquo;creeps&rdquo; with regard to what the future holds for this country and for the people of the country.  Now, it may be quite correct that there are hard times in store for us all and for the country. At the moment, people are enduring hard times by reason of the shortage of quite a number of commodities. There is a shortage in some of the things which are most prized or most needed by people, such as fuel and tea, and a few of the people also appreciate the quality of the bread that they are now consuming.  Now, in a time of war people require to get a little exaltation of spirit now and then.  They require to see that those who are inresponsible, representative position would imbue them with courage instead of endeavouring to frighten them, and let us hope that in the months that are to come Ministers will bend their energies in that particular direction rather than the other.</P>
    <P>I am not speaking now entirely as a <Col N="2414" /> politician, although, on every occasion here for the past three or four months, when I stood up to speak on a matter of that sort, I intended to draw attention to it, but my attention has been riveted to it by conversations that I have had with professional men&mdash; medical men&mdash;on that subject.  They say, in effect: &ldquo;Take a foot-rule.  If the last inch is going to mean something particularly hard for the people, then give them at least the satisfaction of having the other 11 inches&mdash;in other words, the other 11 months of comfort &mdash;and they will probably be better able to meet whatever discomfort or hardship may come in the last inch.&rdquo;  What I am saying now is not being said in any unfriendly spirit.  I am saying this because I think it would be for the good of the people if that were done. It is possible that, owing to the cares of office and the fact that Ministers have not the opportunity of mixing so much with people, by reason of their duties and difficulties, they may not realise the necessity for that, but I think that in such times as we are now passing through, it would be much better to ensure that the people's courage would be kept at its maximum point.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the Minister winds up, there are one or two minor points I want to mention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to point out, in case there is any misapprehension, that only the Second Stage of this Bill is ever discussed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>There are only one or two minor matters I want to mention. One is something I touched on a few days ago, and it relates to the growing practice of Departments so to draw Estimates as to enable them to short-circuit the Comptroller and Auditor-General. This practice of adding notes to the foot of Estimates declaring that those sums will not be accounted for to the Comptroller and Auditor-General and that the balances will be surrendered to the Exchequer or not surrendered to the Exchequer at the end of the financial year, is a thoroughly bad practice.  It may <Col N="2415" /> be necessary in certain exceptional circumstances, but it should not be allowed to grow on the scale on which it has been growing. What actually happens is this: When the Comptroller and Auditor-General attempts to ascertain whether moneys have been spent in accordance with the Appropriation Act, he is simply told that all the Appropriation Act required was that the accounting officer should hand over these sums of the money to the persons specified in the Estimate and, when he is in a position to satisfy the Comptroller and Auditor-General that he did that, all further inquiry is blocked.  When the matter comes before the Committee of Public Accounts, if any attempt is made to extract from the accounting officer information as to the ultimate disposition of those moneys, we are told that there is no obligation on the accounting officer to follow those moneys beyond the point at which he handed them over to the person designated in the Estimate.  It is really an adaptation by the administrative Departments of a plan evolved by the Government.  The Government, when they wanted to carry out certain enterprises without being subject to Parliamentary criticism, set up semiautonomous companies and, when you proceed to ask about the activities of those companies, the Government state: &ldquo;We are not obliged to answer for the actions of independent companies&rdquo;. The Civil Service caught on to this brilliant scheme and said: &ldquo;If you remove the expenditure of public money one step away from the accounting officer you avert any criticism by the Comptroller and Auditor-General.&rdquo; This is a somewhat technical and complex problem but it is one to which I want to direct the attention of the Minister, because it comes peculiarly under his Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another problem which was very exhaustively debated last night and emphasis, I think, put on the aspect of it that strikes me.  I want to re-emphasise it now.  That is the question of the payment for grain.  I approach it from the point of view of supplies.  Everybody in this House knows that I was never in favour of <Col N="2416" /> the wheat scheme.  There is no use arguing the merits of that now, as we are committed to it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The difficulty is that as prices were discussed on a motion recently decided, it is closed. The Deputy may refer to it briefly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to raise the question of oats or barley.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Matters which can be discussed in detail on Estimates should not be raised now.  The Deputy should be brief and general.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to be both.  I do not want to touch on oats or barley, as what I desire to say with regard to them was said by Deputy Hughes last night.  There is one feature about wheat.  We are committed to the wheat policy; we have embarked on the policy; and the vital consideration now is to get the wheat into the mills. That is the important matter.  It would be a catastrophe if, having spent the immense sums of money we have in order to get wheat produced, the wheat did not turn up for bread consumption. I can recognise that the Minister for Finance is bound to play a substantial part in reviewing the guaranteed price to be paid for wheat.  I recognise that he is solicitous, as he certainly ought to be, to prevent an additional burden being put on the community.  He will naturally think that they are already bearing as heavy a burden of taxation as they can conceivably bear.  But it would be a disaster if, in his solicitude to prevent an abuse of that character being perpetrated, he went so far as to drive the wheat that has been produced into the feeding craw of the live stock of this country at this stage. I therefore urge on him strongly to recognise the vital necessity for a wide gap between the guaranteed price for wheat and the guaranteed price for the other grain crops produced, lest the price of the meal mixture composed from the grain crops should approximate or surpass the price which farmers can realise for wheat, thus inducing farmers to use wheat for feeding live stock.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2417" /> I would like to remind the Minister in the most general terms of the advice which his leader's political master has set down.  Machiavelli, in his writings on the <i>Book of Livy,</i> says: &ldquo;Although there are many good men in this world, a prudent Legislature will always assume when legislating that all men are bad.&rdquo;  I am certain that the great majority of farmers in this country will desire, having grown wheat, to make it available for human food.  But it is the marginal fellow who is the danger.  Even at 40/- per barrel, we will get the bulk of the wheat; but it is the marginal fellow who would feed flour to pigs if he thought he could do it without being found out.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I would remind the Deputy that if this matter is raised by him I cannot preclude other Deputies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>There are only two methods&mdash;inducement and compulsion. I think it is too late for compulsion, and I invite the Minister to reflect on the advice of Machiavelli.  The last matter I want to refer to is this: I desired to ask two Parliamentary questions to-day relating to supplies, but they were not in the office in time. I venture to direct the attention of the Minister to them, because I think they are urgent.  One is that oat millers in this country in certain areas have been using motor power for their mills composed of crude oil.  Crude oil is ordinarily used for buses or vehicles of that kind.  I know of one mill which had to close down and nearly 500 men were dismissed because there was no oil to keep the mill at work.  I should be glad if the Minister for Finance will direct the attention of the Minister for Supplies to that matter, so that I can find out what should be said to them, or whether there is any chance of getting the wherewithal to keep the mill going.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The next matter is that, at an early stage, the Minister for Supplies indicated that petrol would be scarce, and if persons desired to put a balloon on their motor-cars and use gas he would <Col N="2418" /> be glad to see them keep their cars on the road in order to keep garage hands employed.  Subsequently he was obliged to say that the coal shortage was so acute he could not allow them to get any more gas bags for motor cars except under licence.  I want to ask the Minister for Finance to request the Minister for Supplies to make a statement as to whether the Government wishes people to put, on commercial lorries and other vehicles that may be put off the road through the scarcity of petrol, gas-producer plants.</P>
    <P>There is no use in your putting such a plant on a lorry if the Government does not want you to do it, because ultimately anthracite coal may not be made available to you.  But if the Government feel that there is sufficient anthracite to permit of keeping a large number of lorries on the road with gas-producer plants, they ought to say so now.  On the other hand, if they think that they cannot foresee any hope that anything like a prolonged supply of anthracite coal may be made available, they ought to say so now.  So far as I can find out, most people in this country are anxious to do anything that will help, but the difficulty very frequently is that they cannot find out what the Administration wants them to do.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFagan" hpid="Mr. Fagan Mr. Fagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fagan</NameTxt>
      <P>As a big live-stock feeder, and as one who knows that farmers are in the habit of buying cake for that purpose, I have come to the conclusion that wheat is the cheapest and best feeding for live stock.  I want to warn the Minister that farmers will not part with their wheat for 2/- per stone when they can do better by feeding it to their live stock.  Farmers are not going to pay 3/- a stone for other feeding stuff when they can avail of their own wheat for that purpose.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry that I am not competent to deal with the question of feeding stuffs for cattle. That is a subject on which I am entirely ignorant.  I could not speak with any authority on it, and it might <Col N="2419" /> be very foolish on my part to make any remarks in reply to Deputy Fagan and Deputy Dillon, both of whom know more about that subject than I will ever know.  I certainly will call the attention of the respective Ministers to the questions raised by Deputy Dillon and Deputy Fagan with regard to the supplies of wheat.  There is one thing that interests me as Minister for Finance when the subject was mentioned, and that is: Where is the money to come from if the guaranteed price of these commodities has to be raised and if farmers are to get better terms?  We would all like to see them doing well, because when they are doing well, generally speaking, everyone else is doing well.  That is my problem.  What is the price of bread going to be if the cost of wheat goes up?  This question has been already raised in the Seanad: If the price of bread goes up, how will poor people buy it if the Government does not subsidise it?</P>

      <P>The people will have to get bread.  These are the reactions that follow an increased price for wheat and other corn products which have to be discussed, as they often are, by the Executive. Like everybody else, I have an interest in seeing that the people are fed.  I have an interest, just as many other Deputies have, in seeing that the poor will be able to get bread, but we have to try to balance things as best we can. As far as the Minister for Finance is concerned, he has to try to see what burden this country can bear in that way.  In his brief remarks Deputy Cosgrave reminded us that our bill for this year amounts to £40,000,000.  It is a terrible bill.  It is a huge bill for the running of this country, and I realise, not only as Minister for Finance, but as an ordinary Deputy, and as an ordinary taxpayer and ratepayer, what the cost of living is, and what the cost of keeping a house going amounts to.  It is very heavy, and it is growing more burdensome every day.</P>

I was told I was a skinflint, that I was tight-fingered, and every other adjective to describe one who holds on to the cash was used. On other days recently, some of the same Deputies told me that I was entirely too generous about spending, and that I had no control over the Exchequer.

It would suit me personally to be generous and to give out money freely.  No matter what way we look at it, even from the purely political point of view, seeing that I am a Deputy for Dublin, I am bound to get the reactions in my own constituency of what Deputy Cosgrave described as my skinflint attitude.  But I have my duty to do as Minister for Finance, and I have to try to see how far I can afford to go in the interests of the community as a whole, and in the interests of the Exchequer, without being unjust.  I may be too narrow in my views; I may be ungenerous, but I cannot help myself in that matter.  I try to be just.  I agree with Deputy Cosgrave and others that £40,000,000 is an enormous amount to expend, but it does not nearly satisfy what many Deputies demand.  They would like the amount to be more. There are schemes of one kind or another for social upliftment and for the social benefit of the people that, like every other Deputy, I would like to see introduced.  I know that Deputy Dillon speaks on that question very often, also Deputy Hickey and others in the different Parties, but we will have to wait for a day when there is more certainly as to the future.</P>

I have not made any public addresses for a long time, except to speak here, but in public addresses the Taoiseach and others of my colleagues have seen fit to speak sometimes in a pessimistic tone, and to warn the country that, moderately happy as we are at the moment by comparison, it might be that we would be much worse off in the future.  I think it is wise to warn the people that conditions may change and that we may be worse off. A year ago, we were in a very happy position.  There was then no shortage of petrol and there was as many motor <Col N="2422" /> cars on the road as ever there were, even though the cost of petrol had gone up since the war.  Tea and fuel were plentiful, and a variety of other things which are now running short and which have disappeared from our tables; our factories and our workshops were then available.  That position could not last with the development of the war.  Now we are moderately comfortable.  The winter is coming upon us and fuel, as Deputy Cosgrave reminds us, is scarce. I hope we shall be able to make arrangements so that the fuel which has been made available, the turf and the timber which have been cut, will be so distributed that those homes in places where there is no turf near at hand will be at least enabled to have fuel enough to cook their meals.</P>

I agree that, while it may be necessary to warn the people that, although they may consider themselves badly used these times, worse may be in store for them, it would be wise and probably helpful to the country to cheer the people up more, if we have any foundation for words of cheer.  I think we have good foundation for words of cheer and hope and optimism to our people in the fact that this awful calamity of war has lasted two years and we have not yet been involved, thanks be to God.  Our prayer and our hope is that that state of affairs may continue.  Deputy Cosgrave mentioned the Banking Commission's recommendations that a change of <Col N="2423" /> terminology in relation to the Appropriation Bill was necessary.  I have not looked into that matter.  I certainly made no promise in that regard and, if a promise was made, it must have been my predecessor who made it, but I shall look into the matter to which he refers.  With regard to Deputy Dillon's point as to the Comptroller and Auditor-General, I agree that he should have the right to control and the right to audit, but there may be a purely technical point and the secretary of a Department&mdash; it may relate to a kind of independent or semi-independent company&mdash;may say: &ldquo;I am not responsible and I do not account for this matter&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>I shall look into the matter, but I do not know whether we can control it or not.  I agree with the Deputy that, so far as public money is concerned, when we give out the money we ought to follow it and see where it is spent.  The country, through the Committee of Public Accounts, ought to be satisfied that the <Col N="2424" /> money is being spent for the purposes for which it was given.</P>

      <P>On the final stage of this Bill, I propose to quote a statement made by the Minister in the Seanad on the 9th instant in respect of excess profits.  The Minister has spoken to-day of his difficulty in getting money and he has asked where the money is to come from.  I think the Minister should examine the statement he made himself in the Seanad, in the course of which he gave examples of companies making excess profits which he was not able to get from them, because of their method of putting them to reserve.  The Minister said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;I will read these examples. Example 2 is an actual case.  Company B was registered six years ago, and has a nominal capital of £5,000. Its original issued capital was £3,000 held by its three directors, members of one family.  Profits for six years were £35,000 after payment of directors' fees, £15,000; profit standard, £5,000 and reserves (part), £3,000.  The company's nominal capital is now increased to £20,000, reserves are capitalised to the extent of £3,000, and bonuses issued to directors are £2,000.  New capital issued to directors in lieu is £5,000. If the recommendation were accepted, a deduction of £300 in <Col N="2425" /> respect of an artificial transaction would be given.  The capitalisation of the £3,000 reserve involved a loss of surtax on this sum.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The third example is also an actual case.  Private Company C was registered four years ago with a nominal capital of £5,000 and issued capital of £5,000.  Profits for six years were £75,000 after payment of directors' fees which were substantial but not exceptional and the profits standard was £13,500.  The last balance sheet disclosed reserves of £45,000.  If the nominal capital were increased and reserves capitalised and issued to the shareholders, a deduction of £45,000 at 6 per cent. could be claimed in a chargeable accounting period.&rdquo;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quoting from Volume 25, column 1727, of the Seanad Reports.  The Minister went on to say:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;These are four cases typical of a number of these private companies and typical of the way they could treat their reserves by capitalising them and escaping the tax.  Private Company D, another actual case, was registered six years ago with a nominal capital of £10,000 and an issued capital of £10,000.  Profits for five years available were £60,000 after payment of directors' fees, which were substantial, but unexceptional, and the profits standard was £12,500 approximately.  For the last of the five years the dividend distribution was 180 per cent., amounting to £18,000.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>The Minister talks of the difficulty of getting money.  He talks about encouraging people to be of good cheer, but I am afraid he is <Col N="2426" /> going a wrong way about it.  If Deputy Dillon says we voted for tariffs&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>We did it in the best interests of the country but Deputy Dillon would not agree that those people who have these quotas are not being controlled as they should be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a result of your voting for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not the result of out voting for them because we have no control over the tariffs and quotas. When the Minister says that we are pretty well off, I am afraid he is being too complacent about these things.  If we are going to have any kind of security or any kind of equal sacrifice among the sections of the community I would suggest to the Minister that he should deal more drastically with the people who are making excess profits.</P>

      <P>I think the Deputy probably has read part of my statement in the Seanad, as he has picked out those items, but if he has read the thing through, he has found out that I was arguing in favour of being allowed to tax these people.  An effort was being made to allow these people, to a certain degree, to go tax free.  My effort was to see that they should pay the taxes that were added this year for certain classes of companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>If certain amendments had been accepted in the Seanad, that type of company to which the Deputy has just called attention might have escaped, but the amendments were not accepted and these companies will pay their share of the tax as a result of the attitude I adopted.</P>
