      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he will state in respect of each Vote the total of which was not expended in the financial year 1940/41, the amount of the unexpended balance surrendered or liable to be surrendered to the Exchequer at the expiration of the financial year and the total sum so surrendered or liable to be surrendered in respect of all such Votes.</P>

      <P>It is impracticable to give a firm figure regarding the amount to be surrendered out of a Vote until the Appropriation Account is settled in the autumn of a year; but one of the tables which, in accordance with the practice in recent years, is being circulated in connection with the Budget will show issues made during 1940-41 for the several Votes and will compare the total issues with the total of the Estimates for that year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGovern</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health whether in view of the fact that owing to the shortage of petrol the ordinary transport business of the people cannot be carried on as usual by motor power, and that owing to the slippery condition of the roads in County Cavan this power cannot be replaced by horses, he will take steps to see that the main roads there are finished off in such a manner that they will be serviceable for use by horses and other animals.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. Ruttledge)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has on several occasions referred in this House to the slippery conditions of roads in County Cavan. From inquiries made by my Department, I understand that every effort has been made to meet objections of this kind, possibly not with complete success.  There is very little complaint of this kind from other parts of the country.  I will bring the Deputy&rsquo;s representations before the Cavan County Council.</P>

      <P>The Government has <Col N="7" /> given careful consideration to the steps which should be taken to deal with unemployment which may become aggravated with our increasing difficulties in securing supplies of essential materials from overseas, and has laid down as a first principle that everything practicable shall be done to keep as many workers as possible occupied at their normal employments for as long as possible. Among the measures which have been the subject of investigation in my Department in this connection are the abolition of overtime where possible and the adoption of schemes for short-time or rotational working.  I have also been considering the extent to which existing regulations governing what is known as &ldquo;continuity of employment&rdquo; under the Unemployment Insurance or the Unemployment Assistance Acts should be adapted to fit in with the general proposals.  I think it advisable, however, before coming to final conclusions in this matter, to seek the advice and help of workers and employers, and, as a first step, I have called a conference of representatives of organisations of workers and employers to discuss this and other aspects of the situation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. O Ceallaigh)</NameTxt>
      <P>The financial year which closed on March 31st was, unfortunately, marked by a continuance of the calamitous conflict which has brought death and destruction in wholesale measure to many peoples. It is also memorable for the spread of the horrors of this bloody conflict to nations previously outside the war zones.  Short as is the period elapsed since March 31st, even in that short time we have witnessed a still further widening of the area of hostilities and the spread of the horrible sufferings and sacrifices inflicted on ancient cities and towns.  We have become so accustomed to it that now we can read without a shudder the daily accounts of the deaths of thousands of unoffending men, women and children in the countries of the war area, massacred through the ruthless military actions of this awful struggle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While our hearts are wrung with sorrow for the afflicted peoples and our sympathies go out to them in fullest measure, the woes which have been the lot of the smaller nations since this war began must cause us to ponder long and seriously on our own position. These are times of the gravest peril and anxiety for all, but, particularly, for the smaller nations.  When we read our daily newspapers or listen to the war news on the radio, our attention is forcibly called to the fact that small <Col N="22" /> nations with histories as old as, and no less honourable than, our own have suffered grievous wrongs since this war began.  Nations whose historic past and whose great achievements have been known to us from childhood through song and story, whose peoples up to a year ago, or even less, were living their lives in peace and comfort, pursuing in freedom their ordinary avocations, not thinking of encroaching on their neighbours and with no intention of interfering with the rights of other peoples, to-day mourn the loss of many thousands of their citizens, have had their cities and towns blown to atoms and their peoples who survive them left homeless and hungry.  In some cases, these sufferings and sacrifices have not sufficed.  Practically, these nations no longer exist as free national entities.</P>
    <P>Though Ireland has not entirely escaped the savageries practised in modern warfare, the part of our national territory now under the jurisdiction of the Oireachtas has for 20 months succeeded in avoiding the major misfortune of being involved in war.  It is earnestly to be hoped that this good fortune may be prolonged until peace has been restored.  We unite with all our people in earnest prayer that this may be so.  We trust that our neutrality may continue to be respected.  It is our misfortune, however, that we, like other small nations to whose sad fate I have referred, have not the means to guarantee peace to our people.  Our duty is, therefore, so far as our strength and circumstances permit, to be prepared for the worst and for the rest to put our trust in God.</P>
    <P>It is in these unhappy circumstances and with the disturbing and anxious thoughts which such appalling conditions arouse in us that we must face the problem of budgeting for the financial year to end on the 31st March next.</P>
    <P>Though we have avoided, so far, the grave misfortune of being involved in war, we could not and did not succeed in avoiding the manifold repercussions of the war situation.  The effects of these repercussions on our economy <Col N="23" /> are too painfully familiar to Deputies and, indeed, to all sections of the community to need detailed recital here. It is, probably, with regard to our imported supplies that these repercussions have been most keenly felt. Stocks of various classes of commodities with which the country entered the war have been steadily drawn upon, in some cases to the point of exhaustion, without hope of replenishment.  Increasing shortage of shipping, due to war casualties, reduced imported supplies.  Shortage of petrol and of certain foodstuffs became noticeably acute.  The farmers were hampered by lack of fertilisers and feeding stuffs, and their difficulties were intensified by what can be described only as a national calamity.  The outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease, which has taken such tragic toll of some of our best herds, has also played havoc with our exports and affected the flow of business and the circulation of money, particularly in the rural areas.  Fortunately this dreadful scourge seems now to be getting under control, but its evil effects will persist for a long time.  It has caused me, as Minister for Finance, more concern than the many homilies, learned and otherwise, that have appeared on the state of the national finances, currency, credit and banking.  Without a sound agricultural economy, no amount of juggling with financial machinery or bits of paper will avail, no national well-being can be assured, and all progress must be arrested.  This is not to say that I am unconcerned about the condition of our public finances.  They cause me no little worry, but worry does not solve a tangle of problems which nothing short of prophetic vision can, to my mind, completely resolve.</P>
    <P>As Deputies will see from the tables circulated in connection with the Budget, the financial year closed with a deficit of £1,755,000 instead of a surplus of £4,000 anticipated in May last.  This deficit occurred despite the fact that the tax revenue, including motor vehicle duties, at £28,824,000, exceeded our anticipation by £931,000, though non-tax revenue at £5,814,000 showed a slight fall of £62,000.  The <Col N="24" /> improved yield of taxes is ascribable in the main to customs which exceeded the Estimates by £662,000, excise by £10,000, and income and surtax by £333,000.  Motor vehicle duties at £915,000 disappointed to the extent of £85,000, a minor fall in the circumstances.</P>
    <P>It may well be asked how, with this good showing made by the revenue, the results of the fiscal year proved so disappointing.  The answer is that a spate of Supplementary Estimates not only swept away all the anticipated savings of £600,000 on Supply Services, but involved much greater outlay than we expected.  These supplementaries totalled in all £4,114,000 and were mainly for defence.  The growth in recent years of this system of Supplementary Estimates is one which must cause anxiety to any Minister for Finance.  It may be unavoidable in times like these, but even in peace time the practice tended to be carried to an unreasonable extent.  The taxpayers, that is all citizens&mdash;for no one escapes the net&mdash;are entitled to know their bill for the year at the time of the Budget, and the Minister for Finance should stand between them and further demands, unless some critical need arises.  A need of this kind can, I think, be pleaded in defence of our military expenditure, and it was indeed accepted on all sides of the House.  The two Supplementary Estimates for defensive purposes made up £3,553,000, out of a total for Supplementary Estimates of £4,114,000. Outgoings from the Army Vote for the year came to £6,682,000, as compared with £2,973,000 in 1939-40, while Army pensions totalled £496,000.</P>
    <P>The deficit of £1,755,000 last year is thus attributable to our exceptional outlay on defence, and it has already been met at the expense of the large Exchequer balance with which we entered the year, viz., £3,623,000, which, of itself, represented part of the proceeds of the £7,000,000 loan floated in December, 1939.  By financing the deficit and other outgoings, this balance was reduced to £728,000 on 31st March last.  The latter figure would have been further reduced had not additional borrowings taken place during the year&mdash;<Col N="25" /> £500,000 on Ways and Means Advances and £592,000 on Savings Certificates, the latter more than offset by repayments of £658,000.</P>
    <P>In view of the interest taken in questions of supplies, Deputies may like to know how the main heads of the customs revenue turned out as compared with anticipations.  The most prolific by far of all customs duties is tobacco, which produced no less than £6,590,000 in the year.  We had, of course, the benefit for the full 12 months of the additional rate of duty of 2/8 per lb. imposed in the Supplementary Budget of November, 1939. Even so, the increased yield of duty was £1,285,000 above that of 1939-40. Sugar also suffered an increase in November, 1939, of 7/- per cwt., and this was responsible for raising the yield from £596,000 in 1939-40 to £1,400,000 in 1940-41.  Practically all other heads of customs revenue showed declines.  Tobacco, indeed, saved the situation.  It represented 55 per cent. of the total customs collected during the year, while customs duties themselves represented 40.54 per cent. of the total tax revenue, including motor vehicle duties, a proportion reduced to 31.75 per cent. for the current year, as Deputies will see by referring to the Estimates given in the White Paper, which are, of course, based on existing rates of taxation.</P>
    <P>On the excise side the principal contributor again was beer&mdash;with £3,214,000, an increase of £73,000 on the previous year&rsquo;s figure, but still £23,000 below what we had hoped to get.  It will be remembered that the beer duty was raised in November, 1939, by 12/- per standard barrel of 36 gallons, bringing the excise duty to £5 12s.  Despite dismal prophecies at that time about killing the goose, etc., the consumption of home-made beer appears to have been maintained. Reduced to terms of barrels of a specific gravity of 1055º, it amounted to 616,800 barrels in the year to 31st March, 1940, as compared with 617,900 in the previous year and 573,000 in 1938.  To some extent, this is due to a contraction in imports which amounted in recent years to around 42,000 barrels retained for home consumption.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="26" /> The excise duty on spirits netted £1,816,000, an increase of £82,000 on the preceding year.  Here again, the rate had been raised in November, 1939, by 10/-, to £4 2s. 6d. per proof gallon.  A decline in receipts under this head had been budgeted for but, despite this heavy duty, the movement was the other way.  The consumption of both home-made and imported spirits has in recent years shown a slight upward tendency, but it is impossible to draw final conclusions as to the trend of consumption owing to forestalling. There is, everywhere&mdash; amongst wholesalers, retailers and the consuming public&mdash;a tendency to lay in abnormal stocks of dutiable commodities, owing to fears of short supply, rising prices and increased taxation.  These movements tend to inflate the figures of revenue, just as the increased value per unit of imports tends to inflate the yield of <i>ad valorem</i> duties.  All these make the forecasting of revenue under particular heads a matter of extreme difficulty.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note that beer and spirits between them provided in 1940-41 £5,030,000, or 76 per cent. of the total revenue from excise.  Adding in tobacco, the total yield from these three commodities came to £11,620,000, or 41 per cent. of the total tax revenue, excluding motor vehicle duties. Advocates of increased Government expenditure would do well to ponder these figures, which illustrate in such a striking manner the extent to which taxation has gone on these commodities.</P>
    <P>One of the tables circulated to Deputies gives particulars of the gross capital liabilities of the State which, on 31st March last, amounted to £72,931,000.  Adding a sum of £9,250,000, estimated capital value of State contributions under the Housing Acts, we get a total of £82,181,000. This represents an increase during the year of £1,085,000 on the liabilities side, with which has to be coupled a decline of £2,192,000 in capital assets, making a total addition during the 12 months of £3,277,000 to the capital burden.  The decline in the assets was mainly occasioned, as stated above, by <Col N="27" /> financing the deficit and other expenditures, which reduced our cash resources from £3,623,000 to £728,000. These movements, though regrettable, are, I suppose, part of the financial history of all nations at present.</P>
    <P>Before I leave this topic of debt, I must say a word about the position of local authorities.  The latest figures available relate to 31st March, 1940, on which date the gross indebtedness of local authorities amounted to £33,879,000.  After making the necessary adjustment for State contribution towards housing and for certain electricity and technical instruction loans, the net debt outstanding was £21,200,000, as compared with £20,001,000 on 31st March, 1939, an increase of £1,199,000.  Capitalising, as an asset, that portion of the loan charges paid by tenants, at 4 per cent. for 35 years, we get a figure of £7,600,000, which leaves a total deadweight debt of £13,600,000, as against £13,201,000 on the previous 31st March.</P>
    <P>The total gross liability of the State and local authorities combined amounted to £100,207,000 on 31st March, 1940, after deducting £6,264,000 in respect of advances from the Local Loans Fund since 31st March, 1935. Allowing for an increase in the case of local authorities of about £1,000,000 during the year, the corresponding figure at the end of March, 1941, was no less than £101,546,000.  These huge figures show that we have not been niggardly in sponsoring and financing development schemes of all kinds, local and national, for the benefit of the country, and they furnish a complete answer to critics who speak as if we had shirked our duty in this respect.</P>
    <P>The purse strings have never been held too tightly here.  A liberal and even generous policy has been pursued by me as it was indeed, by my predecessor. As I explained in my Budget speech 12 months ago, I am not wedded to orthodoxy, but a Minister for Finance must necessarily be discriminatory. No Minister in my position, no matter how heterodox his financial opinions, could finance every one of the <Col N="28" /> projects that will come his way, and if he disappoints any section of its cherished scheme, his whole policy will be suspect and denounced accordingly. To those who look at the situation in broad, general perspective, we can, I think, submit our financial record with confidence.</P>
    <P>The task of a Finance Minister in a neutral country, right in the zone of hostilities, grows progressively more difficult as the war advances.  His embarrassments are twofold&mdash;a decline in revenue and a rise in expenditure. Moreover, any Estimates that he may frame under either head may be completely falsified by an unexpected turn of events.  He must, however, make some assumptions before he can proceed to construct a Budget, and the assumptions on which I have gone are that, with the help of God, our country will not be involved in the conflict that is raging round us, that some supplies at any rate will continue to reach our shores, and that, with the co-operation of home producers of food and materials, no major economic catastrophe will overtake us.  These assumptions may or may not be well-founded, and accordingly a big element of conjecture attaches to all our figures.  It is in the light of this knowledge that I would ask Deputies to study the White Paper of Estimates of Receipts and Expenditure for the year ending 31st March, 1942, which has been circulated.</P>
    <P>It will be seen that, on the basis of existing taxation, our estimates of tax revenue for 1941-42 are £26,045,000, as compared with actual receipts of £28,824,000 in 1940-41, a decline of £2,779,000.  Customs revenue alone is down from £11,688,000 to £8,270,000, a gap of no less than £3,418,000.  A variety of adverse movements has contributed to this.  Imports of all kinds from the Continent practically ceased with the collapse of France in June, 1940.  New sources of supply were, generally speaking, not available, and, where they were, the longer haul and greater element of risk attaching to it tended to reduce quantities.  Moreover, the intensification of the war effort in the United Kingdom has led to a gradual contraction in output for <Col N="29" /> civilian requirements which, in turn, will affect what we can draw from this source.  The greatest loss that we will face occurs in the mineral hydrocarbon group, from which we received in customs revenue £1,343,000 in 1940-41 and can expect only £700,000 for 1941-42.  Tanker tonnage has been depleted owing to war casualties, the demand for war purposes has been intensified and we have sustained a considerable cut in our imports which, I hope, may not be so serious for the remainder of the financial year.</P>
    <P>The sugar group is another instance of reduced import and corresponding loss to the revenue.  It yielded us £1,400,000 in 1940-41, but we can put it no higher than £505,000 in the current year, a drop of roughly £900,000.</P>
    <P>Tobacco, that saviour of the Exchequer, to which I referred already, shows an estimated decline from £6,590,000 last year to £4,785,000 in the current year, a descent that in no way impairs its position of leadership on the customs side.  Even at that reduced figure, it will produce 57 per cent. of the total customs revenue as compared with 55 per cent. in the year just closed.</P>
    <P>Tobacco has been the subject of repeated and unwelcome attentions on the part of Finance Ministers here and elsewhere, but our consuming public seem to stand up in a wonderful way to each successive impost on the weed. The thrifty pipe has been superseded by the unthrifty cigarette, and the fair sex contributes materially to this smoke screen that is so valuable to the Exchequer.  There were abnormally heavy clearances of leaf in 1940-41, so much so that, in order to preserve our limited stocks, I was forced to make an order restricting, as from the end of February last, the weekly clearances from bond of unmanufactured tobacco. These cannot now exceed 1/65th of the clearances in the year ended 31st March, 1940.  Clearances in the current year will, therefore, be reduced to about 80 per cent. of those of the standard year and, in consequence, a decline of more than one-quarter on the abnormal revenue receipts of last year must be anticipated.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="30" /> The raw material position in this industry, which is so valuable from the employment as well as from the revenue standpoint, is one of increasing difficulty and fills me with anxiety. It is dependent mainly, as Deputies are aware, on imported leaf, which comes chiefly from the United States of America.  If relief does not come before the end of the present financial year, the 1942-43 revenue will be still more seriously affected.</P>
    <P>Wine is another good revenue producer for which the import prospects are not bright.  Shipments from the chief source of supply&mdash;the Continent &mdash;have practically ceased, with the exception of the wines of Spain and Portugal.  Stocks are declining and cannot be replenished, but are sufficient to give us a yield in the current year only slightly below last year&rsquo;s. In the spirits group, brandy, rum, geneva and other sorts, the stock position is even more precarious, and substantial declines in yield have to be expected in the current year.  The revenue from piece goods of all kinds, cotton, linen and wool, as well as from clothing and apparel, is affected by the restrictions on civilian output in factories in Great Britain and Northern Ireland, while the duty on motor car parts and accessories will, for obvious reasons, suffer serious decline.</P>
    <P>This catalogue of deficiencies may seem unnecessarily long, but they are a reminder to those who would continue to pile liabilities on the Exchequer that our resources are not only limited but contracting.  Nobody has any thought of tempering the wind to the shorn lamb.  Almost every Deputy, almost every organ of public opinion clamours for more and more expenditure.  Our newspapers, it is true, praise economy in the abstract, and so do many of the Deputies, but when it comes to applying it in practice, their spirits falter, and the Minister for Finance is left alone&mdash;a voice crying in the wilderness.  I have no doubt that, in the coming year as in the past, I will be the recipient of many lectures on the need for less expenditure and less taxation, but if a <Col N="31" /> demand is put forward from any class of public servant for improvement in conditions, from any outside service for new or additional subventions or assistance in some form or other from the Exchequer, our leader writers, who, the day before, castigated the Government for its lack of thrift, will join in a chorus of commendation, and will be shocked if reproved for inconsistency. In virtually the same breath they speak of more expenditure and less taxation.  Lack of realism or of business instinct is, I suppose, responsible, but it is regrettable that the community, or sections of it, are led to believe that they can get what they want from the public purse without the painful necessity of having to pay for it.</P>
    <P>If I have so far dealt almost exclusively on the revenue side with customs duties, it is not to underrate the importance of the Inland Revenue. Fortunately, the latter is not subject to such violent fluctuations and here, of course, the income-tax and surtax stand out as our primary benefactors. It will be remembered that for the year 1939-40 the standard rate of income-tax was raised by 1/- to 5/6 and that, in November, 1939, I announced a further increase to 6/6 in the £ for the 12 months beginning on 6th April, 1940.  Exchequer receipts from income-tax and surtax in the year just closed were £7,305,000, and on the basis of existing taxation are estimated at £7,939,000 for 1941-42.  The receipts from both heads in the past year were substantially in excess of Estimates.  Trade conditions, though difficult, have been relatively better than expected, but this buoyancy is not reflected in other directions, e.g., stamp duties, where the sweepstakes have proved disappointing and are expected to yield even less in the current year.  Our other main heads of Inland Revenue, Estate Duties and Corporation Profits Tax, made a satisfactory showing and are expected to maintain their position.</P>
    <P>I now turn to our main task, the Budget for the coming year.  On the expenditure side, the chief item is the <Col N="32" /> provision for Supply Services which, as Deputies will have observed from the Volume of Estimates circulated early in March, comes to £35,323,000.  To this we have to add two sums of £102,000 for the provision of shipping, and £7,000 for the relief of distressed Irish nationals abroad, for which Estimates have already been submitted to the Dáil.  A further bill is promised from the Department of Agriculture in connection with foot-and-mouth disease. The size of it is uncertain, but it will probably be not less than £350,000. These various additions bring the provision for Supply Services to £35,782,000.  Adding the figure given in the White Paper for Central Fund Services, £4,844,000, we get a total of £40,626,000&mdash;a burden with which the country has never before been faced and with which no former Minister for Finance has had to deal.</P>
    <P>We must first proceed to make dedutions for capital or abnormal expenditure. These relate mainly to the defence provision for mechanical transport, general stores, guns, ammunition, armoured cars, anti-gas equipment and our modest Naval establishment. Further, there is provision in the Public Works and Buildings Vote for barracks, magazines, etc.  I feel justified in charging to revenue only one-quarter of this expenditure and defraying the remainder, £682,000, from borrowing.</P>
    <P>Expenditure on airports and meteorological equipment in the coming year is expected to be £220,000 and, as in the past, deducting the annuity required to meet the total estimated expenditure, calculated on a 15-year basis at 3½ per cent. interest, we get a figure of £84,000 to be borrowed.  For afforestation, I propose to charge to capital £60,000&mdash;part of the cost of acquiring land and of cultural operations.  For employment schemes, I am borrowing, as in the previous year, one-quarter of the total provision of £1,000,000; and as regards shares in Irish Shipping Limited, I feel justified in treating the whole amount, viz., £102,000, as a non-revenue charge.</P>
    <P>These various capital items together total £1,178,000, and subtracting this <Col N="33" /> from the gross figure of expenditure mentioned above we get £39,448,000.</P>
    <P>We must, I am afraid, assume this to be our net bill as no relief can be expected this year from savings.  In 1940, I assumed a figure of £600,000 under this head in relation to Supply Services, but the large volume of Supplementary Estimates undid the reckoning, an under-estimate of £2,028,000 occurring instead.</P>
    <P>From the White Paper, Deputies will see that the yield of tax revenue on the existing basis is £26,045,000, and of non-tax revenue £5,638,000, making a total of £31,683,000.  The gap between revenue and expenditure is, therefore, £7,765,000.</P>
    <P>This is a figure of alarming proportions and I must frankly say at the outset that I see no way of bridging it by normal means, that is, by economy or by taxation.  The Budget cannot, therefore, be strictly balanced, and we must succumb to the general epidemic of Budgetary malaise that has been sweeping the world, and particularly European countries, in recent years.  Of course, we have had before now Budgets that did not precisely balance according to the strict canons. Our equilibrium has, however, been more than usually upset this year, but I think Deputies will agree with me that the circumstances are entirely exceptional and abnormal.  My first drive, when confronted with the situation, was naturally to secure a curtailment of expenditure, and here the Army seemed to offer the most promising field with its Vote of £8,313,000 and Allied Services of £1,048,000.  If their defences in the field are as strong as their defender in the Council Chamber, our soldiers need fear no foe.  All my attacks were repulsed.  I suppose I am revealing no secrets when I say that not even was succour forthcoming on my side from the Council of Defence. All efforts to force economies on other Departments were equally unsuccessful.</P>
    <P>Faced with this dilemma, there seems to be no alternative but the imposition of heavy taxation.  This I am reluctant to do because of its unfavourable reactions on industry and <Col N="34" /> commerce generally, and particularly on employment.  On the other hand, we must make income more in harmony with outgoings.  We must not allow our national finances to become waterlogged, and in this attitude I am sure I can count on the support of all Parties in the House.</P>
    <P>As a first step towards meeting the deficit, I propose to increase the standard rate of income-tax from 6/6 to 7/6 in the £.</P>
    <P>The question of imposing an excess profits tax has again been explored. When this question was examined prior to the preparation of last year&rsquo;s Budget, that is to say about February and March of 1940, very few trading concerns whose accounting periods ended on dates some time later than the outbreak of war had completed the making up of their accounts, and still fewer of these accounts had reached the officers of the Revenue Commissioners. In accordance with the usual procedure prior to the introduction of the Budget, trading concerns of importance which habitually made up accounts to dates such as the end of December or the end of March were requested to furnish in advance approximate estimates of what their profits for the year to December, 1939, or March, 1940, were likely to be.  The estimates received did not in general indicate any very appreciable increase in profits and I, therefore, decided not to impose an excess profits tax last year.  Since then, audited accounts of business concerns have been coming in, and an examination of these goes to show that the advance estimates furnished by traders early in 1940 were for the most part unduly conservative. This does not mean that the estimates were deliberately misleading.  There are very many concerns in which the trader cannot determine even approximately the amount of his profit for a particular year until his stock has been taken and valued and his books have been balanced and audited.</P>
    <P>The accounts now available indicate that a considerable number of business concerns have been making substantially increased profits since the outbreak of the war and that these concerns <Col N="35" /> are mainly in the hands of limited companies.  I, therefore, propose to make certain changes in the Corporation Profits Tax and these changes include a modification designed to give the Exchequer a very substantial proportion of the increased profits which have accrued as a result of the war.  Before explaining these changes I should like to point out that it would be quite wrong to assume that a trader has been profiteering merely because he makes increased profits as a result of a situation like the present one.  The war has inevitably resulted in an increase in world prices and, therefore, in the cost to the trader of the goods which he purchases and sells.  If a trader is paying substantially increased prices for the goods he buys, charges on those prices merely his ordinary rate of profit and maintains the volume of his sales, his profit will automatically be increased.</P>
    <P>Corporation Profits Tax at present is not charged on the first £5,000 of profit.  I propose to reduce this exemption limit to £1,000.  The rate charged now on profit in excess of the exemption limit is 7½ per cent. in the case of companies incorporated in this State and on other companies trading here which keep here a register of their Irish shareholders.  The rate for companies trading here but not incorporated here and which do not keep in this country a register of their Irish shareholders is 10 per cent. I propose to increase these rates to 10 per cent. and 12½ per cent., respectively. These changes will operate as from the 1st September, 1939, the profits of accounting periods beginning before and ending after that date being apportioned on a time basis.  In addition to these changes in the existing structure of the tax I propose to impose a charge of 50 per cent. on profits made as from 1st September, 1939, in excess of a standard computed in normal cases by reference to the profits for earlier years.  In the ordinary case the standard will be the two best of the three yearly accounting periods ending on the 31st December, 1938, or the last prior date to which the accounts of the concern have usually <Col N="36" /> been made up.  The Finance Bill will contain provisions for alternative standards to meet exceptional types of case, and there will be a provision dealing with certain cases in which the trading during the standard years has on balance resulted in a loss.</P>
    <P>The effect of all the changes in the normal case will be that taking into account the 10 per cent. ordinary Corporation Profits Tax charge on the excess profit, the excess Corporation Profits Tax charge of 50 per cent. and the income-tax of 7/6 in the £ which will be charged on the balance of the excess after deducting the Corporation Profits Tax charge, a company which is liable to be assessed to excess Corporation Profits Tax will pay altogether 75 per cent. of the excess in taxation.</P>
    <P>Deputies will not expect me to detail in my Budget speech all the provisions relating to the changes in the Corporation Profits Tax which will appear in the Finance Bill.  There is, however, one further matter to which I should perhaps refer.  It concerns a very small number of companies, but to these companies it is of some importance. Where the capital of a company includes an issue of preference shares and there has also been an issue of debentures, the burden of Corporation Profits Tax falls wholly on the balance of profit available for payment of dividend to the holder of ordinary shares and the existing law contains a provision to the effect that Corporation Profits Tax shall not be collected in excess of a sum equal to 10 per cent. on the balance of profit available after payment of interest and dividends at a fixed rate.  I propose to provide that for the purpose of this provision the limit should be 15 per cent. instead of 10 per cent.  This limitation will not operate in respect of the charge of 50 per cent. on excess profits.</P>
    <P>I estimate that the effect of the changes in the Corporation Profits Tax will give me an increase in the current year of £1,400,000.  As I have already indicated, a company liable to Corporation Profits Tax is entitled to deduct the tax paid in computing its <Col N="37" /> profits for income-tax purposes.  Since income-tax payable by companies is payable in one instalment on the 1st January, whereas income-tax payable by individuals is payable in two instalments on the 1st January and the 1st July, the collection of income-tax from January to March, 1942, will be materially affected by the changes in the Corporation Profits Tax, and I cannot, therefore, count on receiving more than £300,000 in the current year from the increase of 1/- in the income-tax rate.  I estimate accordingly that the net result of the increases in both taxes will be to give me an increased yield of £1,700,000 in the current year.</P>
    <P>Before leaving the subject of the Corporation Profits Tax I might mention that I am proposing to legislate to continue the existing provision which exempts from that tax concerns such as the railway companies, building societies, and the Agricultural Credit Corporation.</P>
    <P>As I have already stated, my information goes to show that the businesses which have been making substantial excess profits are mainly in the hands of limited companies.  It is obvious, however, that where an individual trading alone or in partnership is in possession of a substantial income and that income includes substantial profits from a trade or business carried on by him, any excess profits made in the business should be brought into charge on lines analogous to those applying to a company.  I propose, accordingly, to introduce into the provisions relating to surtax a modification designed to bring about this result.  The effect of the new provisions will be that where the income of an individual in the surtax range has increased and such increase is due partly or wholly to an increase in the profits of a business carried on by him which has a standard of at least £1,000, either the increase in the total income or the increase in the business income (whichever is the lower) will be liable to an excess surtax of from 2/6 to 7/6 in the £.  The rate charged will depend on the rate already payable on the highest portion of the taxpayer&rsquo;s income, but again the effect will be that in the normal case the <Col N="38" /> chargeable excess will, as between income-tax, ordinary surtax and excess surtax, bear tax amounting in the aggregate to 15/- in the £, thus aligning the case of the individual with that of the company.  In the cases to which the new provisions apply the additional charge to surtax will operate to increase the surtax payable on the 1st January, 1942, in respect of the total income of the year 1940-41. In the normal case the excess total income will be ascertained by comparing the total income as computed for surtax purposes for 1940-41 with the average total income of the best two of the three preceding years as so computed, and the excess business profit will be ascertained by comparing the amount of the profit included in the total income for 1940-41 with the average of the best two of the three years ending on the 5th April, 1939 (or the last prior date to which the accounts have been customarily made up).  Some special provisions will be necessary with regard to exceptional cases to ensure comparison of like with like and in relation to cases in which there have been business losses. It is very difficult to estimate what the provisions for excess surtax will yield in the current year since forms for the making of returns of total income for surtax purposes for 1940-41 have only just been issued to taxpayers. As already stated, I am informed that the great majority of the concerns which have been making substantial excess profits are in the hands of limited companies and I do not propose, accordingly, to count on a yield of more than £20,000 from excess surtax in the current year.</P>
    <P>The only remaining change of importance which I propose to make in direct taxation is to increase the rates of estate duty applicable to estates of which the net capital value exceeds £10,000.  The change will operate in the case of persons dying after this date, and I estimate that it will yield £60,000 in the current year and £80,000 in a full year.  The effect is to increase by a further 10 per cent. the pre-war rates of estate duty applicable to the estates concerned, over and above the increases already effected by <Col N="39" /> the Finance (No. 2) Act, 1939.  The new rates are set out in the Schedule to the Resolution.</P>
    <P>These changes on the Inland Revenue side will, I expect, bring in £1,780,000 in the current year, which still leaves us with an uncovered balance of £5,985,000.</P>
    <P>On surveying the field of customs and excise duties, I came to the conclusion that the mineral hydrocarbon oil group, of which the chief member is petrol, could carry some more taxation.  The customs duty at present is 10d. per gallon, which succeeded a figure of 8d. imposed in 1931.  I propose to make an addition of 5d. per gallon, bringing it to 1/3.  This duty will apply to both light and heavy oils, on the same lines as at present, and is estimated to bring in an additional £374,000 in the current year.  At the same time, I propose to raise the excise duty by a similar amount from 8d. to 1/1 per gallon, but as home-refined oil is not at present being produced, no revenue will result.</P>
    <P>In regard to petrol, I am making two assumptions.  First, that substantial imports will take place during the year, and second, that all such imports will be consumed.</P>
    <P>In view of the extensive raids carried out in the past on tobacco interests, I had hoped not to despoil them further, but my needs are so pressing that a substantial increase in duty is inevitable.  The basic addition to customs duty which I am proposing is 5/6 per lb. on unmanufactured tobacco of a certain moisture content, raising it from 13/4 to 18/10 per lb., with consequential increases for the different descriptions of imported manufactured tobacco.  On excise, the basic increase will be 5/3 per lb. or 3d. less than in the case of customs. The concession of 1/4 per lb. on hard-pressed tobacco, principally plug and roll, which I granted last year will be continued.</P>
    <P>I cannot say precisely what effect these changes will have on the consuming public, but, in the light of <Col N="40" /> past experience, the retail price of cigarettes may go up by as much as 2d. for ten and 4d. for 20, while tobacco, now selling at 10½d. and upwards per ounce will be advanced by 4d. per ounce.  The benefits accruing to the revenue from these changes are expected to be considerable, amounting to no less than £1,870,000 in the current year.</P>
    <P>When one is looking for light in the midst of Budgetary darkness, what is more natural than to think of matches.  On matches we collected in excise duty £144,000 in 1939-40 and £152,000 in 1940-41.  The receipts of the latter were unexpectedly high owing to widespread purchases through fear of scarcity and of possible additional taxation.  The speculators will, for once, not be disappointed, as I propose to double the excise duty, thus raising the main rate from 3/8 to 7/4 per gross, and benefiting the Exchequer to the extent of £85,000 in the present year.  Were it not for restricted deliveries of tobacco and less consumption due to the higher price, we might expect to get even more from matches, but the aggregate receipt in the current year should not be less than £200,000.</P>
    <P>Another customs change which I am suggesting is an increase of the existing duty of ?d. per copy to 1d. per copy on imported daily newspapers. Under the Finance Act, 1933, by which this duty was imposed, exemption was allowed in the case of newspapers with an average daily circulation in this country of 1,000 copies or less.  It is now proposed to remove the exemption. This increase of ?d. is also being made effective in the case of periodicals, and certain classes hitherto exempt are being brought within the scope of the duty.  The various changes are estimated to bring in £8,000 in the current financial year.</P>
    <P>Complementary to this duty, I am also submitting a Resolution imposing an excise duty of ?d. per copy on every newspaper which is published within the State at weekly or lesser intervals.  This duty will not become operative until the 26th May and the interval will afford an opportunity to <Col N="41" /> the people concerned to make any necessary adjustments.  Certain exemptions are set out in the Resolution for religious, scientific, trade, educational and other publications.  Refunds of duty are provided for in certain cases. I anticipate a yield of £135,000 in the current year from this new tax and £160,000 in a full year.</P>
    <P>Another excise change which I have in mind relates to the betting duty. An exemption was accorded by the Finance Act, 1931, to bets made on the course by bookmakers at horse races and greyhound coursing and racing tracks and to bets with the totalisator. This exemption will cease as from 1st July next and a duty at the rate of 2½ per cent. on the amount of such bets will be imposed, giving us a return of, I hope, £33,000 for the remainder of the financial year.</P>
    <P>I have made a careful survey of the existing duties on beer and spirits, as a result of which I am satisfied that neither industry is in a position to bear further impositions.  We did increase the duties, after considerable hesitation, in November, 1939, and from the figures which I have quoted earlier in my statement, I do not think we lost on balance by the change, but over a long period, the revenue has suffered a grievous setback in regard to both beer and spirits, with consequent hardships on members of the licensed trade. Heavy taxation is not altogether responsible for the decline as there has been a change in social habits and people have taken to other forms of amusement besides the consumption of intoxicating liquor.  There is one beverage, however, which, I think, can bear a little more duty, cider.  In 1940, it was made subject to 1/- per gallon and I propose to raise this to 2/-.  Cider contains a higher percentage of proof spirit&mdash;about 8 per cent. &mdash;than porter or light beer, and even at 2/- per gallon, the rate of duty will still be much less than the average rate of duty on beer, which works out at approximately 2/9 per gallon.  The production of cider has risen substantially in recent years, and as it will still enjoy a considerable preference, its position should not be materially <Col N="42" /> impaired, Coincident with this change, I am raising the customs duty on imported cider from 5/- to 6/- per gallon.  The revenue is expected to benefit altogether to the extent of £7,000.</P>
    <P>These various changes and additions to customs and excise duties will bring in altogether, it is estimated, £2,512,000 in the year to 31st March next.</P>
    <P>I propose to make certain alterations in postal rates and telephone charges. The inland letter rate will be raised from 2d. to 2½d. and the postcard rate from 1d. to 1½d., while various changes will be made in regard to printed papers and parcels, reducing the weight which can be carried for a given payment.  I am also proposing a 5 per cent. addition to telephone accounts due on and from the 1st October next.  Under the arrangement I have made with the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, all the other changes will operate as from 1st June, and the additional revenue accruing from them, including telephones, is expected to be £190,000 in the current year.</P>
    <P>In view of its diminished income, I propose to take this year from the Road Fund only £100,000 as compared with £150,000 in 1940.  The necessary clause for this purpose will appear in due course in the Finance Bill.</P>
    <P>Deputies will remember that the difference between revenue, on the basis of existing taxation, and expenditure that we arrived at earlier in my statement was £7,765,000.  The additional revenue which I hope to raise under the various proposals mentioned amounts to £1,780,000 in the case of Inland Revenue duties, £2,512,000 in the case of Customs and Excise duties, £190,000 from the Post Office, and £100,000 from the Road Fund, making in all £4,582,000, from which a minor loss of £1,000, due to a concession in regard to imported agricultural tractors, has to be deducted, leaving a net amount of £4,581,000.  The amount of expenditure still remaining uncovered is, therefore, £3,184,000, a figure which we are justified in treating as expenditure arising wholly out of emergency conditions and, accordingly, <Col N="43" /> as appropriate to be defrayed from borrowing.</P>
    <P>In my proposals in regard to corporation profits I have been careful to interfere no more than is necessary with the possibility of companies accumulating resources in order to meet the inevitable shocks of post-war adjustment.  While others may differ with my view, I feel that the 25 per cent. margin which we have allowed to remain with them will be adequate for this purpose.  Even so, I expect to hear a chorus of complaint, but it may be well to state here and now that the Government is most anxious that there should be equality of sacrifice all round and that no section of the community could claim to have accumulated excess profits at the expense of other sections during this grave period of crisis.  In pursuance of this end, we are to-day promulgating two orders of first-class importance which are, to some extent, complementary to the proposals in regard to income-tax and corporation profits tax with which I have been dealing.  These orders place restrictions on increase of rates of remuneration of practically all classes of workers and employees in the service of public utility and statutory undertakings in certain essential industries and sheltered or protected industries and, at the same time, limit the amount that can be paid by companies either by way of dividends or remuneration of directors. Where companies have paid no dividend they will be allowed, under the order, to distribute up to 6 per cent. per annum on all their paid-up ordinary share capital.</P>
    <P>The employments to which these orders relate are set out in a long Schedule which I will not attempt to summarise here, save to say that it covers practically all who are employed in sheltered occupations and in essential or protected undertakings, whether in office or factory.  In these pursuits any increase in costs, whether arising under wages, salaries or other heads, is reflected in increased cost to the public and therefore in an increase in the general cost of living.  Agriculture <Col N="44" /> is not included in the scope of the orders.</P>
    <P>I did refer last year to the results which follow from conceding cost-of-living bonuses to offset increased prices during war time, and I pointed out that such bonuses aggravate the problem instead of solving it.  As misunderstanding still exists regarding this very important matter and as increases have since been granted to a number of categories with the idea of offsetting increased prices, I propose to speak about the matter again.</P>
    <P>When wages are raised in any particular occupation the normal practice is for the employer to recoup the additional outlay involved by increasing the cost of the service performed or the goods produced.  The increase is simply passed on to the consumer.  When the consumer is an employee, he in turn seeks to offset the increased price which he has to pay for those goods or services by demanding, if he is in a sufficiently strong position to demand, an increase in his own wages&mdash;which, if granted, pushes up in turn the cost of the services or goods which he performs or produces.  And so the mad race goes on; higher wages followed by higher costs, higher prices and again higher wages&mdash;all in rapid movement; and the dangerous sequence is unaffected by a statement of the order of events beginning, as labour unions prefer to put it, with higher prices and cost of living, then higher wages, and so on.</P>
    <P>These consecutive increases occur more rapidly and with more certainty in war time when the supply of available commodities is strictly limited and when the bigger volume of purchasing power made available by wage increases operates on the steadily diminishing volume of commodities available for purchase.</P>
    <P>Those persons sufficiently strongly placed to enforce their demands for increased profits or wages are in a fortunate and privileged position.  But what of those not so favourably situated and not in &ldquo;sheltered&rdquo; occupations?  Where they are employers they may be forced to reduce <Col N="45" /> the number of their employees and those so disemployed will then have to try to carry on with only a fraction of their former income to pay for dearer foodstuffs and commodities.  Similarly, the real value of the income of those in unsheltered occupations and of persons drawing old age or widows&rsquo; and orphans&rsquo; pensions, unemployment insurance and unemployment assistance, etc., is diminished.  The conditions of those at or near the poverty line are worsened and their standards of living still further depressed.  The largest body of consumers in the country are our agriculturists and agricultural workers.  If they were in a position to meet the increased cost of living by receiving correspondingly increased prices for exports of agricultural produce, the general position might be comparatively safe, but the fact is that while the prices received for our agricultural exports have increased they have not moved in step with the increased prices which have to be paid for our imports.  Taking the export price index number in June, 1939, as 100, the figure for June, 1940, rose to 129.8, and for February, 1941, to 155.0.  Similarly, taking the import price index number of June, 1939, as 100, we find that it rose to 156.0 in June, 1940, and to 166.9 in February, 1941.  The rise in the import price index number between June, 1939, and February, 1941, was 66.9 per cent. as compared with a rise of only 55.0 per cent. in the export price index number over the same period.</P>
    <P>If we allow to proceed unchecked the inflationary movement which inevitably follows from granting wage increases in such circumstances as exist at present, we are faced with a situation fraught with ever-increasing hardships and injustices for many.  We must expect that everyone shall be prepared to make some sacrifice in his standard of living and not hope to continue his old standard at the expense of the less fortunately placed members of the community.</P>
    <P>The first step taken in giving effect to this policy was to stabilise the cost-of-living bonus of civil servants.  The same principle was applied to officials <Col N="46" /> of local authorities who are in receipt of a cost-of-living bonus.  As employers and employees generally have not seen fit to follow the definite lead thus given, the Government is now constrained to take the measures mentioned in order to check the tendency to grant wage increases in one trade and industry after another.</P>
    <P>There are some additional items of expenditure also arising out of the emergency, to which I must now refer. They will, perhaps, be welcome after the long and bleak catalogue of impositions which I have recited.</P>
    <P>The Government, realising that the poorer sections of the community who are dependent upon assistance from various public sources are more seriously affected by the increased cost of food and other commodities than those engaged in occupations, have decided to the extreme extent that financial conditions permit to make provision for easing their burden.  I propose, accordingly, to make certain additional allowances available for recipients of unemployment assistance, and for old age pensioners and blind pensioners, and pensioners under the Widows&rsquo; and Orphans&rsquo; Pensions Acts. The intention is that these allowances will be issued in kind by way of vouchers for specified rations of milk, butter and bread.  These commodities have been selected as being amongst the most important in the dietary of the poor, and persons offering them for sale will be under a statutory obligation to supply the commodities in exchange for the vouchers issued, payment being made subsequently by the Exchequer.  The allowances will be granted only to beneficiaries under the social services mentioned who live in urban areas and townships, and so far as recipients of unemployment assistance are concerned will be issued only in respect of dependents.  Financial considerations exclude any possibility of extension of the allowances to rural or non-urbanised areas, where it may, I think, be taken that the food problem of the necessitous classes is in general somewhat less difficult, even in present circumstances, than it is in the larger centres of population.  The decision to <Col N="47" /> issue the allowances in kind rather than in the form of increased cash payments has been based in some measure on the fact that it is desirable, in the case of milk and butter, to encourage an increase of home consumption and, in particular, to provide the poor with a wholesome substitute for tea.  It is an additional consideration that the arrangement will ensure that the real benefit of the allowances will be independent of price fluctuations.</P>
    <P>The entire cost of these allowances, which I estimate at £524,000 in a full year, will be borne by the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>I propose also, with the concurrence of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, that the rates of benefit payable under the Unemployment Insurance Acts, 1920-40, shall be increased by 2/6 a week for adult dependents, and by 1/6 a week for dependent children.  These increases will involve an estimated additional annual charge of £92,000 upon the Unemployment Fund.</P>
    <P>The Government would like to feel that the local authorities charged with the provision and administration of home help would consider that they too should afford additional allowances of bread, milk and butter to those who are obliged to apply to them for assistance.  To encourage the local authorities to undertake this extra liability during these difficult times, I propose to provide a sum not exceeding £200,000 towards meeting the cost of the additional food which the boards of assistance may grant to such of the necessitous poor as are approved by them.  In allocating this subsidy regard will be had to the extent to which additional allowances for food are granted by the boards of health and public assistance over and above the amount normally granted as relief in recent years to individual applicants by the local authorities concerned.</P>
    <P>Apart from this additional provision, the estimates of expenditure with which I have been dealing contain considerable sums of benefit to the classes now suffering hardship&mdash;in the sense that they directly or indirectly afford <Col N="48" /> or stimulate employment.  The Employment Schemes Vote of £1,000,000, supplemented by £250,000 from local authorities, and £775,000 in the Public Works and Buildings Vote for new constructional works of various kinds falls under this head.  Expenditure on land improvements, forestry, turf development, Gaeltacht industries, sea fisheries, etc., and grants for housing, drainage, etc., all help to provide work. The items of this character in the Supply Services Estimates total £3,587,000.  There is, further, the provision for capital issues set out in the White Paper, totalling £1,514,000.  In addition to the £100,000 shown therein for advances to the Local Loans Fund, arrangements are being made for advances to that fund from other sources of £1,200,000.  Adding these figures, we get a grand total of £6,301,000, which represents no small effort to cope with our unemployment problem.</P>
    <P>In addition to all this financial provision I have, as Minister for Finance, given considerable assistance to the Minister for Supplies in his efforts to provide us with additional shipping, flying the Irish flag.  I have arranged to take up capital in a newly-formed shipping company up to a figure of £102,000, or 51 per cent. of the total nominal capital of £200,000.  This company will have borrowing powers up to £2,000,000, all of which I have power to guarantee.  Borrowing up to £1,000,000 has, in fact, already been guaranteed by me.</P>
    <P>The measures taken by the Government to stimulate food and turf production by individuals and local authorities have helped and will help further to find employment for many now dependent to a greater or lesser extent on public relief.</P>
    <P>I have set out for you in detail the financial situation as I find it.  I have outlined the expenditure for the current year&mdash;the expenditure for normal services and for the abnormal services arising chiefly out of the war situation, through which our ordinary life is greatly upset.  The picture I have drawn for you is not a pleasant one.  Less pleasing is the heavy additional taxation I have found it necessary to impose.  We here are victims <Col N="49" /> of circumstances which we are powerless to control or alter.  Situated as Ireland is, an island outpost of the Atlantic Ocean, within a few minutes flight from a neighbour engaged in a life or death struggle, it would be miraculous if we were not seriously affected economically and otherwise by our proximity to the war zone.</P>
    <P>Though we are neutral, I think I may claim that, to some extent, this Budget is a war Budget.  It is a war Budget certainly in so far as a considerable proportion of the additional expenditure I have had to make provision for arises directly out of the war. Of course, it is true that if we had the grave misfortune to be involved in hostilities this Budget would have had to be of a very different and perhaps a very oppressive kind.  Though so far we have managed to escape being involved, our neutrality as well as our proximity to the greatest theatre of war imposes certain obligations upon us.</P>
    <P>Neutrality may not be an heroic rôle &mdash;especially for Ireland&mdash;but, nevertheless, it is an expensive rôle.  To secure due respect for our neutrality our defence force has had to be increased. This year it costs four times as much as before the war.  The rise in the cost of living, even though the cost-of-living bonus has been stabilised, has added considerably to our expenses.  The emergency services too, though largely administered by staff borrowed from other Departments, have caused additions to the number in the Civil Service. The cost to the Exchequer of the various social services is considerable. The schemes we have had to subsidise or finance in order to procure substitutes for essential supplies from overseas, now unobtainable, add heavily to our liabilities.  These charges with many other smaller items, which added together make a respectable figure, can, I suggest, be classed as charges forced upon us by the emergency or war situation. If I did not have to provide for them the expenditure side of my Budget could be lighter by several millions.</P>
    <P>I would have been happy, and I know the members of the Dáil would <Col N="50" /> have been happy too, if instead of spending on what I may call war services, we could have spent even a moiety of this large sum on services which would stimulate production and help our people generally.</P>
    <P>The determination of peace or war unfortunately is not ours to make.  Our power to influence those who can decide for peace or war is slight.  Small as our influence may be, however, we will, as a Government, do all that lies in our power to influence the restoration of peace among the warring nations.  A just peace may it be this time and, God willing, a lasting peace.</P>
    <P>With the restoration of peace, which happy day we hope may not be too long delayed, the heavy additional load of taxation imposed by this Budget will be reconsidered.  Oppressive taxation discourages industry and increases unemployment. In our present circumstances, the additional imposts, though they do not even meet fully the increased expenditure are, I realise, a very heavy burden.  I like to look towards the day when it can be lightened with advantage to the permanent well-being of the nation.</P>
    <P>Our people in the past, remote and recent, have made sacrifices not surpassed by those of any other people for the nation&rsquo;s right to determine freely how it should live and be governed. Money was not counted in the days of those protracted struggles.  Our neutrality to-day is an expression of the same people&rsquo;s desire to live its own life free from external control or interference.  You men and women of the generation which succeeded in winning the independence we here now enjoy will not be found wanting if further sacrifices have to be called for to maintain the rights and liberties won at such cost.  In the past our people gave their lives generously, aye, lavishly, for the cause of freedom in all corners of the world.  Though the love of freedom is not less dear to us to-day nor perhaps the will to fight for it, all we ask of other nations now is&mdash;and it is the most earnest request of our people&mdash;to be let live in peace.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister, in the course of his statements, gave voice to many pious expressions.  We would be inclined to give very much more credit to the sincerity behind them if, on examination of the financial policy pursued by the Government for some years past, we could see that, occasionally, there was a balanced Budget.  We would have to go back a great many years to find a balanced Budget.  The Minister&rsquo;s predecessor, two or three years ago, claimed that he had balanced one of his last Budgets, but on an examination of the dead-weight debt, and of the figures which the Minister presented to the House, it was quite clear that his Budget was not balanced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The principal, the distinguishing, characteristic of this Budget is, of course, its size, and, also, the <Col N="62" /> deficiency which the Minister admits is practically £4,000,000.  When we examine the other side, and see the various deductions that are being made in respect of capital expenditure to be defrayed by borrowing, one can see that this figure can go up to almost £5,000,000.  In my opinion, it would be better if an honest presentation were made: if it were honestly admitted that this Budget is unbalanced to the extent of £5,000,000.  The principal consideration, not only for this House but for the country, is the very large sum of money that is being taken from the taxpayer during the current year. Although certain firms may have made excess profits, there are few people who will say that the national income has increased during the last 12 months. The country had a fairly level, an almost fixed, amount of income over a number of years, but during the period of the economic war it diminished very considerably, by some £10,000,000 or £15,000,000 a year.  The Government propose, under this Budget, to extract from the pockets of the people, as well as from the rates collected by the local authorities, more than one-quarter of what the people earn.  When the Government take up the line that people must behave themselves with regard to their demands and must be satisfied to receive less money than, perhaps, they would otherwise be entitled to claim, they ought to examine their own conduct of affairs, and see if they have been extravagant.  Are the Government the only people in the country permitted to be extravagant?  If we here take steps to ensure that people will pay their debts, are the Government to be the one exception to that?  Are they not to pay their debts, but simply to go on adding to their liabilities, leaving for their successors a huge load of dead-weight debt?</P>
    <P>In the last page of his statement the Minister, in a reference to the conclusion of the war, said he looked towards the day when the present heavy burden &ldquo;can be lightened with advantage to the permanent well-being of the nation&rdquo;.  Surely the Minister must have been serious when he made himself responsible for that statement, but how is he going to carry it out?  In <Col N="63" /> what way is the burden going to be lightened?  It would be possible to lighten it if we could increase the productivity of the country, enhance its wealth and increase the number of taxpayers who would be in a position to bear it without it being unduly burdensome. Is that the prospect, or is it the prospect that expenditure will be decreased?  So far as the Budget or any of its predecessors for the last seven or eight years is concerned, no such policy has been indicated, and no attempt has been made during those seven or eight years to encourage an increase in production in the country.</P>
    <P>Occasionally during the course of the statement reference was made to the difficulties of the present situation. Most of those difficulties are directly due to the mishandling by the Government of its responsibilities.  During the last couple of months we heard here that, when the situation of December, 1938, came under their notice the Government immediately took steps to increase stocks and to buy more goods.  Where are they?  When were they purchased?  Not in 1938, not in 1939, not in 1940.  If they had been, they would have appeared in the totals of our imports.  Imports show a figure something like £44,000,000 for 1937; £44,108,000 for 1938, when we were told that they started to buy in goods for the difficult times ahead; and in 1939, in which there were four months of war, we bought £43,414,000 worth of goods.  In 1940 the amount was £46,000,000, but it should be remembered that in 1940 there had been a very steep increase in the cost price of the imported goods.  What is the use of telling the people of this country that steps were taken to deal with the situation and in saying now that they were powerless to do anything in the exceptional and difficult circumstances with which they were faced?  Where is the tea we were told was brought in and stored in 1938?  Where is the petrol, the wheat, the coal and the other items?</P>
    <P>A very similar state of affairs is presented in connection with the terrible affliction of the foot-and-mouth disease.  Its spread was really traceable <Col N="64" /> to the inefficiency and incompetence of the Ministry.  One single case of infection came in and spread throughout the country almost like wildfire.  The cost is enormous but, perhaps, the lowest part of it is that which the Minister for Finance will have to pay.  That cost is due entirely to the inefficiency, the incapacity and &mdash;one might almost say&mdash;the uselessness of the Minister responsible and of the Ministry.</P>
    <P>If the ratepayers and the taxpayers of the future are to be put in a position to bear this burden more easily, this Budget and its predecessors give no promise as to how it is to be done. It is proposed to make certain additional allowances to recipients of unemployment assistance, to old age pensioners and so on, which will amount to about £524,000.  If I gather correctly from the statement of the Minister, it is proposed to meet this particular additional service by paying traders and that recipients will get either milk or bread or rations of some sort or another.  I suggest for the Minister&rsquo;s consideration that this allowance should be made in cash. Not alone will there be high administrative cost in connection with the working of this scheme, but there will be dissatisfaction.  It has always been the desire of people who are assisted that they should get money and not goods.  It would be cheaper in administration cost and would be more satisfactory to them.</P>
    <P>One of the items which is included in expenditure to be defrayed by borrowing is afforestation.  We will take that as a case in point.  Last year the Minister borrowed, I think, £58,000 in respect of afforestation.  The explanation given in respect of £45,000 of that was that it was land purchased during the year.  In the previous year £156,000 had been spent on that service and no money was borrowed. Surely there should be some standard of expense and no sum should be borrowed unless the expenditure is in excess of that amount?  There does not seem to be anything in the nature of continuous practice in connection with this matter.  It is a small point, but it is disturbing.  The same thing <Col N="65" /> applies to unemployment schemes.  If these unemployment schemes were in respect of a full week&rsquo;s wages and a few weeks&rsquo; continuous wages in addition, we might expect to have some asset when the work had been done, but in this present form of distribution of the money it is doubtful if they will be an asset at all.  In any case this Estimate is down something like £400,000 upon last year&rsquo;s provision for the same service.  According to the information that we have had from one Minister, there are something like 15,000 persons less registered in national health insurance this year than last year.  That would seem to indicate that there would be more unemployment this year and, if that were so, the Government seems to make provision for it by less unemployment relief schemes.</P>
    <P>The last item to which I propose to refer is the Army Estimate.  The Minister appeared to be very concerned in that connection.  It amounts to over £8,000,000.  He said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;If their defences in the field are as strong as their defender in the Council Chamber, our soldiers need fear no foe.  All my attacks were repulsed.  I suppose I am revealing no secrets when I say that not even was succour forthcoming on my side from the Council of Defence.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is the first time I heard that the Minister approached the Council of Defence in connection with this matter.  I was unaware of it.  I should have been glad to afford him every assistance in my power if he had made such application.  In my view, that Estimate of £8,000,000 should be reduced by over £3,000,000, as it contains a negligible amount for the most important item in the Estimate.  It would not balance the Budget, even if that were done, but if that were done and if it were a headline for the other services in the whole Book of Estimates it would be possible not only to bring the Estimate within the balancing period, but even to allow for a reduction in the enormous impost the Minister has found necessary this year.</P>
    <P>Finally, there is a proposal in this <Col N="66" /> series of Resolutions to bring down the excess profits tax in the charging period from £5,000 to £1,000.  It may be that some firms making a profit of £1,000 have two, three or four partners. In a case of that sort if a new imposition were to be placed upon a small firm it would be unfair.  In imposing additional taxation we should endeavour to ensure that no unusual hardship will be placed on anybody. Certainly in the case of limited liability companies with two, three or four partners earning only £1,000 it does appear to be a rather unusual imposition to charge them extra taxation. I do not know of any nor has any been brought to my notice.  If the Minister in the course of his statement says he is not bound to follow orthodox methods, that is one of the difficulties of those of us who are examining Government policy that they are neither orthodox nor unorthodox. When they are orthodox they are moving towards inflation.  When anybody else suggests inflation they say they are not orthodox but must follow orthodox methods.  Nobody knows what the Government policy is in regard to finance.  All we know is they are not paying their way; they are not trying to do it.  They ought to do it. If they were honest men they certainly would try to do it.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Finance, in the course of his Budget statement this evening, indicated that he was faced with the task of raising, approximately, £40,000,000 for Supply and Central Fund Services during the year.  He intimated that no Minister had ever before faced a task of that magnitude.  But the one surprising thing that strikes one confronted with a Budget of this kind is the fact that while the Minister is providing for increased expenditure and while that increased expenditure ought to ensure some redistribution of national income and ease the burden and the lot of the sorely pressed people of the country, the fact remains that in this year if we are going to raise £40,000,000 by taxation or borrowing, which is merely a method of deferred taxation, the struggle for life of the ordinary people of this country is going to become <Col N="67" /> harder than ever.  Recent declarations which the Minister for Supplies has been compelled to make, through sheer poverty of supplies, indicate to everybody that, notwithstanding some small concessions in this Budget, the lot of the ordinary people in the country is going to be very much harder this year even than it was last year.  We had again from the Minister in his Budget statement another declaration of his belief in a low-wage policy, another declaration of his belief that the only thing that matters in this country is to keep wages down.  If low wages could ever have made a country prosperous the Ireland of the war of 1914 to 1918 would have been the most prosperous country in the world, when she had a permanent substantial tariff in the form of the intolerably low wages paid to our working-class people.</P>
      <P>In the face of the miserably impoverished condition of life which is brought about by a policy of low wages and inability on the part of the people to purchase the necessaries of life, the Minister for Finance, almost 30 years afterwards, commits himself to the belief that that type of policy, which is the bane of our economic existence, is the one type of policy which is going to take the nation through the trials and tribulations of these war years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister talks about the vicious spiral.  Where does the spiral begin? The spiral begins by prices being permitted to rise.  The inability of the Government to control these prices naturally and legitimately encourages workers to look for increased wages, but the increase in prices precedes the demand for increased wages.  The Minister and his Government, which will not permit wages to increase, take no effective steps to control prices. The profiteer and the racketeer are allowed to batten on the public while, at the same time, two orders of first-class importance are issued, one of which has the purpose of forcing down wages while prices are permitted to increase. One would imagine that, having permitted prices to increase by upwards of 100 per cent. in many cases, the Minister for Finance would hardly have the hardihood to-day to tell us he was going now to peg the wages of <Col N="68" /> workers down to a level which seriously reduces their standard of living, while the prices of the commodities they wish to purchase are allowed to sky-rocket, as if it was the Government&rsquo;s duty to push the prices up instead of helping to keep the prices down.</P>
    <P>We are told now there is to be an increase in benefits for old age pensioners, for persons in receipt of widows&rsquo; and orphans&rsquo; pensions, for persons in receipt of unemployment assistance.  We are told this when we know perfectly well that the incomes these people have had from these sources have seriously deteriorated by the rise in prices during the past few years.  But, in any case, it is quite clear from the Minister&rsquo;s statement that only a small percentage of these people are going to get any increase, because the benefits are not to be made applicable in non-urbanised towns, and only those living in cities and towns are to get any benefit whatever.  It is not possible yet to see what the Minister has in mind when he talks about making provision for butter, milk and bread or what quantity of any of these commodities the needy people concerned are to get, but I want to say, on my own behalf&mdash;others can say it for themselves&mdash;that I think it is a mistaken policy to single out these sections of our community who are so unfortunate to have to live on unemployment assistance, widows&rsquo; and orphans&rsquo; pensions, or old age pensions, and say to them that they are the one section of the community that cannot buy their own milk, that cannot buy their own bread and that will not be permitted to buy their own butter.</P>
    <P>It is a fact that these people live on benefits of that kind which indicates that our economic position is very bad indeed.  It seems to me that it would be a far better policy, instead of labelling these people as a kind of untouchables who must get vouchers for food, first to provide them with work and, if we cannot provide them with work, at least enable them to purchase the necessaries of life in the same way as any member of this House or any Minister can purchase his.  It should not be the position that the only people who cannot manage their own <Col N="69" /> affairs are the people who, first of all, are victims of a system that we permit to continue.</P>
    <P>There is no provision whatever in this Budget in respect of the serious unemployment problem with which we are confronted to-day.  The Budget, in that respect, is like the Budget of last year or the Budget of ten years ago, or even the Budget of 15 years ago, but we are not living under similar conditions.  We are living now in 1941, and facing, as has been admitted by the Minister for Supplies, a crisis of the first magnitude.  Into that crisis we are going with the hoary old weapons upon which we relied in times of peace&mdash;weapons which gave us such miserably unsatisfactory results&mdash;and with these hoary old methods and weapons we hope to be able to find a solution of an intensified war problem. The Minister was very careful not to make any detailed references to the steps he proposes to take to grapple with the growing unemployment problem. It may be said, of course&mdash;it has already been said from the Government Benches&mdash;that the cutting of turf will provide a good deal of employment this year.  It will provide a fair amount of employment in areas where turf is available, but only up to about the end of September next, even in these areas.  What is to be the position from September until the following April, even in respect of the rural areas where turf is available?  Does anybody believe that we can cut turf from September until the following April?  Yet no provision has been made for the unemployment which will be caused when the cutting of the turf has ended.  You cannot cut turf in the City of Dublin or in the City of Cork, or the other big cities throughout the country, and what are the workers in these areas to do?  It is in these areas, probably, that the greatest unemployment will result during the next 12 months.  Yet no provision whatever is made for facing up to the type of unemployment which is going to be caused in these areas: no provision for utilising the labour of the unemployed people in these areas.  In so far as the question of dealing with unemployment is concerned, this Budget is like many <Col N="70" /> of its predecessors.  It suffers from want of vision and want of courage, and the Government now, apparently, have lapsed into a state of coma in respect of unemployment, quite satisfied, evidently, that it is easier to let it continue than to have the courage and the vision to face up to the problem and solve it.</P>
    <P>It was pleaded by the Minister for Finance&mdash;incorrectly, so far as the Council of Defence is concerned&mdash;that it was necessary to raise substantial sums of money for national defence.  I was never unprepared to spend money on national defence, once that money was wisely and properly expended, but that is an aspect of the matter that has not come before the Council of Defence in any detailed way.  If it is desirable, however, to spend money on national defence&mdash;and I do not question money that is well spent on it&mdash;I think it is equally desirable to spend money in defending the homes of our people, and in defending the standard of living of our people.  This Budget indicates that we are going to make no attempt whatever to defend effectively the homes of the people.  And so far as the standard of living of our people is concerned, this Budget, by its low-wage policy, indicates that we are going to make war on the standard of living of our own people.  Every enlightened economist in the world rejects the philosophy enshrined in the Minister&rsquo;s speech: that keeping down the incomes of wage earners is a remedy for any problem.  The most disastrous kind of remedy that could be applied to the position is one which will allow prices to rise while incomes are kept in a static condition.  I hope the Minister will take counsel with, and learn from some people within this State, or even learn from people outside the State, that an attempted solution along these lines is not going to give this country either stability or prosperity, but that it will only mean the same miserable standard of life as that which we knew of in the days of the last war.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;Surtax is charged on any individual whose total income exceeds £1,500 at rates which increase at each step of the income.  The rates in force for 1931-32 to 1937-38 were increased for 1938-39 by 10 per cent. in the case of incomes between £3,000 and £8,000, and by 15 per cent. in the case of incomes over £8,000.  For 1939-40 the increase of 15 per cent. was altered to an increase of 20 per cent. as regards incomes in excess of £20,000.  The rates rise from six pence in the £ at the bottom of the scale to 7/6 in the £, the higher rate being charged on the amount of income in excess of £20,000.  The proposed extension of surtax is to charge excess surtax at the rate of 7/6 in the £ on the part of the income representing increased profits of a trade or business carried on by the individual, in so far as the increase is reflected in his total income.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>(1)  That the duty of customs imposed by Section 21 of the Finance Act, 1935 (No. 28 of 1935), shall, in respect of hydrocarbon oil chargeable with that duty which is imported on or after the 8th day of May, 1941, be charged, levied, and paid at the rate of one shilling and three pence the gallon in lieu of the rate now chargeable by virtue of sub-section (1) of Section 11 of the Finance Act, 1939 (No. 18 of 1939).</P>
      <P>(2)  That the rebate allowable under sub-section (2) of the said Section 21 of the Finance Act, 1935, shall in respect of hydrocarbon oil on which such rebate is allowable and which is imported on or after the 8th day of May, 1941, be allowed at the rate of one shilling and three pence the gallon in lieu of the rate now allowable by virtue of sub-section (2) of the said Section 11 of the Finance Act, 1939.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(3)  That the duty of excise imposed by the said Section 21 of the Finance Act, 1935, shall, in respect of hydrocarbon oil chargeable with that duty which is sent out, on or for sale or otherwise, from the premises of the manufacturer thereof on or after the 8th day of May, 1941, or is used by such manufacturer on or after that date for any purpose other than the <Col N="79" /> manufacture or production of hydrocarbon oil, be charged, levied, and paid at the rate of one shilling and one penny the gallon in lieu of the rate now chargeable by virtue of sub-section (3) of the said Section 11 of the Finance Act, 1939.</P>
    <P>(4)  That the rebate allowable under sub-section (4) of the said Section 21 of the Finance Act, 1935, shall, in respect of hydrocarbon oil on which such rebate is allowable and on which the excise duty mentioned in the next preceding paragraph of this Resolution was paid at the rate of one shilling and one penny the gallon, be allowed at the rate of one shilling and one penny the gallon in lieu of the rate now allowable by virtue of sub-section (4) of the said Section 11 of the Finance Act, 1939.</P>
    <P>(5)  It is hereby declared that it is expedient in the public interest that this Resolution shall have statutory effect under the provisions of the Provisional Collection of Taxes Act, 1927 (No. 7 of 1927).</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFrancisOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that this particular tax, as things are at the moment, is a particularly unjust tax. As far as we are aware, at the present moment the bulk of the petrol consumed in the country is consumed by people for purposes other than pleasure&mdash;lorrymen, taximen and others whose means of livelihood depend on driving a car, a van or a lorry.  This particular five pence a gallon, while it may sound small putting it that way, is an extra income-tax of from 5/- a week to £1 a week on a small number of people.  Unless consideration is given to some arrangement such as was made in this country during the Great War when petrol was fairly heavily taxed, whereby a special rebate of a proportion of the tax was allowed to those who used petrol as a means of getting their livelihood, I think this particular tax should be opposed.  Under war conditions as far as petrol is used by anyone for pleasure or recreational purposes, I would not object if the tax was considerably higher than the tax outlined here, but, where comparatively humble folk have <Col N="80" /> got to earn a livelihood by a petrol-driven vehicle, I think this tax is, to say the least of it, an ill-advised and brutal tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said in his Budget statement that he hopes to be able to get £374,000 additional revenue in respect of taxation on mineral hydrocarbon oils.  I wonder if the Minister can tell us at this stage, because it would give us a better perspective of the position, whether we may assume that petrol will be available for consumption by motor users during the remainder of this year on a more generous scale than was available during the past few months, or whether it is hoped, for instance to stabilise the issue of petrol rations on the level of the supplies which were issued for the current month.  If we could have some information as to the availability of petrol supplies in relation to this tax, it would help people to understand the position more clearly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the remarks which have been made here, I have tried to do a sum in arithmetic, and it appears that the Minister was expecting to get in 12,000,000 to 14,000,000 gallons of petrol and have that available for distribution.  I think that is the calculation.  I do not know if the Minister can confirm that.  It would look as if that were the amount which is expected to be available.  Can the Minister confirm or deny that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not object to the remarks made by Deputy O'Higgins with regard to this additional imposition on petrol.  It is a heavy tax, a very heavy tax.  But if I do not put it on petrol, where am I going to get it?  It has to be got somewhere. A tax on petrol is as just&mdash;or much more just&mdash;as a tax on tea or sugar and other things which I could suggest.  There are Deputies opposite, and Deputies on my side of the House too, who would make strong protests against a variety of other taxes which might be suggested as a substitute for the tax on petrol.  The money has to be got.  The petrol tax will hit a certain number of people, admittedly, <Col N="81" /> and will hit some of them sorely, perhaps, but it cannot be helped in the present circumstances.</P>

      <P>It may happen that there will be a good deal of overlapping. With regard to the matters raised by Deputy Norton and Deputy Dockrell, as I said in my statement, I have to make certain assumptions, and amongst them is the assumption that we will get in petrol.  I assume for my purposes that we will get in 16,000,000 gallons.  That is my assumption, but I cannot guarantee that, and nobody could; nobody in this House can say that we will get that quantity in.</P>

      <P>Resolutions Nos. 9 and 10 deal, one might say, with the same tax, though they affect separate sets of individuals.  I should like the Minister to go more deeply into the merits of this particular proposal. According to his statement this afternoon, he hopes to get £33,000 out of this tax for the remainder of the financial year.  I presume the total sum that might be expected in the full year would be £50,000.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>This tax is going to be put upon Irish racing, which can ill afford it at the present moment.  I do not know whether the Minister has ever gone into the question, but I am aware that a few years ago there were something like 1,500 horses in training in this country, and they ran for stakes worth about £70,000 or £80,000, which meant an average of £50 for each horse.  The people who wager on an Irish racecourse are mainly those engaged in the horse-breeding industry, in the training of horses, or who own horses.  From all I can gather, there is not much money in it and, from the information I have, it cannot afford this particular impost.</P>
      <P>I noticed in the financial returns for last year and the year before that there was a very considerable drop in the betting duty.  The duty which is collected in turf accountants&rsquo; offices throughout the State is largely on English racing and occasionally on Irish racing; the majority of the bets would be on English racing.  The tax there would not upset the racing economy of the country, generally speaking.  It would be simply a tax on certain people who follow racing, principally in England, and it would not interfere at all with the prosperity of the industry, as it is called, here.</P>
      <P>If this proposal is carried into effect the Minister will hear during the next 12 months about the damage that it will do.  It was our experience, up to 1931, that a very strong case could be made for having this duty remitted.  A relatively small number of people would be asked to contribute this amount. From the information that was conveyed to me about it, some of them would wager as much as £25,000 or £50,000 in the year, not being more than £500 or £1,000 out in the whole transaction.  How that is done, I am not going to explain, because I do not know; in fact, I do not know that it would be possible for anybody to get precise information.  One can see, however, that there will be a very considerable impost upon those persons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The keeping and training of numbers of horses afford a considerable amount of employment.  It is not, perhaps, <Col N="88" /> one of the industries that would appeal to men like Henry Ford, or the type of man who writes about finance&mdash; Keynes.  It is a type of activity, the interruption of which would throw many people out of employment.  Will the Minister consider, between this and the time the Finance Bill is introduced, increasing the betting duty, as such? That would not&mdash;interfere with Irish racing as much as would this proposal. We were given to understand some years ago that this would interfere with Irish racing.  The duty upon an ordinary wager on an English race might be 5 per cent. or 7½ per cent. It could certainly bear 7½ per cent. much better than the course betting here could bear 2½ per cent.  Perhaps the Minister will consider the matter and take advice from persons who have more experience than I have?  He may then be disposed to alter this particular tax.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>A similar provision was embodied in the Budget in 1932 and 1933, but was withdrawn by the Minister during the course of a discussion on the Financial Resolution.  It was explained that Irish racing was, in fact, suffering by the imposition of a racecourse betting tax and the Minister was sufficiently impressed to withdraw the proposal.  The position of Irish racing is as bad now, if not worse, than it was at that period, owing to causes arising out of the war and by the recent restrictions on the movement of animals due to the outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease.  The amount that will be raised by this tax on Irish racing will not be considerable. It is expected that it will be only £33,000.  I suggest to the Minister that he might look into the matter with a view to endeavouring to amend the proposal, so as to exempt betting on Irish racecourses, whatever may be done in respect of betting in bookmakers&rsquo; offices on races run in England.</P>

      <P>One matter escaped my attention when I was speaking, concerning oats, which form a considerable part of trainers&rsquo; expenses. The cost is now twice what it was in 1930 or 1931.  In addition, Irish <Col N="89" /> trainers have had to withstand an invasion from other places.  There has been less racing in England and consequently greater competition for prizes here.  In the circumstances, the proposal might be reconsidered.</P>

      <P>I suppose any Minister for Finance in circumstances like the present has to concern himself with what might be called industries or amusements.  I suppose racing could be called an amusement and also an industry, and if I had to tax it, and tax it heavily, I suppose I would be regarded as a kill-joy.  I would hate to be regarded in that light.  I do not know very much about racing.  I do not know anything like what Deputy Cosgrave knows about it, or maybe Deputy Norton, who comes from a racing constituency.  He may know something about the stables and maybe he gets &ldquo;an odd good thing&rdquo; from the horse&rsquo;s mouth.  I am quite willing to adopt the suggestion of Deputy Cosgrave to reconsider the matter but I would like to get the money.  If the suggestion the Deputy made would give anything approaching what I hope to get from the present proposal I would be happy.  I do not want to hurt Irish racing or to hurt any other Irish industry but the money has to be got.</P>

      <P>Following on Deputy Cosgrave&rsquo;s statement on the Budget as a whole, I should like particularly to underline this as a tax that would be absolutely unnecessary but for much futility of the general Governmental administration of affairs.  I suggest to the Minister that he should look at the space and the type of stuff that was pumped out on Government advertising intended to organise people on proper lines to meet the emergency and to deal with compulsory tillage.  It was urged on the Government that the county committees of agriculture should have had an opportunity of cooperating in bringing the compulsory tillage policy into operation, but the Department of Agriculture intimated that it was able to look after that side of the business, and had all the machinery and inspectors that would be required.  I should like to have an estimate of the total amount of money that was spent in pumping advertisements into newspapers throughout the country, appealing to parish councils and sundry bodies to give their aid in getting the compulsory tillage policy into operation, so that the necessary amount of work would be done this spring.  It would be quite unnecessary to have this tax if the work of Government departments had been carried out, as the particular type of advertising that was indulged in on a large scale could have been avoided, particularly during recent months.  It would help the Minister and help the people, who get very little for what they are paying for their newspapers at present, if things could be left as they are, and if there was a review of the amount of money that has been spent unnecessarily in advertising, and on a type of advertisement that is not doing the work that the Government thinks it is doing.  Apart from intending to impress on people the necessity of doing certain work, it is simply impressing upon them the idea that the Government does not know how to do its business but is just beating the big drum.</P>

      <P>Some other provisions are inserted further down the Resolution, and I take it that Resolution No. 24 refers to excess profits corporation profits tax; in other words, the excess profits tax which used to prevail has now gone by the board and is replaced by Resolution No. 24.</P>

      <P>I should like the Minister to take some imaginary figures for a particular company and tell us what is going to happen under this Resolution.  I think the House would require some explanation from the Minister as to why, in respect of a tax so onerous as this, he goes back to a year which has been completely closed. Take a trading year running from 1st September, 1939, to 1st September, 1940.  The company closed its accounts on that date, made whatever disbursements from its profits were necessary in the very difficult circumstances of that time, and made use of whatever <Col N="109" /> moneys were available to it from these profits to consolidate its business in order to enable it to weather the difficult times of the present period and the even more certain difficult times that were then, and are now, looming ahead.  I think it frightfully unjust for a Minister for Finance at this hour of the day to put huge taxation on moneys which might have been available on 1st September, 1940, but which may have been absorbed in one way or another in order to secure the maintenance of the industry, the continued employment of its employees and future supplies for the industry.  They find now, when perhaps the money is not available, that they have to pay a large sum of money.</P>
      <P>In face of the general position of industry at present, when we consider the importance which everybody must attach to the maintenance of it and the comparatively little provision made, compared with the amount provided last year, for maintaining people on Government schemes or relief, industry must this year, in spite of its difficulties, do even more than it did last year to maintain its people in employment, if the country is to be maintained and the Minister is to get his taxation. There is no part of the Minister&rsquo;s proposals for taxation of which the House would require a more careful explanation than this proposal, so that we can examine it and so that the industrial community, and even the workers dependent on the maintenance of industry, can thoroughly understand it and see whether it is equitable that these proposals should be gone ahead with, or that they should be modified or minimised.  Some sample industry ought to be taken and the position in this regard explained to the House.  In addition, a very good case would require to be made to the House for going back over the year ended 1st September, 1940, and imposing taxation of this kind in respect of it before the House could reasonably agree to it.</P>

As I said already, it has not been the practice, but with regard to Deputy <Col N="110" /> Mulcahy&rsquo;s point, I will give an example.  The reason I have to go back to this year is that I have to get the money, and it was commonly stated here, and outside as well, that we were allowing all sorts of people to get away with huge profits, especially during the war emergency.</P>

      <P>Deputy Mulcahy asked for an example of how this will work out.  I shall give two examples. In the case of an Irish company, or a foreign company which maintains in this country a branch register of its members resident here,&mdash;there are some notable exceptions but they are not many&mdash;the margin of exemption we propose to reduce from £5,000 to £1,000 and we propose to increase the rate from 7½ per cent. to 10 per cent. corporation profits tax.  The corporation profits tax payable on profits of £1,000, under the law as it stands, would be nil, and, under the proposed amended law, nil.  I shall give the Deputy a copy of these figures.  On £2,000 profit, the amount payable under the existing law would be nil, and, under the proposed amended law, £100; on £5,000 profit, under the existing law, nil, and, under the proposed amended law, £400; on £6,000 profits, under the existing law, £75, and, under the proposed amended law, £500; and on £10,000 profits, under the existing law, £375, and, under the amended law, £900.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of a foreign company, the margin of exemption is again being reduced from £5,000 to £1,000, and the rate increased from 10 to 12½ per cent. The tax payable on profits of £1,000, <Col N="111" /> under the existing law, would be nil, and, under the amended law, nil; on £2,000 profits, under the existing law, nil, and, under the amended law, £125; on £5,000 profits, under the existing law, nil, and, under the amended law, £500; on £6,000 profits, under the existing law, £100, and, under the amended law, £625; and on £10,000, under the existing law, £500, and, under the amended law, £1,125.</P>

Reference has been made in the course of the debate, I think by myself, to the fact that we shall have to have recourse to a Referendum in the hereafter if further changes have to be made.  I think we are brought up against a situation which makes it abundantly clear to most of us&mdash;to me certainly&mdash;that this occasion should have been taken advantage of to incorporate in the Constitution an amendment which would have rendered comparatively innocuous the motion which appeared on the Order Paper and which the Minister for Justice did not move.  The fact is that I have the most complete confidence in the personal integrity and high sense of public duty of the present occupant of the Ministry of Justice.  But that does not alter the fact that I view with the utmost possible alarm the introduction by him, or any other Minister for Justice, of a motion to remove a judge from the Bench when I know that that motion can be carried by a bare majority of this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the public know that any dispenser of justice in this country cannot be <Col N="118" /> removed from his high office without the consent of all the political Parties in the State, then the public know that between them and the Executive stands an independent person who is a judge who can, if he deems it his public duty, bid the Executive defiance and depend on the Legislature to protect him from any attempt to victimise him for his act in protecting the individual from the vengeance of the Executive.  If, however, the public come to believe that, if a judge displeases an influential member of the Government Party of the day, whatever Party that may be, that influential member of the Government can prevail on the Government to sponsor in this House a resolution removing him from the Bench and that resolution can be carried, I envisage the danger of abuses arising in this State of the gravest possible kind.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Very good.  The purpose of any Constitution, as I understand it, in general is to protect the people of a country in certain important matters against absolute power.  When Constitutions were first conceived of they were the guardians of the people&rsquo;s right as against monarchical power.  By a slow growth of popular opinion, when Parliamentary democracy came to be regarded as a proper institution in certain countries, the terror of the tyranny of the monarch was replaced by a similar terror which was the tyranny exercised by a Party majority in a Parliamentary House.  Constitutions were supposed to be drawn with certain fundamental rights so protective that the process of law could not take away those fundamental rights or could not whittle them down to a point when they were negligible.</P>
      <P>The progress under the Constitution that we are discussing has been towards making law superior to the Constitution.  The progress right along since the Constitution was introduced has been to make the Constitution itself subservient to the ordinary law, and the ordinary law, of course, is passed by a simple majority in a House which contains a Party majority.  That progress is still further marked by the amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendments have been introduced which still further strengthen the law in its relation to the Constitution.  I had put down some amendments which I had thought it would at least be advisable to have discussed in order to get the other picture painted, to see a Constitution which would be tied and which could not be changed: <Col N="121" /> that in any event, whether the Constitution itself could be changed or not, what are called the fundamental rights could not be operated upon by, say, the will of a Minister, or the will of a Minister backed up by a Parliamentary majority.  We have increased the power of the law in this Constitution. In the amendments that have been made in the Constitution, we have gone a step further in the situation which I have tried to paint.  The fact that the Constitution can be suspended indefinitely is of little account.  What is of account is, that the protection of the Constitution to the ordinary people, in regard to their fundamental rights, is gone.  It will be remembered that in this House an Act called the Offences Against the State Act was passed.  It was sent, under the Constitution, for the opinion of the judges as to its constitutionality.  I do not pretend to give the full effect of that judgment, but it did amount to this: that, in respect to any fundamental right in the Constitution, where that is embedded in any phrase which drags in the law, the judges will not be curious to find, if some piece of legislation encroaches on a fundamental right, whether that right was in tow with the spirit of the Constitution or not.  They will simply take the piece of legislation and look at it.  They will see whether it was regularly passed, and if it was, that is what ties them, so that all the fine phrases in the Constitution with regard to fundamental rights go.</P>
    <P>One of the best phrases in the Constitution was in regard to the freedom of the person, but that was subject to law.  The Offences Against the State Act attacked that fundamental right and left it dependent, first of all, upon what a judge declared to be a judicial opinion expressed by a Minister.  That was changed to what a Minister certified for, but that was in no way to be regarded as a judicial statement.  If one surveys the Constitution that we are discussing, I think it will be found that the law on similar matters that are of no great importance sometimes, if they are put in prohibitory clauses, cannot be changed.  They seem to be quite bluntly put there so that they cannot be changed.  The rights that <Col N="122" /> are of any value, such as the right of personal freedom, the inviolability of the home, the right of association, the right to express views, the right to vote, rights with regard to religious views&mdash;they are all subject to law, and, being subject to law, then, in the opinion of the judges on the Offences Against the State Act, may be changed by a Party majority in this House. The independence of the judges, although enshrined in a fine phrase, goes further in that it says they are independent, subject to the law and the Constitution.  We go further in this constitutional amendment that has been passed.  It will be found that it was by inventing offences, and by putting people into jail for inventing offences, that tyranny was first worked upon people, but if one looks at the articles that deal with offences, and the method of their trial, there is, first of all, the general statement that &ldquo;justice shall be administered in public courts established by law by judges appointed in the manner provided by this Constitution.&rdquo; Having made that statement the Constitution, previous to the amendment recently passed, allowed for the exercise of functions of a limited judicial type to be carried out by people who are not judges.  Apart from criminal offences and the provision for special courts and military tribunals, as if the law had not sufficient sway over the Constitution, a further amendment was added last week on Report Stage.  I do not know whether it is intended that that amendment should go as far as, in fact, it does go.  I understand some suggestion was made to the effect that a rigid interpretation of the phrase used in the Constitution&mdash;that justice shall be administered in public courts&mdash; might prevent a court being cleared for certain cases.  If that was the situation in which the amendment was passed it was an amazing situation, because under a statute of this House the court has to be cleared for the hearing of certain cases.  Nevertheless, we are being asked to rectify that situation. The rectification is achieved in this way.  As well as I remember, the Article in the Constitution used to read in this way:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="123" />&ldquo;Justice shall be administered in public courts established by law by judges appointed in the manner provided by this Constitution.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is now to be struck out, and the Article that has been inserted reads:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Justice shall be administered in courts established by law by judges appointed in the manner provided by this Constitution and in public save in such special and limited cases as may be prescribed by law.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I would like to know what is the exact position with regard to the reservation that has been tacked on to the end of the new amendment.  It says that justice shall be administered in courts established by law by judges... in public &ldquo;save in such special and limited cases as may be prescribed by law.&rdquo;  There can be no doubt, I think, that that reservation applies not merely to cases in public, but to the hearing of cases by judges.  If that be so, then we have taken a further step. We have courts in which limited judicial functions may be exercised by people who are not judges.  We have the criminal courts, but they may be set aside.  We have the special tribunals and the military tribunals, which may be instituted, and now we have this reservation tacked on to the end of the Article in the old Constitution.</P>
    <P>People have mixed feelings with regard to any constitutional document if you tie things down too rigidly.  In an emergency you may find that you have not sufficient elasticity in your powers to deal with an emergency situation.  On the other hand, if you have not some provision to tie down the Executive of the day, you are simply trusting the fortunes of the people, their religious views, their personal freedom, the inviolability of their homes, the right to free association, the right to speak their minds freely, over to the will of a Government majority in one House.  On that, I want to refer to a point that Deputy Dillon made. It may be said, of course, that there are two Houses, that legislation requires to be passed by both Houses, and that, therefore, apart from a motion to remove <Col N="124" /> a judge, even if the law governs everything, the law has to run the gauntlet of two Houses.  We must, however, remember the situation that we are in now.  If we had adopted the American system in which the Seanad was built up in a sort of lagging position behind the building up of the Dáil, then you would have got the position in which a new Government, when it might be apt to be tyrannical, would be tied by an Assembly which had not been thrown up by the same political majority.  It would be a brake on it.  The brake would be realised as the Party majority filtered through the other House.</P>
    <P>We did not do that.  We have adopted in the Constitution a scheme of having a Seanad going out of office with the Government.  When it is re-elected, it is re-elected under the same sway of political opinion as that which elects the new Dáil.  Therefore, as far as the election goes, the Seanad is almost certain to reflect the political strength of the new Dáil.  For fear it would not reflect that strength enough, power is given to the new Taoiseach, a person thrown up at the general election, to nominate a certain number of his adherents to the Seanad.  The result is that the Seanad is certain to be much more under the control of the Party that governs than the Dáil itself is.  In these circumstances, the protection of the Second House disappears. That is the situation in which we now find ourselves.</P>
    <P>It may be that, in steering a course between the two points of the dilemma, we have tied ourselves by being too rigid, and not leaving ourselves enough elasticity to deal with an emergency, and, on the other hand, asking the people to trust themselves to a Parliamentary majority.  It may be that it was necessary to swing away from the rigid system.  At any rate, if anyone feels that this Constitution is going to tie the hands of any Government he should disabuse himself of that idea, because the law is supreme.  The Constitution is underfoot as far as the law is concerned.  The law will emerge from a Party majority in this House. If there is also with the Party in this House a Party majority of the same <Col N="125" /> complexion in the Seanad, and if it be thought that in these circumstances there is really any importance to be attached to a written document, then I say the people who think so have not fully considered the effect of the document.</P>
    <P>I said that we have taken one further step.  As a result of what I have said, I find myself unable to be excited about that further step.  We have allowed this House the power to extend the national emergency, when it occurs, in such a way that the Constitution may be suspended.  We have passed phrases here which have changed the Constitution in such a way that it could be set aside, and acts done under certain legislation could not be invalidated, if those acts were done during a time of conflict, war, or armed rebellion.  The &ldquo;time of war&rdquo; was amended by increasing the phrase to mean a period in which this State was not engaged in conflict, but when there was a national emergency voted by the two Houses of the Oireachtas.  Now we find ourselves in the position that, once a national emergency resolution has been passed, it is necessary that each House, by another majority, should vote that the national emergency has passed, before the Constitution regains whatever life it had in it. Feeling that the Constitution is not much of a safeguard for the people, I cannot complain very bitterly of that.</P>
    <P>There is observable here the tendency &mdash;which is usual with loosely-worded documents&mdash;that, instead of tying the hands of the Executive, great care is taken, in the First Amendment of the Constitution, to increase that power; and again, in the Second Amendment of the Constitution, care is taken to extend it still further and to increase the power of the Executive by making it more supreme.  It appears that, once an emergency has been voted, it requires positive action on the part of this House to bring that emergency period to a close, in order that the Constitution may again be operative as far as the courts of this country are concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to make further reference to a matter which I <Col N="126" /> raised on a previous stage of the Bill, in the hope of obtaining further clarification from the Taoiseach.  When the Draft Constitution was under consideration in this House, there was in it an article which up to now has been described as Article 56, and I refer particularly to paragraph 5.  It seemed to me that the effect of the Article was to recognise that certain people who had Constitutional rights or statutory rights previously should not have those rights trampled upon nor their agreements torn up in any capricious fashion. With that end in view, a phrase was put in to Article 56:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Nothing in this Constitution shall prejudice or affect the terms, conditions, remuneration or tenure of any person who was in any Governmental employment immediately prior to the coming into operation of this Constitution.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>If that phrase meant anything, or if the manner of its introduction meant anything, it clearly meant that the rights persons had prior to the coming into operation of this new Constitution would be saved, and that this clause was a saving clause to preserve those statutory or Constitutional rights.  One can scarcely imagine that the Taoiseach recognised in that clause any other meaning.  Whatever meaning he then desired, surely the reasons for attaching that meaning to it, and recognising its necessity, are as important to-day as they were then; but apparently, the Taoiseach has some other viewpoint on the matter now.  Notwithstanding what appears to be the saving value of that clause, he comes along now to add to the Article, as a step-down from that position, the phrase that:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Nothing in this Article shall operate to invalidate or restrict any legislation whatsoever which has been enacted or may be enacted hereafter applying to or prejudicing or affecting all or any of the matters contained in the next preceding sub-section.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to ask the Taoiseach what value he attaches to that paragraph 5 of Article 56 as it stands at present with the addition of the amendment now proposed.  It seems to me that it <Col N="127" /> would have been much more honest to delete paragraph 5, as its value has been completely destroyed by the new sub-section.  The Taoiseach ought to tell us why he regarded Article 56 as well and satisfactorily drawn when it was going through the House, and why he now finds it necessary to amend it in the manner proposed in this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to deal with the remarks of the last speaker first.  When speaking on the Second Stage of the Bill, I believe I answered the question put to me now by the Deputy.  I pointed out the intention in Article 56, Section 5.  There could be no doubt regarding the intention, as it so happens that the records of the Dáil indicate it very clearly.  An amendment was proposed here designed for another purpose&mdash;to put the State servants affected by Article 10 of the Treaty in a special privileged position by means of the new Constitution.  We refused to do that.  We said that the meaning of this Article was that the passing of the Constitution as such was not intended to affect their position&mdash; that is, that the mere passing of this Constitution would not affect the existing position, which was that their rights depended on an Act of Parliament which could be repealed or altered if the Oireachtas so decided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was said that, under the old Constitution, they had a Constitutional position; but the old Constitution was a very different one from this, as the old Constitution could be changed by simple legislation.  Therefore, in fact, the public servants to whom Article 10 of the Treaty related had only the rights guaranteed to them by the Legislature, and if the Legislature wished at any time to change those rights it could do so, If those rights were incorporated in a definite form in this Constitution, they would be given Constitutional rights which could not be changed by the Legislature but which would require a referendum.  The question is as to whether this Article in the Constitution expressed exactly what we intended it to express.  Was there a doubt that it might be used in the sense of the amendment we had <Col N="128" /> refused to accept, had voted against and defeated?  We wished to make certain that the position after the passing of this Constitution would be the same as before&mdash;that is, that the mere passing of the Constitution would not affect rights which were embodied in an Act of Parliament but, at the same time, that it would not be used to prevent the Legislature at any time dealing with those rights.  In other words you have here an addition proposed to make that quite clear.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Nothing in this Article shall operate to invalidate or restrict any legislation whatsoever which has been enacted or may be enacted hereafter applying to or prejudicing or affecting all or any of the matters contained in the next preceding sub-section.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was intended to clarify the position, lest there be any question whatever as to the point which Section 5 was intended to cover.  It is not introducing something new, but is maintaining the previous position.  It is simply a question of making clear that there would not be read into that what was intended by the amendment which was introduced at the time the Draft Constitution was being discussed in Dáil Eireann.  We want to make sure that the passing of this Constitution did not affect that position and that whatever rights they had would still remain untouched. These, in our opinion, were embodied in the 1929 Act.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>This is simply a precautionary measure.  As far as we are concerned, we put in that as a precautionary measure lest it might be said by anybody that this really meant what the amendment which we rejected at the time was intended to mean.  In other words, the question here is whether this really meant that <Col N="129" /> the passing of the Constitution would not affect the position.  That was the intention.  And then the question is, could it be read in a wider sense and could it be said that, in fact, by this they are getting Constitutional rights and their position is being guaranteed in the way suggested in a Resolution which was moved at the time&mdash;I forget who it was that moved the Resolution. It may have been the Deputy.  Somebody moved a Resolution which would prevent the Legislature from passing a measure which would prejudice their position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the wider questions of the Constitution as a whole which have been raised by Deputy McGilligan, his own remarks make it quite clear that he is fully conscious of the difficulty there is, on the one hand, to try to secure and protect in the best possible way the rights of the individual as against the Executive or against Parliament or, in our case, a majority in Parliament and, on the other hand, to give to Parliament the powers to protect the State.  At various points you have to try to decide how far you can go in one direction without endangering the interests of the other. In time of crisis, if the State is to last, the Parliament must be in a position in which it can defend the State and take the measures that are necessary to ensure its security.  It is quite true that unless you completely tie the hands of an Executive, an Executive that is inclined to be tyrannical may abuse its position and may pretend that there is a situation which needs strong action when, in fact, no such situation exists and it is a question of the individuals that constitute the Executive taking a wrong view of a situation or being tyrannically inclined. That has been certainly before my mind in all this question of the Constitution since we first had to deal with it.  I said that when we were introducing the Constitution.  It is natural that an existing Executive is inclined to go too far with its precautions, perhaps, on the one hand, whereas the Opposition, on the other hand, looking at it from the other angle, is inclined to go too far in the other direction.  I think, at any rate, that this is a fair compromise and I certainly would feel very <Col N="130" /> uneasy from the point of view of the safety of the community if we tied the hands of the majority in Parliament or the Executive any more than they are tied here.</P>

We would have to start the discussion right from the beginning.  These things were worked out in the cases of the particular Acts that were going through and, in the case of a document of this sort, there is this conflict between the desire on the one hand to limit the powers of the Executive, lest they be abused, and, on the other hand, to give them ample powers to be rightly used. Whenever a definite choice came up to me, at any rate, I came to the conclusion that the public interest would be best served by making it possible for the Executive in a case of crisis to defend the State and to protect the State.</P>

      <P>With regard to the superiority of law, in general, where law is mentioned here and where it is possible to make regulations by law it is intended that the law would work out the details.  The general principles are laid down in the Constitution and, by law, the details are to be worked out.  Again, I am not going to deny for one moment that people of ingenuity and those who are prepared to use that ingenuity in a wrong direction could by means of the details work contrary to the general principles that are laid down or in a way which is not intended.  I am quite willing to admit that, but again I think it would be quite impossible for us to produce any document of a reasonable size which would even cover some of the cases that might suggest themselves to any person who throws himself an imagination into the possible difficulties that might arise and the possible cases that might arise.  On the whole, we have to take the position that a body of representatives who have been elected by the people will ordinarily act in good faith and if the situation is reached in which they are prepared to abuse their position and abuse their power to the extent that is suggested when we are asked to amend these Articles in definite ways, then there is an end to popular representation in the ordinary way; a new situation is come about; you are practically into a revolutionary situation in which a coup has been effected by the Executive, because that is what it would practically mean.  If they are prepared to do the one thing, they are prepared to do the other.  The only thing is, I agree with those who would like to provide if it could be done&mdash;it would be satisfactory&mdash;that any such person with such desires should not appear to be able to do it under the cloak of the Constitution.  I am quite willing to admit that.</P>

      <P>That request did not come either from Deputies opposite or from me.  It was the result of an outside suggestion, and I do not think that agreement on the Deputy&rsquo;s amendment would have got us out of our difficulties.  However, as I have said, there are two points of view, as I am sure the Deputy is very well aware, and there is the difficulty of getting the right balance between the two.  Having to choose between the two and, if you like, having chosen rather on the side of strengthening the hands of the Executive to deal with abnormal situations, I think we have taken the wiser decision.  We could have gone, of course, in the other direction and tried to make it impossible for the Executive to take the action which prudence at the time might suggest should be taken.  We had to choose between the two, and I think we made the best choice, and personally I believe that if the Deputy himself were responsible for bringing in a measure of this sort and had to make a choice, he would make the same choice.</P>

      <P>The question of liberty has been discussed by the courts, and they have said that they have not power to prevent such abuses. The Taoiseach used a phrase, which rather struck me, to the effect that the law is only working out the details of the Constitution.  There is a very short phrase in the Constitution about personal liberty&mdash;just two lines&mdash;in which it is stated that &ldquo;no citizen shall be deprived of his personal liberty&rdquo;, and it ends up with &ldquo;save in accordance with law.&rdquo;  We worked out the details in connection with the Offences Against the State Act, and it amounted to this: that if a Minister says that a man ought to go to jail, then he goes to jail.  He is simply deprived of his personal liberty.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is designed to bring under control certain privileged institutions, notably Edenderry creamery.  I understand, of course, that Edenderry creamery is operating under a special licence of the Minister.  There is a licence to buy milk in the old creamery area in Edenderry but Deputies should bear in mind that there is no price fixed.  The creamery can buy milk at their own price and send it to the city. While the Minister can at any time withdraw the licence, we suggest that <Col N="137" /> the chairman of the board should have some control in that respect.  If at any time this institution desired to expand its operations by buying milk in other districts, and sending on more milk than it is at present sending, it might not be desirable.  I suggest, therefore, that this control should be vested in the chairman of the board.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that the case of Edenderry creamery, which the Deputy wants to deal with in this amendment, would not be covered by this section because this deals with registered creameries.  As far as registered creameries are concerned, as I explained here on Second Reading, I gave an undertaking to certain creameries who supplied the city during the fall of 1939 when the strike was on here that they would be permitted to continue to supply milk to Dublin.  I do not think that I could agree to give the chairman of the board any discretion with regard to the removal of those creameries from the list.  This amendment would give him that power.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister say what control is in operation at the present time to restrict this creamery in expanding its operations?

The Minister agrees that the price at which they purchase milk is not a fixed price and is it not desirable to have that creamery under control?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That particular creamery is confined to suppliers of the old creamery area.  That is the only limitation there is there at the moment.  If the Deputy will remember, when we were dealing with the Principal Act, we discussed this particular case very fully.  There are two sides to the question. There is the side of the suppliers who had this market and we did not think it fair to deprive them of the market.  There was the other point of <Col N="138" /> view, that milk was coming from outside the scheduled area.  I do not think the arrangement has been abused in any way, as far as I know.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">

      <P>We are only trying to provide against the possibility of abuse.  We have no objection to the suppliers of that creamery preserving their market here, but in the event of any desire on the part of that institution to expand its operations here, I take it from what the Minister said that they will have no power to expand, that they are operating under a licence and that they can only buy in the old creamery area?</P>

      <P>We were told on the Second Reading of the Bill that the purpose of this section was to give representation to a limited company.  My interpretation of the section, as it is worded, is that the Minister will have power, for instance, to nominate a panel of his own choice&mdash;simply to produce a panel to the producers and say: &ldquo;You must elect from that panel.&rdquo;  I think it is necessary to preserve their right to elect members of the board from their own number.  While I do not believe it is the intention of the Minister to deprive them of that right, as the section is worded at present he has power to do it.  If the Minister would accept the amendment, it would clarify his intention to preserve the rights of producers to elect a board from a panel nominated by themselves.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>In this section we are amending Section 12 of the Principal Act by removing these words, &ldquo;from amongst their number&rdquo;.  As I explained on Second Reading this is being done to give an opportunity to partners in a firm or members of a private company to be elected.  Paragraph (a) of Section 12, sub-section (1) of the Principal Act states:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;There shall be elected to be ordinary members from amongst their number by the persons who are registered on the qualifying date in the register of producers kept by such board, the appropriate number of producer members.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="140" /> If we leave out the deletion of the words &ldquo;from amongst their number&rdquo;, I do not see how it can be argued that the Minister comes into the matter at all because the paragraph would then read:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;There shall be elected to be ordinary members by the persons who are registered on the qualifying date... the appropriate number of producer members.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It says plainly that the board would be elected by the producer members.  The same thing would be applied to the retailer.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that at the termination of the strike the Minister gave an undertaking to the Milk Producers&rsquo; Association that any creamery which had not put in equipment prior to 1st July would be excluded.  As a matter of fact I have a copy of the letter to that effect.  That is the reason why we suggest that that date should be fixed. It may be argued by the Minister that the war conditions have upset the possibility of the creameries putting in the necessary equipment, but even at that time it was considered that the <Col N="145" /> period up to July was a considerable period of time.  Those who were interested pointed out to the Minister that a long period of time was given. The plea was made that it was difficult to obtain equipment, and it was for that reason that 1st July was fixed.  I do not think the Minister should depart from that now.  I think he should agree to this amendment, and fix the date which he undertook, by letter to the Milk Producers&rsquo; Association, to fix, namely, 1st July.</P>

    <P>&ldquo;(5)  If any person (in this sub-section referred to as the vendor) who is a registered retailer or a registered wholesaler in respect of a joint district sells milk to another person (in this sub-section referred to as the purchaser) who is a registered retailer or a registered wholesaler in respect of such district at a price less than the price which would, if the vendor were a registered producer in respect of such district, be the appropriate statutory minimum price, each of them, the vendor and the purchaser, shall be severally guilty of an offence under this sub-section and shall be liable on summary conviction thereof to the penalties mentioned in the Schedule to this Act.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>&ldquo;or if any person who is a registered producer, retailer or wholesaler, attempts to buy or attempts to sell milk at a price below the appropriate statutory minimum price such person shall be guilty of an offence under this sub-section and shall be liable on summary conviction thereof, to the penalties mentioned in the Schedule to this Act.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I understand one of the greatest difficulties in the administration of the old Act was that it was necessary to be in a position to prove a person sold or bought the milk at less than the minimum price before there could be a prosecution.  It was insufficient for the board to prove that attempts were made to sell at less than the fixed price.  This amendment is put down for the purpose of making even an attempt to sell at less than the fixed price, an offence.</P>

      <P>I am told by lawyers that an attempt to commit an offence is <Col N="148" /> actually an offence under the common law.  Where we lay down anything to be an offence, it is triable under the Act, but the other aspects come under a Conspiracy Act, or something of that nature, where one conspires to commit an offence, and it would be triable in that way.  I am told it is unusual to put in the ordinary laws anything about attempting to commit an offence.  That is covered generally under the heading of conspiracy.</P>

      <P>Before Section 23 to insert the following new section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>If any person (in this section referred to as the vendor) who is a registered producer in respect of a joint district makes to another person (in this section referred to as the purchaser), who is a registered retailer or a registered wholesaler in respect of such district and to whom the vendor has sold milk, any payment, by way of rebate, refund, discount or allowance howsoever in relation to the sale of such milk, which would have the effect of reducing the price of such milk below the appropriate statutory minimum price, each of them, the vendor and the purchaser, shall be severally guilty of an offence under this section and shall be liable on summary conviction thereof to the penalties mentioned in the Schedule to the Principal Act.</P>
      <P>This sets out to deal with an offence that is alleged to be rather common&mdash; where a purchaser agrees in a contract to give the minimum price, but there is a secret agreement that the purchaser will get a hand-back from the seller. This sets out to make it more illegal still.  I think the Principal Act covers this point, but the intention is to lay particular emphasis on it, so that the section can be quoted if anybody is doing that sort of thing.</P>

A man honourable enough not to stoop to that sort of thing finds that the wholesaler&rsquo;s car passes by his gate and leaves the milk there, while the man who gives the hand-back and evades the law by secretly agreeing to do so gets his milk collected every day.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to restrict sales during the months of May, June and July, the flush period.  The <Col N="151" /> Minister may suggest that the board can control the position, by requesting the creameries to reduce supplies during these months.  That would be more or less in their own interest, seeing that the price then is not attractive, and that there is the risk of the milk turning sour.  But representations might be made by some local interests that might have a strong pull, asking the Minister to allow supplies to be brought in from particular areas during that period, and it might be difficult for the Minister to regulate supplies, or to effect a sufficient reduction to provide for the sale of milk from the production area.  Perhaps the Minister would agree to let the chairman decide the matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I can only repeat what I said on amendment No. 2.  Under the Principal Act certain creameries supplying milk to Dublin city were safeguarded by being allowed to continue doing so.  Then there was a second list of creameries which supplied during the strike period, and they got an undertaking that they would be permitted to enter the Dublin market.  The amendment would be entirely against the understanding come to with the original creameries, and also with the second group that came along since the strike.  It should be possible to come to some agreement with the creameries. It is fairly obvious that there is practically no profit whatever for them during this period, as the amount they would get by sending milk to Dublin then would hardly cover their expenses. It certainly would not give any profit. There was also the great risk of the milk going sour during those months. On the other hand the creameries would be anxious to get back to the market about the end of July.  That is why I think there will have to be some sort of an arrangement between the parties so that the creameries would be safeguarded, provided they agreed to keep off the market during the flush months.  This year that question will not arise.</P>

      <P>The price should be stated so that producers would know what they were to get.

      <P>The price as set out in the contract is the minimum price and people when making contracts do not know whether it will last or will change during the year.  If it is not set out then the minimum price will be paid. I do not see what advantage there would be in putting down a price. At present the contract is a daily or a weekly one.  It would be a great mistake to put in a monthly period, because if the purchaser found it more convenient to buy a good deal of milk for three weeks and less milk for the fourth week it would be bad for the producer. At least the quantities should be stated per day or per week. The Deputy does not mean that the farmer should supply 300 gallons a <Col N="153" /> month.  It would be better that he should supply 75 gallons a week or ten gallons a day.  The shorter the period the better it would be.  Otherwise the purchaser could put the supplier to great inconvenience.  In my opinion it is not necessary to state the price.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 17:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before Section 28, to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>A board may, on being satisfied that deliveries of milk under any contract have fallen short of, or exceeded the basic contract figure by an unreasonable amount and that no reasonable excuse exists for the variation, impose on the person responsible for such increased or reduced deliveries a levy not exceeding 2d. per gallon on the amount by which the deliveries varied from the basic contract figure and may pay such levy in whole or in part to the aggrieved other party as compensation.</P>
      <P>The decision of a board as to the offending party shall be final, and where, in their opinion, the responsibility for the unreasonable departure from the contract is shared by both buyer and seller, they may impose such levy on both parties to the contract.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that it has been the practice of some wholesalers to enter into a contract for an amount far below the normal amount of milk taken from the producer.  If a producer can supply, say, 50 gallons, the wholesaler agrees to take 50 gallons, but enters into a contract for 20 gallons.  He takes the 50 gallons during a certain period of the year, but, when the flush period comes along, he pushes the producer down to the 20 gallons in the contract, or less, so that there may be a wide variation over most of the year between the contract figure and the amount taken by the wholesaler.  It is <Col N="155" /> to prevent that sort of practice that I move the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>My information on that point is that it did take place when the Act came into force at first, but not for the past couple of years, because the producers&rsquo; association itself stopped it.  That, of course, is the only way in which it can be effectively stopped.  If a producer is willing to do what the Deputy says, that is, to make a contract for 20 gallons, to take 50 gallons during the scarce season, but to take only 20 gallons during the summer months, he is not the type of person who is likely to report it, and nothing can be done about it.  If he goes to his own association, however, I think they will make things right for him.  They have kept things straight for the past couple of years.  In the first year, as I say, there was quite a lot of trouble of the kind the Deputy speaks of, but I have it on the authority of the association itself that they have not allowed it to happen for the past couple of years, and I think it is only the association could stop it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>The association have informed me that it is happening still, and I put down this amendment at their request.  They complain that that type of case, of a nominal contract and the producer being tied down to that contract when there is a surplus of milk, is still occurring.  If that is so, it is wrong to permit it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think you can cover it by a penal clause of this kind, because I am afraid the producer who <Col N="156" /> accepts such a contract is not the type who will have the matter brought before a court.  He will probably put up with it, and it is only the producers&rsquo; organisation which can give a bit of backbone to such people, and get them to report it to the organisation and have it settled by them.  We are trying to see what we can do about the surplus milk period.  It is not going to arise this year, I am almost certain, and I think we are, even still, asking more milk from the creameries than they usually supply.  It looks as if we shall have another 12 months in which to think about the problem.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>Over and above the normal work of the Minister&rsquo;s Department, the other work falls for consideration under two main headings: firstly, organising the increased production of food to meet, as far as possible, our national requirements both in human and animal food and so bridge the gap left as a result of the falling off to an almost insignificant quantity of the imports of food and raw materials for the production of food, due to the indiscriminate destruction of shipping in the blockaded zone; secondly, the work of grappling with and eradicating the foot-and-mouth scourge.  Examining the position, one is forced to the conclusion that there was, in reality, no food plan or no organised effort at a food plan.  At most, there was simply an appeal to the farmers by the Taoiseach and the Minister, in this House and, occasionally, on visits down the country, to produce more food on the ground that it was their patriotic duty, and their responsibility as Irishmen, to produce sufficient food for our requirements during this emergency.  That was their conception of a food plan&mdash;coupled with a Compulsory Tillage Order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it must be admitted that that was not enough.  I have no doubt that when the estimate of the acreage under cultivation comes to be made this year, the result will be very disappointing. This is the first time in the history of <Col N="158" /> the country, under a native Government, that we had to face an economic crisis of the first magnitude, and I had hoped that we would be able to face up to the problem and show that we had organising ability and capacity to deal with it.  I do not believe in recrimination, and I do not suggest that a retrospective examination in that respect would serve any good purpose. It is sufficient to point to a few things that should have been done.  The farmers should have been protected from the avarice of the opportunist and profiteer in the purchase of his seeds and manures.  The Minister&rsquo;s attention has been drawn to the operations of that type of individual on many occasions in this House.  It was pointed out to the Minister that, even on his own scheme of licensing certain individuals to assemble seed wheat at a price of 2/6 over and above the fixed price of wheat, he had a basis for fixing a fair price for the seed when sold back to the farmer.  There were some merchants in many parts of the country who charged exorbitant prices for seed wheat.</P>
    <P>Then, we had the question of artificial manures &mdash; an essential raw material for the production of grain for the coming year.  The price of superphosphate in England was £5 a ton and here it was £8 a ton&mdash;£3 of a discrepancy.  Those are matters which required the attention of the Minister and his Department forthwith, but very little was done to get an adjustment of the price which would make it comparable with that in Britain, with the result that the farmers were fleeced by manure manufacturers in this country.  The attempt to provide credit for farmers was a very poor one and many farmers found it exceedingly difficult to expand the acreage under cultivation owing to lack of sufficient credit facilities.  Taking into account the increase in the cost of production and the acute shortage of raw materials necessary for the production of food crops, a guaranteed price should have been fixed sufficient to ensure that farmers would get a net return equal, at least, to their profit prior to the emergency. I am not suggesting that the agricultural community should take <Col N="159" /> advantage of the times to amass money. I do not think that they could do that in any case but I have no doubt that the price fixed at present will not give to the farmer a net return equal to that which he enjoyed prior to the emergency, taking into account the increased cost of production.  There should have been far more co-operation between the Department and the agricultural community, and more help should have been given the farmers in their effort to increase production during the present year.</P>
    <P>Let me give an example of what I mean.  Recently, the Minister had to enter upon and compulsorily acquire certain farms for tillage purposes.  It was very late in the year when that occurred.  It is very doubtful whether that land, ploughed at that time of the year in a very slipshod and rough way, will give any return.  It is very doubtful whether it was in the national interest at that time to put that land under cultivation, the period of the year being so late.  We should have profited by what was done during the last Great War, when the Department of Agriculture sent inspectors through the country to ascertain how far farmers were complying with the Tillage Order.  They discovered in non-tillage counties that farmers lacked equipment. They had no means of doing tillage and, when they attempted to set land by conacre, they could not find anybody interested.  In those circumstances, the Department co-operated with the farmers in securing the necessary help to get that land into cultivation. They went into the tillage areas and asked people to send horses and ploughs into the non-tillage districts to do the necessary cultivation for those farmers who were unable to secure horses for hire.  They offered an attractive return for horses used in that way.  There was nothing to prevent the Department, in the present emergency, from inviting people with tractors to go into those districts and do that class of work for farmers who were not in a position to provide equipment for themselves.  They could have done that and offered a decent return to those who would give the use of their <Col N="160" /> tractors.  There was no co-operation, and no attempt by the Department, to help the farmer under the Tillage Order.  That co-operation was forthcoming during the Great War, and it is extraordinary that a native Government should have lacked the necessary sympathy and foresight to afford that co-operation to our people.  One would expect that help would have been extended by the Department to those upon whom the nation depended for food for the coming year.</P>
    <P>Again, the Government set up parish councils, and parish councils could have given a great deal of valuable assistance by co-operating with the agricultural community in the many problems confronting them.  Take the credit and seed problems.  The local parish councils could have gone to individual farmers to encourage them in their work.  If their work involved increased cultivation, they could ask them if they had any seed problem or credit problem or anything like that.  The Minister may say that a farmer could apply for a loan to the Agricultural Credit Corporation, but the Minister ought to realise the type of individual he has to deal with.  A lot of our people hate writing letters; it is the last thing many farmers are prepared to do.  I suggest that more use could have been made of the local parish council or the local agricultural committee.</P>
    <P>In Great Britain, agricultural committees interest themselves quite a lot in that sort of work and give help and assistance and co-operation to individual farmers in facing these problems. What happened here is that there was no attempt at an organised plan of State assistance, and no sympathetic help or consideration by the Minister&rsquo;s Department.  The farmer was left absolutely and completely on his own. He was simply told that he would have to face up to a compulsory tillage order, and that if he was not prepared to do it or was not able to do it he would have to get out and the State would do it for him.  I do not think that is the attitude that ought to be adopted.  I think it is absolutely wrong.  I know for a fact that certain <Col N="161" /> farmers&rsquo; lands have been entered upon by the Minister, operating through the local authority, and acquired for tillage purposes.  I take it that the Minister&rsquo;s inspectors reported early on that an effort was not being made by these farmers to till the quota that they were bound to till of one-fifth of the arable land.  In that case the Minister should have taken time by the forelock and organised some means of doing that other than the system of taking over the lands by compulsion.</P>
    <P>At present we are absolutely and completely in the dark as to where we stand with our food production campaign this year.  I suggested before that there should be an early census of production taken.  There was nothing to prevent the Minister getting the Guards on the job in mid-February in order to find out what our position would be.  Any farmer at that time could tell accurately what he had sown and what he proposed to sow during the season.  A census could have been taken even on the 1st February, which would give an indication of where we stood.  If a further effort was required in March, while there was still time to do the work, the work could have been done.  Now, at the end of the sowing season, we do not know where we stand. The Minister was asked a question to-day about the acreage under wheat and his reply was that the weather was against the early sowing of winter wheat; that he felt that the effort at early sowing was disappointing, but that he was satisfied that there was a considerable increase in the acreage under spring wheat over last year. Yet, I understand that within the last few days the admixture of Irish wheat for the coming year was fixed by the Minister at 50 per cent.  That was a very pessimistic figure, but I presume the Minister is right.  I am afraid that the figure will be very disappointing. If that figure is correct, it means that we shall have to find 50 per cent. of wheat or wheat substitutes for our bread requirements next year.</P>
    <P>In dealing with this question of wheat, Deputy Dillon expressed certain views on the last day we were discussing this Vote that were somewhat at <Col N="162" /> variance with my views, and I think with the views of other Deputies in this Party.  I think that our attitude about the wheat scheme during the present emergency should be made quite clear. No matter what Government is in office I think that we have to advocate the growing of as much wheat as possible during the emergency period. But what we do object to definitely is a Government wheat policy that encourages people to grow wheat on every type of soil irrespective of whether the soil is suitable for the production of wheat or not, and to grow wheat intensively. The intensive production of wheat means exhaustion of the soil.  I know that very well because I have had experience of it.  I know farms where the soil is practically exhausted as a result of intensive wheat growing in recent years.</P>
    <P>It has been pointed out that it was a very wise policy for this country to have a wheat scheme prior to the emergency.  My answer to that is that there is land under wheat this year which, if it had not been growing wheat for the last few years, would be in a position to grow a better crop of wheat during the emergency.  I can bring the Minister to farms where the soil has been exhausted owing to the growing of wheat, and where production is falling off enormously from an intensive production of wheat.  That sort of thing certainly ought not to be encouraged.</P>
    <P>Farmers ought not to be encouraged to produce wheat intensively without compensating the soil for what it has produced.  Wheat is very severe on soil; any Deputy who is an agriculturist knows that well.  It is a gross feeder; it uses up the fertility of the soil rapidly.  You cannot continue to grow wheat intensively except on a farm where you have stall-feeding and an extensive feeding of live stock and where you are restoring the fertility of the soil through the medium of rich farmyard manure.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon did not attempt to make clear that our attitude with regard to wheat growing is that a scheme of intensive cultivation of wheat in normal times is wrong.  We have examples of that from other <Col N="163" /> countries.  When we went into wheat production here in 1932, Austria, which was an intensive wheat-growing country, was appealing to the League of Nations for financial aid to enable it to go in for live stock because the soil there had been exhausted by the production of wheat; the average yield had fallen to three or four barrels per acre.  There is no doubt that when we went out of intensive wheat production after the Franco-Prussian war it was because of the condition of the soil; the soil had been reduced in fertility and had become foul and dirty with weeds.  A policy of building up and preserving the fertility of the soil would be a sound policy for any country to pursue.  During an emergency period of that sort we would be in a position to draw upon that built-up fertility stored in the soil, while in normal conditions we are opposed to a policy of intensive cultivation of wheat.  I stress the word intensive.  We think that during an emergency period, such as the present, it is good policy to encourage the production of home-grown wheat intensively.</P>
    <P>I am of the opinion that the co-operation that is necessary between the Department of Agriculture and the Department of supplies on the vital matter of the supply of essential raw materials for increased food production, appears to be absolutely lacking.  I brought to the attention of the Ministers of both Departments the question of making more lime available for use on the land.  I got a sympathetic answer from the Minister for Agriculture. I should like the House to know that, under the lime scheme, we are in a position to produce all the lime we require.  It is important that lime should be made available, especially at present when there is an acute shortage of artificial manures.  Lime, when applied to sour land, will release a valuable plant food that is lying dormant in the soil.  Lime in itself is not a plant food, but it will stir up a chemical reaction in the soil, releasing a certain plant food on sour or acid land.  We had that lime available in several places, and we also had people who had entered into contracts with <Col N="164" /> local committees of agriculture to supply it to farmers.  We found, however, that we got no sympathy, help or co-operation from the Minister for Supplies.  He was not prepared to release any petrol to enable the lime to be transported.  The Minister for Agriculture did realise how essential the delivery of that lime was to the farmer.  Yet we had, as I have pointed out, this lack of co-operation between the two Departments.  One would think that the Minister for Supplies would have facilitated the making available of an essential raw material of that sort during a critical period such as the present.  Apparently he did not think it was essential.  He did release a supplementary allowance of petrol about a fortnight ago, but it was then too late.</P>
    <P>This was primarily a question for the Minister for Supplies.  I am of opinion that the Minister who is responsible for increased food production this year should have made it perfectly clear, when accepting that grave responsibility, that he was only doing so on the condition that when he said he wanted an essential raw material to enable him to achieve that object, he would get it right away&mdash;that it could not be held from him by another Minister, because if so it would have the effect of retarding production.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to tell the House what steps he proposes to take about the assembling of sufficient cereal seeds to meet our requirements next year.  I think he adopted quite a sound policy last year when he licensed certain individuals to assemble seeds, and that he ought to pursue that policy still further by giving licences to individuals who have facilities for assembling seed grain and are in a position to condition it.  A start ought to be made on that work now.  We ought to see to it that the best grain we can produce is reserved for seed purposes.  The Minister should fix the price that the merchant will pay the farmer for the grain to be kept for seed, and allow a fair margin for handling purposes, and a fair profit.  We should not have occurring next year the ramp and profiteering that went on this year when we had <Col N="165" /> people who enjoyed a monopoly in the storage of seed wheat charging what they liked for it.  The prices they charged amounted to a rob.  That ought not to occur again.</P>
    <P>The Minerals Bill got a Second Reading last week.  I want to ask the Minister for Agriculture to impress on the Minister for Industry and Commerce the necessity of working, to the uttermost capacity, the deposits of rock phosphate in County Clare.  As soon as that Bill becomes law, the company that it is proposed to set up under it should take immediate steps to go ahead with the work of development. In the absence of artificial manures, any attempt to produce crops in old tillage districts will, I fear, be attended with disastrous results. There will be a steep falling off in the yields.  Now is the time to get the rock phosphate deposits in the County Clare worked so that the phosphates will be available for next season&rsquo;s tillage. There is also the question of making potash available.  I understand that during the last war a firm in Galway produced a lot of potash from kelp.  There is no reason why the same should not be done now.  The people in the west, who are in a position to make the potash, ought to be appealed to to get on to its production as quickly as possible, so that some quantity of potash can be produced in the country.</P>
    <P>On the question of foot-and-mouth disease, I think we should be satisfied that the position is somewhat better, and that the Department are now getting the scourge under control.  Undoubtedly, it is to be regretted that the precautions taken at first were not sufficiently drastic to cope with this dreadful disease, and that it was allowed to spread all over the country into many counties.  Our agricultural community has suffered a very severe handicap, financially and otherwise, as a result of the hold-up of the export of live stock for the last few months. At the present time the disease has been practically cleaned up, with the exception of County Kilkenny, and that county certainly appears to be in a very bad state.  In my opinion, every possible precaution should be adopted <Col N="166" /> and a very strong cordon should be thrown about County Kilkenny so as to prevent the disease spreading into new centres.  I understand that it was difficult to get co-operation in County Kilkenny, and that some farmers there were badly advised on this matter.  It is very stupid for any group of farmers to try to prevent the inspectors and veterinary officers of the Department from doing their work.  I understand it was suggested to a certain group of farmers in that county that it was through the officers of the Department travelling through the country that this disease had spread.  I do not believe that is occurring, and it was stupid to suggest it.  However, I do not propose to go over that question again, as it would be unwise to shake any of the confidence that our people have at present in the ability of the veterinary officers to cope with the disease.  This is not the time for criticism or recrimination of any sort.</P>
    <P>There is a suggestion which I would like to make.  I understand that approximately 2,000 cows were slaughtered here in the City of Dublin, and that there are now very few cows in the city.  This is the time to consider whether it is wise to permit such a large number of cows in a modern city like Dublin.  I am glad that the Minister for Local Government and Public Health is in the House at the moment: he might consider whether it is in the interest of the health of the people to permit such a state of affairs to continue.  We know now how disastrous it was to have such a large stock of cows in the city when this disease broke out, and that it was almost impossible to eradicate it in the city without a complete eradication of the live stock in the city.  The Prussia Street type of area is a very difficult one to deal with.  Those who know the lairage accommodation there will appreciate that.</P>
    <P>Most of the city producers must have found it difficult to make an economic living, as they had to pay for all their winter feeding, for hay, straw, mangolds, concentrated foods and grain.  When they put their cows to grass during the summer it means buying grass by the 11 months&rsquo; system. <Col N="167" /> In my opinion we might very well consider whether it would be wise to permit these people to re-stock or not and to determine the amount of money necessary to compensate these people for any loss involved through their not re-stocking.  There is an opportunity now to examine that question and see whether cows could be kept out of the city.  I believe that the whole system of lairage in the Prussia Street area is wrong.  We have a very valuable live-stock industry, and the fact that our markets are situated in the Prussia Street area, away from railway termini and shipping is altogether wrong.  The Department should consider the possibility of providing proper marketing facilities at the North Wall port.  As a matter of fact, if it were possible we should not permit the reopening of the market at Prussia Street at all, as it is a very costly method of marketing our live stock.  when they arrive at Cabra they have to be driven a considerable distance to the lairages, then put on the market, and then driven down through the city to the boat.</P>
    <P>Our live-stock industry is well worth the investment of a decent sum of money to provide proper modern markets at the North Wall, with railway termini situated in the market, proper lairage facilities and, on the other side, easy access to the boat. That would eliminate much of the costly handling charges which farmers have to pay at present.  I suggest that this matter is well worth consideration, and that some committee should be set up to examine the whole problem.  Certainly, the congested area around Prussia Street provided a dreadful problem in tackling the foot-and-mouth disease when it reached the city.  Everyone realised that when a case occurred in the abattoir here it was bound to spread through all the lairages.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, the measures taken in that regard were, in my opinion, the worst possible.  The outbreak occurred on Wednesday, February 19th, at the abattoir.  Cattle had arrived in the city for the following day&rsquo;s market, and most of the lairages were occupied. The Minister made an order that night <Col N="168" /> banning the next day&rsquo;s market, but he permitted victuallers and dealers to buy live stock and travel from one yard to another, with the result that there was a number of people trapesing from one yard to another all over the Prussia Street area.  Naturally, if there was any infection there it was dragged from one yard to another.  It was the most effective way one could adopt to spread infection in the Prussia Street area.  In my opinion, it would have been far wiser to permit a market to take place that day.  A market could have been thoroughly washed down and disinfected.  All the facilities for doing that are on the market.  There were no facilities for thoroughly washing down and cleansing poky lairages in the Prussia Street area.  Thinking over that matter, I personally feel an opportunity is presented for again examining this whole problem of whether the market as at present situated is badly placed for export purposes, and the question of whether the lairage accommodation is old-fashioned and obsolete.  If our live-stock industry is worth anything to this country, at least it is worth giving it a market which is properly situated within reasonable distance of railway termini and shipping facilities, with modern lairage accommodation.  I think there is sufficient space in the North Wall area to provide for that.  I suggest some examination should be made of the possibilities of doing that.  As a matter of fact, there would be nothing to prevent us from even providing a modern abattoir there if we have to continue for the duration of the war to export beef on a dead meat basis. Even in the post-war period when we might have to revert to the export of live stock, we would have an alternative way of exporting which would ensure a certain amount of competition.</P>
    <P>In the last report published by the Committee of Public Accounts it is reported that in 1938-39 the sum of £2,598 5s. 6d. was paid to the Newmarket Dairy Company in respect of a licence to export butter to Belgium.  I should say the butter cost £3,922 and it was exported to Belgium without <Col N="169" /> any price being made for the butter. It was simply exported on an open market there.  We took our chances on the open market.  We had to pay customs duty to the Belgian Government.</P>
    <P>The customs duty and licence cost £3,040, making a total cost of the butter on the Belgian market of £6,963.  The butter failed to realise the price that was anticipated by the officials of the Minister&rsquo;s Department, and it was shipped back home.  The Department applied for a rebate of the import duty. The Belgian Government refused to hand back the £3,040 paid as import duty.  The butter was then shipped to England, and the Department paid £840 penal import duty at that time, so that the butter cost £7,803 on the English market.  The butter was sold on the English market, and the price realised was £2,029, so that we lost on the transaction the difference between £2,029, the amount realised, and the cost of the butter on the English market, £7,803, which equalled £5,700.  It amounts to this, that for butter for which the Department, through the Newmarket Dairy Company, paid farmers in this country £3,922, we lost £5,700.  The quantity of butter was 585 cwts.  It would have been far better for this country if that butter had been dumped in the sea or had been given out free to the poor.  It is an extraordinary state of affairs that the Department should have decided to ship butter to Belgium without knowing what we were going to get for that butter, or without making any attempt to sell the butter prior to shipment or finding out what the conditions there were, or what the market was like at the time.  They simply chanced their arm; exported the butter, paid an import duty of £3,040 to the Belgian Government, and then found the market was not any use to us.</P>

      <P>In any case, I want to say that if any individual or any manager of a firm handled his business in that fashion he would immediately be dismissed.  I merely want to point out that is not the way to do business. The responsibility is on the Minister and his Department to carry out the work of the Department on a business basis.  Where we have to export an article, some effort should be made to find out what the market is like, and, if possible, to sell the article before it is exported.</P>
      <P>There is just one other question I would like to ask the Minister.  Has any effort been made to have any representations made to the British Government to secure supplies of raw material on a barter basis?  We are exporting certain essential food and marketing it on the other side, and it appears that we are getting very little help or co-operation from them at the present time in the way of raw materials for the production of that food. Has any attempt been made to exchange our export of food on a barter basis, on the understanding that some effort will be made by the British Government to give us, in exchange for that food, some of the essential raw materials that are necessary for us if we are going to continue the production of food?  In other words, some effort should be made to get, in exchange for every cargo of cattle or pigs that we export, maize or something else like that, that we require for the production of food.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think we all realise that it is necessary at the present time not only to produce the food that is essential for our own people, but to maintain our exports as far as possible, especially if we want to preserve that market during the post-war period&mdash;assuming, of course, that the market is there at all in a post-war period&mdash;because, if there is a scramble for that market by Dominion countries, we will have no bargaining weapon to enable us to expand our quota of trade with them.  I think we must all realise that it is in our interests to maintain our present <Col N="171" /> quota of trade with the British, and to preserve it at all costs, because if it falls off&mdash;and I am sure it is likely to fall off to some extent&mdash;to any great extent it might be very difficult for us to get an expansion of that trade in a post-war period.  I think we might point out to them that, while we are anxious to preserve our existing quota of trade, we can only do it if some effort is made by the British to supply us with raw material.  I do not know what efforts have been made or are being made by the Government in that direction, but it is essential that some effort should be made to do that.</P>

I do not know whether I am in order in asking the Minister now for some forecast as to the position with regard to the dairying industry for the coming year.  I do not know whether that question should be asked under this Estimate or under the Estimate for agricultural subsidies, but I should like him to take some opportunity of giving us the information.</P>

      <NameTxt>Donnchadh O Briain</NameTxt>
      <P>Very well, Sir.  I should like the Minister to give us some information in regard to the possible prospects of the dairying industry for the coming year.  Recently, the Limerick County Committee of Agriculture, a responsible body, passed a resolution asking that the Minister and the Department of Agriculture should try to arrange that the return to the farmers supplying milk to co-operative and other creameries should be 10d. per gallon on an average.  I realise, of course, at once, that that is a very desirable figure if it could be reached, but I realise also that, in view of the prices that are available for our produce, such as butter, in the export market, it will mean that the balance will have to be made up, if the <Col N="172" /> farmer is to get 10d. a gallon, either by the taxpayer or by the consumer.</P>
      <P>Realising, however, the importance of the dairying industry to the whole agricultural industry, I should like to know from the Minister what it will be possible to do in that respect for the coming year.  It is of serious concern to the constituency I represent, because Limerick is probably one of the greatest dairying counties in Eire. There is a co-operative creamery in practically every parish.  The Minister is fully aware of the situation already, and on previous occasions, when this question was raised before him by deputations and otherwise, he has not shown himself unsympathetic.  Indeed, I am fully prepared to admit that were it not for the steps he took from the very first day he came into office as Minister for Agriculture, the dairying industry all over the country would be now non-existent, and large numbers of dairy farmers realised that also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another matter to which I should like to refer in connection with this Estimate.  In previous years there was a sub-head providing for reclamation schemes in semi-congested areas, and that sub-head is now being done away with.  I understand that that reclamation scheme is being replaced by the farm improvement scheme.  I had occasion to see the former reclamation scheme for semi-congested areas in operation in a certain part of County Limerick, the western part, which is semi-congested.  It was a very valuable scheme and provided for a grant for the reclamation of land and for drainage.  It also provided for lime at a cheap rate and for cheap seeds, such as oats, wheat and so on.  that scheme was in operation, I think, since 1936, and it was going great until it was dropped this year.  I would appeal to the Minister to reconsider the position in regard to that scheme and try to work it in, as it was in operation from 1936 onwards, under the new farm improvement scheme.  The farm improvement scheme is a very good one in its way and I hope it will be possible to do more in regard to that scheme this year, but in view of the conditions which obtain in these semi-congested areas, in County Limerick <Col N="173" /> and other places outside that county, I think it would be a good thing to put the reclamation scheme into operation again this year, and if the privileges that were available for small farmers in these areas were restored to them this year, it would be very valuable, and I think the Minister should give favourable consideration to that matter.</P>
    <P>Another matter to which I should like to refer is the question of the Compulsory Tillage Order.  The position in regard to the enforcement of that order was, I think, in some cases unsatisfactory. There are some people&mdash;a small minority, but of course representing a big acreage of land&mdash;who escaped fulfilling their duties in regard to the tillage order last year and who, I am afraid, to a certain extent, also escaped this year.  I hope that, even though one acre of extra tillage would be better than any penalties that would be enforced, the people who fail to do their duty to the nation to help in securing the nation&rsquo;s food supply will not go unpunished.  While the position is as it is I think it is unfair to the other members of the farming community, who fulfilled their obligations generally, and in many cases did even more than they were asked to do, that there should be black sheep who failed to do their duty and got away with it.  I hope that the Minister and the Department will see that these black sheep will not get away with it this year.</P>
    <P>It was interesting to listen to Deputy Dillon&rsquo;s apologia for his attitude in regard to wheat growing, in view of the present situation that we are faced with.  No matter what Deputy Dillon may say now in trying to explain away the position, all the water in the River Shannon would not wash him and some members of his Party of responsibility for the attitude they took up on that very vital part of the agricultural policy of the present Government. Deputy Dillon quoted a statement made by An Taoiseach in Limerick in which he said that the weather was against us.  That is true, of course, as far as the weather from the beginning of this year was concerned, but that was not true of the weather in November or in December <Col N="174" /> when a good deal more could have been done.  I agree, of course, that the exhortation to the farming community in regard to the wheat campaign this year probably started a bit late, but nevertheless, I hold that there is, in this country, due to the speeches of Deputy Dillon and the attitude of certain members of his Party in the past, an ingrained prejudice amongst some farmers against wheat growing. The present position with which the country is faced in regard to supplies of flour should be a lesson to the people and a proof of the wisdom of the policy upon which this Government embarked when it came into office in trying to provide here in Ireland our own requirements in wheat.  I do not want to delay the Dáil or the Minister any longer.  I just wish to put the few points I have raised to him and to ask him particularly for any information he can give us in regard to the position of the dairying industry for the coming year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>This Estimate is very important as it provides the Minister for Agriculture, who is in control of the most important Department in the Government, with an opportunity of publicly examining his administrative conscience, with the assistance of members of this House, and of finding out in what way he has erred during the past year.  I believe that if the Minister looks over the experience of the past year, he will very candidly admit that he has made very many serious mistakes in the handling of agricultural problems.  The people of this country were very seriously alarmed last December and early in January, when it became know that there was an estimated serious shortage of wheat.  It was surely the duty of the Minister for Agriculture to have seen that every possible step was taken to ensure that this country would have an adequate food supply, having <Col N="175" /> regard to the fact that the war had been in existence for over a year last winter.  The Minister was questioned here in regard to his policy generally when a motion in regard to wheat growing was recently discussed in this House.  In reply to Deputy Hughes who asked him if he had consulted with farmers in regard to his tillage policy, the Minister stated, as reported in column 1051 of volume 82: &ldquo;The farmers were consulted.&rdquo;  I quote the following further passage from the Official Report:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Mr. Hughes: When and where?</P>
      <P>Donnchadh O Briain: The members of the Council of Agriculture were consulted.</P>
      <P>Dr. Ryan: Yes; they were consulted and they gave their approval.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The fact of the matter is that this consultative council did not meet since last October until about a fortnight ago.  It is very far wrong to assert that the consultative council had been consulted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to point out that later on it was decided to increase the minimum area which was to be compulsorily tilled and it was also decided to increase the price of wheat.  It was further decided to launch a nation-wide campaign in support of that increase in the acreage under wheat.  The support and the co-operation of members of this House and of all sections of the community were asked in this campaign, but the Consultative Council on Agriculture was not convened to give the Minister the benefit of their views.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>They approved of 20 per cent. in October.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should imagine that the co-operation of this consultative council should have been sought in any <Col N="176" /> campaign such as was launched last January for a very big extension of the acreage under wheat and also in regard to the fixing of the price of wheat.  I think that a council such as this, if it is to be of any use to the Minister at all, should meet at regular intervals so as to enable the members to give the Minister the benefit of their experience and knowledge of agricultural matters.  The Taoiseach has been complaining that he is afraid that we have not a sufficient acreage under tillage and that we shall not have sufficient wheat to carry us over the coming year.  I think that the observations of the Taoiseach in regard to the acreage under tillage amount to a serious censure of the Department of Agriculture, and the Minister, inasmuch as it was the duty of the Minister to ensure that a sufficient acreage of wheat and of other essential crops would be grown.  If there is a shortage, it means either of two things: the Minister did not provide in his tillage order for a sufficient acreage of tillage or, alternatively, he did not make an order providing for a specified acreage of wheat.  There seems to be a certain amount of failure on the part of the Minister and of his Department in regard to this entire question of essential food supplies.  Anyone who travels through the country at present will observe that the main portion of the tillage operations was carried out during the latter part of March and the month of April.</P>
      <P>We cannot dare to hope for a very prosperous harvest from lands which were tilled under such conditions, and I do not want to add anything further to the criticism of the Department which has been expressed here in regard to this matter, but I think it is time now that the Minister should make up his mind in regard to the coming year.  He ought to ensure, first of all, that timely notice is given to the people of this country, and to the farmers in particular, of the exact acreage of tillage which will be required next year, and also, if necessary, of the exact acreage of wheat which will be required.  If necessary also a compulsory tillage order should be made in regard to the acreage of wheat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="177" /> I think it ought to be generally understood that the tillage season in this country starts in September&mdash;that is a point which appears to be overlooked&mdash;and, therefore, in making a tillage order for the coming year I think it should be made in August, so that the farmers will know exactly what is required of them and will be able to make timely preparation to get the largest possible acreage under wheat before the winter sets in.  We had a very bitter experience last winter, inasmuch as practically from November until late in March there was very little suitable weather for tillage operations.  I think we ought not to make the same mistake next year, and, therefore, the order for whatever tillage is necessary should be made in August.  In that way we would be planning well ahead, and we would be able to ensure that we would have a sufficient amount of land ploughed, and ploughed early.  I think it was last October I suggested to the Minister&mdash;a suggestion which was intended to be constructive&mdash;that some special inducement should be offered to the farmers to get as much wheat as possible into the ground before the winter.  However, nothing practical was done, and the country has suffered very much as a result.</P>
    <P>Having definitely decided what acreage of tillage is required next year, it is absolutely essential that adequate precautions should be taken in regard to seed.  Every farmer knows that what happened last year, particularly in regard to spring wheat, was that large quantities of the best spring wheat went to the millers and was milled into flour, and that as a result there was a definite shortage of spring wheat.  In addition, we had the fact that a considerable quantity of very good spring wheat was bought up by merchants and held for the purpose of making excessive profits.  Very enormous profits were made out of this seed, to the detriment of the unfortunate producer.  In many cases the merchants more than doubled their money on the supplies of grain.</P>
    <P>I do not think that this should be allowed during the coming year.  Now is the time for the Minister to <Col N="178" /> announce definitely what price will be allowed to be charged for seed wheat during the winter and spring months. The Minister, of course, has already fixed the price for the seed wheat produced by farmers, but I think he should follow that up with an order fixing the price which farmers will be expected to pay for their seed supplies, and which merchants will be allowed to charge. The Minister has been frequently appealed to by members of this House definitely to fix the prices with regard to oats and barley.  So far, he has resisted those appeals, but some statements which he has made recently seem to indicate that he is reconsidering the position in regard to next year, and that it is possible or even probable that he will fix the prices of oats and barley next year.</P>
    <P>I know that some farmers, both in this House and outside this House, hold that it is not in the farmers&rsquo; interests that the prices of oats and barley should be fixed this year, inasmuch as there is a possibility of a serious shortage of those cereals, resulting in inflated prices, but I think anyone who takes the long view of the matter will realise that it is always to the farmers&rsquo; interests to have grain prices stabilised and definitely fixed, so as to avoid profiteering and to avoid the glutted markets which frequently occur in the autumn.  I think that the glut of oats and barley in the markets could be definitely prevented if the Minister would fix a reasonable price, a fair and economic price, for both oats and barley in the autumn.  He could also prevent profiteering by fixing a somewhat increased price for the subsequent months.  I would say that the price should be graded upwards until spring, that is to say, I think it would be fair and reasonable if the price of oats and barley in the spring was, say, 10/- per barrel more than in the autumn.  I would suggest that more than that is an unreasonable profit to the merchants. I think that the time is now opportune to fix those prices for oats and barley.  That ought to be made the permanent policy of the Department of Agriculture, so that the farmers, when tilling their land and sowing their crops, will know exactly what prices <Col N="179" /> they are going to receive.  I think the farmers would be well advised to support the Minister in fixing the price of oats and barley this year, and, having supported him, to insist that he continues that policy in the future.  I think that is a sound policy, and is in the best interests, not only of the farmers, but of the country generally.</P>
    <P>There ought to be a planned national agricultural economy in this country. That is to say, the acreage under oats, barley and wheat ought to be planned by the Government at the beginning of the year, just as an intelligent and efficient farmer would plan the acreage for his various crops at the beginning of the year.  That policy is urgently called for, and failure to adopt it has been ruinous for this country in the past. Prior to the outbreak of the present war, the acreage under various crops in this country was fixed to a large extent by external influence&mdash;by the operations, perhaps, of big importers and big firms in other countries.  That state of affairs should never be allowed to operate again.  If necessary, in order to rationalise the marketing of grain, a central marketing organisation should be set up to control the entire marketing of wheat, barley and oats in this country.  It should control not only the price which the producer will obtain, but also the imports of grain, and ensure that there will be allowed into this country only the quantity of grain that suits the interests of the nation, instead of allowing the matter to be dictated by chance.</P>
    <P>Deputies have suggested that in normal times it is not desirable to attempt to grow 100 per cent. of our wheat supplies, or even a large pencentage. There might be something in that suggestion, but it is a matter which should be controlled by a central marketing organisation.  One thing is certain, that if in the future we decide to cut down the home production of wheat, we should always ensure that we have in the hands of the State or some semi-State body a sufficient supply to carry us for at least more than one year.  It will also be absolutely necessary, if we are not producing 100 per cent. of our <Col N="180" /> wheat requirements, that we should produce a fair percentage, as otherwise we would not have the seed in the country or the expert knowledge of wheat-growing so essential in case of emergency.  I think, therefore, that a central marketing organisation is the one thing that will ensure the continuance of a sound tillage policy, a tillage policy based on the best interests of the nation, having due regard to the necessity of preserving the fertility of the land.</P>
    <P>Last year farmers suffered very much through lack of sufficient credit to carry on their tillage operations.  Of course, their difficulties were increased by the hold-up in the marketing of live stock.  I think the Government have not gone far enough with the provision of credit for tillage operations.  The scheme operated by county councils is inadequate because it is impossible, owing to the limited finances of the councils, for those bodies to undertake the financing of agriculture.  Those unfortunate public bodies have to rely for their incomes upon the money which they can extract, mainly from the rural population.  The extent to which they will operate a scheme of this kind will be regulated by their very limited finances.  A central organisation could operate a much bigger scheme, one which would extensively increase our production.</P>
    <P>Another difficulty under which farmers laboured during the spring months, and particularly during last month, was a shortage of tractor fuel. It was very unfortunate that greater supplies of tractor fuel were not available. A basic allowance of 50 gallons was provided for each tractor.  In some cases that amount was adequate, but where tractor owners were working for hire in areas where there were not many tractors, and where there was a good deal of tillage work to be carried out, the 50 gallon allowance was quite inadequate.  To my own knowledge, on many occasions tractors in such areas were idle for over a week, sometimes as long as a fortnight, in the busiest season of the year.  The Minister should not have allowed that to occur and, no matter how violent the action he might have to take with <Col N="181" /> the Minister for Supplies, he should have ensured that the tractors were kept at full pressure during the last month.  Failure to do that has caused very great hardship, not only to farmers but to tillage contractors, and it has meant a serious loss to the country.</P>
    <P>The Minister&rsquo;s attention has been called to the land improvement scheme that was in operation during the last few months.  This scheme was purely experimental.  I do not think it has been as successful as one would expect, although it has enabled some farmers to carry out a certain amount of improvement, but so far as getting increased employment is concerned it has not been very effective.  Having regard to the urgent need for increased employment on the land, the Minister should encourage the Government to launch a much bigger scheme, a scheme in which additional men employed on farms over and above the number employed in 1939-40 would have their wages subsidised by the State. Such a scheme would be much more desirable and it would enable farmers to utilise additional labour, not only for improvement work but for tillage operations as well.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that tillage operations could be carried on much more efficiently and with much greater benefit, not only to the farmer but to the nation, if the farmer was put in a position to employ additional labour. Having regard to the limited finances of farmers and the conditions existing in relation to agriculture, it will be agreed that most farmers are not in a position to employ additional labour unless the wages of the labourers are subsidised by the State.  If such a scheme were put into operation it would absorb many of the unemployed, who would not then be dependent on various forms of relief.  That would be the immediate result if wages for employment in agriculture were subsidised by the State.  I think the Minister should suggest such a scheme to the Government, a scheme that would be operated on broad, far-reaching lines, and endeavour to secure the necessary finance for it.</P>
    <P>This is an opportune time, I think, <Col N="182" /> for a discussion in relation to the improvement of our dairy herds.  During a war period it is always possible to get rid of inferior types of live stock provided, of course, that the disease that is holding up our trade is eradicated. With that disease removed, there ought to be a good market for all live stock in a suitable condition for the butcher.</P>
    <P>The Minister should introduce a scheme for the elimination of inferior cows.  I do not intend to take up time outlining how such a scheme should be operated, but when the present outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease has been overcome, that would be an opportune time for such a scheme. There is no doubt that in future this country must of necessity aim, not at maintaining large herds as in the past, but at improving existing herds.  For that reason we should get rid of inferior types of cows, not only in milk yield but for beef purposes.  A scheme for the registration and standardisation of cows should be introduced, as it would be of permanent value in the difficult period through which we must pass after the war.</P>
    <P>As the representative of a sheep raising county I want to know if the Minister has taken any steps regarding the marketing of wool.  The question is an important one for farmers in mountain counties.  If there is not a sufficient market here for home-grown wool, he should endeavour to secure an external market.  I also wish to call his attention to the marketing of eggs. The representative of a firm who approached the British purchasing organisation about the price of eggs, and complained that it was inadequate, was informed that no demand for an increase in price had been made by the Department of Agriculture.  Having regard to the manner in which external marketing is carried on at present, it is the duty of the Department always to be alive to the need of securing the highest possible price not only for eggs but other agricultural products.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to draw the Minister&rsquo;s attention to the difficulty that some people have had in getting lime <Col N="183" /> delivered from the lime kilns.  In Wexford people found great difficulty in getting delivery, even though they had paid in advance.  Those in control of the lime kilns contend that there is a shortage of coal with which to burn the lime.  I wish the Minister would look into the matter, so that the people concerned could not advance the excuse that they had not a sufficiency of anthracite.  Many farmers who needed lime failed to get it.  I ask the Minister to consider also the possibility of making small loans available for farmers whose valuations vary from £25 to £30 for the erection of corn stores.  The Minister may say that they could get loans through the Agricultural Credit Corporation, but everybody is aware of the difficulty in getting such loans.  Many small farmers who grow grain have no means of storing it.  It is most important that they should be able to store it next winter.  I appeal to the Minister to make loans of from £50 to £80 available, because if corn stores could be erected now they would be available for storage purposes for next harvest. There would then be no need to sell their grain in October or November. For want of storage they had to sell it last year, and then when they wanted seed they had to buy back practically the same corn at an increased price.  That is happening every winter.  Every encouragement should be given to farmers to retain all the grain they possibly can on their farms.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brodrick</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad Deputy Cogan mentioned the marketing of wool, and I hope the Minister, now that he has got due notice, will not leave farmers in the position they were last year, of having no market.  Producers did not know what to do, and there was a time when they could not sell the wool at all.  About one-sixth of the wool produced in Éire comes from my constituency, and I ask the Minister to take steps to provide an early market.  Deputy O Briain, who represents Limerick, a county that contains, perhaps, the best land in Ireland, complained that some people were evading the Tillage Order, and he asked the Minister to take notice of <Col N="184" /> that.  Even at this late stage I appeal to the Minister to have manures made available in the West of Ireland. Farmers in Galway and Mayo, who are anxious to do what they can to produce food, are not being sufficiently helped to comply with the Order.  They are tilling more land than they should till, but they are left without manures. People who got a 50 per cent. supply of manures in previous years only got 25 per cent. this year.  Land in the West of Ireland will not produce crops unless manures are available.  What is the use of giving people seed potatoes if they have not manure, when they are planting on rocky soil?  The valuations in part of my constituency are very small, yet the people are constantly tilling their land, and many of them have conacre for which they pay up to £5 an acre for tillage.  There should be some provision made for supplying manures to poorer districts.</P>
      <P>The land in County Limerick, that Deputy O Briain complained was not tilled, could produce crops without manure for the next two years, and the same could be said of Meath.  I am sure when the Minister gets the returns of this year&rsquo;s crops he will find that the people on the poorer land have done much better than those on the rich lands.  I have seen potatoes sown in plots and not an ounce of manure put in with them, and I appeal to the Minister, if there is any manure whatever to be got, that he should send it to the poorer areas in order to help these people.  I know these poorer areas&mdash; I come from them myself&mdash;and without manure they can do nothing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the reclamation of lands, I should like to see the Minister continuing that scheme which has been of great benefit, and anyone moving through these areas can see the good effect of it.  I think they got £5 an acre for reclamation work and it was money well spent.  It gave a fair amount of employment, and I should like to see that scheme continued.  Seeing that it has gone on for so many years, I think it would be a pity to drop it now.  With regard to foot-and-mouth disease, the West of Ireland has a clean bill of health.  My own constituency, <Col N="185" /> Galway, is free from the discase, although I admit that there is a part of East Galway which is pretty near an area in which there was foot-and-mouth disease a fortnight ago. The position down there is that unless there is somebody in authority to apply for a licence for the holding of a fair, the fair cannot be held, and fairs are very necessary at present. The Department, in the last three days, has relieved the situation to a great extent.  Three fairs were held&mdash; Ballinasloe, Athenry and Galway&mdash; which relieved the situation very much, but I do not think it should be necessary for people to apply for a licence to hold a fair.  In most of these small places, there is no local authority, no fairs and markets committee, and no one who can decide to apply for a licence for the holding of a fair in a certain place.</P>

      <P>I should like to know whether it is true that a number of people have made application for the cancellation of contracts for the supply of beet to the Sugar Company.  I have <Col N="186" /> heard that something like 20 per cent. of the suppliers in certain districts have applied for cancellation of their contracts, and, if that is so, it means that the position will be very serious. With regard to butter, the Minister should take steps to ensure that what occurred last winter will not occur again.  The position is that butter is sent to Britain, the price paid by Britain being around 115/- a cwt., while the poor of this country have to pay from 1/7 to 1/9 a lb.  I think that is not right.  We should not charge the poor people here any more than the price at which we supply butter to England.</P>
      <P>I should like to know whether the farm improvement scheme applies to County Mayo or not.  I think it can scarcely apply to that county because all the people I know who made application from South Mayo and parts of North Mayo got no answers to their letters.  I do not think any of them got one of these grants for improvement, although they complied with all the regulations and made their applications in time.  With regard to seeds and manures, I understand that a great deal of difficulty is experienced by the Mayo County Council in respect of seed supplies.  They sent in an application for five tons of spring wheat about the end of February or March. That spring wheat has not been delivered yet and I suppose, of course, that there is no prospect of getting it now.</P>

      <P>The county committee of agriculture.  I will give the details to the Minister later on.  A number of Deputies have urged the Minister to try to get supplies of oil and petrol for use in tractors.  I am sure there will be no difficulty from to-day in getting full supplies, after a Budget of £40,000,000 in which provision is made for the taxing of oil and petrol to the extent of 1/3 per gallon.  The people will have no difficulty now except in getting the money to pay for it.  In view of the fact that we have had a Budget of £40,000,000 to-day, it is not too much to ask that the Minister should take up with his colleagues the <Col N="187" /> question of a moratorium in respect of annuities and rates on agricultural land.  They amount only to about £6,000,000 per year and it is not too much to ask that these be left over for the duration of the war.  If the Minister does that, he will be looked upon as the greatest Minister for Agriculture the country had in our time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>In considering this Estimate, we have to face the fact that we commenced this hyper-tillage campaign after the farmers had already endured a long war of another kind. It is quite obvious from going round the country that our own agricultural economy is not well suited to what might be called a flexible system of agriculture, where you have suddenly to alter the ratio of your tillage. There is far too much poor land in the country, far too much land which, as a result of various difficulties over past years, is far from suitable for tillage purposes, which has to be tilled, and rightly so, in order to provide food, but which could have been in much better condition if we had adopted more modern methods at a much earlier date, and if we had concentrated on the most vital and most urgent work facing this country since it achieved independence, that of trying to reach a position in which we could compete adequately with those nations which are rivalling us more and more on our principal market.  It is just as well, since we are discussing this Estimate, to realise what an unnatural conflict took place here during the whole of those years prior to the war when, as a result of a political dispute amongst ourselves, we got into the habit of speaking with two minds &mdash;one element urging the necessity for cattle production and for grass-cultivation and the other urging ever and ever more tillage.  In fact, all the time we were having that conflict and ignoring the model policy of grass-cultivation advocated by Sir George Stapleton and now largely adopted in Great Britain, in New Zealand and other countries which were becoming our economic enemies on the English market, the real policy was a combination of the two.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="188" /> There never should have been any conflict or any situation whereby it was hard to persuade the larger farmers to break up grass land or any situation whereby the smaller farmers could have adopted the position that they were the tillage farmers of the country.  There should have been a regular policy of breaking up grass land periodically and progressively in every part of the country.  It is just as well to those of us who face the prospect of a long war, with a very high tillage ratio, to realise that there was that unnatural conflict.  What we have to face is: after a long period of stagnation in agriculture, we have suddenly altered our whole policy, and we should endeavour to find out the best way to overcome the difficulties which we have to face as a result of what has gone before.</P>
    <P>We have an extensive system of farming and we have been competing for 20 years with countries which adopted the intensive system of farming. With an extensive system of farming, we suddenly find ourselves having to plough up more and more land with insufficient quantities of fertilisers. It would seem to me that the only thing we can do to compensate for the difficulties which we have to face is to see how far we can improve the quality of the land we have at our disposal to enable us to carry through this heavy charge of tillage without doing more damage than is necessary. I should like to ask the Minister what his view would be if we were to prepare a farm survey, as is being done in Great Britain at the present time.  In many parts of that country, agricultural inspectors are visiting every farm and marking down the quality of the grass, the quality of the old pasture land, the condition of the hedges, drainage conditions and the condition of the rough grazing and have indicated what proportion of each farm is below the best standard.  I think that it would be a magnificent thing for the people of this country if we could have hanging in some hall in every parish a survey, based on modern conditions, of the state of our agricultural land.  I think that the people would be staggered, if such an inspection were made, <Col N="189" /> to learn how far we are behind the best we could achieve and they would realise what tremendous work was necessary, no matter what the result of this war and no matter what the circumstances, in order to compensate for the lack of effort in the past, owing to political difficulties of one kind or another.</P>
    <P>One thing we can do: that is, improve land through the land-improvement scheme.  We cannot go in for modern grass cultivation because we have not the fertilisers or seeds and we cannot go in for the adoption of Sir George Stapleton&rsquo;s plans because we have not got the means at present, but one thing we can do is to improve what land we have by the ordinary labour of men.  According to our own statistics, hundreds of thousands of acres once classified as pasture land are now rough grazing, covered with ferns, gorse, rushes, badly drained and ill-used. I reckon that there is enough land gone back in this country to the rough grazing condition to provide for 25,000 families 40 acres each.  That is what might be described as a picturesque way of measuring the extent to which land has gone back.</P>
    <P>It is obviously impossible for the Government entirely to subsidise the cleaning of all that land.  It is obviously equally desirable, if we are to have the best of our intensive tillage policy, that as much of that land as possible should be brought back, so as to carry us through this crisis.  The Government has initiated a land-improvement scheme which, I think, has been the finest thing done for agriculture during the past ten years.  I hope it will be extended.  We have not heard from the Minister, so far as I can gather from reading the report of his statement, exactly how much money will be available for land improvement. One realises the terribly serious situation that arises when land is allowed to go back when one sees that the Estimate of the Department for cleaning land varies from £10 to £20 an acre.  If that land had been maintained in good condition, if we had from the beginning of our independence followed an intensive policy of reconstruction and cultivation, much of <Col N="190" /> that land would not have gone back. The cost of improving and cleaning land increases almost geometrically from the time it ceases to be good land and, accordingly, this very large amount of money is involved in the cleaning of land.  Not only has land-improvement work to be done on a huge scale but there is the work of improving hedges, eliminating unnecessary headlands, doing minor drainage schemes, and eliminating rushes.</P>
    <P>Whenever one meets agricultural experts from other countries where land is even more scarce than it is here, one finds that they are always amazed at the amount of land actually wasted here.  Now is a time when we cannot afford to waste land, and when our land is desperately in need of improvement. I think that it would be necessary not only to increase as much as possible the land-improvement grant but that it would be necessary to carry out a campaign amongst farmers to induce them to do voluntary work in the way of capital improvement, so far as their available labour and means permit.  I know some farmers who should have subsidies for cleaning their land.  That is obvious from an examination of their farm economy.  I know farmers who do not need subsidies to clean their land, and I think the Government must make its appeal to both classes&mdash;that is to say, to those who might do more for themselves if encouraged by the State and to those who, in any event, need a subsidy to carry out the work.  If one goes through the country and if one imagines an inspector carrying out this farm survey of which I have spoken, one cannot fail to be impressed by the relatively poor condition of much of our land.  My own belief is that not more than 5 per cent. of farms are properly equipped in the way of ordinary housing, buildings, etc., to take 100 per cent. part in the maximum production of food in this country.  That is the report I got from three inspectors or instructors whom I have consulted in the matter.  I imagine it is a very fair average.  I have spoken to Deputies, and some of them would raise the 5 per cent. to 10; <Col N="191" /> others would reduce it to 2½ per cent. It is a very serious position for us to face.</P>
    <P>After the war, when materials become available to us, we shall have to face the whole situation in a way we never faced it before.  Until then, we might at least put back into cultivation 500,000 acres of land and make that a matter of life and death just as we are making the growing of wheat a matter of life and death.  The sowing season is nearly over.  We have an intermediate season in which it could be done.  The Government have done a great deal by means of publicity in connection with the growing of wheat and other crops.  Much could be done by a land improvement scheme for a great cleaning up of the land.  In conclusion I wish to congratulate the Minister on having formulated a scheme and spent £250,000 on it.  I hope that what I have said will encourage him to continue it and to increase it largely.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan" hpid="Mr. M. Brennan Mr. M. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>There was a refreshing contrast between the speeches of Deputy Childers and Deputy O Briain.  Deputy Childers at least has grasped the situation that some of us have been trying to make clear to the House for years past, particularly since the end of the economic war, namely, that what we want in this country is greater and more profitable production. Deputy Childers referred to the conflict which went on in this country as between tillage and live stock.  So far as Deputy Childers is concerned, the fact is that he missed the tide; he was not here in time.  Had Deputy Childers been here in time to educate the Fianna Fáil Party that would not have happened, because the policy of the late Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Hogan) was a policy of mixed farming &mdash;one more cow, one more sow and one more acre under the plough.  That was the policy advocated by the previous Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The conflict went on previous to that.  The Deputy is quite right about the conflict.  The conflict was entirely in the minds of his own <Col N="192" /> Party; otherwise there was no conflict. There was the misleading notion that farmers ought to go in for tillage. Again I quote the late Mr. Hogan: &ldquo;One more cow, one more sow and one more acre under the plough.&rdquo; Fianna Fáil has not reached that yet. Whether in connection with an agricultural policy or an industrial policy, this country or any other country would be wise to produce an article which it can sell and sell at a profit.  There is no use in producing something you cannot sell.  I have always advocated and the late Mr. Hogan always advocated that we ought to have more tillage here.  If we got one more acre under the plough from every farmer it would increase production enormously; if every farmer had one more cow and one more sow our production would also go up enormously.  We always wanted that policy and I always advocated more tillage.  But, if you want to sell your produce, you should not export it in its raw state but feed it to live stock and in that way get a good price for it.</P>
      <P>Some people in this country were terribly muddle-headed about the whole matter.  They had the idea that this country ought to go in for tillage; that it was unpatriotic to have any live stock at all; that grass and live stock should be taboo in this country. That gave us the rotten foundation upon which the Government and the country staggered when the war came upon us.  Now, we have Deputy O Briain falling into the same kind of trap into which a lot of people in this country fell.  He said that the present emergency showed the need for wheat production and the fact that we were all shouting for the growing of more wheat at present was evidence that the Fianna Fáil policy was right.  It was not evidence of any such thing.  A policy that is suitable in an emergency or in an abnormal period is not necessarily suitable, in fact it is almost bound not to be suitable, in a normal period.  You very rarely get the two running together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I maintain that if we had only 20,000 acres of wheat in 1939 we would not have got into the position we are in at present because a decent effort would have been made to get wheat. <Col N="193" /> It was not made.  Why was it not made?  It was the kind of mind which Deputy O Briain has that kept it from being made.  The Government and their supporters had the feeling that as they had a tillage policy and a wheat policy everything was all right. Can anybody imagine that in the autumn of 1939, when the war started, a Government which had not a wheat or a tillage policy would have been so forgetful of their business that they would not import into this country a supply of wheat which would ensure us at least for a couple of years?  That was not done.  Why?</P>
    <P>I am not saying that the Government really neglected it in the ordinary way, but they were misled by the type of mind which Deputy O Briain has, that we were producing something in this country which would meet the emergency.  Of course, we were not doing any such thing.  Had they not misled themselves by that type of policy they would have laid in a store of wheat.  One of two things should have been done, but neither was done; we should have imported all the wheat we possibly could lay hands on, or gone out and sown all the wheat we could have sown.  We did neither one nor the other in 1939 or 1940.  Why was it not done in October or November, 1940? The Government did not even ask for it until January, 1941.  I do not want to criticise the Government in any destructive way.  I should like, if possible, to try and assist the Government and the country in providing for our needs at present.  In my opinion the Government have taken a false step and they should see that it will not happen again.</P>
    <P>Right through the whole period we had an evident lack of that organisation on the part of the Department of Agriculture and the Minister which was absolutely necessary if any effort was to be made to feed the people. Even at present, we have that lack of organisation.  Apparently we got a supply of petrol for the month of May &mdash;just a little extra.  Notwithstanding the fact that we had tractors and machinery idle part of the time for want of petrol for agricultural purposes, <Col N="194" /> we are now going to license private cars for amusement or other purposes and waste the little surplus of petrol we have, while we do not know if we will have petrol in June, July or August for harvesting purposes. Since this Government came into office we have never got a complete picture of anything.  We have got it in little bits.  The only chance for this country, as I have already said in this House&mdash; I am glad Deputy Childers agrees with me&mdash;was to have gone in for the wholesale improvement of the land.  No matter what anyone may say, we will always have to fall back on the land. A land policy is the only policy for this country that will survive.  But the position is that the land of this country was starved from 1932 to 1937.</P>

      <P>As soon as the war started preparations were made to meet the situation in all the countries around us.  What did we do?  What did the Minister do in connection with manures?  What provision did he make in his Estimate last year and this year for them?  He is providing a subsidy for the limited amount of manures that is manufactured in this country.  Is it true that, after the war started, we had a quota order in operation here against the importation of manures?</P>

He gets up and makes the most unfair criticism that he can think of.  He knows right well that it was announced publicly in this House that that quota would not be operated.  It is true that it was never removed, but anyone who asked for a licence got it, and that is what makes the difference.

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Something that was said touched the Minister, and that is all.  The Government must become alive to this position if they intend to get anywhere.  They have not been alive to it and the Minister for Agriculture has not been alive to it.  If we are to have anything in the way of wheat schemes, cereals schemes or food schemes, we must make an earnest endeavour about it.  There is no use in Deputy Childers telling us here to-night something which is quite right &mdash;that a lot of the land has been impoverished, and that steps must be taken to improve it&mdash;unless, at the same time, Government Departments do something to ensure that manures are available.  That has not been done up to the present.  From the beginning, the Government has fumbled with this question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reference was made to-day to the price of seed grain.  I remember&mdash;last September, I think it was&mdash;after the threshing had started, putting a Parliamentary question to the Minister with regard to the price of oats.  The Minister had made a statement that 14/- a barrel was a fair price for oats. I asked him if he were satisfied that the price would be paid and he said he thought it would.  I asked him if he would fix it, and he replied that he would not.  He said that anybody who kept the oats would get that price for <Col N="199" /> it.  Was that, in fact, a good policy, a long-sighted policy: was it a long view or a short view?  It was definitely a short view.  I do not like fixed prices or Governmental control, but there are times when one cannot do without it. If the Minister is having anything to do with prices at all, the best thing he could do would be to fix them, and also to have some kind of graded prices for grain for seed purposes later on.</P>
    <P>That could have been done earlier, but it was not done.  What happened? I am not finding fault with the merchants who bought grain for seed. They got a good price for it.  However, I know personally that it was bought at 10/- and 11/- a barrel at that time. They did not pay the 14/- agreed upon by the Minister as reasonable.  They only paid 10/- and 11/-, and that would enable oatmeal to be sold at around 14/- or 15/- a cwt.  They stored that oats and it is being returned by way of oatmeal as high as 20/- and 25/- a cwt.  Is that good for the food problem, for the hungry people?  Some people will say that the farmer is entitled to the best price he can get for his seed oats.  I am a farmer, and sold seed oats and got a good price.  I would be perfectly satisfied, and so would every other farmer, to get that.  In the first place, the farmer would not know what seed oats would fetch.  If I were assured of a fixed price of 14/- for oats in September and October, and 16/- or 17/- in February or March, I would be perfectly satisfied.  But that is not the point: the point is that the difference between the buying price of oats and the selling price of oatmeal would have been eliminated and there would be cheap food for everybody, and everybody would be quite well-off.  A few farmers getting 30/- and 35/- and up to £2 and £2 2s. per barrel for oats may have to put up with 17/- a barrel, but when the poor people are able to buy oatmeal at less than £1 per cwt. they would have been better off.  However, the Minister did not do that.</P>
    <P>The same thing happened with regard to seed wheat.  I understand there were people who had their lands ploughed and had not the wherewithal to buy wheat or oats.  Some of them <Col N="200" /> came to the county council when the scheme was finished and the closing date over, and we had to reopen it to give them seed.  I do not like control, but if there is to be control it should be of a decent type, and should be in force all the time, with more regard to the food value than to the price of oats.</P>
    <P>We are told by Deputy O Briain about some speech which Deputy Dillon made.  I read it a while ago, as I was not here when he made it. He said a lot of things which I would not say and which many other members would not say; but, in the main, what did he say?  He simply said that he had always said that wheat growing was &ldquo;codology&rdquo; and, if it was not &ldquo;codology,&rdquo; why was the Minister for the Co-ordination of Defensive Measures out now trying to buy wheat in America?  That is all that was said about it; that was the sum and substance of the whole thing; and, of course, that has to be said.  I have always grown wheat.  I never thought &mdash;and do not think to-day&mdash;that in ordinary normal times it would be good business for me to grow wheat for the market.  I do not think it is economical, unless the Government or the consumer pays me something extra for that purpose.  However, the war has come upon us and the self-sufficiency policy which we thought we had has broken down&mdash;for one reason, and that only, that the people on the Government side of the House did not realise that the self-sufficiency policy was not complete at all and that they only had it in name.  I do not wish the Minister to be led astray again and tell him now that, if he and his Department do not make an earnest of this matter, the country will be without food.  If the type of organisation we had for the last two years&mdash;since the war started&mdash;is any indication of the type of organisation we will have in the future, we will fail.  Tractors could not be kept constantly working, manures were not to be had, seed prices went out of bounds.</P>
    <P>Now, when we get a chance of a little petrol, we are going to waste it on private cars and we may not have it in the harvest time when it is needed. We are told that there is no security for the month of June, even in regard <Col N="201" /> to private cars.  The first thing should be to conserve whatever supplies we have.  There is no use in the Minister losing his temper or getting angry with me: that will not hurt me one bit and will do no good to him.  There is no use in the Minister getting up&mdash;as the Minister for Supplies did some time ago&mdash;to mislead the people by telling them that there is a two years&rsquo; supply of wheat in the country.</P>
