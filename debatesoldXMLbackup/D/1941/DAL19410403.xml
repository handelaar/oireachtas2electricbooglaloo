      <P>Deputies will observe that the normal order of questions has been altered on to-day's Order Paper, so that Deputies who had tabled questions in good time, and which questions were not reached yesterday, may not be stymied again, to-day.  I hope that the questions, which are 49 in number, will all be dealt with to-day, and that Deputies in putting supplementaries will have regard to brevity and relevancy, avoiding argument or veiled debate.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for External Affairs if he will state how many ships sailing under the Irish flag were (a) attacked and (b) sunk during the last four weeks; the names of the ships and the circumstances and results of the attack; whether the parties responsible for the attack were identified; what action has been taken by way of protest; whether compensation has been sought in respect of the lives and property destroyed, and whether any steps have been taken to protect Irish ships in future against such attack.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>During the last four weeks, one Irish vessel has been sunk and three others have been attacked.</P>
      <P>The vessel sunk was the s.s. &ldquo;St. Fintan&rdquo;, a collier of 495 gross tons. According to the only report which has so far been received, the vessel sank about a fortnight ago at the entrance to the Bristol Channel following a loud explosion.  It is not yet known whether the vessel was attacked or struck a mine.  Her entire crew of nine was lost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The vessels attacked were the s.s. &ldquo;Glencullen&rdquo; and &ldquo;Glencree&rdquo;, two colliers of 448 and 481 tons, respectively, and the motor vessel &ldquo;Edenvale&rdquo; of 444 tons.  The two former <Col N="1345" /> were machine-gunned by aircraft in the Bristol Channel last week.  The motor vessel &ldquo;Edenvale&rdquo; was machine-gunned by four aircraft at the entrance to the Bristol Channel a few days later.  Each of the three vessels sustained some damage, but no personal injuries were suffered.  In all cases, the attacking aircraft were identified as German.  The <i>Charge d'Affaires</i> in Berlin has been instructed to protest against these attacks, and to claim compensation for the damage done.</P>
    <P>As I informed Deputy Dillon, in reply to a question on the 20th February, the Government is not satisfied that the advantage of providing armed protection for Irish ships would outweigh the disadvantages.  There would be considerable risk that the arming of Irish ships, far from obviating such incidents as have occurred, would tend to make them more frequent, thereby increasing the danger to Irish life and property. However, in view of these recent incidents, the whole question of the protection of Irish ships is being reconsidered.</P>

The posters advertising the lettings were put up only in the colony and at the auction it was made clear to any local applicants that the lettings would be confined to migrants.  Suitable terms having been agreed upon, the lands were let to migrants.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>The approximate area of bog in the hands of the Land Commission in Laoighis is 340 acres and in Offaly is 2,020 acres.  The greater part of these areas comprises bogs of very inferior quality for which there is no demand and which it is considered would not warrant heavy expenditure on development.</P>
      <P>With regard to the second part of the Deputy's question, power has been given to local authorities to acquire and let or work turf banks and the Land Commission will be glad to facilitate these authorities in every possible manner should they desire to exploit any bogs on Land Commission hands.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Lands whether in view of the necessity for increased turf cutting he will state whether the Land Commission propose to acquire the turbary at Umeras, Monasterevan, for division among local persons.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy was previously informed, the Land Commission about three years ago acquired some 268 acres of the bogs owned by the Umeras Peat Company, nearly all of which have been allotted.  His <Col N="1348" /> present question presumably refers to a residue of some 300 acres of turbary at Umeras not acquired.</P>
      <P>The Land Commission have at present no proceedings for the acquisition of this turbary.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the appeal that has been made to cut turf, and in view of the keen demand for turf banks in that area, will the Minister consider the question of instructing the Land Commission to take early steps to acquire that land for division so as to ensure that the turbary there will be fully exploited this year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall call the attention of the Minister for Industry and Commerce to the matter.  I think I should explain to the House that the procedure for acquiring turbary under the Land Commission is rather complicated and tedious and the intention is that in future, as far as possible, in order to meet emergency conditions, exploitation of turf should be carried out, if at all possible, through the Turf Development Board.  I shall call their attention to the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister bear in mind that this House gave certain powers to the Government, under the Emergency Powers Act, which would enable the Minister to operate supplementary legislation to remove any tedious and cumbersome procedure that may exist and, in view of the general appeal by the Taoiseach and Ministers, and the anxiety that exists for putting by as large a supply of turf as possible to meet the country's requirements, will the Minister give an assurance that no tedious or cumbersome procedure will be allowed to hold up the winning of turf this year?</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>When I referred to tedious and complicated procedure, I was referring to the normal procedure which takes place when the Land Commission is providing turbary for its own tenants.  The provision of turbary for outside persons, for parish councils and others, is an entirely different matter.  The initiative in this matter might well come from the local <Col N="1349" /> authority, seeing that the Government have given them special powers, under a recent Emergency Order, to arrange for the exploitation of turf banks.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>

      <P>When it was announced early in March that the clock would be advanced by a further hour in Great Britain and Northern Ireland during the period from the 3rd May to the 9th of August, the Departments concerned considered the question of taking the same step here.  There are many arguments in favour of doing so.  A temporary difference in clock-time as compared with Great Britain and Northern Ireland is bound to cause a certain amount of confusion.  It will cause difficulties and complications in the operations of mail, telegraph and telephone communications and transport services with Northern Ireland.  It <Col N="1352" /> will cause inconvenience in communications with Great Britain also, but the effect will not be as serious this year as it would be in normal times, since mail and passenger services to Great Britain have been severely curtailed. Furthermore, an advance of clock-time would have the advantage of effecting a saving of fuel particularly by the Electricity Supply Board and gas works.  After careful consideration of all the arguments for and against, however, the Government have come to the conclusion that the disadvantages of a further advance in clock-time would at present outweigh the advantages, and they have, accordingly, decided not to make any change.</P>

      <P>The referee has not yet reported on the application made under the Military Service Pensions Act, 1934, by Mr. Patrick Coloe, Ardstown, Summerhill, County Meath.  When a <Col N="1353" /> decision has been reached the applicant will be notified without any undue delay.</P>

Company, 3rd Battalion, 5th Brigade, and that no decision has been reached so far, and if he will expedite a decision in these cases.</P>

      <P>The findings of the referee were communicated to the applicants on the 1st instant, except in the case of Mr. James Wrenn, who was notified of the referee's decision on the 2nd July last. Mr. Wrenn has now appealed against the decision of the referee.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Defence if he is aware that in certain cases where civilian labour has been employed in connection with military posts, suitable members of the Local Defence Force, and the Local Security Force have been overlooked and jobs given to men who have been known to be actively in opposition to the formation of these Defence Corps; and if in future he will make an order that when civilian labour is being employed, either directly or through contractors, that first preference be given to suitable men in the Local Defence Force and the Local Security Force.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>The reply to the first part of the question is in the negative. In answer to the second part of the <Col N="1354" /> question, the procedure adopted is that the existence of vacancies is notified to the employment exchange by the Corps of Engineers, and from the persons submitted by the employment exchange a selection is made by the local engineer officer, first preference being given to old I.R.A. men who have offered themselves for military service during the present emergency and have not been accepted for reasons of age or health.  Second preference is given to persons who are members of any of the emergency defence organisations. As regards labour employed by contractors to the Department, I am not in a position to specify conditions of service.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonnONeill" hpid="Mr. O'Neill Mr. O'Neill">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Neill</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest to the Minister that it is necessary to do as I have requested.  I did not put down this question without first having taken into consideration certain particular cases.  Would the Minister think it worth while to inquire if this grievance does not actually exist in Kinsale? What I have indicated in the question is being perpetuated there.  When civilian labour is required suitable men who are in the Local Defence and the Local Security Force have been actually overlooked while men actively in opposition to the formation of these bodies have secured the jobs.  I think that in the future when civilian labour is being employed, directly or through contractors, the first preference should be given to suitable men who are amongst those who have freely placed their services at the disposal of their country.</P>

The actual figures are 13,000 to 15,000 lower, even taking unemployment plus artificial employment, but so far as the provision of means to deal with the unemployment as it exists is concerned, that is being urgently looked into.

Grants for the schemes are approved to the local authorities on the express condition that the works are to be started and proceeded with in such a way as to be completed within the financial year.  A further determining factor in this matter is the necessity of avoiding possible interference with spring work on farms through the continuance in operation of large-scale employment schemes in rural areas after the 31st March.  It is hoped shortly to make an announcement which will much improve the position in the rural areas.</P>

      <P>Unemployment assistance cannot be paid legally to any applicant for whom suitable employment is available.  Whether or not employment offering is suitable for any individual applicant is determined in <Col N="1371" /> accordance with the Unemployment Assistance Acts on the facts of the case regard being had to age, physique, education, normal occupation, place of residence and family circumstances.  I am aware of only one case in which the applicant was offered and refused employment in Clonsast bog following his rejection for the Construction Corps on the grounds of medical unfitness.  This applicant, though accepted by the employer, following an examination by a medical officer, had refused an earlier offer of employment in Clonsast bog. He again refused this employment and his application for unemployment assistance was disallowed.  The standards of fitness required for work in Clonsast bog and in the Construction Corps were fixed by the respective employers. In the case of the Construction Corps, the standard is laid down in Defence Force Regulations 80 and 88 of 1940. The standards of fitness are related to the requirements of the employers. The difference in the standards is due to their different requirements.</P>

(2) Seeing that the average production per head of persons employed in agriculture, including both owners and hired help, does not exceed £70 per annum, how is it possible for a farmer to pay a minimum of 30/- per week to each adult employed?  (3) Would it not be better for unmarried men without dependents to get wages even below 30/- per week, which farmers would be glad to pay, particularly where the father of such men was already employed on the same farm, than to be compelled to remain idle altogether without even a hope of the dole, from which they are excluded by the operation of the recently passed Employment Period Order?</P>

      <P>Would the Minister consider announcing forthwith the minimum prices that he will undertake to pay for those commodities in the autumn so as to get the barley and oats sown?  Details of the scheme can lie over.  If the Minister will announce the minimum prices, it will enable all of us to co-operate in getting individuals to sow the corn.  If the experience we had last year were to be repeated, when only 8/- and 10/- a barrel were paid, it would be very hard to get people to venture again.  If the Minister were to announce now that minimum prices will be paid by him&mdash;let anybody else pay more if he wants to&mdash;that will enable us to get the stuff sown.</P>

    <P>That Dáil Eireann is of opinion that adequate steps have not been taken to deal with the foot-and-mouth disease epidemic, and that the Government be requested to explain why the disease appears to be spreading and to state what new <Col N="1387" /> steps, if any, it proposes adopting to cope with the epidemic.</P>
    <P>It is recognised, both inside and outside this House, that our agriculture is the mainstay of the country, and that our live stock is the mainstay of our agriculture.  It is further recognised that the present outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease threatens our whole cattle, pig and sheep population <i>vide</i> the statement of the Minister for Agriculture in Dáil Eireann on the 20th ultimo.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Linehan</NameTxt>
      <P>At one period in his statement, when he was moving the reference back of this Estimate, Deputy Keyes touched upon the difficulties of obtaining supplies of milk for the free milk schemes in various areas.  He intimated that one of the reasons why milk was not available was that people who heretofore sold milk in small quantities were not now doing so, because <Col N="1395" /> they could not bring their premises to the standard required by the regulations. The position is an extremely serious one, and it will become more grave if there is going to be a shortage of foodstuffs in urban or rural districts. I suggest it would be very advisable for the Department to take steps to acquire supplies of milk on a large scale for distribution amongst the poor children of this country.  We are facing a period when milk will be more valuable than ever.  The drastic rationing in regard to tea that we read about to-day will make things very awkward for the poorer householders.</P>
      <P>The Minister cannot suggest that milk is not available.  In every creamery district milk is being taken in every day of the week.  That milk is turned into butter.  We take a certain amount of butter for our own consumption and we export the balance. That balance is being exported at a loss, because the export is being subsidised. Would it not be possible for the Minister to ignore the regulations. cut through the red tape, and make arrangements whereby local authorities will be able to get the surplus milk from the creameries for the purpose of meeting the requirements of necessitous children?  A creamery taking in 2,000 or 3,000 gallons a day could afford to sell, for direct human consumption, 400 or 500 gallons, and the local authorities would be able to secure that and sell it at a reasonable price to the poorer sections of the community. The farmers are not getting such a high price and any scheme of that nature would not hurt them. Even if it were necessary, there could be a subsidy given so that the poor would get the milk very cheaply, if it could not be given to them absolutely free of cost.  In that way we would be merely doing what is always being done in connection with butter exports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would prefer to see the milk being drunk by our children rather than export it in the form of butter and subsidising that export.  When the regulations about dairies and cowsheds came into force, persons selling only nine or ten gallons of milk could not afford <Col N="1396" /> £40 or £50 to bring their premises up to the standard required.  The position with the creameries is different, because they have the machinery and equipment necessary to pasteurise the milk.  Perhaps the Minister will consider my suggestion in view of the shortage of foodstuffs and the scarcity of tea.  It would be desirable, in these circumstances, to take over surplus supplies of milk and put them within reach of the people who need milk so badly for themselves and their children.  If that were done it would be of considerable benefit to the people of the country.</P>
    <P>I do not think the Minister should allow any regulation or statute to prevent the operation of such a scheme. The one thing the children will most need if the emergency persists is milk and if it is available in the creameries it should be used for home consumption instead of exporting it in the form of butter.  Last year we were exporting butter and subsidising it although we wanted it at home.</P>
    <P>There is one particular aspect of the Local Government Department with which I would like to deal.  It is in connection with building.  It seems to be hinted that the Local Government Department or public authorities will not initiate building schemes or sewerage or waterworks schemes during the emergency period except in cases of urgency.  That is a terrible mistake.  When anyone considers the unemployment figures he will have to admit that were it not for public and private building, and sewerage and waterworks schemes, the unemployment figure would be much higher.  If we are justified in spending money on anything at the present time we are justified in spending it on the relief of unemployment.</P>
    <P>So far as building and waterworks and sewerage schemes are concerned, it is very doubtful if all the materials that would be required are not already available in this country.  Take an ordinary cottage building scheme.  It is hard to see why our native building materials would not be sufficient to enable us to erect cottages.  The entire job could be one of concrete.  Timber <Col N="1397" /> requirements could be curtailed considerably by constructing a concrete roof.  If reinforcement is necessary, we have plenty of waste metals which could be used.  If public authorities are to stop building schemes or other public utility schemes, it will mean adding very large numbers to the already heavy total of unemployed, because, in rural areas and in urban areas, the only available employment for carpenters, masons and other types of tradesmen connected with the building trade, and for the great bulk of unskilled labour who had not the opportunity of engaging in agricultural work, was the employment given by building and public utility schemes. At present I should much prefer to see money being spent on the carrying on of building and public utility schemes than to see these people allowed to go unemployed.</P>
    <P>On another occasion, I referred to the fact that, in my own town, 18 out of 28 carpenters were unemployed. Four or five of these 28 carpenters were men who worked on their own and who had workshops in their own houses.  The other 23 or 24 were employed by local contractors, and these local contractors now have no work for these men, except on one small scheme which is to start there immediately. Instead of dropping building schemes, would it not be much better to keep them on and to carry on the various schemes suggested for the past number of years?  The number of cottages to be built in our public health area has not been reached at all, and would it not be better to spend money on building these cottages and on giving these men employment even though the cottages cost £50 or £60 extra?</P>
    <P>I believe that if there were a little more care and attention paid to the pricing of the contracts, as I said last night it would be found very often that with good contractors, paying good wages the increased cost during the war period would not be so much. The trouble is that you are going to have no private building for the future and if the Local Government Department which controls all housing and public utility works, does not keep <Col N="1398" /> building and the carrying out of these works going on, we are going to have the unemployment amongst the type of people catered for by this work increasing every day.  These people are not the type to be absorbed in agriculture.  The agricultural position at the moment does not give any room for their absorption, and I ask the Minister, if he is going to spend money in his Department this year, to spend it on building and public utility schemes which will keep these people in employment.</P>
    <P>There is one matter which the Minister seems to have overlooked.  It has to do not with his own Department but with the position of the public health authorities by reason of the operation of the Employment Period Order.  The Minister responsible for that order seems to suggest that no destitution or hardship can arise through its operation, because, if a person is destitute or suffering hardship, he can qualify for home assistance.  Assuming that, owing to the operation of the order, 2,000 or 3,000 people are held by the local authorities to be destitute and entitled to home assistance, what provision does the Minister suggest the local authorities are going to make for them?  They have no provision made at present because the local authorities could not have anticipated last year that this period order was going to be made, and does the Minister not realise that if the local authorities are satisfied that this order gives rise to destitution and hardship, they will have to budget for far greater amounts in respect of home assistance next year, with a consequent increase in the rates in the particular areas?  It is merely a shifting of responsibility for a national burden on to the shoulders of the local ratepayers.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyLinehan" hpid="Mr. Linehan Mr. Linehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Linehan</NameTxt>
      <P>My submission to the Minister is that, instead of putting these people on the home assistance authorities, when they will be his responsibility, he should provide employment for them, by carrying on the works which local <Col N="1399" /> authorities now seem to intend to stop. I will not go any further with it.</P>
      <P>There is another point, and again it may be suggested that it is a purely local matter.  I should like to know from the Minister what is the attitude of his Department with regard to sanctioning the appointments of people to jobs under public authorities.  I want to give him an instance.  Let us assume that the position of home assistance officer became vacant and one applicant was a man and the other a young girl.  The board of health, wrongly, in my opinion, choose to appoint the young girl to the job and, having appointed her, when the position of cottage rent collector becomes vacant, they amalgamate that position with the position of home assistance officer, appointing the young girl to the two jobs.  Does the Minister not think it would be no harm if he woke up the public authorities and told them that, where a suitable man is available for a job, he, and not a young girl of 22 or 23 years, should get it?  After all, a man who is a candidate for one of these jobs may have family responsibilities or may be supporting other people, and nobody could suggest that we would be doing anything invidious or anything against the female sex, if we said that in respect of the job of cottage rent collector for a wide area in a rural district, a man is better able to fill the position than any woman.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that, in a case like that, even though public authorities are entitled to elect whomsoever they like to these positions, the Minister, in his discretion, ought to investigate the type of person appointed, even though the local authority says that person is quite all right, and use his discretion, if necessary, to refuse to sanction the appointment.  It is not good in the eyes of the public that, in any board of health area, positions should be filled day after day by persons who are definitely connected with members of the board and who the public believe would not have got these positions but for the fact that their relations were members of the board of health.  It has always been suggested in the past <Col N="1400" /> 20 years that we had got away from something which had been happening before that, and it was always suggested, in a sneering manner, that the old district councils and urban councils, prior to the movements of 1916 to 1920, were hot-beds of corruption, but I do not think that, in the history of these old boards, anything happened like what is happening in County Cork at present.</P>
    <P>If the Minister will investigate the appointments in the North Cork Board of Health area for the past four or five years, and look up the relationships of people appointed to particular positions, I am sure he will get the shock of his life.  I regret very much that instead of the attitude of some public representatives being that they will not use their influence to secure appointments for their own friends, the attitude seems to be rather that it would be very unfair to penalise a man's son or daughter because his or her father was a county councillor. That seems to be the attitude towards public appointments now.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyLinehan" hpid="Mr. Linehan Mr. Linehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Linehan</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I submit that when a board of health makes an appointment, the Minister should use his discretion in the matter of sanction, and, obviously, one of the reasons for refusing would be the appointment of a young girl to a job in a district where men were available.  That type of appointment has done more to discredit public authorities in this country than anything else, and I am quite satisfied that, in the area I represent, owing to the action of persons who voted for people for jobs like that, if there was a plebiscite taken to-morrow morning for or against a commissioner and the abolition of the board of public health, the commissioner system would win by ten to one.  That is not a very nice thing to have to say after 20 years of self-government.  I make this final appeal to the Minister, that, no matter what happens, he will do all he can to keep building and public utility work going; that he will <Col N="1401" /> get all the money he can to keep them going; and that he will induce and encourage public authorities to keep them going by the provision of money &mdash;anything to prevent the unemployment which is being created in the country by the stoppage of these schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestEdmondsonBenso" hpid="Mr. Benson Mr. Benson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Benson</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to hear from the Minister what, if any, schemes are in contemplation in his Department for the community-feeding of people, more particularly in the City of Dublin and, possibly, eventually over a much larger area.  The Minister is aware that I recently put down a question on this subject, but it dealt only with the possibility of such feeding having to arise out of belligerent action, but it seems to me that if the promised spate of unemployment develops&mdash;and, unfortunately, I can see no reason why it should not some time&mdash;the probability that some form of community feeding will become necessary is, I think, very strong.  I should like the Minister also to say whether he is prepared to co-operate with any other body already dealing with that matter&mdash;the older charities or the new one just started, the Guild of Good Will, which is concentrating on that particular aspect at the moment &mdash;and whether the Department is prepared fully to co-operate with any scheme such as that which will help to relieve the distress and destitution which may come upon this city.  As far as the administration of this Department is concerned, one thing has been mentioned in every speech made so far&mdash;the delay which takes place.  I have no desire to go into details on that point.  The fact that Deputies from all parts of the country have mentioned it is sufficient evidence that such delay does take place.  What the cause of it is I do not know, but it is very distressing to persons who give their time&mdash;time which, in some cases, can be ill spared&mdash;to the work of local authorities to find that schemes which they, in their wisdom, think are good schemes, when sent up to the Custom House, seem to hibernate there.  &ldquo;Hibernate&rdquo; is hardly the right word because they remain there <Col N="1402" /> for more than one winter.  I appeal to the Minister seriously to consider whether the time he spends listening to complaints of this sort would not be more profitably spent in a thorough investigation of the Department with a view to ascertaining the cause of these delays.  The local authorities endeavour to act rightly in the various things which they attempt and they do feel that the Department should be as a father to them and should give them encouragement instead of allowing schemes to lie in their hands for so long a period that the people get disgruntled. I ask the Minister seriously to consider whether there cannot be more co-operation between his Department and the local authorities so as to get all outstanding matters cleared off. At times, the Department and some of the local authorities seem to consider they are doing better work by scoring points off one another in letters than by getting on with the work in hand. I am sure that, if the Minister would devote some of his time to the investigation of this matter of delay, he would clear it up and this important Department, which touches the life of the country more than any other Department, would, as a result, really and truly co-operate with the local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister referred rather briefly in his speech to the moneys derived from the Hospitals Sweepstakes.  For years now, we have been hearing, both from the Minister and his predecessor, about the increasing demands which are coming in from the hospitals year after year.  We have never learned what the policy of the Ministry is with regard to that.  So far as one can judge from the events of the past few years, there does not appear to be any directive policy.  They simply take each year's accounts as they are submitted, express astonishment at the increase in the deficits and say that larger sums are required in order to provide a capital fund to produce the income to meet these deficits.  They leave the matter at that.  That is an unsatisfactory method of dealing with a problem which should be tackled much more intelligently.  Has the Minister <Col N="1403" /> at any time considered the desirability of handing over to these hospitals a lump sum which will produce a standard contribution towards meeting the deficits?  He need not bind himself to the sum which would be required in the case of last year.  He can take into consideration extensions or improvements which would be required in the running of the hospitals and finish that side of the business.</P>
      <P>The Hospitals Commission which has been established raised suspicions for a while as to whether it was not a sort of sanatorium for politicians who were rejected for the Dáil.  They went in and out of it, they are going in and out of it now and probably will continue to do so for some time to come. What the actual work of the commission is nobody knows unless he reads the report which is occasionally published. The report does not seem to run on parallel lines with the policy of the Ministry as we learned on the introduction of a Bill to construct a new hospital on the north side of the city. Some years ago, the then Lord Mayor of Cork convened a public meeting in the City Hall to consider what should be done with regard to a hospital the building of which was then under consideration there.  Nothing has been done about that, although it is some years ago.</P>
      <P>Whatever allowance one may make for the criticisms, which are apparently perpetual, of Ministers and Ministries, one is forced to the conclusion&mdash;when finding such a case as the non-building of the hospital in Cork, the situation, described here yesterday by Deputy Brennan, of various other hospitals erected in different parts of the country which are defective in important particulars, one having no water and another no sewerage and a third allowing the rain to come in&mdash;an inspector visited the place after a series of dry weeks and was unable to discover the rain&mdash;that strength is lent to the case made against the Ministry in respect of its mishandling or incompetence in respect of public administration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister the desirability of reconsidering his policy, if he <Col N="1404" /> has any policy, in respect of these hospitals' moneys.  Many of these charitable hospitals are in existence over a long period&mdash;most of them over 100 years.  They have ministered to the needs of the people for a long time, according to the moneys available to them, and they have done what they could to relieve suffering and to help the sick.  Generally, their services were very useful and the people were very grateful for them.  When this scheme of getting money for the hospitals was introduced, the people saw very big sums collected and subscriptions to the hospitals fell away.  In essence the hospitals were placed in much the same position as they were prior to the introduction of the sweepstakes.  They are now almost entirely dependent on what they get from the sweepstakes. So far as one can learn, they are in the position that they have practically to give explanations for all their expenditure.  They are subject to examination and sanction has to be received for certain matters.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to see that there is any policy behind this whole business.  For instance, with the money that there is available, has there been any attempt, either on the part of the Minister or the Hospitals Commission, to see what improvements could be effected in any of the hospitals?  From information conveyed to me from different sources, not confined to any one hospital, no such policy is being carried out at present.  Proposals which are put up are subjected to the very closest possible scrutiny.  In one case, down the country, the surgeon reported that he required an X-ray apparatus which, presumably, would cost about £100. The excuse was made that, in view of the likely construction of a new hospital, it would be inadvisable to spend this money, although the equipment could have been transferred from the old hospital to the new one, if it were ever built.  Meantime, the patients there are not being properly attended to.  There is plenty of money available.</P>
    <P>I should like to know from the Minister what is the policy of either the Hospitals Commission or the Department with regard to the construction <Col N="1405" /> of hospitals in Dublin or Cork.  It appears as if the Minister's attention was being directed towards the provision of new buildings.  New buildings, if they are going to be expensive, and are going to add to the cost of attendance on the poor, are not as advisable as providing better methods of dealing with the patients, if that could be done at less expense. We had the example here a short time ago of the Richmond, Whitworth and Hardwicke Hospitals.  The proposal was to scrap a hospital that was constructed only 50 or 60 years ago and that is one of the most up-to-date in the city.  The idea was to have a magnificent new building.  The first thing that ought to be considered is the treatment of patients and there has been no increase in hospital accommodation in Dublin.  It is alleged that a few extra beds have been provided, but that is not a real increase.  The same thing might be said with regard to Cork.  In three or four cases, where hospitals have been built throughout the country, they have not yet been utilised.  We heard from Deputy Linehan the other day of a hospital which was constructed and which was taken over by the military.  The Minister ought to reconsider his entire policy in regard to this matter and approach the question from the point of view of increase in the accommodation for patients.  There are other matters of which he can learn from the medical profession which would be of advantage, not only to hospital patients, but to the general health of the people in the cities and in the country.</P>
    <P>The Minister told us about the discovery of a new serum for diphtheria. If I interpreted what the Minister said correctly, he conveyed that the matter had been put before the Medical Research Council by the Department of Local Government, but that so far they had not heard from the Medical Research Council.  Some three or four months ago we read with great satisfaction about the discovery of this new serum by Doctors O'Meara and McSweeney.  It is a matter of satisfaction to Deputy Hickey and myself <Col N="1406" /> to know that one of these doctors took out his degree in University College, Cork.  It is four months since that announcement was made.  I have made inquiries, but I have not been able to substantiate the Minister's statement, if I interpreted it correctly.  No letter was sent by the Local Government Department to the Medical Research Council about this new serum.  If I have misinterpreted the Minister, I shall be glad to give way to him.  That is one of the things that would appear to the ordinary Deputy to be of some importance.</P>
    <P>It is only a few years ago since the public were horrified by an occurrence which took place down the country. The information I had from some members of the medical profession at that time was that no reliance could be placed on the serum in use at that time, even though the Department of Local Government were particularly anxious that parents should consent to have their children immunised.  If the discovery is such as has been announced, certainly a remarkable advance has taken place in medical science in this country and it merits much more consideration than the Minister has thought fit to give it.</P>
    <P>It is a satisfaction to learn from the statistics given by the Minister yesterday that public health generally is improving.  It would be interesting to get fuller statistics from certain of the hospitals.  People who live in cities, such as Cork and Dublin, are always pleased to learn that their hospitals are showing good results.  My information, for what it is worth, is that there have been remarkable results obtained in some of these hospitals.  After a lean period, if one might so describe it, during the last couple of decades, it is a satisfaction to know that the medical and surgical profession here are keeping so well abreast with the times.  It was the general impression, after the success which attended the Sweepstakes, that a remarkable improvement could be anticipated in medical science here.  It afforded an opportunity for a progressive Ministry. Such a Ministry would have seen the <Col N="1407" /> opportunity that was there to mark an improvement in our position.  Other countries have done so.  There have been some remarkable results in places which, in the lifetime of people who are not very old now, were regarded as being second-rate or third-rate. You had them for example in Edinburgh, the McGill University and the Mayo Clinic.  We had opportunities that few of those countries had, but we do not seem to have made any great progress during the last few years.  We would be glad to hear from the Minister what his intentions are with regard to this question, whether he will now say to the hospitals: &ldquo;Well, we have been for some time seeing what is the best policy to adopt with regard to this matter and we now propose to endow each one of those hospitals in accordance with a well-considered, fairly distributed slice of this public money&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>There is then the question of the hospitalisation of Cork, a more important city than the one we are assembled in.  It is to be hoped that it will now get the hospitalisation that it requires, needs and deserves. Generally, we would like to know what sum of money is going to be made available for the construction of new hospitals, and, if the very elaborate plans which were in mind with regard to the new hospitals, are to be in any way altered, what the proposals are for increasing the bed accommodation for patients.  We should like to know, also, if there is any information from the Medical Research Council which has been in operation for some time.  I think the Minister can depend on it that he will receive sympathetic consideration in regard to all those problems if we learn from him that he has his mind bent upon marking an improvement, and of showing that this country is worthy of the great confidence that not only the public here but in other countries have placed in it through the medium of their generous support of the Hospitals Sweeps.</P>

      <P>My reason for intervening <Col N="1408" /> in the debate is to ask the Minister a question.  Due to the outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease the Minister is aware that farmers all over the country are finding it difficult to meet their obligations in regard to the payment of rates.  The markets have been stopped for the time being.  I hope the Minister will not place any difficulty in the way of county councils who, in present circumstances, desire to extend the period for the collection of the rates.  I am not suggesting that he should issue any general order, but I am hoping that the Department will not do what it did in former years, compel rate collectors to close their warrants at an early period this year. That may have the effect of placing county councils in a financial difficulty for a month or so.  Perhaps the Minister would enable them to get over that difficulty by making it easy for them to get bank accommodation for the time being.  The position is so grave at the moment so far as the farmers are concerned, that I am sure the Minister will give every facility to county councils who desire to extend the period for the collection of the rates.</P>

      <P>I look upon the Department of Public Health as one of the most important Departments of the State.  As a member of the local bodies in Cork City, I want to say that we have experienced great disappointment at the slowness of the Department in coming to decisions on matters which affect the city and the county.  We often wonder whether the Minister is in contact at all with the administration of his Department in view of the delays that take place in getting decisions on many matters of importance. Deputy Cosgrave referred rather lightly to the question of the hospitalisation of Cork City.  If one wanted to criticise simply for the purpose of criticising, then I say the citizens of Cork have good reason to be critical of the way in which the Department of Local Government has treated the question of the hospitalisation of their city during the past six or seven years.  It is hard to believe that any Department of State could have been so shortsighted as this Department has been or, to put <Col N="1409" /> it more bluntly, so inefficient.  In Cork City we have had hospitals under way since 1932, 1933 and 1934.  There is not the remotest sign of any of them being built for the next six or seven years. When one has to deal with these matters week after week, one is forced to ask whether the Minister is in touch at all with matters appertaining to his Department.  I am a member of several public bodies: the public assistance board, the corporation, mental hospital committee, and the sanatorium. I have seen in the latter place an X-ray machine, value for £1,000, laid up in a room for over 12 months because we could not get a decision from the Department as to what should be done with the contractor responsible for putting it in a working condition. We had contracts being carried out, money held up and appeals made to the Department for decisions on this, that and the other.  We had men losing their patience and giving up all hope of anything effective being done by this Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Six or seven years ago plans were prepared for a maternity hospital, and when the site was almost acquired we got word that the place was going to be condemned.  It was condemned and a new site was mentioned.  We were asked to inspect it.  The committee was appointed to do so with the engineer and the doctor of the maternity hospital.  They gave a certain report, pending the receipt of the engineers' report.  The next thing we found was that there were several people interested in getting the site sold.  The site was sold for £6,000, and payment was sanctioned by the Department of Local Government despite the fact that we had no report from the engineers.  Twelve months or so after the site had been acquired we had a report from the engineers saying that it would cost anything up to £25,000 to prepare it and sink foundations. It would cost that before a brick was laid to build the hospital. That happened about three years ago, and we have not heard a word since. We see no immediate chance of getting the hospital in spite of the fact that we have paid £1,185 for the preparation <Col N="1410" /> of plans for the hospital on another site.  When we were asked by the Department we agreed that a prize should be offered and a competition got going for plans for the hospital. We waited for months and months before we got the competition going. Without exaggeration it must be 18 months ago since we did that.  We have not yet heard a word about the plans, who is going to get the prize or anything else.</P>
    <P>About three years ago, as a result of consultation between engineers sent down by the Department and the local engineers, a site was acquired for a fever hospital.  When, however, it had been paid for, we got word from the Department's engineers that the place was unsuitable and that we should look for another site.  We paid £3,500 for that site; now it is condemned and is on the corporation's hands.  We were then told to look for another site, which we did.  The site was purchased without the consent of the corporation at the rate of £175 per acre.  After acquiring the site and having the sewerage plans under way, we have discovered that we cannot build a hospital there until we first build a new reservoir.  I submit to the Minister that if that were done by an ordinary member of the corporation rather than by what are known as experts we would have huge placards all over the place telling us about the muddling by the Cork Corporation.  The same thing applies to the Regional Hospital. We had the plans prepared six or seven years ago, if not more, for a site for the new Regional Hospital, and after the plans had been prepared and the site decided on we had a communication from the Department saying that the site was not suitable and should be scrapped.  The engineer who prepared the plans had been paid £2,500 for preparing them.  A further site was acquired, and we were told that the hospital would cost, roughly. £300,000, and the architects' fees £15,000.  A letter came from the Department telling us that the plans and specifications should be submitted for competition.  As one member of that board, I voted for submitting the <Col N="1411" /> plans for competition, and it was decided, by one vote, that the whole thing should be given to a specific engineer.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding the fact that the Department had said the plans should be submitted for competition, the Department agreed that it should be given to the engineer who was mentioned. He happened to be an employee of the board.  From our experience of dealing with the Department we feel&mdash;personally I feel very strongly&mdash;that the Minister has not that touch with those things which it is desirable for a Minister to have.  If he took into consideration the views of the people locally, rather than those of the engineers and the experts in the Department, I think we would not be in the unfortunate position we are in to-day, as far as Cork City is concerned, on the question of hospitalisation.</P>
    <P>When one considers the amount of money spent on architects' fees and legal expenses, I think it is appalling that any Department of State should allow such muddling.  Another matter we have to complain about is that when a hospital is costing £200,000 or £300,000 we have the architects adding another couple of thousands to that. Of course the reason is that the architect is paid 5 per cent. on the total, and it is in his own interests to make the total as large as possible.  Locally, we have cut out very large sums in those estimates, but the Department is more inclined to agree with the experts, as it calls them, such as the architects and engineers.  Recently, in connection with the building of a cottage hospital in Youghal, we discovered after the whole thing was fixed that a lodge costing £1,300 had to be built.  We stated that we would not agree to a lodge costing more than £480 or £500 but, notwithstanding that, a lodge costing over £1,300 had to be passed.  I should like to say to the Minister that I think he should deal with this question of architects and engineers who are absolutely dominating the situation with regard to hospitals.  What we want in this <Col N="1412" /> country are not palatial hospitals.  We want plain, efficient hospitals, not the costly things which those engineers are putting up in the country, and which cost an enormous amount of money to maintain.</P>
    <P>I understand that in his opening remarks last night&mdash;I was not able to be here&mdash;the Minister stated that public health had improved and that malnutrition was greatly reduced.  I also gathered from the papers this morning that he said certain infectious diseases were reduced.  I think that was contradicted in a later statement by the Minister, when he said that the infant mortality rate was exceedingly high.  I would like to say to the Minister that I am afraid the health of the country has not improved, but is rather on the wrong side all the time.  As far as malnutrition is concerned I am perfectly certain that it is increasing.  I have condemned some of the medical officers because they are not specific enough in determining the condition of health of the people with whom they are in contact.  I saw the latest report from our medical officer of schools in Cork in which he said that over 11 per cent. of the children attending school are suffering from malnutrition.  If one were to consider the condition of the children under five who have not yet reached school, what must be the state of malnutrition?</P>
    <P>I notice that some of the medical officers who talked about malnutrition some few years ago have very definitely cut it out of their reports for the past few years.  If there was malnutrition in certain areas two or three years ago, am I to be told that it is not more marked to-day, with the increased cost of living and with the same purchasing power in the hands of those trying to exist?  In order to bear out what I am saying I should like to refer to a report from one of the home assistance officers which came before us at our meeting last Monday.  This report deals with three little so-called villages about five miles from the City of Cork, Little Island, Riverstown and Glanmire. The home assistance superintendent reported that there were 35 cases which had to be put on home assistance <Col N="1413" /> owing to the Employment Period Order.  It goes on to say that on 22/3/41 there were 35 cases, which included 94 persons, and the amount which the 94 persons received from home assistance was £15 7s. per week. Now that amounts to 3/3 per person per week, or 5½d. per day, or 1½d. per meal per day, without making any provision for rent, fire, clothing, or school books for the little children, not to mention all the other things which would be needed in the household.</P>
    <P>Does the Minister seriously suggest that those 94 persons are properly fed and clothed on that sum?  Mind you, those people have no other income, and there were a number who were not helped by home assistance although they were put off unemployment assistance by the Employment Period Order.  I would like to ask the Minister to read the report of the Cork City Medical Officer of Health last year.  He will see there the amount of income of a number of families in 900 houses where we have differential rents obtaining.  That income has not been ascertained by any outside body, but by the man appointed by the City Manager to determine the amount of the rent.  I want seriously to suggest to the Minister that he should take notice of those figures, and not try to believe that things are as good as he would like them to be, but rather to see them as they really are.</P>
    <P>The position is very serious from the point of view of poverty in Cork City and suburbs.  We heard a good deal to-day about tea rationing and the arrangement of the ration at an ounce of tea for each person.  That means that many people may not be able to get tea and, unfortunately, the poor depend upon it very largely.  The only substitute the poor can have is milk and there are many of them who cannot buy milk on their present incomes. Take, as an example, an old age pensioner with 10/-, or a widow and an orphan with the average weekly amount that is allowed them, or a widow with a non-contributory pension of 7/6.  How can they manage to exist?  Some widows are living in rooms or in very small houses for which <Col N="1414" /> the rent is 3/- or 3/6.  I have received letters from priests telling me how those poor creatures have to pay 3/6 out of their pensions for rent.  I often wonder how those people exist.  I should like the Minister to visualise their difficulties.  I suggest that home assistance, old age pensions and widows' and orphans' pensions should be increased to meet the present abnormal conditions.</P>
    <P>Reference was made here to-day to the desirability of communal feeding of the poor in our cities and towns and the provision of communal kitchens.  I am opposed to communal kitchens.  I believe in feeding the people in their own homes and, if we are to start feeding the sparse population we have in a purely agricultural country through the medium of communal kitchens, then it is time for us to ask ourselves do we deserve to be here as representatives of the people.  It is unfair to ask the people to get their food from communal kitchens.  I know there is some talk of it at the moment. I am not trying to make little of anybody's efforts to help the poor, but I am very keen on maintaining the status of the family and I want to see the poor being fed in their own homes and given the means to buy what they want so that they can cook and eat it in their own homes.  I am opposed to communal kitchens and community feeding.  It is the duty of any Government that describes itself as a Christian Government to enable the people to get the bare necessaries of life.  I did not see any reference to that aspect of things in the Minister's statement.</P>
    <P>In the <i>Irish Press</i> this morning I read that the Minister commented on the little advantage that is being taken by local authorities of opportunities in relation to building and he mentioned Cork as one place that has not many houses in course of construction. That is altogether due to the price we are paying for money.  We have 216 houses under way and we are paying 5¼ per cent. for the money to enable us to build these 216 houses. Taking the acquisition of the land, the development of the site and the building <Col N="1415" /> of the houses, we cannot get them erected at less than £500 per house. The interest we have to pay on the money, 5¼ per cent., means a weekly rent of 10/4.  That must be paid by the workers for interest alone before anything else is added and we cannot continue to build houses while we have to pay so much for the borrowed money.</P>
    <P>We require something like 4,000 houses in Cork.  We have sufficient land and the real problem is to get people to pay the rent for the houses we have already erected.  We have houses at a rent of 10/- to 12/- per week.  There are unemployed people in some of those houses and, because of their circumstances, they cannot meet the rent and the only alternative is to evict them and put them elsewhere.  It is little use the Minister commenting on public bodies not doing sufficient in the way of house construction when we have to pay so much as 5¼ per cent. for the money.  We have great difficulty in getting people to pay rent. They have not sufficient to buy themselves milk or even two meals a day. How are we to get rent from people whose incomes are not equal to it?  In such conditions there is no use in the Minister telling us we are not taking advantage of the housing drive.</P>
    <P>As one who has some knowledge of public boards in Cork and who has some experience of engineers and architects, I think the time has arrived when the Minister will have to make some arrangement as to the salaries and pensions that are to be paid to engineers and architects.  I have in mind the case of one man who is about to retire.  His part-time salary is £750 a year and he is also being paid fees for other work.  If his pension was to be calculated in accordance with the regulations of the Department, he would be getting far in excess of what his salary is from the public body by whom he is engaged.  I have been informed that we would be bound to pay that man much more in the form of a pension than he is getting from the board by whom he is employed as a part-time officer.  It is time for some <Col N="1416" /> definite arrangement in regard to the calculation of pensions in cases of that kind.</P>
    <P>I am not objecting to placing a man in a position of security at the end of his days; I do not object to a reasonable pension, but I do object to any individual dictating to the members of a board who have to listen at another time to men who try to exist on 6/- or 7/- a week in the form of home assistance. Public boards frequently have to deal with men who have eight or nine in family and who are expected to live on 14/- or 15/- a week.  Then, because there is a Departmental regulation and there are certain legal rights defined in the Department, an individual can get more by way of pension than he ever earned from the board as a part-time official.  That position should be rectified at the earliest possible moment.  I understand it can only be done by legislation.</P>
    <P>Tea cannot be got for the poor and the only substitute is milk.  I do not mind in what way the farmer is paid, but I am standing four-square behind the farmer's demand to get an economic price for his milk.  If the farmer is charging 1/- or 1/4 for the milk, I am not one bit disturbed, because I believe those engaged in farming work never got proper recognition in this country.  I say that deliberately.  The farmer and the farm labourer are the people who now count in this country, and it is strange that the people upon whom we are relying so much to save us from starvation are the only people who have had least recognition in this country.  While the only substitute for tea is milk, by subsidy or otherwise we must let the poor and their children have at least a sufficient supply.  We have a milk board operating within and outside Cork City.  Their price for milk at the moment is something like 1/4, and if they are not able to dispose of that milk amongst the citizens at that price, it is sent to the University College Dairy where it is taken at a price of something like 9d. per gallon. I believe that milk should be made available to the poor, and the difference between the 9d. paid by the <Col N="1417" /> college and the cost of distributing it to the poor of the city should be provided by subsidy.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the Minister should consider that point in the immediate future because I know&mdash;and I can prove it by figures&mdash;that there are hundreds and hundreds of children in Cork City and suburbs who do not get even half a cup of milk per day.  It is a sad thing that we should have that position when we have milk produced within a radius of eight or nine miles of the city and sold to creameries at about 7d. per gallon for manufacture into butter, on which there is a subsidy of 3d. a lb. in order to land it in the English market.  That subsidy should be given to the farmers, so as to enable them to get an economic price and to enable the poor to have sufficient milk.  I hope the Minister will consider the points I have made with regard to hospitalisation and the need for his taking a hand himself in order to see that decisions are arrived at and conveyed promptly to the local authorities who are doing the best they can for their areas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I could go back to 1729 on that matter of poverty in Dublin, but I am not making any point of it.  I know that the Government at that time did all in their power to combat poverty, and it seems to me that the document read last night by the Minister was a calm and confident document, in face of threatening times, <Col N="1418" /> a document which I think would appeal more to the general body of citizens than the statements regarding Dublin which very often appear&mdash;sometimes grotesque, sometimes misleading and sometimes outrageous.  The Minister and his Department are supposed to have their fingers on the pulse of the country, and they would not come here with a document that demands confidence if things were as bad as they are represented to be.  Deputy Hickey is a very honest and sincere man&mdash;so are all the members of the Labour Party; I would not pick out anyone more than another&mdash;but his speech was more sensible than those of some of his colleagues because the others said that they were entirely disappointed with this document, with this report, and that the Minister must know nothing at all about conditions in the country.  That was said, but I do not think that class of talk is going to do any good.  I would rather, in these days, that we gave confidence to this Department and agreed that they were doing their best and that no political points should be made against them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was, however, on another matter altogether that I decided to speak. Certain motor regulations were made in this city, some three years ago, which interfered very much with the business of people in particular streets.  I do business in a small central thoroughfare called Trinity Street, and there the police put up &ldquo;No waiting&rdquo; notices.  I must say that I did not know what these notices meant when they went up, but I was soon brought to a realisation of the fact that motor cars would not be allowed to stop in that street at all. The result was disastrous to the business of most of the merchants engaged there.  One electrical contractor, not in a very big way but still a very efficient man, told me, about a month or so after the notices went up, that his ordinary receipts for his shop were from £12 to £15 a week, but that when the &ldquo;No waiting&rdquo; business came into operation, they were reduced to 3/11 and 4/-.  The result was that in a few weeks' time he had to clear out.  He told me that he would conduct his business from his own house and try to <Col N="1419" /> live.  Other firms simply faded out, and my own business went so much that I had to make application to my landlord, who happens to be the Dublin Corporation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to inform the House and I have been only five minutes speaking.  I applied to the corporation for a revision of my rent. I said that so long as I was getting public money, I was prepared to pay the rent, but that when the public money ceased, the position would be that I should have to give up the shop, as I could not pay the rent, that the people who came to buy the goods I sell drove up in their cars to look at the books and pictures.  That would take some time but the police would not allow them to wait one minute in that street.  The result of my representations to the corporation was that there was no decision made.  The matter went before a committee and two members voted for the reduction, two against, and one did not vote at all.  A solicitor was employed to make representations to the City Manager and the Local Government Department in respect of a revaluation.  That was in January, 1940, and we got the result a few weeks ago.  Those who are rate-payers received a postcard with two or three lines in print.  One line said, &ldquo;Your rate is increased&rdquo; and the other &ldquo;Your rate is altered&rdquo; and a pen was drawn through whichever of the lines did not apply to the person receiving the card.  Most of the people in the street got an intimation that their rate was altered and that they could inspect it, within 21 days, by applying to the corporation offices. Most of those getting the postcards found that their valuation was altered <Col N="1420" /> and, on inspection, that it was reduced, generally, by a sum of £5 a year. Those who were paying £100 a year in rates found that their rates would be £95&mdash;a reduction of £5 all round.  I do not know if the Minister has any knowledge of this department.  Is it a serious department?  I know it is a long time in existence.  It has its offices in a very serious street in Dublin&mdash;Hume Street.  Are they serious in these offices?  Only in two instances were valuers sent during the whole year to interview the owners of these shops and find out something in connection with their work.  Upon what they based their valuation I do not know. I made very intimate inquiries lest I should make a mistake.  I found that only in two instances in that street did valuers call and make a personal inspection or inquire as to the business carried on.</P>
      <P>I hope the Minister will take my words here very seriously.  I have been in other streets in Dublin and the phrase used to me was that &ldquo;business is ruined&rdquo;.  That is not good enough. I make this statement knowing very well that the Minister will take the matter up and have inquiries made. There are other streets which are one-way streets.  The motorists must have a right of way one way through these streets.  That class of restriction has interfered very much with business. A professional man in Trinity Street found his business receipts so much reduced that he moved out into Dame Street and took a place with a higher valuation at a higher rent.  He could not stick it very long and he had to move back into Trinity Street. Such disturbance as that, simply for the convenience of motorists, is not good enough.  The police are the controllers of the traffic in Dublin.  They made no inquiries whatever beyond having a man counting the number of cars which moved backwards and forwards during a particular day or week or month.  As a result of their calculations, they made these regulations, which interfere so much with business.  That finishes my ten minutes and I hope the Minister will bear in mind what I have said and will see that we get a fair &ldquo;do&rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>While it is a matter for satisfaction to hear from the Minister of the improvements effected in the public health services, in the health of the people and of the reduction of mortality for notifiable and infectious disease, there is cause for very grave and serious alarm when one views the spiral of expenditure of this Department over a period of years.  Taking this Vote alone, in 1932-3, the cost was £437,091, and the Minister's Estimate for this year is £1,229,829.  When one bears in mind that the local authorities have a proportionate growth in their expenditure, amounting to about £12,000,000, one becomes very seriously alarmed at the whole financial and economic position of this country.  One is tempted to ask if this critical year is the culminating point of Fianna Fáil financial and economic policy or what attempt is being made by the Government in the various Departments to give value to the taxpayer and ratepayer for the money contributed? It appears to me that no effort has been made to keep expenditure by this Department or other Departments within reasonable bounds &mdash;within the capacity of the people. We must remember that we are a comparatively poor people in our ability to contribute large sums to public services and that we are facing a difficult situation.  Recently, we were informed by the responsible Minister that unemployment assistance was being withdrawn in the rural districts and in towns under a certain population.  The result was that large numbers of unfortunate people, who had not the wherewithal to live, were thrown back for assistance on the local authority. The Minister is well aware that local authorities, generally, had not budgeted for that considerable increase in their burden.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is the further consideration that the charge for the bulk of the money put up by a local authority is borne by one section of the community&mdash;the agricultural community&mdash; and by the people who have property. Under this system of financing local government administration, numbers of people escape what ought to be <Col N="1422" /> their just moral responsibility.  I refer to those&mdash;many of them with sub stantial salaries&mdash;who have no property and who escape local taxation. The tendency of the Government is to throw back further and greater responsibilities on those sections of the community who contribute to local taxation.  That is unfair and unjust. I have had experience of deputations at boards of health within the last few weeks making representations for home assistance because unemployment assistance was being taken from them. We find, side by side with that, the Minister's order withdrawing, as from the end of last month, relief grants on roads and pointing out by circular to local authorities that there is sufficient work on the land at present for the people affected, owing to increased tillage operations.  The Minister cannot have made an examination of the position before he arrived at that decision.  I can inform the Minister that, in some of the counties where there was mixed farming and a considerable amount of tillage at all times, the increase in employment resulting from the additional tillage operations at present does not warrant the withdrawal of relief grants.  There are many men thrown out of employment as a result of the withdrawal of this relief grant who cannot find any work at present.  I suggest to the Minister that, before he makes an order withdrawing a relief scheme of that sort, he should make himself conversant with the local position.  In my constituency, representations have been made to me by unfortunate men who have lost their employment as a result of the withdrawal of this scheme and who have no prospect of getting work anywhere, and that has resulted in a further burden being thrown on the local authorities.</P>
    <P>I think it is altogether unfair to the local taxpayer to ask him to shoulder this burden.  It is a continuation of the whole policy of making relief schemes contingent on contributions from the local authority.  The local authority, in their effort and desire to help the unemployed, have to my mind stretched themselves beyond their capacity in order to comply with the <Col N="1423" /> conditions laid down by the Minister. I do not think it is fair or just to ask for these contributions from a particular section of the community and that is what I object to most of all.  We live in a civilised state and we must maintain society.  The responsibility is on the State to maintain society in decency and to see that people will not die from starvation. Those who are in a position to make contributions must do so.  It ought to be the duty of the Minister and the Government to ensure that all sections who are in a position to contribute to taxation and to relief bear that responsibility in proportion to their income.  What I take exception to is the method adopted by the Minister of throwing back that burden on one particular section of the community, the agriculturists who constitute the bulk of the taxpayers of the country.</P>
    <P>There is a matter I have referred to previously on Estimates of this Department and that I briefly wish to refer to again, and that is the administration of the Road Fund.  The contribution to the local authorities from the Road Fund is divided into two classes. There is a maintenance grant and an improvement grant.  The maintenance grant is based on the amount spent by the local authority and the contribution is 40 per cent. of the amount spent.  Of course there is an incentive there to the local authority to spend as much as possible so that they would secure a substantial grant towards maintenance.  That 1926 road scheme was a good and useful one at that time when roads generally throughout the country were in very bad repair, but I am of opinion that to-day that scheme is obsolete and that it ought to be scrapped and a new method of administration of the Road Fund introduced. In my opinion much of that money is not spent to the best advantage.</P>
    <P>Contributions from the Road Fund are only made available for main roads and main roads only constitute about one-fifth of the total roads in the country.  We have approximately 10,000 miles of main roads and about 47,000 miles of country roads.  In the <Col N="1424" /> most progressive counties, those main roads are in very good condition, and the county which is trying to secure a substantial maintenance grant for main roads very often has to scarify and tear up roads which are in very good condition in order to secure that grant.  That is not good policy.  It is a sheer waste of public money to a great extent.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the local authority, and particularly the county surveyor, should be empowered to make recommendations to the Department as to how the money should be spent in the county.  In the majority of cases that money could be more effectively spent on county roads.  There is no reason why it should not be spent on county roads.  There is no reason why we should tie the expenditure from the Road Fund to main roads only.  This Road Fund is built up by taxes paid by motorists.  These people do not all live on main roads and motors are not always driven on main roads.  There is a lot of motor and lorry traffic over county roads.  Yet, under this 1926 scheme, the county roads cannot benefit to any extent from the Road Fund.</P>
    <P>I put that aspect of the case to the Minister before without any result.  I suggest that there should be greater latitude given to the local authority, and particularly to the county surveyor; that they should make recommendations as to where the grant should be spent and that it should not be confined mainly to main roads.  It should be within the discretion of the county surveyor to recommend how the money should be spent, and if his recommendations are approved by the Department's inspector, that is the proper way to have it administered.</P>
    <P>The other grant is the improvement grant, which also comes from the Road Fund.  I have always been of opinion that sufficient money is not spent on improvements and that possibly too much is spent on maintenance.  Again, we have had the policy in some counties of attempting to maintain roads which are in poor condition, and the maintenance cost of which is very heavy.  That type of highly cambered <Col N="1425" /> road, which shows a lot of wear and is maintained by a 40 per cent. contribution from the Road Fund, should be reconstructed.  There should be an inducement to local authorities to go in more for reconstruction work on roads by making a larger contribution to local authorities through the improvement grant and reducing the amount spent on maintenance.  To my mind, you will get a better road in the long run and it will not cost anything more.</P>
    <P>The Minister regretted that there was a considerable falling off in the number of houses built.  I suppose that is inevitable in present conditions.  The cost of construction has gone up considerably, and there is a real difficulty in securing materials.  In spite of the fact that there has been a considerable increase in the cost of construction, no attempt has been made to increase the subsidy payable to local authorities. Local authorities, in view of the present high level of local taxation, are faced with a very serious problem, and so far as they are concerned there is no inducement for them to go on with housing construction.  The Minister is going to get very little improvement in that respect until some attempt is made to give increased grants to meet the increased costs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make my position clear and to suggest to the Minister that there should be proportionate increases from the central authority to enable local authorities to meet the cost of social services that ought not to be theirs at all.  The local authorities are now obliged to meet the cost of all kinds of social work. There is the question of house building. There would be no objection if the general taxpayer, and not a particular <Col N="1426" /> section of the community, made his contribution to the cost of that.  That is not being done.  What I take a serious objection to is asking a particular section of the community to bear a burden that ought not to be theirs only, but that ought to be the responsibility of the general taxpayer.  Referring again to housing, county medical officers show a tendency to condemn houses that would be reasonably good for small families, for old-age pensioners or for a family of two, three or four.  Because some of those houses are found to be too small for big families, they are condemned.  I think that is bad policy, and that we cannot afford that sort of thing.  If a house is in a reasonably good condition it ought to be preserved and a small family put into it.</P>
      <P>I do not know whether Deputy Linehan was right in what he said about the provision of back doors in houses.  Deputies who are members of local authorities are familiar with the complaints made by the occupants of most of those new concrete houses with tiled roofs.  They complain that they are very cold.  I think that if you put two doors in that sort of a house and two windows you are almost certain to cause a draught.  I do not think many of the tenants would be very keen on having back doors at all.  I am inclined to agree with the architects and the engineers of the local authorities that in building houses without back doors they are doing the right thing.  A back door might add to the general appearance of a house, but the comfort aspect should not be overlooked either.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree that this is a very important Department.  We have had complaints made by Deputies, notably by Deputy Hickey, that local authorities find it very hard to get quick decisions from the Department, and that its whole machinery seems to be very slow and unwieldy.  The result of all that is that local authorities are delayed in their work for weeks and, sometimes, for months.  Complaints of that kind have appeared in the Press recently. The Dublin Corporation made a complaint to that effect, and I think there <Col N="1427" /> were grounds for it.  I suggest to the Minister that he should look into this, and, if possible, speed up decisions by his Department so that the work of the local authorities may be more efficient and effective.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am at one with Deputy Murphy and his complaint as regards the Department's interference in the matter of the small increase in wages that was given to the road workers in the County Cork.  The argument was put up that there had been no increase in the wages paid to agricultural labourers.  The agricultural labourer has perquisites that the ordinary road worker has not.  In nine cases out of ten he has a free house. He has vegetables provided for him, and other things that the ordinary road worker has not.  On this question of increases, I find what I can only describe as a class distinction working right through the Department of Local Government.  That is a thing that should not exist in any democratic State.  Some time ago a caretaker who had been with the Cork County Council for 31 years looked for a small gratuity or pension when going out. The county council gave it to him, but the Department of Local Government refused to sanction it.  On the other hand, if a doctor looks for an increase in salary, the Department will tell the local authority that the doctor's salary is not half large enough.  It will lay down rules and regulations for further increases.  Deputy Hickey alluded to engineers.  We have an engineer in Cork who is a part-time official.  The unfortunate caretaker was a whole-time official and got nothing.  This part-time engineer, despite the fact that he was getting a permanent and definite salary from the board of assistance was allowed by the Department to compete with other architects for fees, and got them.  That was allowed, even though, according to the terms of his appointment, he was supposed to do all the work required by the board. When the question of the hospital arose he got fees on the work done, and the same happened when repairs were carried out to the county home.</P>

      <P>By whatever you wish to call it.  I think I saw a few cases in Wexford recently that would not bear the light of day either.  Here is an official paid a definite salary for his work.  The Local Government Department comes along and gives him certain fees.  For instance, a scheme for the building of labourers' cottages comes in&mdash;I notice the Department is complaining that there are not enough houses built&mdash;and the unfortunate workman who goes into one of those cottages has to pay first of all so much to the solicitor, so much to the engineer, 2½ per cent., I think, and so much to the clerks above in the office. That is all piled on to the unfortunate labourer, in nine cases out of ten a man who is on the dole.  He has to pay all that when the cottage is finally handed over.  We had an extraordinary position down in Cork recently when there were three special meetings of the board of health called for the division of the loot.  The officials themselves could not agree on the division of the spoils with which the Local Government Department so kindly presented them.  The secretary said: &ldquo;I should get the whole of it,&rdquo; and the clerk said: &ldquo;No; I worked five hours a day as well as you, and I should get a share.&rdquo;  We even had writs served on the secretary by the clerk for a portion of the money.  We had that extraordinary position of affairs brought about by the venal action of the Local Government Department in sanctioning those moneys.  One would think that the ratepayers' money was like mud&mdash;something to be thrown away. They managed better in Wexford, I <Col N="1429" /> agree.  They succeeded in dividing the loot there without any exposure.  Now we have the extraordinary position of this engineer retiring.  Through the casting vote of the chairman of the board he got large fees, to which in the ordinary course he was not entitled, and which in my opinion the Local Government Department should not have allowed to be paid.  The Local Government Department should not have allowed those fees to be paid to an official who is working there as an engineer.</P>

      <P>That is the position, and we want it ended.  It is about time that it was ended.  Protests have been made as to the action of the Local Government Department in those matters.  On the one hand they refuse to allow 2/6 a week increase in hi wages to an unfortunate roadman who succeeds in getting, at most, about four days' work in the week, and on the other hand they pile up salaries and fees for one class of the community. The ratepayers cannot afford the condition of affairs which is being brought about.  They cannot afford it, and I may say frankly that they have no intention of affording it.  If there is no other way of stopping the ramp that is going on except by refusing to pay the rates, it will be done.  The ratepayers' pockets are not something into which you can be always dipping. An ordinary engineer down the country, appointed at £400 a year, can succeed in drawing £17,000 in fees in three years.  It is time that that kind of thing stopped.  If the Local Government Department itself is not going to stop it, some other means of stopping it must be found.  If there are any mistakes in the law in connection with the matter, let them be straightened out, but for heaven's sake let us not have this extraordinary position of affairs going on.  An individual comes along and draws £1,500 or £1,600 fees out of one hospital&mdash;a hospital that will never be built.  An order came from the Local Government Department some time ago to prepare plans for a fever hospital.  The plans were prepared by the whole-time engineer and sent up to the Department. The next thing that came down from the Department was a notification that the fever hospital was not to be built at all, but the whole-time engineer got £1,500 fees out of it.  Does the Department think that that is a fair way to spend the ratepayers' money?  Is it fair, when a member of the board of assistance comes in with a list of unfortunate people, as Deputy Hickey described them a while ago, looking for home assistance, that <Col N="1431" /> there should be cheese-paring in connection with them, while at the same time another gentleman gets &ldquo;oodles&rdquo; of loot out of the ratepayers' pockets with the collusion and assistance of the Local Government Department?</P>

      <P>The Minister is responsible. At least he says he is.  I want the Minister to put an end to it.  It is unfair and unjust.  It is unjust to the ratepayers.  It is unjust that there should be cheese-paring in the case of unfortunate people who are hungry while on the other hand when we come to let a labourer's cottage we find that the engineer has to get so much fees out of it, that the solicitor has to get so much, and that the clerks above in the office have to get so much, all piled on top of the unfortunate devil who gets the cottage.</P>
      <P>Too much class distinction is going on in the Local Government Department. There is too much government of officials, by officials, for officials.  That is what it means.  Unfortunately, there seems to be no inclination to check it. If it is not stopped in one way the people will probably decide to stop it in another and, if they do, more power to them.  I appeal to the Minister to try to stop it himself.  He has the power.  There is no reason in a gentleman coming along, after enjoying a salary of £700 a year for so many years, and telling us that his pension will be double his salary.  That extraordinary position has been brought about with the collusion of the Local Government Department.  A man who is retiring now finds that his pension will be double what he was earning when he was working; in other words, he will get double as much when he is idle as when he was in office.  It is too bad to have that type of thing in a country where many unfortunate people are hungry because they cannot find money to buy the necessaries of life.  There is a lot to be said for the fellow who declared that it would pay to have a few good gunmen to get rid of the pensioners.</P>

It is quite possible he is not a member of Deputy Corry's Party, or there would not be so much respect for him.</P>
      <P>I am not at all satisfied with the portion of this Estimate that indicates a reduction in the housing grant from £230,000 to £100,000.  I think that the amount should have been kept up to the level of last year, seeing the advantage that housing is in this country, not alone to the people who get possession of the houses, but to those who are put into employment by the erection of them.  The Minister may say that we are short of supplies.  So far as timber is concerned, we have a fair amount of native timber being planted, but I daresay the war will be long over before that is fit for use. With the co-operation of the Land Commission, under whose supervision the timber is being planted, I think the Minister should make as much provision as he possibly can out of native timber for housing purposes.  I may be told that native timber is too fresh for housing.  It is, but why would not the Department try to get in a few drying plants to dry that timber and make it fit for use?  I have seen some of the timber that is going into houses and it is regrettable to see it used in such a fashion.  It is cut down to-day, sawn up to-morrow, and put into house construction the day after.  That will mean a serious loss to the country because timber used in that way cannot be satisfactory and the house cannot be satisfactory either.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1433" /> If we had a few drying plants I believe we could get on with a fair amount of house construction.  I have criticised the housing Estimate year after year and I have done so for this reason, that I want them to bring building up to a certain standard in this country.  I must give credit to the Department that in places that I have travelled through the building has been brought up to a good standard &mdash;from what I have seen, that is the case&mdash;but it is through criticism and great supervision that it has been brought up to that standard.  I must give credit to the Department and its inspectors that they are doing their utmost.  I should like the Minister to reconsider this part of his Estimate, because a drop from £230,000 to £100,000 is far too much.  You can proceed with building because you have the main supplies in the country.  All you require is some machinery for drying in order to get the wood into a suitable condition.</P>
    <P>There are other parts of the Estimate with which I do not agree.  I think there is a good deal of unnecessary expenditure. Let me take the sanatorium that was proposed to be built in Galway.  There are some members of the Dáil who are members of the Galway Board of Health and I think they will admit that the board of health was compelled to buy a certain estate. Engineers were then appointed to draw up plans.  A few years passed by and then the members of the board of health were told that they should dispose of the estate.  It was disposed of at a great loss to the Galway ratepayers. I do not say that the board of health were responsible for it.  After losing so much money on the Reddington estate, they are now being told that they have to look for another site for a sanatorium.  It is too bad that there should be that kind of muddling, or whatever one may wish to call it.  The house was no use, unless, perhaps, it could be used in an emergency, and the land had to be sold at a loss.</P>
    <P>I will now come to the Galway Hospital. In 1921, or 1922, a sum of £30,000 was spent renovating the old workhouse hospital.  I think there <Col N="1434" /> were up to ten workhouses in County Galway at the time and all the people in them were brought into the one place.  It cost the ratepayers £30,000 to renovate one hospital and they reconstructed a small place close by. Money has been made available from the Hospitals Sweepstakes for the building of a new county hospital in Galway.  I do not think the Minister will contradict me when I state that there were seven or eight plans and specifications drawn up for the erection of that hospital.  I am sorry Deputy Beegan or Deputy Killilea is not here. Both Deputies could tell us the amount paid in engineers' fees and the amount already due to the architect in fees, all in connection with the erection of a hospital for which the plans have not yet been sanctioned.</P>
    <P>The architects and engineers at the head of a Department should get into consultation with the architect employed on the proposed new building to draw up the plans and specifications. No doubt he is a man of great repute. He spends months of hard work there, the plans and specifications are sent to the Department and then some little tuppence ha'penny engineer comes along and says: &ldquo;No, we will not have them.&rdquo;  The men drawing up these plans and specifications are men with much better qualifications than some of the men who condemn them.  That has been going on for years and all the patients of County Galway are in that central hospital.  Not alone are they lying on poor beds, but they are lying on the floors of the corridors, and that is a scandalous state of affairs when the money is available.</P>
    <P>The Minister was asked to meet a deputation composed of people, Church and lay, who were interested in the erection of this hospital, who knew the conditions in the hospital and who were anxious to do everything to help the Minister in every way and the Minister's reply was that meeting such a deputation was no use.  That is the kind of thing that people cannot stand.  The people of the county who pay their rates well, a county in which the home assistance <Col N="1435" /> is the lowest in Éire, are prepared to pay their portion.</P>
    <P>Thousands of pounds of the ratepayers' money have already been expended in the drawing up of plans by an architect of repute, which do not meet the demands of the Department, but what the Department should do is to send the plans down and let the job be carried out, and not to be wasting money and holding up things as they have done for the last four years.  I hope the Minister will consider the few points I have raised in respect of drying plants for native timber and I urge him to co-operate in those cases in which the Land Commission are selling mansions to people who want to make money.  These mansions have good roofing, the finest of slates, which could be used on houses again, and the Minister should co-operate with the Land Commission in regard to them, instead of allowing every Tom, Dick and Harry who can do so to put down £300 or £400 for these places and to sell all the timber and roofing at a huge profit.  I hope he will also consider the matter of the sanatorium in the Reddington estate and the new county hospital.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGovern" hpid="Mr. McGovern Mr. McGovern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGovern</NameTxt>
      <P>I sympathise with the point raised by Deputy Bennett, that ratepayers should be considered in the matter of the collection of rates, but I think a much more important point is that the burden of rates has been growing from year to year, due to a great extent to the policy of the Department.  I could not hold the Department responsible, if local bodies were responsible for this increased burden, but unfortunately that is not so. The Department is egging them on by every means in their power to increase the burden on a section which is already overburdened and unable to meet its liabilities.  Not only have the farmers to provide food for the country&mdash;and they appreciate the necessities of the situation and are prepared to do it, although they are not getting the cost of production&mdash; but they have to bear a burden of rates which they are not able to bear. Instead of the Minister trying to <Col N="1436" /> relieve them of this ever-increasing burden so far as possible, he is doing everything in his power to increase it by inducing them to take over the financing of unemployment and the provision of work, out of the rates, to a certain extent, for all the unemployed in the various counties.</P>
      <P>The method adopted by the Minister in order to egg them on to spend more money is to give certain grants on condition that the local bodies pay a certain percentage.  In order to secure the grants, the county councils think it wise to expend money, although they know that the ratepayers are unable to meet the burden.  The ratepayers in rural districts are principally farmers, and these rates are assessed in a most inequitable manner.  It is not that taxation is collected on the basis of income, but these people are assessed without any regard to their means.  For that reason, they should be considered, and the burden of rates should not be increased.  The Minister should co-operate with those local bodies who are inclined to reduce rates in order to enable them to reduce the burden. We have in the country at present the Guild of Goodwill and Muintir na Tire, two bodies which are out to do something to relieve unemployment and to improve the position of the poor, and I think the very least that could be expected is that the Government should co-operate with them.  Instead, the Government is throwing obstacles in the way of these bodies whose activities are bound to fail unless the inducements held out to the people to leave the land, to fly into the cities and to create an unemployment problem are withdrawn.  Unless that is done, it is inevitable that the unemployment problem must increase, and, no matter what organisations, the Guild of Goodwill or others, you have, they will not be able to improve the position.</P>

      <P>That the Dáil is of opinion that the censorship is being used at present unduly to restrict legitimate free speech and prevent the natural expression of public opinion in this country and that effective measures should be taken forthwith to ensure an administration of censorship powers which will command the confidence of our people.</P>
      <P>A man who, I think, is perhaps one of the greatest statesmen in the world to-day and who looks at the world through no materialistic eye, but sees in the society of men an organisation ordained under the law of God, laid down that one of the objectives for which he thought a man's life might well be given was the right to think, speak and act freely within the law, and to have free access to the thoughts of others.  I adopt those words.  I regard that as one of the most sacred rights that generations of our people fought to win from foreign oppressors who denied it to us for seven centuries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I well remember the depth of feeling in this House on the day when we consented to the unprecedented powers that this Government asked for on the representation that they must have them effectively to defend this State. We gave them to them because we felt they were best able to judge what powers they must have and that we, in our capacity as the Opposition, were bound, in that hour of emergency, to accept their word.  But we surrendered into their hands that sacred right to hold as trustees for us and for other <Col N="1438" /> freemen in this State.  A trustee is a person into whose care one confides one's treasure in the confidence that he will be more careful of one's interest in these valuables than one would be oneself and that he will permit no diminution of their value that can possibly be avoided.  A pawnbroker takes your valuables on pledge, taking no more than ordinary care of them, feeling that the longer he holds them the more his absolute right to them grows, and knowing that, ultimately, you may lose your title to your treasure and he will be free to dispose of it at his own discretion and his own sweet will.  We gave these rights in trust to hold for our people and my indictment of the Government is that they took them as pawnbrokers and that, with the passage of weeks and months, they seem to imagine that the longer they hold these rights for the people the less claim the people have to them and the more absolute becomes the discretion of the Executive of this State to withhold a greater and greater portion of freedom, whereas my interpretation of the trust was that, from day to day and hour to hour, the Government would be more vigilant than we to see that the upper limit of liberty was allowed to function and that, knowing themselves to have the power to extinguish it, they would lean back and take risks in order perennially to reassure our people that the larger liberties were safe and would come back intact and in order continually to remind our people that the restricted liberties to which we consented were an imperfection in the State which democrats and men who love liberty would never tolerate but for the purpose of averting the greater evil.</P>
    <P>Before I go into the specific merits of the case I want to make, there are one or two things I desire to make quite clear.  I am not concerned to-day to argue that one side of the case or the other should be given the better hearing.  Most Deputies in the House know where I stand on the great issues that confront this country and I would have them know it.  But that is not in issue now.  The matter we are concerned with this evening is the right <Col N="1439" /> of every man to think, speak and act freely within the law, and have free access to the thoughts of others. The second thing I want to make clear is that, in the criticism I have got to make of the Executive, I have no desire to suggest that they are pro-German or pro-British or pro anything else.  I do not believe that the Executive of this State is pro-German.</P>
    <P>The case I am making to the Ministers responsible for the administration of these powers is&mdash;and I have got to be plain and blunt in making it&mdash;that the permanent official responsible for that administration is not a fit person to occupy that position and that the Minister who has answered to this House for the exercise of these powers has allowed himself to drift into a position in which he regards himself as Czar, a master of the people, instead of their servant and the protector of their treasure.  We are a Catholic and a Christian people. Ninety-nine per cent. of our people are Christian and the Leader of Christianity in the world to-day and the Head of the Catholic Church is His Holiness the Pope.  Let me here interpolate that I want to make no cheap suggestion that any member of the Executive has a lesser veneration for the Holy Father or the Vatican than I. No such suggestion is implied, nor could it for a moment be sustained. But, in my submission to this House, when great events are moving in the world and the Vatican breaks silence to comment upon them, it is the right of our people to hear that voice.  I say that a censorship which felt itself entitled to withhold from our people messages addressed by the Vatican to the faithful of the whole world showed itself to have lost all sense of proportion and entirely to have misinterpreted the scope of the discretion conferred upon it by an Act of this House.</P>
    <P>About six weeks ago, the <i>Osservatore Romano</i> published an article in which it said that the Vatican could no longer remain silent, that it was satisfied that tendentious rumour was being spread about and so assiduously and skilfully spread that it might reasonably be expected to deceive persons of <Col N="1440" /> good will, and that it desired to say categorically that these rumours were false and untrue.  All that was published in Éire.</P>
    <P>But the <i>Osservatore Romano</i>, in the article, went on to say that it was necessary to describe what these rumours were.  It set out under five heads the rumours suggesting, to put it quite bluntly, that the Pope was behind Hitler and Mussolini and expected all Catholics to be the same. The five rumours were different variants of that theme.  It said: &ldquo;Those five rumours are false, and we want anybody who attaches importance to what we say to know that these five specific rumours are false.&rdquo;  These five specific rumours were struck out by the censor in this country, and our people were denied the right to hear the Vatican's voice in contradiction of specious propaganda designed to confuse the Catholic mind on vital moral issues that confront the world.  We were told that the reason these five rumours were struck out and publication prohibited in this country was that the rumours which the Vatican desired to countervail had never been printed here.</P>
    <P>Who ever printed a rumour?  What man has made more passionate protests in this House than our Taoiseach about the deadly injury done to him by rumour?  What man has complained more bitterly that nowhere could he find the thing in print so that he could produce it and contradict it, but that he could hear it carried on the breeze? I remember his standing there describing how all his life, again and again, he had felt himself aggrieved by rumours.  I remember his saying here that the only way he could meet them was to set these rumours out, put them in print, and then contradict them, if their authors were afraid to do as much, and meet them in a concrete form.</P>
    <P>But, when the Vatican newspaper, perhaps the most conservative organ in Europe, says: &ldquo;This scandal of rumour has reached such magnitude that we must print these foul rumours and then contradict them; we must first give concrete publicity to these rumours, something their authors are <Col N="1441" /> afraid to do, and then give a concrete contradiction,&rdquo; we give the contradiction, but disassociate that contradiction in the minds of our own people from the rumours which it was designed to quell.</P>
    <P>I can imagine an error of judgment. Who will deny that the equitable administration of the censorship is a most difficult task?  Who in this House would willingly accept the burden?  It is a difficult task.  What trustee ever accepted responsibility for such a trust who did not know he was shouldering an intolerable burden?  I would forgive gladly and readily an error of judgment.  But this was no error of judgment, because, finding that the written word had not caught up with the whisper, the Vatican turned to its second weapon, and on the Vatican radio ten days ago proclaimed to the world that these rumours were still abroad and that it would now, not only contradict them, but would add a painting of the true picture of the internal state of the country which the Vatican was supposed to want us all to love and serve.</P>
    <P>The announcer declared that the religious situation in Germany is highly unsatisfactory and condemned the Nazi attitude to the Church.  The threat of a State religion, he said, hangs over all religious life in these territories. The State religion is based solely on on the Fuhrer's will and is the only one which he wants in the State.  In the countries which have been incorporated into the Reich a State Church has been formed&mdash;in Alsace, Austria and Sudeten Germany.  These tendencies have been enforced in the extreme and these countries are to be made a model for the spiritual structure of the rest. The announcer spoke of the difficulties and obstacles placed in the way of priests and members of religious communities attempting to fulfil their duties.  He stated that lecturers, teachers and propagandists inculcated pagan principles and that German youth were deprived of proper religious instruction.  Even in schools where the priest is, in theory, admitted, he often finds the door closed upon him. The priest, he went on, is treated with disrespect.  He is considered to be outside <Col N="1442" /> the life of the State.  He is methodically ignored and his prestige is lessened every day.  Officials are subject to disciplinary measures if they fulfil their religious duties.  All that remains of the one-time great Catholic Press of Germany are a few parish magazines and even these have to be edited with the greatest care in order to avoid being accused of interfering in political matters.  Since 1933, Rosenberg, the Nazi Party's philosopher, has been given charge of the spiritual life of the Nationalist Socialist Party, and in 1937 it was declared that his writings are to be the gospel of the &ldquo;myth&rdquo; that Germany must have for her own race, Catholicism being dismissed as a myth only suitable for the Mediterranean.</P>
    <P>Every line of that was censored. The censorship was asked if they would permit publication of what I have just read in the Press of Ireland and they said, &ldquo;Not a line, not a word.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I want here to reiterate that I am not suggesting that The Taoiseach or his colleagues are in a dark conspiracy to blacken the name of the Catholic Church or to co-operate in derogation from the devotion we pay it.  I am pointing out to the House how the power of censorship has been allowed to demoralise its administrators, and I believe that they have lost sight of the lengths to which they have allowed themselves to go.  I take this opportunity of putting it before them in all the horror that it presents to an outside observer so that they may come to understand why we are asking for some new dispensation that will preserve the censorship in a form that is tolerable to honourable people.  I interpolate that again, because I am going to indicate to the House something which I think casts a shocking light on the censorship administration. I have shown how the Vatican pronouncements were ruthlessly suppressed. But this was permitted to be published in an Irish newspaper:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Able-bodied men are no longer able to enter monasteries in Germany or to become monks.  This prohibition is contained in a decree, valid throughout the whole of the Reich,</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1443" /> issued jointly by the Reich Minister of Labour, the Reich Church Minister and the Führer's deputy.  The decree aims at assuring the nation's requisite labour supply, and states that it is undesirable that any person able to work should enter religious seclusion, or become a member of an ecclesiastical order involving his withdrawal from productive labour.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Here is a Nazi version of a decree which forbids any young man to enter a religious Order.  The Nazi decree meant let the old monks die so long as we have the young prevented from getting into their clutches.  We can see the old fellows drop off so long as there are no young men to take their places.  An Irish newspaper may print the Nazi version, that this is done to preserve the labour supply in an urgent time.  Listen to this, a message which was elaborated a week later.  It was thought perhaps that the first one did not carry sufficient conviction to the innocents, so Goebbels returned to the charge the following week.  The following propaganda paragraph appeared in an Irish paper:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The German radio states that it is the religious Orders themselves which have no interest in accepting people whose only reason for entering is to escape their civic duties and, apart from this, there is nothing to prevent any German who is really in earnest from entering religious Orders, the message adds.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That Nazi propaganda is taken from the German radio and copied into Irish papers, but the Pope's pronouncement on the same thing is censored and is cut out as being unfit for publication in neutral Ireland.  Deputies may wonder that I ask for an administration of the censorship powers which will command the confidence of our people.  This is no occasion to tear a passion to tatters.  I plead guilty sometimes, when feeling deeply as I do about this matter, to speaking perhaps a little strongly.  I deliberately desire to avoid that to-day.  I believe that when we are confronted here with evil, it is in the common interest of us all to abate it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1444" /> I am now going to read for the House words taken from the pastoral of an Irish Bishop that were struck out by the censor.  I want to ask Deputies of this House quite objectively, do they think that the censor who struck these words from the Bishop's pastoral acted within the scope of the authority that they intended to confer upon him?  These are the words:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We know what the Poles are suffering and we know how the Dictator has treated the Church in Germany.  Can we look with indifference on God dethroned from His rightful place in the universe? Can Catholics view with easy minds the possibility of a victory which would give brute force the power to control Europe and decide the fate of small nations?</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Thoughtless persons give no heed to these prospects, yet they may become very real.  Such an attitude of indifference to the religious outlook of the future is treason to our faith.  This mentality is caused by the persuasion that anything that injures a hereditary enemy is good for us.  Even if true, political expediency should not weigh in the balance against Christianity.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now, you may agree with that or you may differ with it.  You may think it right or wrong, but do you think it right that it should be suppressed as unfit for the eyes of Irishmen to see? Do you think that the Government, the trustee of our liberties, should so far submit to belligerent blackmail as to suppress that in order to please a diplomat accredited to our Government? I do not.  My experience in the world has taught me that, if the blackmailer makes extravagant demands upon you, the sooner you call his bluff and tell him that you will pay no more, the less trouble you will ultimately have with him; but yield to his first assault, surrender what you think you should not have surrendered for peace sake once, and his demands become greater and greater as you fall back along the path of slavery.</P>
    <P>Our people may have feared, as all true men should fear, the consequences <Col N="1445" /> of standing for our rights to-day.  Our people may be prepared to waive punctilio rather than face the horror of war, but I do not believe our people are prepared to allow any statesman in Europe to silence the Pope or their Bishops because what they say displeases the statesmen of Europe.  If we encourage the statesmen in Europe to believe that now, a day may come when our people will vindicate their right to hear those voices with their blood, whereas if it is made quite clear to them that if they attempt to rob them of that right they could not, a bloody sacrifice might never be called for.  I have spoken of the suppression of that pastoral and of those Vatican pronouncements on the grounds that they might give possible offence to certain diplomats.  But this vigilant censor so anxious about the susceptibilities of the equally vigilant diplomat allows a newspaper in this country to quote the Spanish paper <i>Ya</i>, and to describe it as a Catholic newspaper. This paper states: &ldquo;that the German Government has taken care that the religious life there should receive as strong an impulse as possible; that there is no intention of influencing Catholic life in the general government in any way, and instead Germany's high respect for religion is indicated.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>One version of what is happening in Germany is given publicity, the version sponsored by Goebbels and promulgated by a silenced priest called Krawczyk.  He was stripped of his holy ordination by the bishop who ordained him.  That filth is presented to our people, but the voice of the Vatican correcting it is silenced, and our people are assured that they are getting a detached and an objective report of all that passes in Europe.  While Krawczyk, the silenced priest, can spread his propaganda, the Pope's attempt to contradict it is censored from the news. Have people noticed recently that, while the censor was vigilant to see that no one would suggest that Nazi Germany was persecuting anybody, and that Krawczyk might be quoted to show that nothing was further from their mind, in the same paper where Krawczyk pays testimony to Hitler's magnanimity, splash headings declared <Col N="1446" /> that England was in a conspiracy to persecute the Catholics of the North. If we are so solicitous about the feelings of the Reich, has the British Government got no feelings at all?</P>
    <P>If, in order to appease the Reich, the Pope must be silenced and the Bishops censored, may the British Government ask that an exuberant leader-writer should be restrained, or is it that we are prepared to give to those we fear that which we withhold from those we know will not act the bully in our regard?  God forbid that that should ever be said of our people.  Arrogant we might be, sometimes unjust, but perish the thought that we would ever crawl before a bully and insult those who we believe would treat us with equity and justice.  Before I pass from the subject of that persecution in Poland, I want to ask this question.  If a book published by Burns, Oates and Washbourne, called &ldquo;The Persecution of the Catholic Church in Poland&rdquo;, is to be banned from our mails by the censor, and forbidden to the Post Office to carry, why is the Post Office made the daily agent of the Radio Stefani and the Italian Embassy in this city to distribute Italian propaganda every day?  Deputies in this House know that they receive morning after morning the tendentious propaganda of the Italian Government, carried by the postman to their door.</P>
    <P>In a newspaper of December 6th there appears a letter from a correspondent, signed G. O'Doherty of Tyrone, commending the new order, pointing out that Germany and Italy and Hungary are hoping to create a new order in which Ireland can play her part, and another letter, signed &ldquo;Scotus&rdquo;, appears in a newspaper dated November 1st, drawing attention to the fact that:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Ministers of Italy and Germany are known throughout Ireland for the sympathy and understanding with which they regard this nation's reaction against the Versailles conception of a European political and economic order, while for their part the Irish people realise that it was in Italy that the movement <Col N="1447" /> for the reconstruction of Europe began, a movement in which war was never contemplated as an essential factor, as may be remembered by those who read the pronouncements of the Italian and German Ambassadors in London in May, 1939.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If those letters are published, why is it that, when another citizen of this State writes to the same paper and puts his point of view, the editor says: &ldquo;I will gladly print your letter if the censor will let me,&rdquo; but writes on 12th December: &ldquo;Further to my letter of the 6th, I regret to say that, as I feared, your letter was stopped by the censor&rdquo;?  Does the Taoiseach quarrel with me for holding that there is good ground here for asking that an administration of censorship powers should be established which would command the confidence of our people?  I ask this House: when we gave the Government power to exercise those Draconian laws, did we anticipate that they would rule for all time, that they would suppress anything and everything which criticised the censorship either directly or indirectly?  If we heard that the Gestapo in Germany publicly proclaimed to the world that anything which commented adversely, directly or by implication, on the Gestapo, would be prohibited in Germany, would we not say: &ldquo;There, from its own mouth, it stands convicted as a beastly instrument of tyranny&rdquo;?  Change the word &ldquo;Gestapo&rdquo; to &ldquo;Irish censor&rdquo; and that is the law in Ireland.  Here on the floor of this House is the only place where you can speak words that will be reduced to print critical of the censor or designed to direct the attention of our people to the encroachments which that officer is making on their liberty.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach and the censor will say: &ldquo;But you can say anything you like Who is stopping you from speaking? Provided you speak within the law you are as free as the birds of the air.&rdquo;  What man can speak to 3,000,000 people?  Were he able to gather them into one place, what human voice will reach them?  What is more maddening than the attempt to persuade you that you have got your <Col N="1448" /> liberty, the specious suggestion that there has been nothing taken away, when in fact you know you have been left with the shell, but that the substance has gone, and that your power to awaken the people to the dangers that lie ahead and to the diminution of their freedom is made doubly and trebly grave by the hypocritical shell that the censor has left you, the right to speak with the assurance that you will not be heard?</P>
    <P>Since when has the safety of this State demanded that the Taoiseach should not be criticised?  Can Deputies of this House believe that a newspaper in this State, not one month ago, was told that it must not say: &ldquo;The Taoiseach was criticised&rdquo;?  It was told: &ldquo;You may say `there was a reference to the Taoiseach' but you must strike out the word `criticised'.&rdquo;  The Taoiseach went on the air on St. Patrick's Day to tell the world that we were blockaded by both sides, and that we had no desire to be involved in an imperial adventure.  I do not want to misquote him in any way, and, if I have, I would be glad that he would correct me.  Tactfully enough&mdash;I speak ironically&mdash;the persons to whom he addressed that message were the American people, who were just girding up their loins to get into what he described as an imperial adventure.  Now, I know the American people very well, and I love and honour the American people, as most people in this country who remember the deep obligation under which Ireland lies to America must love and honour them.  Like every other nation, she has her imperfections and her self-deceptions, but her worst enemies will never charge her with being a nation with imperialist ambitions, desirous of building up greatness on the ruins of the weak.  If we would hold the sympathy that has so often sustained us in the past, I cannot commend the tact of a national leader in this country who would tell America: &ldquo;We want to stay neutral, for we want to be involved in no imperial adventure&rdquo; in the very hour when the American people, almost unanimously, resolved to throw their weight into the struggle on the side where they believed right and justice lay.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1449" /> I do not think it is very tactful, if you depend for all you have got in the way of raw materials and imports on the ships and convoy of a neighbour country, to tell that country that it is blockading you in the same way that Germany&mdash;who has warned us that she has mined our waters and will blockade us with her warships whether we like it or not&mdash;is blockading us.  If the Taoiseach cannot see any difference between the attitudes of those two countries, most reasonable men can, and, surely to God, in this country it will not imperil the life of the nation if one of those reasonable men ventures to criticise, not the Taoiseach himself, but his broadcast?  But the censor in this State says &ldquo;No, you may refer to his broadcast, but you must not criticise it.&rdquo;  Is there any figure in history, since Nero sat upon the throne of Rome, who was immune from criticism?  I can think of none. I think Hitler and Mussolini and Stalin boast that they want their friends to criticise them, to tell them their faults; that they want to improve with every day.  Nero and Caligula could not be criticised because they were gods.  Our Prime Minister may sometimes think himself a prince, I know, but to date I have never charged him with the delusion of thinking he was a god.</P>
    <P>Is it desirable in this country to use the censorship to suppress discussion, legitimate discussion about domestic affairs?  Here is a man who writes a letter to the paper saying that when nobody can get petrol he does not see why Ministers and their wives should be flying around in their motor cars, getting all the petrol they want.  I think that is &ldquo;codology.&rdquo;  I think the Ministers must use their cars, and they would be damned fools if they sent the Prime Minister home on his bicycle.  I am prepared to join issue with any obscurantist, any pot-walloper, down the country, who-wants to suggest that Ministers should be harried and insulted because they use their cars to get about on the State's most important business.  But, in heaven's name, why should the censor prohibit the pot-walloper who believes that Ministers should travel on bicycles from <Col N="1450" /> saying so?  Surely that does not imperil the State.</P>
    <P>I have in my hands a letter in which a man says that he thinks the Government ought to give 50/- for wheat, and that they should guarantee a price for cereal oats.  It was stopped by the censor.  There is the letter, and there is the censor's endorsement, &ldquo;Stopped by Censor.&rdquo;  It is a trivial thing, almost pertaining to absurdity; but such things are portents, and those who are wise will recognise them before they acquire a gravity out of all proportion to their essence.  They are trivial nothings now, but if they are the first milestones on the road that lead to slavery, they will become famous in the history books of this country, and it is our duty to recognise them now while there is time to stop that march, and, scorning them for the trivialities of their essence, bless them for the warning they gave us while there was still time to act and tell the censor that &ldquo;they may not do that here,&rdquo; that the humblest man with the silliest idea may communicate by free speech, that he has the right to think and speak and act freely within the law, and that his neighbours shall have free access to his thoughts.</P>
    <P>I speak of a matter now which may not command the sympathy of the House, but in which I think, as an humble citizen, that my predilection is entitled to consideration.  Why should a little Irish girl from Ballaghaderreen, who bears herself bravely and reflects the utmost credit on herself and her family during the blitz in London, Manchester or Glasgow, be banned from the columns of an Irish newspaper? If any boy or girl from this country bears himself or herself bravely and wins encomiums of praise from those who see them in the midst of desolation, and if that fact is reported from any part of Great Britain to an Irish newspaper, it is immediately stamped, &ldquo;Banned by the Censor.&rdquo; I will not read them all; they are all simply, you may say, trivial little stories of individual acts of heroism that reflect honour on this country and credit on those who were responsible for them.  They may be published from Southampton to Singapore, but in the <Col N="1451" /> Twenty-Six Counties of Eire they are obscene.</P>
    <P>A young Irishman went out to take his part in what he felt was a fight for great principles, the sort of fight so gloriously described in the immortal lines of the late Tom Kettle which I was recently privileged to quote, and he died.  He died for that cause.  Let me read the story of how his death was recorded in Ireland, his own country.  This is the paragraph as it was printed by those who knew nothing of him except that he came from Ireland and he died doing his duty:&mdash;</P>
    <P>The funeral took place, with naval honours, from Belfast City Mortuary to the City Cemetery, of Commander F. Halloran, R.N., who lost his life attempting to rescue a sailor from drowning.  Deceased was a former Irish rugby international.  Included in the cortege were 60 officers and men from the late Commander's ship.  The Irish Rugby Union were represented.</P>
    <P>All that was desired was to record that he went down to his grave with all the honours that his comrades could offer, and here is what the Irish censor said: &ldquo;You must strike out the words `with naval honours'; you must strike out the word `commander'; you must strike out the letters `R.N.'; you must strike out the words `in his cortege 60 of his comrades walked', and you must print the paragraph thus: `The funeral took place from Belfast City Mortuary to the City Cemetery of F. Halloran.  He rescued a sailor from drowning.  Deceased was a former Irish rugby international. The Irish Rugby Union were represented !&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If he had been a crossing sweeper who had drawn his £2 weekly wage cleaning the streets of Belfast, his passing could have been no more ignominiously described.  Why, at the instance of the German Embassy, should we conspire to insult our dead? Why should Commander Halloran's name be hidden when his death redounds for ever to the glory of our country?  Why should the fact that he was ours be represented to the world as something we are ashamed to <Col N="1452" /> claim?  We are not ashamed to claim it and the censor who thinks we are is mad.  And that is true from the most irreconcilable supporter of the Taoiseach to the most conservative survivor of reaction in this country. Why, when the army of the Nile&mdash;not our Army, but the British army&mdash;and the British fleet&mdash;not our fleet&mdash;swept to victory under the leadership of seven men, five of whom were Irish, was it necessary to print in this country that, of the seven commanders, two came from England and five from Japan&mdash;Cunningham, O'Moore Creagh, Wilson, O'Connor and Somerville&mdash;all from Japan&mdash;North and South Island? Did Dáil Eireann mean censorship powers to be used that way?</P>
    <P>But there is a ray of credit here. When the Minister for the Co-Ordination of Defensive Measures was taxed with this, he denied it.  Speaking in the Seanad, Senator Keane said &ldquo;The Press is required to revise the announcements of deaths of Irishmen, no matter where they die, and it is an unreasonable power of censorship.&rdquo; Mr. Aiken replied: &ldquo;It was not done.&rdquo; Let Deputies listen to this because it is perhaps as dramatic a thing as has happened.  The report of that was sent to the censor's office, with a footnote from the newspaper which had printed it stating:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Mr. Aiken's denial that the announcement of the deaths of Irishmen abroad have been prohibited by the censor is contrary to the facts. We have on our own files records of such prohibitions.  On last Monday &mdash;48 hours before Mr. Aiken made his speech&mdash;the announcement of the death abroad of a well-known Dublin doctor was prohibited by Mr. Aiken's censor.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Mr. Aiken's denial was passed by the censor but the newspaper's demonstration that his denial was false was suppressed by the censor, and the newspaper was compelled to print Mr. Aiken's defence, without the proof of his guilt, or to print nothing at all. Is that the way we expected the censorship to be used?</P>
    <P>The censor in this country is a resourceful man.  He is not only prepared <Col N="1453" /> to suppress the news, but he is prepared to re-write the news.  The censor says here: &ldquo;If you get messages from the Associated Press, which is an American agency, from Berlin or Paris, and the American correspondent says `To-day such and such an event has taken place in Berlin,' you must not publish that.  You must say `To-day, it is reported that such and such an event has taken place in Berlin'.  You must create that little spark of doubt in our people as to the veracity of the report of this incident, because it may not be true, but you must not leave it to the people to determine whether it is true.  You must tell the people, by implication, the way Taoiseach de Valera thinks they ought to think about that piece of news.  Now I know the Taoiseach is a didactic man. He was ever thus, but surely he will content himself with lecturing us without lecturing the whole Irish people.</P>
    <P>That is not the limit of the censor's versatility.  There are a few experienced leader-writers in this country, and no newspaper proprietor or editor&mdash;I ask the House to note this well&mdash;has the right to pervert the facts.  He has as solemn a duty as could rest upon any citizen to print the news as he gets it, and as he believes it to be true, but, when it comes to his leading article, he has the right that any of us has to cast up the news, to put his interpretation upon it, and to say to his readers: &ldquo;That is the way the news strikes me&rdquo;.  But the censor does not think so.  The censor takes the leading article and says: &ldquo;You must not say: `Since the adhesion of Yugoslavia to the Tripartite Pact was first mooted, it has been manifest that the Army and people were in large numbers opposed to the proposal'.  You must say: `It is reported that the people were opposed to it', so that those of our friends who desire to say it was the nasty British who put out this ugly rumour in order to help the <i>putsch</i> in Yugoslavia can say: `Oh, but the paper does not say it was manifest that so-and-so; it says it was reported it was so, and do we not all know where such reports come from?' &rdquo;</P>
    <P>When the editor wanted to say in the leading article: &ldquo;All these events <Col N="1454" /> amount to a reverse for Germany in the diplomatic arena, and may cause her to revise whatever military plans she had,&rdquo; the censor says: &ldquo;No, you must not say that Germany has had a diplomatic reverse.  That might vex the Embassy.  Cut that line out.&rdquo; When the editor wanted to say: &ldquo;Although no official declaration on the point has been issued at Belgrade, the action taken by the King and Government is actually a repudiation of the Pact,&rdquo; the censor says: &ldquo;No, you must not say that.  You must not give that as your opinion.  You must substitute my opinion that the action of the King may be a repudiation of the Pact.&rdquo;  The newspaper wants to go on and say: &ldquo;It is abundantly clear that the people are now resolved to support the new regime,&rdquo; but the censor says: &ldquo;No, you must not say nasty things like that, or the Embassy will be vexed.  You must say that the Yugoslav people are resolved to resist aggression and, then, if the Minister comes to complain, we can say to him: `You are not going to aggress them, are you?', and we have him hoist with his own petard.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is childish in one way, but it is bad enough to censor the facts; it is bad enough to tell us what we may say and what we may write, but, my God, are you going to tell us what we may think?  That is what your censor is claiming to do.  There is no body in this State, from the meanest local authority up to the President, who has the right to tell me what I will think, and there is nobody, however high, however sacrosanct, in this country that has the right under God's law to tell me what to think, and any law or any claim to impose that upon the humblest citizen of this State is overridden by a higher law, which there is no power in the hands of man to amend, and the censor who challenges that law will fall by that law, for the Irish people will never abandon that law or surrender their rights under it.</P>
    <P>Let us take the position of Deputies who stand upon the razor-edge of neutrality.  Let us assume that we are all agreed that there is to be strict neutrality&mdash;and God knows we are not, but let us assume we are&mdash;and let us <Col N="1455" /> ask ourselves this question: Is it fair to print the German claim that they have shot down hundreds of British aeroplanes and have the Royal Air Force on the run and to censor the British reply, and when they are asked: &ldquo;If you allowed the German <i>communiqué</i> to be published between 13th July and 26th July, claiming mighty victories in the air, why did you refuse us the right to publish the British <i>communiqué</i>, taking those claims one by one and making their comment upon them?&rdquo; the answer of the censor is:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I am directed by the Minister for the Co-Ordination of Defensive Measures to refer to your letter with reference to the suppression of a statement which purported to have been issued by the Air Ministry News Service on July 26th&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>that is Civil Service-ese for &ldquo;the British side of the story&rdquo;.&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;&mdash;&mdash;and to state that, while it has been and will continue to be the censorship policy of the Government to allow publicity for official statements issued by or on behalf of any of the States which are belligerents in the present war, the censorship reserves and may from time to time exercise the right to prohibit the publication of any particular statement if it thinks fit.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Do Deputies think it was fitting to publish the Nazi side of the story and to censor the British version of the same facts?  I do not believe that a single Deputy who gave these powers to the Government ever meant that they would be used in that way.  Is it treason in this country to pull Frank Aiken's leg&mdash;or, perhaps, I should say the Minister for the Co-Ordination of Defensive Measures' leg?  The Minister for Co-Ordination got up in this House and made a silly speech, in which he said he sometimes wished that all the ships in the world were sunk to the bottom of the sea and that, if they were, we might have to adjust ourselves to the new situation and we would be much better off.</P>

      <P>Words to that effect.  He went to Drogheda and, whatever he said here, he sang a different song in Drogheda.  The tears were streaming down his face in grief and sympathy with the disemployed operatives of Drogheda whose factories could not get supplies of raw material.  He said: &ldquo;I have come to you to-day to tell you we are going to do something about it; we are going to get ships and raw materials in for you; we are going to get a mercantile marine which will carry the goods you want over the seas to Ireland.&rdquo;  At that, there were loud and ecstatic cheers from the audience at Drogheda, who had not read the speech made three days previously by the Minister in the Dáil.  Senator Milroy sharpened his pencil.  He wrote a letter in which he said that he thought that when Mr. Aiken got his job as Minister for Co-Ordination of Defensive Measures, £1,700 was wasted, but if that Minister would now devote his energies to co-ordinating the Minister for Co-Ordination of Defensive Measures with Frank Aiken, then he thought the money would be well spent, because they would find out whether he means what he says in Dáil Eireann or what he says in Drogheda.  It was a good-humoured letter.  It was not an epoch-making letter, but it was a perfectly valid piece of political jocularity which brought home to the people the irresponsibility of the Minister in the public affairs of the country.  That letter was suppressed.  It &ldquo;imperilled the neutrality of Ireland, or tended to undermine the safety of the State.&rdquo; Did the most acrimonious partisan of the Fianna Fáil Party ever intend that the censorship should be used for that? This is a grave matter, but it is my duty to bring before the House the absurdities as well as the bigger issues because, taken all together, they indicate a trend, and I am not without hope that, taken all together and laid before the Government en masse, they may open the Government's own eyes to the trend, and that, by approaching them in this spirit, we may get their co-operation to check this trend and to set right what is wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On his way to open a War Weapons week in Shropshire, George Robey, the comedian, was given an <Col N="1457" /> onion, which he promptly auctioned for fifteen guineas.  Can you imagine any more harmless news item than that? I should say that nobody in this country cared two hoots whether George Robey got an onion or whether he auctioned it.  Would you believe it&mdash; the censor's department was thrown into confusion by the news.  The blue pencil was produced, and all the newspapers in town were rung up and told: &ldquo;Don't publish a line about George Robey and the onion.&rdquo;  These particulars are true.  I have seen the censor's &ldquo;Stopped by the Censor.&rdquo; Every newspaper in Dublin and Cork was warned: &ldquo;Publish a line about George Robey at your peril.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Another enterprising periodical was short of material to fill half a column. So they turned up their files and put a heading to the column: &ldquo;War in East Africa.&rdquo;  Then they said: &ldquo;The following indicates the progress of the British forces in East Africa as it has taken place in the past six weeks:&mdash; February 2, Agardat captured; February, 3, Barentu captured; February 14, Kismayu captured....&rdquo;  This was simply a calendar of the events published in the Press.  An urgent message came from the censor: &ldquo;Stop the presses; at all costs get this out.&rdquo; There it is.  There is no comment. There is nothing in it except an index of events recorded in the newspapers published during the previous fortnight. A photograph of the battleship &ldquo;Vittorio&rdquo; was submitted to the censor, and the answer came back not to stop it but to hold it for consideration. As practical men we know that there is nothing as stale as yesterday's news. The vessel had been sunk and if they did not publish the photograph the following morning they might as well be publishing Gaby Deslys' picture now.  What was the astonishment of the newspaper editor, who had instructed his staff to jettison that picture, when he opened the rival newspaper&mdash;I need not name the rival&mdash;and there see the picture which he had been directed to hold.  He wrote to the censor asking why his rival had been given permission to publish a photograph which he was told to hold for consideration.  He was told that it was an unfortunate oversight and that it would not happen <Col N="1458" /> again.  If Michael the Archangel were administering censorship that could happen.  Papers are published at 2 o'clock in the morning, and the censor's anxiety is to get his decisions taken as quickly as possible so that the papers can go to press.  I do not want to make much of that.  Here, I think, is the jewel of the censor's activities. There is a paper published in the U.S.A. called &ldquo;Time.&rdquo;  Every year, on the 1st January, or in the first edition after the 1st January, &ldquo;Time&rdquo; publishes on its cover a photograph of &ldquo;the man of the year.&rdquo;  This year they published Churchill's picture.  It was an interesting news item.  There is a good deal of speculation in America as to whom &ldquo;Time&rdquo; will choose as the man of the year.  It was a lean time, early in January, and a newspaper thought that they would make a little paragraph of this for a panel.  They made an attractive little panel, and they headed it, in quotation marks, &ldquo;Churchill, man of the year.&rdquo; Then they said: &ldquo;Mr. Churchill has been selected man of the year for 1940 by `Time,' the weekly magazine.  This designation is given every year by the editor to the man or woman who has effected the most dramatic change in the course of history in the past year.' &ldquo;Time&rdquo; man of the year for 1938 was Hitler, or 1939 Stalin.&rdquo;  Could a more neutral statement than that be put into print?</P>
    <P>The message was rushed down.  This apparently threw the censor's office into a tail spin.  It was perfectly neutral. It could not be banned on the ground of neutrality.  It happened 3,500 miles away, and so it could not react very violently on the defence of this country.  The worst enemy of the newspaper could not say that it was a secret relating to the strategy of Irish defence.  So they decided on the middle course.  They passed it subject to deletion, and the deletion was: &ldquo;You must not put it in a box.  Print it in small print in the middle of a column, but, woe betide you if you put it in a box.&rdquo;  So the editor dropped it out altogether.  Being an industrious man he bought his rivals' two papers the following morning and found it in a box in both.  The offending box was in the <i>Irish Press</i>, the wicked box was in <Col N="1459" /> the <i>Irish Times</i>, and the virgin page of the <i>Independent</i> had no reference at all.  The note that I put on my papers even when I last pinned them together was: &ldquo;Are these follies or what?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I love the liberties our people fought to gain.  Most men in this House made a mighty contribution to that victory.  Many men in this House staked their lives on Ireland's right to freedom.  Many of us are born of families which for generations served in the struggle that this country might be free.  We got our freedom and we enjoy it.  Whether we are in Opposition or in Government, deeply discontented as we have been from time to time with what was passing in the public life of Ireland, we had the right, and we were proud of the right, to say that, in any case, in Ireland we have the right to think and to speak and to act freely within the law and to have free access to the thoughts of others.</P>
    <P>We put those rights in trust to secure the greater good.  We look to the men who act as trustees of those rights to see that every man and woman in Ireland understand the nature of our burden.  We look to them to be more jealous of our liberties than we would be ourselves.  I say that familiarity with the powers they acquired has betrayed them into assuming the role of pawnbrokers instead of trustees.</P>
    <P>I claim now that effective measures should be taken to restore the capacity of trustee.  I think the case I have made to-day entitles me to ask that all sections of this House who have lent their aid to this Government in a time of crisis, who have put their shoulder to the wheel without counting the political cost, are entitled to say, without apportioning blame, without condemning you for misfeasance or malfeasance, that the stewardship in this trust has been deserving of criticism. So precious is the treasure you hold that we claim the right to watch it with you.  We recognise that liberties we fought for and would die for must, in this hour of crisis, be abridged that Ireland may survive in freedom and attain to unity.  We ask now&mdash;no, we demand, that the watch over those liberties shall be shared by us all.  We <Col N="1460" /> have the right to say to you now that the watch will be carried on in no captious spirit of obstruction.</P>
    <P>There was a time when you might have suspected us of that intention, but you have not the right to entertain that suspicion now.  We want to get general consent for the things that must be done if Ireland is to go safely through.  We say that our experience teaches us that the watch upon these powers must be shared amongst us.  I have made a case in justice for that demand, and I end by asking this, House to ensure that all of us will have, not indulgence, not something over and above that which a Higher Power conferred upon us, but simply this, and only this&mdash;justice, justice, justice.</P>

      <P>I am not quite sure whether Deputy Dillon has cast a spell over the House and that that is accountable for the unwonted pause between the termination of his speech and the next one.  It was not my intention to enter into this debate at such an early stage.  The question in my mind was whether or not I would be given an opportunity of intervening in the debate at all.  Weighing up the possibilities of the question I must say that I did take the trouble to try to string a few sentences together so as to be able to give coherent expression to one or two points of view that I have on this matter.  I was not very enthusiastic about intervening in this debate, partly because of the limitation, the unfair limitation to my mind, in the matter of time imposed on a debate on such an important question as this is, and partly because I am, like most of the Deputies in the House and most of the people outside, in a state of almost complete bewilderment in relation to the operation of the censorship. In these days when rumour is heaped on top of rumour, and when we eventually find that there is more than a little truth in those rumours, it is very difficult for us to retain our belief in the conduct of the censorship and our faith and belief in those responsible <Col N="1461" /> for its existence and operation.  It is very difficult, in these times, to determine, in relation to news and views, where truth ends and fiction begins, and this may, I say, be a truly deplorable state of affairs for honest citizens to find themselves in, especially in a time of emergency such as exists at present.</P>
      <P>Now, at the outbreak of war all of us were so alive to the dangers besetting this country economically and politically that this House freely gave the Government the very fullest and widest powers.  Surely we had the right to expect that these powers would be appreciated to this extent, at any rate, that they would not be abused. Now, fundamentally, censorship is necessary in war time for the following reasons: firstly, to prevent the circulation by means of the Press of mischievous and sensational stories that would tend to undermine the morale of the people, or cause a state of unwarranted panic or fear; secondly, to prevent the circulation, by means of a popular Press, of propagandist and subversive material that would tend to undermine the authority of the State and its institutions; and, thirdly, to prevent the leakage of useful information in relation to our defence measures to possible enemies of the State, whether foreign or domestic, whether inside or outside the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These, I think, represent what is the object, or what should be the object, of censorship.  But what do we find here?  What is the position?  Most of the Deputies, that is to say those Deputies who still think freely, although they do not speak and vote freely, must realise that censorship here is being manipulated to suppress the free expression of public opinion throughout the country, not only in matters relating to international affairs but in matters of purely domestic interest.  Not a word and not a syllable is allowed to appear in the public press in relation to the moral issues at stake in the present titanic conflict now being waged over half the world. The statements of Bishops and of high ecclesiastical authorities are blue-pencilled as ruthlessly as the statements of political leaders and public <Col N="1462" /> dignitaries here and elsewhere.  The news is presented in such a way in the newspapers, by reason of the mutilations of the censor, that the belligerents are all branded with the same brush, and are made to appear in the same robe as rogues, thieves and liars.  No attempt whatever is made, or allowed to be made, to differentiate between one of the belligerents who, in spite of the fact that she is herself beleaguered on all sides, is responsible for the bringing to this country of every drop of petrol and every grain of tea that has entered this country since the beginning of the year 1939.  No attempt is made to differentiate between that belligerent and the other belligerent who has done the utmost in his power to prevent supplies, essential to the vital needs of the people of this country, from arriving here.</P>
    <P>It is quite possible that, in making a statement like that, I may expose myself to the risk of carrying the torch of Great Britain, but, let me say here and now, that I am neither afraid nor ashamed to indicate that my sympathies are all on the side of those small countries who, during the last 18 months, have been struggling, and struggling in vain, to maintain their freedom.  The death rattles of those countries have fallen on deaf ears in Leinster House&mdash;Leinster House the general headquarters of all but one other small nation that, for centuries, fought and struggled to maintain its freedom.  As I say, I am all on the side of those little plain, simple, ordinary people throughout Europe who still want to think freely, to speak, to talk, to write and to read freely, who when they go to their wireless sets want to turn on the knob and listen to sounds that are pleasing to their ears, irrespective of the origin of the country these sounds emanate from.  It is only by very simple things that man knows he is free, and I would urge the Taoiseach to remember that.  I would urge his Ministers to remember that, and, above all, I would urge his censor to remember that.  Surely, in a country like this, neutral as it is, that degree of freedom should still be left to the Press to enable it to lead <Col N="1463" /> public opinion.  In my opinion it is a very sad sight, and a very pathetic thing, to have a front bench of leaders on the right, and no leadership.  What is that due to?  Is it due to lack of moral courage?  Is it due to loss of initiative?  Is it due to the loss of the common touch, or is it due to a combination of all three factors?</P>
    <P>Those are matters of speculation.  To my mind, the main, if not the entire cause of this, is the fact that the Government has lost the common touch. How could it be otherwise, because the Ministers&mdash;or may I refer to them collectively as the Cabinet&mdash;when they are not at home are behind mahogany desks, and when they are not behind mahogany desks are sandwiched between a vanguard and a rearguard of 30-horse power vehicles?  It may be well for the Government to bear in mind the incidents that are happening in southern Europe, the recent incidents in the Balkans.  Trouble is again brewing in the Balkans.  All of us are aware of the fate of a Government that has lost touch with its people.  We are all aware of what happens.  Let the Government take warning from that. Let the Government take heed of that. Let the Government regard that as a salutary warning.  Happenings and incidents of that kind spread.  They can spread as rapidly as, let me say, foot and mouth disease.</P>
    <P>Now, I could cite numerous incidents which any fair-minded person would agree should have been allowed to appear in the public Press, but I will not take up the time of the House.  I read very carefully the debate in the Seanad where numerous incidents were quoted.  I listened with great interest to some of the incidents referred to by Deputy Dillon when he was introducing this motion.  In addition to the debate in the Seanad let me say this; the principal speaker on the motion in the Seanad, a motion somewhat similar to this, cited numerous examples of matters which were dealt with unfairly by the censor.  The very unfortunate thing about the matter, however, was that although the Minister for the Co-Ordination of Defensive Measures was <Col N="1464" /> in the House at the time, and he in theory at any rate is responsible for the operation of the censorship, he made no attempt to refute or accept as being true at least half the allegations made by that Senator.  The only effort at reply was a very considerable amount of personal abuse.  I should like to think that the abuse launched against the Senator on that particular occasion had no really vindictive feeling behind it, and was nothing more than a very well-known political ruse of drawing a red herring across the trail.  As I said at the outset, I was hesitant to intervene in this debate because, like the majority of Deputies in this House, I am very much uninformed as to how the censorship is being operated, but, judging by data which have been provided here to-night by Deputy Dillon, and by little pieces of knowledge to be picked up here and there by closely perusing the Official Debates, and by reading between the lines in the newspapers, it is perfectly obvious to me at any rate that the present system of censorship is hopeless. I, therefore, wish to say that I heartily endorse the terms of this motion, and shall be pleased to accord it my fullest support.</P>

      <P>I naturally was waiting until I heard a case made.  I have heard Deputy Dillon state a case, but I do not say for a moment that he has made a case.  I will intervene at this stage; I did not intend to, but in view of the suggestions that we have not got a case to make I certainly will intervene.  I hold that so far no case has been made that censorship has failed.  On the other hand, I am quite prepared to say that censorship has succeeded inasmuch as we have still retained our neutrality.  From that point of view I say that censorship has not failed.  I do say that in ordinary normal times of peace and goodwill there would not be found in this House one Deputy who would be prepared to stand behind a policy of censorship.  I do not believe there would be found one Deputy who would <Col N="1465" /> be prepared to advocate a policy of censorship, nor do I believe that a Government which would be prepared to force upon the people a policy of censorship in times of ordinary peace could survive the outcry which would be raised against it.  But these are not times of peace and goodwill.  They are times which are pregnant with very grave and very serious responsibility for our people, and very grave and serious dangers for our people.  I feel certain that the operation of censorship up to the moment has done more to preserve us against the dangers which beset us on all sides than anything else which we have been able to do.</P>
      <P>I must admit that Deputy Dillon is able to make a good case, a very dramatic case, and one which appeals to the sentiments of those who are listening, but he has made statements here which have no foundation in fact.  He has stated that words by the Holy Father were censored.  I say that no words or statements issued by the Holy Father were ever censored in this country.  He mentioned also the fact that the Vatican Radio was censored. The Vatican Radio is in no sense regarded as the mouthpiece of the Holy Father&mdash;the Holy Father has on occasions had to repudiate statements made on the Vatican Radio&mdash;nor is the <i>Osservatore Romano</i> regarded as an official publication of the Vatican.  It is not edited by an ecclesiastic; it is edited by a layman.  There again we have to deal with statements by the <i>Osservatore Romano</i> in the same way as we would deal with statements made in any other periodical.  There are certain principles to which the censor has to apply himself, and they are simple principles.  He will not allow anything to be published in the Press which is likely to jeopardise the neutrality of this nation.  He will have to be the judge in respect of that.  We cannot have half a dozen people giving us their opinions on the particular question. We must have one man whose judgment will be accepted.  We have decided that, so far as the censor is concerned, he will be the final judge in respect to what is to be published and what is not to be published.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1466" /> I am not going to suggest that the officials in the censor's department cannot make mistakes.  I am sure they have made mistakes; I am sure they have made large numbers of mistakes and, no doubt, they will make mistakes again.  That, I suggest, is very largely due to the type of work they have to undertake.  I know something about newspaper production; I know something about the rush and the bustle that obtains in respect to late news coming in, and in respect to the examination and publication of such news. It is quite possible that certain things will be let through in one paper and stopped in another.  It is quite possible, owing to the fact that large numbers of officers have to deal with the news, that some of these officers may take different views.  In that way Deputy Dillon can show us a box in one paper, an empty space in another and, perhaps, an ordinary article in another.  These things are possible.  I do not think the officials in the censor's department are going to claim that they are infallible in that respect.</P>
    <P>I have heard the statements made by Deputy Dillon.  I have listened to them carefully and, beyond the statement he has made in respect to the Holy Father, which I want to state now is not correct, I do not think there are any things that need very serious comment. It may be quite true that something about George Robey and an onion was stopped.  That is quite possible, but I cannot give a reason why such a seemingly ridiculous thing was stopped.  I have no doubt there will be some explanation of the matter forthcoming.  Anyhow, censorship will have to be regarded in this State as something that must be abided by.  It has, as I have mentioned, preserved us up to the present.  I hope that by its operations it will continue to preserve what we have up to the moment; that is, the peace and quiet that do not exist in other countries.  We are not anxious to get into the war.  I felt from the remarks that Deputy Dillon was making this evening that he would not mind if we were in the war.  This House decided&mdash;I think it decided unanimously&mdash;that the proper policy should be a policy of neutrality and, <Col N="1467" /> until somebody puts down a motion that neutrality should no longer obtain and that some other policy should replace it, I feel that the type of speech that was made here this evening will do us a grave disservice.</P>

      <P>I want to intervene in this debate mainly to deal with the activities of the Minister whose duty it is to deal with the censorship department. I intend to refer to one particular item of his work.  That particular item came into a discussion in the Seanad on the 4th December last on a motion dealing with the censorship and the Minister for the Co-ordination of Defensive Measures gave us a very clear idea of what his interpretation of censorship is.  The person who introduced the motion about the censorship in the Seanad referred to a certain item that appeared in the <i>Cork Examiner.</i>  It was an item dealing with the destruction of salmon and trout in the Blackwater.</P>
      <P>A certain journalist in Mallow, a reputable journalist regularly employed by the <i>Cork Examiner</i> for a number of years, sent in a report to her paper that a number of salmon and other fish had been killed in the river&mdash;that they had been killed by an effluent from the beet factory.  The Censorship Department prevented that statement from being published, and the mover of the motion in the Seanad commented on the fact that the Censorship Department had prevented it from being published. The Minister justified the censor's action in terms which, if he had made them outside the House, possibly would have rendered him liable to a civil action on behalf of the journalist.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will quote from Volume 24, No. 22, col. 2607, of the Official Report.  The Minister, dealing with the report that was censored, described the journalist who sent in that report as the type of person &ldquo;on whom we have got tabs fairly well for the past few years&rdquo;; as the type of person who was prepared to send out an untrue story, no matter what damage it did to the country, in order to get a few pence out of it; as <Col N="1468" /> the type of person who is willing to earn a few pence by crying down his own country, and as the type of person who should be taken by the back of the neck and given a couple of years in jail.  That was statement made by the Minister for the Co-ordination of Defensive Measures about a journalist in this country.  He made that statement under the protection of privilege in the Seanad.  The journalist, who sent in that report in good faith, who sent in a report that could have been verified by everybody who lives between Mallow and Fermoy, that could have been verified by every Civic Guard who walked along the Blackwater during that period, was attacked in those terms in the Seanad by the Minister under the shadow of privilege.</P>
    <P>The journalist has no redress.  She is put in the position that a report appeared in every paper in this country of the Minister's references to her&mdash; that she was not a fit person to send in a report, that she was a person prepared to sell her country for a couple of pence.  The Minister made that statement without inquiring into its truth, and the only explanation he could give for his attitude was that his Department yielded a little to the temptation to stop the story for 24 hours until the Department of Fisheries had got hold of the truth.</P>
    <P>The Department of Fisheries never issued a statement contradicting one word written by the journalist.  Apart from the international reactions to censorship, and apart from the national and internal reactions to censorship, are we going to let a Minister for State get up in the Seanad, or in this House, and try to justify the actions of the censor by stating, without any advertence to the truth of the situation, or enquiring amongst reliable people in that area, that the journalist was a person who would cry down the country for the sake of a few pence?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Linehan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister referred to a certain type of journalist and he said they were honourable people.  In the text he said that a certain type of journalist is an honourable man who thinks of his country and does not want to do to the State, as a whole, or any portion of it any harm, adding:</P>
      <P>and he will not earn a few pennies by crying it down, but there are some people in this country&mdash;and we have got tabs on them fairly well this last year or so&mdash;who are prepared to do anything.</P>
      <P>He used those words in the context: &ldquo;if this lie had got out and had got 24 hours' start of the truth&rdquo; and so on.  Is that a reference to the journalist who sent in that statement or not?  If those words are put in the context: &ldquo;if this lie got 24 hours' start of the truth,&rdquo; is the reference not to that journalist?  Will the Taoiseach listen to this:</P>
      <P>It appeared to the Department of Fisheries that if this lie got out and got 24 hours' advance of the truth, it would have a very bad effect on the people in the locality along that river who are earning their livelihoods in keeping people who come there to fish.  There should be some way of dealing with irresponsible statements of that kind and I think that, in ordinary times, we should have a law that a man who does deliberate damage like that should be taken by the back of the neck and given a couple of years in jail.</P>
      <P>Does that statement now refer to that journalist or not?  If the Taoiseach is satisfied that that statement did not refer to that journalist, I will make him a very fair offer: will the Minister for the Co-Ordination of Defensive Measures, when he returns from his sojourn in the United States, repeat that statement outside the House and risk facing an action in a civil court by that journalist?</P>

      <P>It would take Deputy Briscoe to think of that argument and that answer.  If it were a question of &ldquo;the greater the truth, the greater the libel,&rdquo; I might suggest that no libel action could ever be brought against Fianna Fáil Deputies.  If truth were the test of libel, they never stood in any danger of an action and the Deputy knows that as well as I do. But I do not mind the Deputy intervening. He refreshes me and gives me a chance to draw my breath.  I ask the the Taoiseach if the Minister in charge of this Department regards his functions as entitling him to attack a journalist for sending in a certain report, without inquiring into the truth of the report, and if the Taoiseach intends to intervene in this debate, I ask him this question: when the Minister in the Seanad made the statement about a certain lie getting 24 hours' start of the truth, did the Minister then, or ever, investigate the truth or falsehood of the story sent in by that journalist?  Were inquiries ever made of the local Gárdaí?  Were inquiries ever made of the local board of conservators, who would be in a position to tell them what happened?  Did they ever make inquiries as to whether the story was true or not, or did the censor merely delete the story, and, in justification of that action, the Minister gets up and makes that type of statement?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Assuming that the person who sent in that report did deliberately mislead <Col N="1471" /> the paper for which he was working, by sending in a small statement, would it still justify any Minister of State, who had any regard for the dignity of his position, who had any regard for the responsibilities of his office, in speaking on a motion in the Seanad, in referring to a particular item of news, the truth of which was in doubt at the time, in the terms and language he used&mdash;&ldquo;will not earn a few pennies by crying down his own country,&rdquo;&ldquo;should be taken by the back of the neck and given a couple of years in jail,&rdquo; and &ldquo;we have got tabs on them fairly well in the last few years&rdquo;?  If that is the attitude of the Minister in charge of censorship in this country, it means that just because the Minister&mdash; not even the censor&mdash;gets the idea into his head that a report sent in by a journalist does not suit him, it can be stopped, and he can then say: &ldquo;This journalist is not one of these honourable professional journalists who tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, but one of these people who are prepared to do anything for the sake of a few pence.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I want to tell the Taoiseach that I have had experience of this particular journalist over a number of years, and that this journalist is not, and never was, a political supporter of mine.  That journalist, no matter what her political opinions were, is a person who always put the truth into any report she gave, but just because, for once in her life, she put in something that did not suit the Ministry, she is a person not fit to be spoken of in any terms, except in terms of &ldquo;should be taken by the back of the neck and given a couple of years in jail.&rdquo;  Is that a sensible way of dealing with the matter?</P>

Some of these resolutions deal with political arrests.  We have a number of internees here and in the North.  Many things have been said and many resolutions have been passed on this matter and they are all being censored.

These individuals, whose aim should be to guide the minds of the growing population, are using their position to instil anti-British propaganda into minds in some cases.  I do not say that of the teachers as a class.

      <P>When this war broke out, one of the first things we had to look to, if we were to maintain our neutrality, was to see that people and newspapers who might hold strong views on one side or the other would not be permitted to bring this country into the conflict.  Everybody knows that, in this country, we are not all of the same opinion.  Certain people have opinions very much one way and certain people have sympathies very much the other way, and if you were to have that freedom of speech which we have in normal times, it would be inevitable that we should have a violent conflict very rapidly between sections of our own people, and that the warring parties, who would have a special interest in developing that, would make use of it to the full.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In a very short time, we would have not only internal turmoil but we would quickly find ourselves in a position in which we would be bringing ourselves <Col N="1476" /> into conflict with one side or the other. We have not had much experience of a situation like the present situation. This is the first experience we have had of it as a free community.  It is novel to us.  The restraints which other free communities have had under similar circumstances to put upon themselves are, naturally, galling to us and we chafe at them, but no country in a situation like ours has been able to pass through a period like this while allowing all its citizens to give free expression to their views on the merits of the conflict, and to take up strong partisan positions.  In the long run, they would find themselves overwhelmed, either through internal conflict or through attack from outside. The fact that we approach the matter in a prudent way like that, as all reasonable people would approach it, is no reason why we should be taunted with being timorous or having to obey the crack of the whip of one embassy or another here.  That is untrue.  We believe we have a right to live our own life in the way that is best in the interests of our own people, and we intend to maintain that right.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>This House and the vast majority of the people have decided that it is in their interest to keep out of this conflict.  We had to implement that policy by preventing individuals who might have strong feelings one way or another from involving us in the conflict.  It is unfortunate, of course, that things are not otherwise and that we cannot have democracy in the sense that, when a majority decision has been taken, the minority have still complete freedom of action against it.  Democracies have never been able to fight a war with that freedom. If they wanted to wage a war successfully, they have had practically to insist that, when a decision was taken as a State decision, that decision should be implemented and all the citizens should obey it.  In other words, it was made law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>You can easily see what would happen here if we were fighting for our lives, and, in a sense, we are fighting for our <Col N="1477" /> lives at present.  If we were actually engaged in physical conflict and fighting for our lives, is it suggested that because of the democratic right which normally obtains in peace time of free expression, it should be permitted to any section that opposed the war to stand up against it and, by doing so, help to bring danger on the nation as a whole?  I think you will all agree that that could not be permitted; that, in fact, it is not permitted by democratic states or by any other state in a time of war.  But we are, in fact, threatened with the same danger of destruction as if we were in physical conflict because a small state, no matter how strong we feel our rights are, is not in a position to make good those rights.  It can stand by them; it can fall by them; but it is not in a position to impose respect for those rights on larger states.</P>
    <P>Our position here from the start has been this, that we do not want to interfere with other people, but we insist on, and would if necessary fall in the attempt to defend our own right against being interfered with.  It is simply to maintain that position and to see that we would not be brought into the conflict by the foolish action of individuals, who are thinking in a personal way or in a sectional way, that the censorship was established.  It was established mainly to preserve internal peace and, so far as it could be done by imposing prudence in expression, also to keep us at peace with other nations.</P>
    <P>Censorship is the most difficult of all the tasks of war.  It is difficult because in fact it is to parry weapons which the belligerents are using one against the other.  If it were possible to have one person in such a capacity to deal with the whole mass of matter that has to be censored, it would be difficult for him to keep absolutely so even in his judgment on particular cases and to apply his general principles to particular cases in such a way that it could not be brought against him that he was acting in some way which was inconsistent.  To-night he may be weary, in the morning he may be fresh.  His judgment on the matter and his application of the principles <Col N="1478" /> may not be quite the same.  If you get the result of his judgment in the morning and put it with his judgment in the evening, and if you do as Deputy Dillon and some other speakers have done, namely, go over the operations of the censorship for one and a half years, it would be possible to pick out and keep things on the one side or on the other side and say that that person was not acting uniformly.  If you keep the carefully selected mistakes and the apparent biases on one side and present these and do not present the others, you can say that he is biassed in some direction.</P>
    <P>But you must remember that the censorship is not done by one man, that in the nature of things it has to be done by several men, and that it has to be done under conditions of great rapidity, because the one thing that would not be forgiven to the censor would be if he delayed his decisions.  His decisions have to be prompt.  Anybody who is acquainted with the work of a newspaper office knows the rapidity with which the work has to be done in order to get the news prepared and ready for the morning. Therefore, to delay a decision unduly would practically mean that you were preventing the newspapers from doing their work.  These decisions, therefore, have to be made quickly, and they have to be made by a number of people.  It would be impossible to get one man to do the censorship. Knowing that no human being is other than fallible, it would be possible to take the result of his work and to make a case against him and say that he was biassed on this side or that.</P>
    <P>That is all that has been done this evening.  There has been a selection of cases.  Deputy Dillon has been carefully briefed with regard to matters arising over a long period, and he presents the House with a selection from one side and says: &ldquo;Judge from that and you will see that the censorship is being conducted in a way that is biassed, and that the person who is in charge is not a proper person to be in charge.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>As I have said, the work of censorship is extremely difficult.  I, at any rate, am satisfied that the work in the <Col N="1479" /> censor's office is being carried on honestly and sincerely in accordance with general principles, having no thought whatever of anything except the interests of our people and the safety of our community during this trying period.  There is no other motive actuating the censorship staff except that one idea&mdash;to implement the general policy of the State, to try to maintain calm here and to prevent the people from being heated up by propaganda from one side or the other; to try, so far as it is possible for any community to get them, to get the facts and to prevent, so far as they can, biassed comments on those facts.  Do we want that or do we not? I take it we do.  I take it that Deputy Dillon's chief complaint is that we have not the freedom of expression which we all admit it is desirable we should have. We cannot have the two things.</P>

Neither the Minister who spoke already nor I have the close knowledge of these things which would enable us to give all the facts and present the cases as they occur with all the surrounding circumstances, because there may be a good reason for doing something in a certain atmosphere a month or six weeks ago which may not apply to-day.  The trouble is that these things have to be taken as they come. They have to be taken in a certain set of conditions, and, unless you can reproduce those conditions, you are not able to judge fairly as to whether the censorship was satisfactorily done or not.  Reference has been made to my broadcast.  I say that that has been completely and absolutely misrepresented, as much misrepresented in its <Col N="1480" /> tenor and general purport as was the statement of the Minister for the Co-Ordination of Defensive Measures when he spoke about ships.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy can go back as much as he likes.  I read carefully the statement of the Minister in the Dáil because I was annoyed, naturally, when I saw the way in which it was misrepresented abroad and in foreign newspapers.  I saw that reasonable exception could not be taken to that.  His remark was prompted, as I pointed out when I spoke recently, by some remarks which Deputy Hickey was making.  He wanted to turn the people's attention to the one safeguard they have with regard to supplies and that is their own endeavours at home. That was the whole purport of his remarks. I think I pointed out to Deputy Hickey on that occasion that, if he looked through the report, he would realise that every sentence of the Minister's was punctuated by some remark by the Deputy.  Finally, he said &ldquo;Quit this question of ships and turn to the other&rdquo; and, because he did that, the whole thing was taken out of its context.  The words about damn ships were repeated and sent across the wires, and the whole purport of the Minister's speech was misrepresented.</P>
      <P>Now, in the same way I spoke about the position here.  When I spoke at Christmas, we were beginning to realise much more fully how quickly a shortage was about to come.  I spoke of the fact that the belligerents in blockading each other were blockading us.  That was a fact and is a fact.  It is the truth.  There is no denying the visible effect of it in the shortage of our supplies.  That shortage is growing daily and will become graver as time goes on.  Now, why should that statement be made the basis of misrepresentation? I carefully avoided imputing motives to either of the belligerents. I do not believe that either of the belligerents was attacking us as such.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They were attacking each other, but we were coming in for some of the blows.  That is a fact and I stand by it, and if it was not misrepresented it <Col N="1481" /> would do no damage whatever to our national interests.  I made it deliberately and carefully, not foolishly.  I said what I said in that broadcast carefully and deliberately, and I stand over every word of it as expressing the truth as it was, having in mind all the national interests, but when others take it up and for more or less party purposes make it the basis of an attack, then it assumes quite a different appearance.</P>

We must make up our minds about that. Again, I spoke of the attitude of this country.  I was speaking to the American people, and I spoke about the attitude of this country for some years past.  I referred to the time when I was speaking some 20 odd years ago in America.  I wanted to point out to them that our present attitude is no new attitude.</P>

      <P>I assure the Taoiseach that I do not desire to offend him in any way.  I am putting the question to the Chair: &ldquo;Are they relevant to the motion?&rdquo; The motion complains of the censorship.  When speaking I referred to the Taoiseach's broadcast and said that while the newspapers could comment on it they could not <Col N="1482" /> criticise it.  I did not deal with the subject matter of the Taoiseach's speech because I did not think it was allowed.</P>

      <P>So far the Taoiseach has confined himself to points made by Deputy Dillon in reference to the effect of a certain broadcast to America.  To enter into the merits of the case is not my function, but the Taoiseach is replying to some aspects of the Deputy's criticism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The importance of these matters referring to me were twofold.  First of all, there was a suggestion that I was anti-British&mdash;let me put it that way.  There was the plain suggestion that my broadcast was made because of a certain bias against Britain&mdash;that that was the whole meaning of it.  In this conflict I have said that the State is neutral.  I cannot, in any statement of mine, divorce any personal feelings I may have. When I speak, I am speaking as the head of the Government.  My remarks will be taken, and anything that is attributed to me will be taken as representing the attitude of the Government. Now the fact is that this Government is neutral in this war.  We are faithfully carrying out the policy of the State in so far as it is humanly possible for us to do it.  It is not in the interests of the community that the head of the Government, in circumstances like these, should be represented by anybody, or that an attempt should be made to build up a case to represent him as being biassed, as being animated by hatred or any such motive against one belligerent.  It is untrue, to start with, and it is not in the interests of the State.  As long as this Government is here, it is not in the interests of the State that that should be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am referring to these two things, to the blockade and also to what was regarded as imperial adventures.  On the occasion of the broadcast to America, I pointed out, as I had said there years ago, that the aim of the majority of our people was to be an independent State, and that that meant that we were not going to be involved in any imperial adventures. It is possible, I will admit, to relate <Col N="1483" /> that to the present time, to translate and, if one wishes, look at it in that way.  If one reads it with bias it is possible to take that statement and say: &ldquo;Oh, that was referring to the present and passing judgment upon the present issues in this war.&rdquo;  It was nothing of the kind.</P>
    <P>The whole argument was that our people had long ago determined that, if they were going to live as an independent State, then they were not going to be attached to one empire or to another empire: that their whole purpose was to try to get their independence so that they could lead their own lives in their own way.  I wanted to point out, therefore, to those who might be listening to me that the attitude of the State here to-day was quite consistent with the attitude which we had taken up at that time. There was no other purpose whatever in my statement.  I do not think any person reading it fairly, without bias, would hold that there was.  The whole purpose of it was to show that the State now was neutral, and that that neutrality was consonant with the whole purpose which we have in trying to secure our independence.  I take these simply as examples.  There is no doubt but that the imputation of bias to the Government at the present time, on one side or the other, is a harm to the State.  It is not true.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Therefore, the censor is quite right, in my opinion, in preventing people who, wrongly, are trying to impute such bias to the State and to the Government.  Now, with regard to some of the other examples. Deputy Dillon had an excellent opportunity here, of which he made the most, to stand as a champion of democratic freedom, democratic right, of Christianity and Christian principles, and so on.  I think, however, he should have made himself a little more sure of his facts before he spoke.  The Minister for Defence has pointed out that it is not true to say that any statements of the <Col N="1484" /> Holy Father were censored.  They were not.  There was a censoring of a news agency, of a statement in the <i>Osservatore Romano</i>&mdash;that, I think, is something of quite a different colour&mdash;and what was in it was censored because the things that were referred to there and the rumours and reports had not been allowed previously to be published here; that is, the censor here, in the first instance, on his own initiative, stopped those false rumours and false reports which it was necessary for the Holy Father or for the <i>Osservatore Romano</i> afterwards to deny.  The rumours were not published here. They were prevented in the first instance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>They were not published in print.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>They did not seem to be published anywhere, because they certainly were new to any people that I spoke to about them.  The fact is that when you get those newsagency reports you cannot be sure of what you are getting at the present time.  Everybody here knows quite well that propaganda is one of the weapons of modern warfare, and that the news agencies of the various belligerent countries, every one of them, use their power as Press agencies to give a particular complexion to the happenings of the day, to statements and to all the rest of it, and it is right for the censor to view with suspicion statements that come from agencies of that kind.  There were other reports about the Holy Father.  We remember the last war, and the complexion that it was tried to give during that period to the views of the Holy Father of that day.  The same thing is being done at the present time, and the result is that the censor, the moment any reports of that kind come through, stops them.  Therefore, he did not feel that it was necessary to put in a denial of reports which had not been allowed to be published here.  That is the position in regard to that particular item.</P>
      <P>The next thing which has been spoken about is the Vatican Radio.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1485" /> The Vatican Radio is not official, as far as I know.  Broadcasts are to the different places and the different countries with their different circumstances, and a broadcast which, going to one particular people in their circumstances, is right and proper, if taken out and applied to another country in another set of circumstances would not be right and proper.  In any case, as the Minister for Defence has pointed out, the Holy Father is not responsible and does not himself take responsibility for the Vatican Radio.  I do not know of my own knowledge what was the thing to the censoring of which some objection is taken.  I do not know it, but I do know what the facts are with regard to the general position in connection with the radio.</P>
    <P>The next thing which was mentioned was the censorship of portion of a pastoral letter of an Irish Bishop. That passage was censored in accordance with the general directions which had already gone out to all the newspapers.  The newspapers themselves, if they were to act in accordance with the general instructions which they had received, would have themselves censored it.  They do, in fact, censor themselves; they publish only very small sections of pastorals. This particular pastoral was a pastoral on Christian Marriage, and the extract did not seem to indicate very much that that was the purport of it.  A certain portion was chosen which included a passage that no newspaper in the country would have been permitted to print.  If there are instructions given out in that particular way it is quite right that the censor should act uniformly.  The passage that was offending was not the passage exactly that the Deputy read out.</P>

      <P>I have heard the Deputy's point of order.  The Deputy read out certain paragraphs which he said were censored.  He read these paragraphs in full.  The Taoiseach is reading paragraphs from the same Pastoral which he states were censored. The two documents may not coincide, and yet both might be correct. Into the merits I am not going to enter.  They might have been censored for different papers.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it is advisable that this controversy should begin here.  I think it is very much better that I should state that.  An appeal has been made to the Government as well as to the House to see that the censorship is exercised in a more satisfactory way.  Looking at one of the examples that I have got, I may say that if I were the censor and I got that paragraph, having seen the general instructions which had been <Col N="1488" /> sent out, I would censor that paragraph. After all, we have the responsibility here of trying to save this community from the consequences of this conflict, if we can do so.  We have the responsibility and it is in carrying out that responsibility that we are being judged.</P>
      <P>There were some other instances with regard to what is called unfair or biased censorship.  It was suggested that a British official communiqué was censored and stopped and that a German one was let through. My information is that no official communiqués are stopped.  News agency messages&mdash;which are quite a different thing&mdash;touching the communiqués up from a special angle or a special point of view, are censored.  I believe the censors are right in giving the official news from each particular Government, letting that news be given in the Government's own terms, everybody knowing what it is, and everybody discounting it or otherwise according to his or her judgment of the extent to which it is completely and absolutely true.  But a news agency giving its own reports is quite a different matter.</P>
      <P>There was also a complaint that letters criticising the use of cars by Ministers had been cut out.  My information is that letters criticising the use of cars, even though they were not true, had been permitted, but when a spate of anonymous letters came along, knowing that at this particular time the hardships which people were suffering were going to make them very susceptible to lies of that sort, they were censored.  There may be a difference of opinion as to whether the censoring of anonymous letters under these circumstances was wise or not, but that is the fact.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe that that refers to the members of some parish council who were sending forward letters of that kind.  Again, the safety of this country depends upon our getting our food supplies.  If we are going to have irresponsible people at a <Col N="1489" /> time like this, when every hour is precious, trying to stop the national effort by suggestions of that sort, then I think that there, too, the censorship staff might naturally feel that it was a part of their duty to see that national damage was not done.  I am not going to say, and I have not said it, that any one man or any group of men can operate a censorship to the satisfaction of everybody.  It would be absolutely impossible.  Every newspaper that is inconvenienced, every correspondent who wants to have something published which, from the point of view of his profession or otherwise, he wants to get in, has a grievance if something is stopped.  Then everybody will think, being the judge in his own case, that he is right and that the censor is wrong.</P>
      <P>My own belief is that, considering all the difficulties there are in this whole question, we have done reasonably well over the period, and my hope is that we will pass through the whole period without doing greater damage. There is a certain amount of damage always being done.  Inevitably it is a choice of evils, and there is always the evil of censorship.  I believe that if we pass through this period with no more damage and no more evil resulting from it than what has resulted up to the present, we shall be very lucky indeed.  What I am concerned with is that this censorship is being operated, in so far as human fallible beings can do it, without bias and with full understanding, recognising the fact that censorship is an evil which, under present circumstances, has to be borne in order to avoid greater evils.  It has been operated in that particular way and it is not being operated with a view either of cloaking, as someone said, any mistakes of the Government, or with a bias either in internal politics or external politics.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The last thing I propose to refer to is the matter raised by Deputy Linehan, when he spoke of the fish.  I have not got the actual document that was censored, but I take it that the Minister for the Co-Ordination of Defensive Measures, when he was speaking <Col N="1490" /> in the Seanad, summarised its substance. He said that it was represented that for a distance of ten miles the river was filled with dead fish and that the channels were choked with carcases of trout in such numbers that it was possible to walk across the river over the dead fish.  I take it that on the face of it that is false.  I think at that time the papers were asked to withhold publication until examination could be made by the Department. Later, the Minister speaks of a couple of dozen dead fish having been found. I take it that that was the result of some information he had got from one of the Departments.  Why should we stop the publication of that?  It is possible that the Minister was influenced in the same way as I would have been influenced, and I would have stopped it, because, in my belief, it was fundamentally false.  It was a gross exaggeration; it was damaging to our country in one way or the other; and there was no reason whatever why it should go out.</P>
    <P>When I was in the United States on a previous occasion we had a journalist or two in this country&mdash;thank God, they were not many&mdash;who could always get scare headings in the American papers by telling falsehoods about this country.  They were things which were absolutely false, but which 3,000 miles away would not be recognised as being false.  There were such journalists, and there was also a journalist here who, on one occasion, with regard to calves, published a disgusting story, a revolting story, of the cruelty which it was suggested was carried on here at the particular time.  It suggested that we were a callous, cruel people who had no respect for animals, and so on. That was a lie, a complete and absolute exaggeration.  That person did not mind damaging the national credit, and it was a pity that there was not then a censorship to deal with him.</P>
    <P>This matter in its exaggeration would not, I admit, be as harmful to the national interest as that, but there is a danger&mdash;I am quite willing to admit this&mdash;that in trying to safeguard the national interest in this emergency as the censor is bound to do, he may <Col N="1491" /> go further than is absolutely necessary and may err rather on the too safe side.  That is possible, but it is very much better, in my opinion, that he should err on that side than that he should err on the other.  Let him give opportunities for one side and there will be opportunities for the other side.  It is much better that we should have a rigid censor who is not as elastic as some of us might wish than that we should have a censor who is elastic and inclined to strain the censorship in the direction of what we would regard as complete freedom.  That is one of the prices we shall have to pay for safety during this crisis.  We shall have to approach it as a sacrifice which will have to be made, as one of the prices we have to pay.  If we approach it in that spirit, I do not think we shall suffer ultimately.</P>
    <P>What we should remember is that the possibility of our being here later, with full rights restored to us, may depend upon the extent to which we are prepared to suffer, if you wish, a diminution of our rights at present.  I think that is the only way in which we can face it&mdash;that we should do this in order that, later, we may have the power of exercising these rights.  We should not forget, because we have escaped so far, that we are constantly in danger, and if, despite all our efforts to keep our community out of this conflict, we are forced in one way or another into it, I hope it will be found, as I believe it will be found, that the people who have been most anxious to avoid this conflict will behave themselves not less well than those who at present seem less anxious to avoid a conflict than we are.</P>

      <P>Any approach to this motion must take cognisance of the fact that, whatever the viewpoint of individual Deputies may be, the overwhelming anxiety of the people of this country is to maintain a policy of strict neutrality in this conflict, and it is because that viewpoint is so manifest on all sides that I think we do a grave disservice to the cause of neutrality in this country by appearing to meddle in <Col N="1492" /> matters which, from the national point of view, might very well be left alone at present.  The policy of neutrality has been agreed upon by all Parties, and there have been declarations to that effect by responsible persons in all Parties, though one is inclined to doubt now and again, judging by the utterances of Deputy Dillon, whether, in fact, he has not tired of being neutral and now wants to become very belligerent. At the outset of his speech, Deputy Dillon went needlessly out of his way to proclaim the fact that, while the people of this country were neutral and apparently desired to remain so, he thanked God that his views were somewhat different and that the House and the country knew where he stood in respect of the war being waged in Europe to-day.  That may be all right from Deputy Dillon's personal point of view.  It may suit Deputy Dillon to get a particular bend on his mind in relation to that war, but other Deputies might have other views.  The main consideration surely for responsible Deputies to-day, knowing the country desires to maintain a policy of neutrality, is not, by mischievous speeches, to put the country off the road along which, wisely, I think, it has decided to march in this crisis.</P>
      <P>I listened with considerable interest to Deputy Dillon's speech and the fact that was impressed upon me was that threequarters of the speech was devoted to a criticism of one set of belligerents. I think that, from Deputy Dillon's and the national point of view, was a very dangerous and mischievous speech, and one calculated seriously to misrepresent our position before that set of belligerents.  I think the one thing we must do in this crisis is to avoid making the mistake of the man at the fair&mdash;trailing our coat and daring people to walk upon it.  That is a dangerous policy and a highly dangerous doctrine in these times.  We have to remember the gigantic resources of the nations at war to-day; we have to remember the magnitude of their military might; and we have to relate it to our ability to protect ourselves in the struggle taking place in Europe to-day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1493" /> It is not our business, as probably the smallest independent nation now left in Europe, to get in between these titanic military protagonists and to proceed to express our views as to the way in which we think one set is conducting itself in relation to our philosophy of life.  It ought not to be our business in a situation of this kind to express what we think of their attitude one to the other, particularly when that attitude does not concern us as a nation in this portion of the world.</P>
    <P>We would be foolish, of course, if we were to believe to-day that both sets of belligerents are not resorting to all the intrigues and all the subtleties of war propaganda.  Both sets of belligerents have ministries of propaganda, not ministries of truth, not ministries of fact but ministries of propaganda, expressly created for the purpose of issuing their variety of truth for the purpose of deceiving people, for the purpose of getting sympathy for their point of view, and the sole purpose of these ministries of propaganda is to wheedle people into acceptance of the viewpoint of one set of belligerents or the other.  Have we so little to do or do we feel ourselves so armour-plated in our own protection that we must meddle in a matter of that kind?  Let the German Ministry of Propaganda put out its propaganda. Let the British Ministry of Propaganda do likewise but do not let us get mixed up in a competition of that kind, because it will not redound to our national credit or help us to preserve a policy of strict neutrality.  I think that we shall make a fatal mistake&mdash; and we may live to regret it&mdash;if we try to fill the role in this conflict of judge on one side or the other.  That is not our business and our national welfare demands that, in these times particularly, we should mind our business.  When you survey the whole economic position of the country, when you remember its isolated and blockaded position, you cannot but feel that we have sufficient to do to mind our own business without minding the business of any other nation in Europe.  There is necessity for great care in the <Col N="1494" /> publication of news, particularly news relating to the war situation in Europe. So far as the censor exercises his powers reasonably in that regard, I would not complain of the exercise of them.</P>

Let them not be propagandist organs for either the German military viewpoint or the British military viewpoint.  Let us cultivate a reasonable frame of mind in that regard.

      <P>You should have heard the Deputy expressing himself.  In respect of foreign news coming from sources the authenticity of which you cannot trust in existing circumstances &mdash;news coming from obviously propagandist institutions&mdash;it is necessary to tell our people that possibly these sources of information are contaminated. It is not desirable for us to present news as if a particular event, recorded as happening, did, in fact, happen in the way alleged in the report.  On the question of a reasonable censorship of foreign news relating to the war, I, personally, think, independent <Col N="1495" /> of what anybody else may think, that it is necessary to preserve a reasonable discretion on the part of the Press Censor.  If he errs at all, I should prefer him to err on the side of eliminating highly contentious news items rather than on the other side, so far as these items affect the war situation.</P>
      <P>In respect to internal matters, I think the censor should be liberal in his interpretation of his powers and that he should not use these powers for the purpose of shielding the Government from criticism by any citizen or political group in the country. The censor should, certainly, not prevent a Press discussion on important internal political or economic matters. I do not happen to have with me evidence that he has tried to do so.  Some reports did reach me to the effect that articles on certain subjects, including one bearing the heading, &ldquo;Fill the larders&rdquo;&mdash;a very important matter for the people to-day&mdash;did, in fact, incur the displeasure of the censor.  The censor should not exercise his powers in that regard.  In war times, Governments make mistakes.  These mistakes may oftentimes be corrected at the outset if public criticism can be directed against them.  The censorship powers should not be used to shield a Government from criticism of that kind.  I was glad to hear from the Taoiseach that he recognises that the Government has had thrust upon it very great powers under the Emergency Powers Act and that it has a very important trust to maintain liberty of thought, speech and action, conditioned by the national well-being, in the present crisis.  I hope that, if this debate has, in some respects, been mischievous, it will help to indicate to the Government and to the Press Censor that, while reasonable censorship of foreign news matter relating to the war will be endorsed generally by this House and by the people, there should be a fair field and no favour in respect of discussion on internal economic and political matters.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is, I think, common knowledge amongst people who <Col N="1496" /> have any experience of administration that policies that once seemed good at the beginning are apt, occasionally, if people do not review the situation from time to time, to drift away from their origins, that instructions that are given may at times be warped by those who have control and must act under the instructions, and unless an opportunity for revision, such as this debate offers, is taken by those with responsibility, they may find themselves very soon far removed, indeed, from what was in contemplation by those who granted the powers of censorship we are discussing here to-night.  This debate was offered as an opportunity to the Government to review the position, because we believe the situation has drifted very far from what was in contemplation when we granted to a single-Party Government power which, even in a time of war, is only entrusted to a composite group.</P>
      <P>I need not refer to the original debates of 1939.  I have them here if my statements are challenged.  The standard laid down in these early debates was that censorship was a necessity.  We always regarded it as essential and we still regard it as essential.  We did ask under what system the censorship was going to be worked and we were told that, mainly, there would have to be a prohibition of items of news that might be of use to one of the two belligerents and detrimental to the other and that, so far as anything else was concerned, the standard was to be the national interest as a whole.  We were definitely told in those days that it was not contemplated that there should be any interference with expression of opinion. It was news that was the quarry, not opinion.  How far have we moved from that situation?  We believe&mdash;we have put it on record in the motion&mdash;that the censorship is being used &ldquo;unduly to restrict legitimate free speech and to prevent the natural expression of public opinion.&rdquo;  We ask that the censorship be brought back to conform to the ideas we had at that time. Those were ideas that, certainly, would have allowed legitimate expression of free speech and natural expression of public opinion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1497" /> Deputy Norton has talked about the price of 50/- for wheat and the letter that was canvassed about the House. We are told that this letter advocating a price of 50/- per barrel for wheat was censored because it might have obstructed the campaign for more food. Are we now to believe, as I understand is the situation, that what that demanded in the way of a fixed and a guaranteed price is going to be given?  How far are we from the price of 50/- demanded in that letter?  That had to be censored in the national interest.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hickey, in a question here before Christmas, asked&mdash;and this is an internal matter&mdash;how many internees there were in the various internment camps in this country.  He was not referring to belligerents who casually landed here, but to our own people.  He was given the number, and when the news was flashed to the Press, a censor's note came immediately that the information was not to be published.  Deputy Hickey, if he got the information from the papers, might want to complain that there were too many interned, and I might want to complain that there were not enough.  Why should both of us not be allowed to express our views on that matter and to have the information on which we could argue?</P>
    <P>Meetings are held in the Dublin Mansion House from time to time at which folk, who think they are doing the anti-partition movement some good, speak and they constantly refer to the number of people ruthlessly put into internment by the Northern Government.  Every time any phrase like that is used, I understand that there are people who stand up to ask how many the Taoiseach has put in internment and the censor forbids any reference to these interruptions.  Why? Does the national interest demand that these people should be allowed to criticise a Government with which we have at least friendly relations, and that we have to suppress the fact that the Taoiseach here is walking exactly the same path, as far as results go, as his vis-a-vis in the North?</P>
    <P>I understand that when the question <Col N="1498" /> of evacuating children to this country from Great Britain was under consideration a deputation from the Dublin Trades Council went to Government Buildings to meet the Taoiseach and some of his Ministers.  They announced that they had a plan; they announced the funds they had at their disposal; that they proposed to take over children from the poorer quarters in England and put them up free; and that they had a scheme on foot.  I do not mind that that scheme was turned down.  What I do object to is that the Press were forbidden to publish one word about that deputation having gone to Government Buildings and being received by the Taoiseach.  Is that necessary in the national interest?</P>
    <P>There were other small matters which I will leave that are not so completely attached to conditions in this country. I suppose it is possible, here in this House, in a debate which will, no doubt, be ruthlessly censored tomorrow, for me to state without any fear of contradiction that there had been an engagement between naval forces in the Mediterranean recently. Last night one newspaper had a heading over that, &ldquo;British Bombers' Part in Naval Victory&rdquo;.  The censor struck out the word &ldquo;victory&rdquo; and made them substitute the word &ldquo;battle&rdquo;. What is the sense of that?</P>
    <P>There has been recently a seizure of certain ships belonging to two of the Axis Powers as well as to a one-time neutral nation.  These ships were seized in America and protests have been lodged by the representatives of the Axis Powers.  The Press Association message with regard to that carried the comment: &ldquo;Mr. Cordell Hull's blunt refusal to consider the protest&rdquo;.  Our namby-pamby censor would not let that pass unless the word &ldquo;blunt&rdquo; was struck out.</P>
    <P>I thought it was some wits who are circulating what I suppose Deputy Norton would call a mischievous rumour to the effect that certain patent medicines had been forbidden the usual advertisement facilities here because of certain tags to the advertisements, but I understand it is true. Some advertisement for a medicine <Col N="1499" /> called &ldquo;Phosferine&rdquo; carried with it as an incentive to the people on the other side to buy it, that if they took Phosferine they might avoid the siren. That advertisement has to be crushed out of the papers here, not because there is any objection to people taking Phosferine, but because the censor will not let us understand that a thing called a siren is sometimes sounded on the other side.  There is another patent medicine which is supposed to be good for the chest, and there was tagged on to an advertisement for that, &ldquo;War weary people would require this&rdquo;, or &ldquo;War harassed chests would benefit by a dose of this&rdquo;.  Some such phrase as that was used and that was cut out. That has to be suppressed in the national interest.</P>
    <P>Without taking sides in this matter, I state that it is common knowledge that in recent months one of the belligerents in this war has lost hundreds of thousands of square miles in Africa and hundreds of thousands of men.  They have by degrees yielded up the chief cities of Eritrea and Abyssinia.  If any newspaper here takes a Press Association message which contains the words that the Italian forces are on the run, that must be cut out, but the neutral word &ldquo;retreat&rdquo; will be allowed.  Can anybody here stand over these things?</P>

The proper label cannot be stuck on.  These are minor matters in comparison with the bigger things spoken of to-night.  Let me take this important matter of the suppression of an official communiqué which was denied to-night.  I have here a statement countering the German propaganda with regard to aircraft losses.  The statement is published by the British Air Ministry countering a statement which had already got into our papers about losses.  They give for certain periods what they state are their losses.

As to what he meant, I find it at times hard to know.  He has already put two glosses on it and they are not entirely consistent.  Of course that is common form.  Why it was censored I do not know, and I do not pause to inquire. I think that many people share my view that it was injudiciously done. That is not his view.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the trouble. If we pass it over, and if the mistake is repeated, who is at fault?  One way of bringing sense into the Taoiseach's head is to criticise him when we think there is a need for it.  I do not care whether the broadcast was judicious or not or why it was made.  What was criticised here to-night was, that newspaper reports of the debate in the Seanad on the broadcast were censored. In its report of the debate a newspaper thought fit to put up this heading: &ldquo;Broadcast to America Criticised.&rdquo; The word &ldquo;criticised&rdquo; was struck out. The censor insisted that the only heading that could be given to the debate was &ldquo;Reference to Broadcast to America.&rdquo;  Are we to take it that it is not in the national interest that anyone in the Seanad should criticise the Taoiseach's broadcast to America, although it may be proper for a newspaper to give this heading to the debate: &ldquo;Reference to Broadcast to America&rdquo;?  What is the sense of that? The Taoiseach, to-night, several times repeated utterances about the blockade.  All these were in the framework of the national interest.  If I am to deduce anything from the utterances that he advanced here to-night it must be this, that he thinks it is in the national interests of this country that we should say that, equally with Germany, <Col N="1502" /> Britain is blockading this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>In any event that can be related to the statements of the Minister for Supplies and the Minister for Finance, that this country is being blockaded by both.  Deputy O'Higgins thought fit to write a letter to the Press questioning the use of that term &ldquo;blockade&rdquo; in regard to what is happening as between this country and Great Britain.  In the course of that letter he says:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;A blockade means the prevention of supplies reaching a country by the use of troops and armaments.  Last summer Germany informed us that we were within the blockade zone, and that shipping to and from our shores would be sunk by her forces unless such shipping complied with conditions which were considered unacceptable.  Since then she has been blockading us.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>It has been definitely stated that Germany considers she is not offending against the canons of international law in blockading this country.  Deputy O'Higgins, in the course of his letter, referred to our imports from Britain in the year 1940, and went on to give percentages with regard to specific goods brought into the country.  He then asked if we were to believe, in view of that, that she was blockading us.  He then put this rather pertinent query:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Government Ministers state that Britain is blockading us.  The Vice-President of the Federation of Irish Industries, who is associated with many industries, states that it is not so.  Government Ministers state that Great Britain is blockading us.  The Secretary of the Federation of Irish Industries, who is a Deputy in the Government Party, states that it is not so.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the national interests that letter was suppressed.  Apparently, it is in the national interests for Government <Col N="1503" /> representatives to state that Britain is blockading this country, but when Deputy O'Higgins writes to the Press and tries to get an explanation of the matter saying that: &ldquo;it is very much in the public interest that the people of this country should get some accurate and truthful information.... on such a vital matter,&rdquo; the same public interest demands that his letter, requesting clarification of the subject, should be suppressed.  Is that holding the scales evenly, and is that permitting the free expression of public opinion in the country?</P>
    <P>I understand that Deputy Dillon referred to-night to the suppression of portion of the pastoral of the Bishop of Achonry, and also to the suppression of an item of news that came from the Vatican Radio which said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Religious houses have been closed all over Germany often with no pretext at all, and these houses are not returned to their proper owners. Recruiting of Christians is made difficult and religious instruction is almost entirely absent in the schools.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was suppressed.  What did the Bishop of Achonry say?  The Taoiseach, if he wishes, can give me the full quotation.  But this, at least, was suppressed:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We know what the Poles are suffering and we know how the dictator has treated the Church in Germany. Can we look with indifference on God dethroned from His rightful place in the Universe? Can Catholics view with easy minds the possibility of a victory which would give brute force the power to control Europe and decide the fate of small nations?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was suppressed.  Let us understand that situation in this Catholic country.  That was portion of a Bishop's Pastoral issued at a very solemn time, the opening of Lent; a time when it has long been the habit of the Bishops of this country to address their flocks in their different dioceses.</P>

      <P>This pastoral was issued at a very solemn time, when the Bishops address their flocks and speak to them on matters that they feel it their bounden duty to write about.  The Bishop of Achonry decided that he would speak about the dethronement of God from His natural place in the Universe and went on to refer to the possibility of a victory for brute force. That is the spirit in Germany.  Early in the system that now holds there a valiant Cardinal indicated that he thought it was the right of the clergy in Germany to inform public opinion and even to educate the politicians of that country.  That was done with concentration camps in the offing.  That was the spirit shown by the Cardinal of Munich who continued to write his pastorals.  Even with people howling outside his palace, he persisted in writing his pastorals in 1933.  Things were done before the war and were permitted in that country which have not been equalled since in some countries <Col N="1505" /> even in stress of war.  In any event, he proceeded and persisted in that.  That part of the struggle in Germany calls almost for admiration, for in Germany the resistance of certain people with certain points of view was a resistance put up even against the threat of concentration camps and of other terrors. In peace and with no threat of anything in the nature of complete and entire aggression upon us&mdash;if that pastoral were published here &mdash; we decided that that statement to the members of his flock made by a Bishop of the Church should not be allowed publication in the Press.  Why?</P>

      <P>It is the wisdom that prevents such matters circulating here.  I do not know what moral standpoint the people of this country may have in the future or what standard we are to impose on our folk. It would be very hard to get back to an ordinary appreciation of Bishops' duties and rights if people remember that a Bishop, when he had made up his mind on what was happening, was forbidden to announce his mind on that matter.  We are told that the national interest might be weakened if people were allowed to comment here on how the belligerent forces are behaving.  That may be so, but is it not something that people have to think about, something that may develop in the future?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce, in a speech made last September or October at a Local Security Force meeting, told the people who were at that meeting that, when this war was over, this country might find itself without a friend.  That was a serious statement from him.  What had occurred about September to warrant that statement being made by him, I do not know.  The Minister had a manuscript and gave it to the Press and naturally the Press presumed that what a Minister said would be allowed to pass the censorship, and they published that statement of his and it got into some of the morning <Col N="1507" /> papers.  But, by the time the evening had come, the censor took the matter up and, although the Minister's speech appeared, that particular phrase was excised and the censor&mdash;his own colleague, or the people who act under him&mdash;thought fit to prevent the Minister for Industry and Commerce telling the people of this country that when the war was over we might find ourselves without a friend.  If a Minister thinks fit to say that, why does another Minister think fit to prevent publication of it?</P>
    <P>Quite recently here, the Minister for Supplies in a debate told people he was addressing that circumstances might change and that policy must be adapted to circumstances and:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;On the facts as we know them now the policy of strict neutrality in this conflict is in our own best interests&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I take that to be following somewhat in the lines of the Minister for Industry and Commerce&mdash;that a period of stress would come after the war.  One may tell us that, for some reason, because of our attitude to the struggle, we may find ourselves without a friend when the war is over.  The Minister for Supplies told us that circumstances may change and that policy must be adapted to circumstances.  How are the people of the country to find out that circumstances are changing, if they cannot get the news through the Press?  The Minister apparently feels that it may be necessary to depart from this attitude of strict neutrality&mdash;not at the time he was speaking, of course &mdash;but at a later date when some change in the situation may make it necessary and when policy may have to be adapted to the changed circumstances. Who is to know of the changing circumstances? Must it again be that to a single Party Government all the knowledge must be given and they will withhold the facts which show a change of circumstances and show how necessary it is to adapt policy accordingly? Will it happen, at some time in the future, that this country may have to make a sudden change and the only people who will know the <Col N="1508" /> reason will be the people who are now preventing whatever facts are in those Ministers' minds being made known to the people?</P>
    <P>I feel that it is quite possible to have censorship here.  We all voted for it.  Nobody wishes to rush this country either headlong, or by sidestep or incautiously or deliberately into war, but it is possible, we think, to have free speech here and we do think that it is necessary to have a healthy growth of public opinion about the changing circumstances. If the Press are not given some better play than they are given at the moment, we will not have the information upon which future policy will have to be determined.  It is said that no great change ever has been brought about except in circumstances such as this&mdash;you must have devotion to a great cause, you must have an unfaltering faith that whatever is right in the end will prevail.  Do the people get enough information, through the operation of the Press censorship at this moment, to enable them to make up their minds that there is a cause which requires their aid and that there is something which needs their unfaltering faith?  This is a question of deciding where justice lies and whether might or right is going to prevail.</P>
    <P>Deputy Norton wishes us to close our ears to what is happening outside.  He is afraid that incautious allowance by the censorship of news here might drag the belligerents' wrath upon us. That was referred to recently by President Roosevelt.  He talked of those who asked him not to frighten them by telling facts, and gave a warning that people cannot escape danger by curling into bed and pulling the clothes over them.</P>

I am only speaking of the getting of information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1509" /> I am as strong as anybody for preventing imprudent utterances by Pressmen or for suppressing the wildest efforts of the propagandist.</P>
    <P>In this debate we have only given a few examples of censorship of the many that can be given.  I think, when it comes to preventing people hearing statements made by their own clergy, that fact alone ought to make the Government stand back and look at this thing anew and see whether, as I said at the beginning, they have not strayed somewhat far away from the programme and the policy they had and which they presented to this House when we gave these serious powers of censorship into their hands.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The debate that has taken place leaves little to be said from our side, for I think we made a case that the Taoiseach himself felt could not be answered.  A large part of the Taoiseach's speech was devoted to a defence of the text of his broadcast to America.  He protested that it was untrue to represent that speech as being anti-British on the one hand or anti-Axis on the other, and that it was unfair to suggest that he was anti- one or anti- the other.  I would remind the Taoiseach that I introduced my remarks to-night by saying that that was none of my purpose and that, so far as I knew, it would be an injustice to describe him or his colleagues as being anti- one side more than the other.  I did say, and I do not think it was any excess, over and above what discussion would impose, that I considered his reference to imperial adventures as tactless in the last degree.  Surely that is not calculated to wreck this nation and, as Deputy McGilligan has emphasised, leaving aside altogether the merits of what the Taoiseach said, is it desirable, in this day and age, that the newspapers of this country should be forbidden to publish the statement that a free citizen, never mind a chosen Senator, criticised, not the Taoiseach's person, but the text of what he said?  I think the Taoiseach on reflection is as much abashed as we are by the discovery of the use of censorship powers that was made in that case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1510" /> I do not want to go down through all the cases I have already quoted but I venture to say this, that in respect of each one of them&mdash;and they were not chosen cases; they were the run of the mill as I could get them&mdash; every word the Taoiseach spoke in defence of the action taken by the censor's office was special pleading, and he knew it was special pleading.  If you could get him in the secrecy of his own chamber there was scarcely a single case brought under the attention of Dáil Eireann to-day of which the Taoiseach would not have said, &ldquo;If I had the chance to see that before it was done, it would not have been done&rdquo;.  I am not pretending that it is not easy to be wise after the event. I am not pretending that every one of those cases would have been picked up by myself or any of my colleagues if we had to look at it from the other side of the event.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Wait a moment.  Hold your horses now.  What I am saying is this: It would be irresponsible on my part in respect of a motion of this kind to bring forward a number of the trivia that I brought before the House if I did not make the case, &ldquo;Here is nothing serious in itself but the accumulation of these things suggests a trend which can be corrected now but which, if allowed to develop unchecked, may lead us into very serious difficulties&rdquo;.  Surely that is the right way to approach this problem instead of saying, &ldquo;We will wait until the situation becomes so intolerable that we would be prepared to fight rather than submit another hour&rdquo;.  The thing is to come before the legislature in good time and say, &ldquo;There is the accumulation of evidence; let reasonable men read as they run, and see where that is leading&rdquo;. It is obvious the trend is wrong. Check it now and let us get back on to lines on which all of us, in a greater or lesser degree, will be prepared to agree.</P>
      <P>Nobody is asking in this House that censorship should be abolished.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1511" /> Nobody is suggesting that the same degree of freedom can reasonably be expected in time of national crisis such as we are passing through as we may legitimately demand in time of peace.  All we are pressing on our Government to-night is this: If you want to get a free people to concur in this abridgement of their liberty you have got to bring them with you because the alternative is to convert them into a slave people.  You cannot bring them with you if you use the powers with which they trust you in such a way as to shatter their trust. And remember this&mdash;this Government above all Governments in Europe, I think, has received a measure of cooperation from the common people down through the country whenever they trusted them, whenever they said, &ldquo;It all depends on you; if you are prepared to row in with us we can pull it off and if you want to block us you can make our task impossible.&rdquo;  I do not say you can go that far with censorship but I think you ought to say to the people, it must be 75 per cent. common sense and 25 per cent. coercion.  Free speech must be limited by that equation&mdash;75 per cent. of your own common sense and 25 per cent. of coercion which no Government would claim the right to exercise but for the difficult times through which we are passing.</P>
    <P>I am not pretending that there are not difficulties.  Of course, there are difficulties but I say that many of the cases that we set out here to-day are gravely blameworthy.  Some of them are as clearly mistakes as the two pictures of the <i>Vittorio Veneto.</i>  If Michael the Archangel were the censor such errors would occur.  But when we take a whole lot of minor incidents together and see the accumulation and then when you link them up with clear instances of the gravest possible remissness such as were, in my judgment, the censoring of the Vatican and the <i>Osservatore Romano</i>, of the Bishop's Pastoral, of the statement that the Taoiseach's broadcast was criticised, of the official communiqué from Great Britain correcting the communiqué that had been issued by <Col N="1512" /> Germany, then I say, taking these things altogether, we are entitled to say there is an obligation upon you as trustees to satisfy those who trusted you that the job is being done rightly.</P>
    <P>The stewardship to date has not been good.  Let us have no quarrel about it, but let the Party Government in office in this country come half way to the other representatives of the people and say, &ldquo;We know that we are exercising powers over you, the minority, that are repugnant to free men and distasteful to a democratic Government.  We did our best, and if we failed to satisfy you that we have done as you think is fair, being reasonable men, then we are prepared to give you the opportunity that you ask for to supervise the general administration of this restriction of your liberties.&rdquo;  Now, listen. I do not think the Government is obliged to get from us a testimony of perfection.  They are entitled to say that minor errors have occurred.  It is only when such a case is made as was made by Deputy McGilligan, myself, and other Deputies to-night, that a claim can be made to come half way to meet them.  I am indebted to a student of Constitutional history for a reference to what President Lincoln once said.  President Lincoln said that for democracies for free people it was hard enough to have a Government strong enough to protect them in times of crisis that would not be too strong for the survival of their liberties in times of peace.  That is a wise saying, and that is the dilemma of every democracy and every assembly of free men in the world.  I do not think the Government of this country have any reason to complain that the minorities in this country have under-estimated their difficulties.  Let there be censorship. We do not claim that there should not be.  Let there be prohibition of acrimonious language in respect of foreign statesmen.  Let there be prohibition of irresponsible utterances which could be reasonably availed of for the purpose of aggression against this State, but let us, in our desire to avoid those things, forbear from compelling our people to imply assent to things for which our people will never stand.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1513" /> Statesmen of foreign countries are entitled to demand immunity from insult from citizens of this State, and the Government of this State is entitled to compel recognition of that demand.  But no statesman, in this State or outside it, is entitled to demand that the Irish people shall be coerced, in order to gratify that man's will, to imply assent to doctrines that are detestable and obnoxious to them. There is a middle course.  There is the course dictated by reason, and no one here will quarrel with a Government that even leans a little backward to meet pressures brought to bear upon it, from abroad.</P>
    <P>There should be a Rubicon, however, upon which the Government, as the trustees of the rights and liberties of our people, will stand.  There should be a place at which our Government will say: &ldquo;Freedom of expression, and liberty, are the things we live for, and if we cannot have them we would sooner die.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I do not believe that the danger of a challenge being thrown down to us is material.  In this day and age no one is going to quarrel with us about what we say, provided that a reasonable discretion, such as that mentioned <Col N="1514" /> by Deputy McGilligan and myself, is exercised.  I do not believe there is any serious difficulty in adjusting the requirements of reasonable public men on all sides in this country, but I do say now that censorship has travelled along lines in this country which are heading for disaster; that censorship has reached a stage in this country when the facts and information, which our people are entitled to have given them in order to make up their minds reasonably and honestly on the issues that confront the State, are being withheld; and lastly I say this: Governments of free people must carry their people with them.  If there is withheld from our people, as Deputy McGilligan warned this House, the facts on which their Government from time to time must plan their policy, a day may dawn in which our Government and all our public men will play the bitter rôle of Cassandra amongst our own people and, seeing clearly where the interest of our country lies, discover that by the deception, to which we were party, of our own people, we are unable to lead them in the right direction but must abandon them to the destruction that deception wreaks upon them.</P>

      <P>The substance of this question really is that Deputy Bennett, who signed the original motion that gave rise to this question, and I are asking that the Minister should now fix minimum prices for crops that farmers will produce in the coming harvest. Firstly, I want to say that, in the early part of the proceedings when this question was first raised, some Deputies in the House apparently got it into their heads that what Deputy Bennett and I were anxious to secure were fixed prices and they protested, even at that time, against the fixing of any prices and intimated that they expected that oats, to take one crop, would reach a very high price by the end of this year.

      <P>Neither am I concerned with the position of the man who is able to hold his crops for a sufficient time to enable him to take advantage of a rising market.  I am, however, very much concerned with the position of the man who has to dispose, say, of his oats crop, as soon as he threshes it and who last year had to dispose of it at what was practically a ruinous price.  He was driven into the position of having to buy the very same oats later on in the year at treble or quadruple the price.  Actually, for certain types of farm produce the Minister has already fixed prices.  In the present situation when the Government and the Minister are asking for greater production, surely it is not unreasonable to ask the Minister that he should now say that in respect of all categories of farm produce where it is possible to do so, he will fix a minimum price to be paid for that produce after next harvest so that, no matter what crop a farmer produces, he will be able to know beforehand that he will be in a position to dispose of it at a certain price.  If, as some Deputies have suggested, there is the possibility of a great rise in prices in respect of some products, there is no reason why that man, if he were in a position to do it, could not hold the crop until later on in the year and take advantage of that rise in prices.  I want, however, to make it clear to the <Col N="1517" /> Minister that there are hundreds of other farmers who have to get rid of their crops in harvest time because they want the money immediately. That is the reason I suggest that the Minister should now fix minimum prices and indicate to these farmers what they may expect for their crops.</P>

      <P>I am not concerned with whether the minimum is the maximum.  What I am concerned with is that if a man is producing a crop which his economic circumstances may compel him to cash immediately after next harvest, he will not be driven into the position of having to take a price which is uneconomic and scandalously low, in other words, that he will have the assurance that he will get a proper price for his crop.  Everybody may not be in the happy position of Deputy Corry.  If Deputy Corry has, say, 50 acres of oats, I assume he is in a position which will allow him to keep those oats until after Christmas when he can take advantage of a rising market, but as far as I am concerned I certainly do not want to see the small farmers who have to cash their crops immediately, and sometimes have to contract for the sale of them before they are threshed, being put into the position that people of whom Deputy Corry is loud in his praise occasionally will come along and buy their oats and other crops in September, selling them back to them in various forms and in their original form in February and March.  I respectfully ask the Minister, in regard to the small farmers of this country, who are not in a position to retain their crops, who are not in a position to store their crops or to take advantage of rising markets, but who have to cash their crops or even contract for the sale of them before the threshing, to tell them here and now with regard to cereals, and I suggest as well with regard to potatoes, that they will get a definite minimum price for them at that time. If there is a chance of the price increasing afterwards they will get their <Col N="1518" /> chance the same as anyone else, but they should not be left in the position of having to sell their crops at a ruinous price.  I do urge on the Minister that a minimum price should be fixed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the reasons why we are asking for an immediate answer from the Minister on this matter is that whatever value the motion may have as an inducement to farmers to put in the maximum amount of crops, particularly cereals, in the remaining few weeks of spring, would have been lost when the motion was eventually reached.  It was for that reason that Deputy Linehan thought it fit to raise the question to-night. The Minister himself has admitted the truth of the charges which I repeatedly made in this House that in the autumn of 1939 and 1940 the farmers sold their oats and perhaps other cereals but certainly their oats at a price which permitted the purchasers shortly afterwards to get 100 per cent. profit, and in many cases more.  The Minister has admitted that that is a fact.  I repeatedly asked the Minister last year to make arrangements before the harvest so that what happened the year before would not happen that year.  It did.  The farmers are a timorous people.  I have no doubt that most of them are trying to do their duty; some of them may be affected by the fear that what happened to others last year will happen to them this year&mdash;that after they took the pains to grow a crop the bulk of the profit would be taken by the merchants who purchased it from them.  We are not asking anything that will encroach upon the Exchequer; we are not asking anything that we believe will affect the ordinary consumer, in fact we rather believe it will help him.  If a fair minimum price is fixed for the crops which the farmer grows it will not cost the Exchequer anything, it will help the farmer, and it will put the consumer and the purchaser generally in the position that they will know what was paid for the crop and will be able to determine what profit the merchant gets on any crop which he purchased.  That will, to a great extent, prevent profiteering. <Col N="1519" /> I do not want to repeat arguments which were put forward in this House on many occasions.  All we ask is that the Minister would now make a declaration that the farmers will get a minimum price for their crops this year.  If he cannot state the exact figure at the moment, if he cannot determine what is a fair minimum price to offer, we would certainly ask him to make a statement now telling the farmers generally that what happened in 1939 and 1940, when perforce they sold their crops at a ridiculously low price, will not be allowed to occur again.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should not like to agree exactly with what Deputy Bennett has said, that I admitted that the prices which the farmers got for their oats in the harvests of 1939 and 1940 were afterwards doubled by the merchants.  I think I went very fully into that on previous occasions.  There is not very much time to go into it now, but I am sure we will go into it again on another occasion.  Deputy Bennett also said that before last harvest I was asked several times from his side of the House to fix the price.  I am not going to take all the blame for what occurred before last harvest.  I think if Deputies will look up the official debates they will see that the general tone of the debate from the other side of the House was that there was a surplus of oats and barley, that it was going to be dumped at a very low price, and that the farmers were not going to get very much for it.  On every single occasion when that matter came up I appealed to Deputies not to stampede the farmers into throwing their grain on the market; that in a very short time there would be an improved price for that grain, and in fact that if the farmers held out they would get a very good price for what they had.  I do not say at all that every farmer could hold out, but I do <Col N="1520" /> say I appealed to farmers as far as they could to hold their grain last harvest, and if those who could hold it had held it the price would have been quite different.  However, the prices which some people got were poor.  The prices improved all through the year, and of course the prices to the consumer now are out of all proportion. In considering the next harvest, and what is going to be done after next harvest, we must have regard to where that grain will go to. I am talking now about barley and oats.  In the case of wheat there is a price fixed, because it is for human consumption, and we know what we can fix in that case.</P>
      <P>In the case of beet, the same thing applies.  In the case of flax, it is going into fabrics, and it is quite easy to determine what the price should be. But in the case of barley and oats, if there is a surplus, then a certain part of it will have to go back to the farmers themselves for consumption by their own families.  A certain portion of the barley and oats will possibly be required for bread.  If all the surplus were required for bread, we could now fix the price.  A certain part of the barley will be required for the making of beer and spirits.  We could fix the price for that, because that again is for human consumption.  A certain part of the oats will go for oatmeal, and can be dealt with, but, if the acreage under oats and barley is as good as we expect, and if the harvest turns out in any way abundantly, there will be a certain surplus of oats and barley which will go to the merchant, from the merchant to the maize miller, and from the maize miller back to the farmer for feeding pigs and poultry.  For that reason I do not see how we can fix a price for oats and barley.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There will be some.  We do not know what the market is going to be like at that stage for bacon, pigs, poultry and so on.  That is why it is impossible now to say what the price for oats and barley should be, but if <Col N="1521" /> Deputies think it any use I can give what my personal opinion or reaction is to this whole matter.  I think we should be able to work out a scheme of fixing a price for oats and barley whoever they may go to, whether they go for brewing or for distilling or for flour or to the oatmeal miller or eventually back to the farmer; we should fix the price that the producer would get, that price varying from say September to the following March, giving something to the farmer who holds his grain over; we should then fix the price that the merchant would get from the miller or from the brewer, and we should go further than that and fix the price that the maize miller would charge to the farmer who is going to buy that ground oats or ground barley for consumption.</P>
      <P>If we can do that, it is fairly obvious that a minimum price is not going to be enough; there must be a fixed price. If we are going to have a perfect scheme like that, there must be a fixed price right through, the fixed price being laid down for every person and varying from month to month or from two months to two months.  That is what I am aiming at and I think it can be done.  If we can do that, it will be a great advantage to farmers, whether they are growers or consumers.</P>
