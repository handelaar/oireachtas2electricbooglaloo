      <P>asked the Minister for External Affairs whether it is a fact that incendiary missiles were used to ignite oil on the water in the neighbourhood of a sinking Irish vessel, and, if so, whether any Irish seamen suffered injury thereby.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>According to the reports I have received, the suggestion that incendiary missiles were used to ignite oil on the water in the neighbourhood of a sinking Irish vessel is devoid of all foundation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Taoiseach not been informed that, on one occasion, when an Irish ship was sinking and Irish seamen were in the water, a German aeroplane fired incendiary bullets into the water and ignited oil, and that Irish sailors, as a result, were burned?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no such information, but if the Deputy will mention the name of the ship, I might be able to tell him the circumstances, because I have here full details in respect of all the ships sunk.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

      <P>Might I ask the Taoiaseach whether he realises the difficulty of any citizen of this state in getting any relevant information as a result of the censorship imposed?  I shall do my best to get from confidential sources the information we are unable to get from the Press.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">

    <Title>Ceisteanna.&mdash;Questions.   Oral Answers. - Suggested Moratorium.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether he is aware that great hardship has been inflicted on a considerable number of persons who, through having lost their employment owing to the emergency situation, are unable to meet their obligations in regard to rent, house purchase agreements, hire purchase, buying and insurance policies, and whether he will introduce proposals for a moratorium in respect of such obligations where the persons concerned are unemployed or serving with the Defence Forces.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. O Ceallaigh) Seán T. O'Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. O Ceallaigh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware that great hardship has been inflicated on a considerable number of persons arising out of the circumstances stated in the Deputy's question, but I am prepared <Col N="907" /> to believe that some persons who lost their employment owing to the emergency situation are finding difficulty in meeting obligations incurred on the basis of their former incomes.  The whole question of the steps necessary to mitigate the hardship falling on those put out of employment by reason of the emergency is receiving the constant attention of the Departments concerned, and the aspect of this matter to which the Deputy refers will not be overlooked, although, in this regard, I should add that the implication in the Question that members of the Defence Forces require the same relief as unemployed persons cannot be accepted.</P>
      <P>It is not my intention to introduce proposals for a moratorium on the lines suggested by the Deputy, as there is no evidence that such a drastic step would be justified; moreover, even if conditions worsened, it would be most difficult to confine such a moratorium within satisfactory limits, and it would be essential to avoid any measure which might promote a public impression that obligations would not be honoured during the emergency and that all debtors would be protected from the normal consequences of default.</P>
      <P>It would also be necessary to consider carefully the effect of any such proposals on the persons to whom the money payments such as rent, purchase instalments, etc., were due, and also on public and local finances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say that it was not intended that these moratorium proposals should be extended to all classes of persons.  The purpose of the question was merely to secure protection for those who could prove&mdash;and the onus was on them&mdash; that their present state of impecuniosity was brought about directly by the emergency situation.  Is the Minister aware that at present persons who have lost their employment, arising out of the emergency situation, are having insurance policies lapsed and only a fragmentary surrender value paid, <Col N="908" /> because, under existing insurance legislation, lapsing can take place when the arrears amount to ten weeks or over?  Is he aware that persons are at present being evicted because of inability to pay rent, again due to the fact that they have lost their employment arising out of the emergency situation, and in order to steady a situation of that kind which threatens to worsen seriously, will the Minister give consideration to the provision of some kind of relief for persons who can definitely prove that their indebtedness has been brought about directly by the emergency situation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy has practically repeated his question, to which I have given an answer, but I must say that, so far, I am not aware that many of these cases have arisen. I have asked in the various Departments which might be notified of such happenings and I have not been able to get satisfactory evidence there either.  If the Deputy, or anybody else, is able to give me such evidence, I shall have the cases examined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister would seek information from persons who are charged with the responsibility of collecting insurance premiums at present, he would be furnished with information to the effect that policies are lapsing at an alarming rate, due to the inability of people to pay premiums on such policies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>If they are happening at an alarming rate, I imagine that I should have had evidence brought, probably forcibly, to my notice, but I have not got such evidence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall see that the Minister gets it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he will state the value of the external assets of Eire held by (a) banks, (b) Government Departments and (c) (estimated) other persons or bodies, and if he will state, in respect of each of above groups, the extent to which such external assets are represented by sterling or sterling securities.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as official sources of information are concerned, the best material available was given in paragraphs 131 and 162 of the Report of the Banking Commission dated 23rd March, 1938.  Subsequent changes, so far as ascertainable, have been given in the tables relating to the balance of international payments published annually in the <i>Irish Trade Journal.</i>  The latest such return was given in the issue of September, 1940. The inward or credit movements (exports) amounted to £12,078,000 in 1937, £16,082,000 in 1938, and £10,316,000 in 1939, while the outward or debit movements (imports) amounted to £9,593,000 in 1937, £18,051,000 in 1938, and £9,986,000 in 1939.  As pointed out in various articles in the <i>Irish Trade Journal,</i> extreme caution is necessary in the handling of these figures in view of the diverse character of the influences affecting them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister appreciate that these figures were set out in respect of a given date in the Banking Commission's Report, although, or course, it was observed that they were tentative and estimated?  Has any attempt been made to make corresponding, tentative estimates for these figures on the same date for each year since the Banking Commission Report was published?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the year before the Report of the Banking Commission was published&mdash;1937&mdash;there has been set out each year in the <i>Irish Trade Journal</i> a very long and elaborate table giving, I think, all the figures it was possible to give in relation to this matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>The (a) figure is published quarterly, I think, by the Currency Commission.  It would be possible to give a figure with regard to (b).  As regards (c), no effort has been made to get an accurate figure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>What is asked for is an estimated figure.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>Even an estimated figure would be very difficult to get.  It would necessitate prolonged and elaborate inquiry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Does not the Minister think that, in the circumstances in which we find ourselves at present, the result of that inquiry would be eminently worth the trouble taken to make it?  Our whole economic future depends upon it.  If the question is repeated after a reasonable lapse of time, will the Minister consider making the information available?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall consider that but I could not possibly promise the Deputy that, in a reasonable space of time, I would be able to get the estimate he suggests.  I do not say that an effort will not be made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if his attention has been directed to comments of the Public Accounts Committee relating to purchase by the Board of Works of Laurencetown R.I.C. Barracks, County Galway, for the sum of £500, and subsequent resale at £60; if he will state the name of the owner from whom the barracks were purchased, the date on which purchase negotiations commenced, the stage purchase negotiations <Col N="911" /> had reached on 9th March, 1932, and if it was legally possible to have purchase proceedings dropped subsequent to that date.</P>

      <P>Do these details comprise the statement that, in February, 1936, the board was warned that this property was falling into disrepair, that nothing was done about that until August, 1937, and that it was their failure to take requisite measures to protect the property in that period that involved the Government in the loss which it has sustained?</P>

The settlement proposals provide for works on the embankments. Legislation will, however, be required before the Commissioners of Public Works can undertake any works on the drainage district.</P>

      <P>It is not possible to give the Deputy the information he requires, as apart from the question of quality there are numerous cuts of bacon, all of which may be sold at different prices.  The prices charged for bacon in various cities and towns have been investigated from time to time as occasion required, but apart from the information obtained by these investigations I have no official knowledge of the prices prevailing at any particular time.  A fresh investigation will be undertaken in any case if the information available to my Department appears to justify that course. I have power to fix a maximum retail price for bacon, and the matter has been under consideration.

      <P>asked the Minister for Supplies if there is a maximum price fixed for (a) creamery butter, (b) farmers' butter, and, if so, if the Minister will state what those prices are, and if it is illegal to charge higher prices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a maximum retail price fixed for creamery butter and farmers' butter under the Emergency Powers (Control of Prices) (No. 72) Order, 1940, which order was made by me on the 10th December, 1940.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the terms of this order it is illegal for any person who carries on the business of selling butter retail on or after the 10th December, 1940, to sell any butter of a particular class retail at a price in excess of the price charged by such person for butter of that class on the 1st day of November, 1940.  The prices permitted to be charged by this order for creamery butter vary from 1/7 per lb. in the larger cities and towns to 1/8 per lb. and in some cases 1/8½ per lb. according to the transport charges prevailing from the main centres of distribution. Creamery butter sold in packets and <Col N="916" /> rolls is generally ld. per lb. dearer than butter taken from bulk.  The permitted prices for farmers' butter vary considerably from district to district. This butter is generally sold on an open market in the larger towns, but in the rural areas it is sold either direct to consumers or to the smaller county shopkeepers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister consider the advisability of fixing some ascertainable price for butter, as there is no use fixing a price for farmers' butter in relation to a date when there was no farmers' butter sold?  If you want to fix a price for butter, you must day on which farmers' butter was sold, but if there was no butter sold on the day mentioned in the Minister's order, a price could not be fixed.  Would it not be more convenient for everybody if the Minister would fix a price for creamery butter in cartons and in lumps?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The price which prevailed for farmers' butter varied very considerably from one district to another.  The difference between the lowest and the highest price charged was often as much as 1/- per 1b., and there were circumstances which appeared to justify that very big differential.  In the case of creamery butter, the price fixed is easily ascertainable. A uniform price for the whole country is not practicable, because the transport charges from the main centres of distribution have to be taken into account.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister will fix a price for creamery butter, I believe <Col N="917" /> that farmers' butter will regulate itself.  Good farmers' butter will make the same price as creamery butter, and the less good will be proportionately cheaper.  Surely it is easy to say that creamery butter must be sold at 1/8 or 1/7 in the varying districts, county by county, and put an end to all the confusion.</P>

      <P>We have fixed a price only where there were circumstances which appeared to make that course desirable; that is where there was only a <Col N="918" /> limited number of suppliers who could be easily organised into a ring, or a tendency to charge excessive prices. In a very large number of cities and towns there is, of course, considerable competition between suppliers and that competition tends to keep the price of milk down.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Supplies if he will state whether the Government have given consideration to the question of the collection of waste material for industrial purposes, and if he will indicate whether it is proposed to organise the collection of such waste materials through the medium of local authorities or otherwise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Consideration has been given on numerous occasions to the matter of the salvage of waste materials for industrial purposes and it is being kept under constant review. It is my present opinion that the best results can be achieved by leaving the collection of such waste materials to be organised on a commercial basis by concerns who have had long experience in this connection.  These concerns have, up to the present, been capable of meeting all demands except, recently, in the case of waste paper, the requirements of which have increased since the beginning of the present year.  The question of supplies of waste paper is at present being investigated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware of the fact that, while a large holder of waste material will have no difficulty in disposing of that material through a commercial purchaser, a good deal of waste material which is contained in domestic refuse is in fact being classed as refuse at the moment <Col N="920" /> and is being destroyed in municipal destructors throughout the country, and does he not think it desirable to organise the collection of waste material at municipal centres where it is possible to do that and where the aggregate collection would justify any expenditure?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not clear as to the waste material which the Deputy has in mind.  In respect to all the waste materials which are capable of being utilised commercially here, our supply is normally considerably in excess of our needs, except in the case of waste paper.  The position at the moment is that all the waste materials which can be used here are available in quantities equal to and, in fact, in excess of our requirements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>That may be so, but we have no assurance that that situation will continue, any more than we have an assurance in respect to other commodities, while material is going to waste.  Will the Minister reconsider the matter and try to organise collections in the large centres?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

      <P>I should like to take this opportunity of correcting the misstatement which I made in answer to the Deputy's supplementary question on the same date and to point out that the total quantity of main crop potatoes exported from this country in December, 1940, was 6 cwt.

      <P>Will the Minister indicate why he feels at liberty to disclose the export of main crop or seed potatoes for December, 1940, and will not disclose the information regarding the export for the months of January and February, 1941?  Am I to understand that the Minister merely quoted the December figures because they suited his argument and that he dare not tell the House what the exports were for January and February?  Surely the Minister is not trying to justify a position whereby he can get State statistics and quote them against Deputies, but Deputies are not to be permitted to get similar information to that which is available to the Minister for debating purposes in the House?</P>

      <P>Perhaps I should intervene?  It was already explained to the House that there was a definite decision taken by the Government at <Col N="922" /> a certain period that the ordinary statistics should not be published; that it was not advisable in the public interest to give statistics asked for by Deputies which would ordinarily be given.  On account of the demand that was made for them, I myself gave some statistics on the last occasion that I spoke here.  That was against the general decision.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of what the Taoiseach has said, my complaint is localised against the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  My complaint is that the Minister quoted certain statistics relating to the export of potatoes for December, 1940, from a document available to himself, but, declined, when asked, to give similar information for the months of January and February.  Why is the Minister prepared to quote export figures which suit himself, and then coil up and say that it is not in the public interest to disclose other information of an unsuitable kind simply because he does not desire to give Deputies that information?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid I am responsible for the whole thing and not the Minister in question.  I gave certain statistics on the last day because I felt that the public interest would, on the whole, be better served by giving them.  That was on account of certain statements that were made. The Minister in not giving the statistics is, I think, adhering to the decision arrived at.  He would not be if he were to give them.</P>

      <P>The Drumm Battery as at present developed is, I understand, a compromise between the performance as represented by the original batteries and the standard of performance set for the company by Messrs. Edison (U.S.A.).  Efforts towards commercial exploitation of this battery have not been successful, and none of the alkaline battery manufacturers with whom contact was established have tested out the cells in final form.</P>
      <P>Capital sums advanced to the company total £146,300 and with accrued interest its indebtedness to the Minister for Finance has now reached £181,557.  Even if it were practicable to continue to spend money on the battery in anticipation of its utilisation and in anticipation of defects being remedied, the question of a supply of raw materials for commercial exploitation would be a pertinent one, and is understood to present certain difficulties.</P>
      <P>After consideration of the position of the company in all its aspects, and having informed the company that the State must not be involved in further expenditure, I was informed that the directors had before them evidence indicating that further progress towards commercial development on a satisfactory basis was not possible under war conditions.  Arrangements were subsequently made to suspend the activities of the company until conditions are favourable.  During the suspension period necessary patents will be kept alive.</P>

      <P>The applications for Unemployment Assistance of some unemployed persons who are Air Raid Wardens and who refused to accept employment in the Construction Corps have been refused on the ground that the applicants failed to fulfil one of the statutory conditions for the receipt of Unemployment Assistance.  This condition requires that an applicant shall have failed to obtain employment suitable for him having regard to his age, physique, education, normal occupation, place of residence and family circumstances.  Employment which is determined in accordance with the Unemployment Assistance Acts to be suitable for an applicant for Unemployment Assistance is not made unsuitable for him by reason of voluntary part-time service as Air Raid Warden which is not a substitute for employment and which is undertaken by both employed and unemployed persons. Unemployment Assistance cannot be paid legally to any person who fails to fulfil any of the statutory conditions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture if, in view of the likelihood that the acreage under wheat this year may not reach expectations, he will now consider the desirability of fixing an attractive guaranteed price for potatoes so as to ensure adequate supplies of this essential foodstuff, having regard to the fact that, due to shortage of artificial manures, the yield may not be up to normal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Every opportunity has been taken to make not only farmers but plotholders and owners of gardens realise the vital necessity for growing potatoes to the greatest possible extent so as to avoid the danger of food shortage.  The home demand for seed potatoes this year greatly exceeds that of other years, and I doubt whether the offer of a guaranteed price would result in any appreciable increase in the area now being devoted to this crop.  Moreover, the bulk of the potato crop grown by farmers is used on farms.</P>
      <P>The main effect of a guaranteed price would probably be to increase the cost of potatoes (i) to the poorer classes of the community who may be largely dependent on potatoes for their food in the coming year, and (ii) to those who purchase potatoes for stock-feeding purposes.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The usual practice is to carry out a veterinary examination of the animals on the premises before a movement licence is issued.  In some cases examination on the premises prior to movement is not considered necessary as, for instance, when the animals are licensed to a slaughter house where they will undergo ante-and post-mortem examination, or where the animals are located in an <Col N="931" /> area a considerable distance from an infected place, or when the circumstances indicate that the movement involves no disease risk.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Because we have not got enough veterinary surgeons to do it, so where the least risk is involved we must dispense with the veterinary surgeon going on to the farm, as for instance in the case of cattle coming into an abattoir for slaughter where they will undergo ante- and post-mortem examination, or where the animals are being brought from a farmer's farm to an out-farm a considerable distance from an infected place.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that we certainly do not think it is satisfactory, and is he not prepared to consider at least allowing individual butchers to negotiate with individual farmers to buy and sell cattle subject to a veterinary licence granted by the Department of Agriculture?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>But suppose that practice of going to the farm is prohibited? Is the Minister aware that there is a large number of farmers here with age-old associations with victuallers in this City, who normally send a postcard saying &ldquo;We want half a dozen beasts&rdquo;, and the farmer, well knowing the butchers' requirements, consigns them?  Surely, if the trade is done on that basis, subject to a veterinary permit, that is a safer arrangement than the arrangement at present operating, where there is no veterinary licence required.  Under the additional safeguard of a veterinary licence, would the Minister consider granting that concession?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>

      <P>I have recently received a number of applications for licences to export fresh meat.  Such licences may, however, be granted only in respect of premises registered in the appropriate register of slaughtering premises kept under the Agricultural Produce (Fresh Meat) Acts, 1930 to 1938, and such registration is possible only in the case of premises which comply with statutory requirements as regards structure and equipment.  Since the commencement of the recent emergency, due to the outbreak of foot and mouth disease, I have, up to now, issued four new beef exporters' permits and one new mutton exporters' permit enabling the holders to export the classes of meat covered by their permits from premises already registered. The question of the registration of suitable additional premises under the Acts, so as to afford increased facilities for the export of beef and mutton and of extending facilities for export in existing registered premises has received and will continue to receive my attention.</P>

      <P>An order was made by the Government on 29th October, 1940, to amend the Control of Imports (Quota No. 13) Order, 1935.  Prior to the making of this amendment, the importation of woollen and worsted piece goods was restricted to cloths <Col N="945" /> which were more than 12 inches in width, more than seven ounces in weight per square yard and more than 3/6 in value per square yard.  The effect of the amendment which it is now sought to confirm was to extend the existing restrictions to cloths which were more than 3/- per square yard in value.  When the original amending order was made, it was anticipated that, due to the trend of prices in Great Britain, it would be necessary to grant some relaxation of the existing quota, but, in practice, it has been found that the 3/6 extension then granted has been more than was necessary, and, in fact, more than was advisable, and, following a consultation between all the interests concerned, it has been decided to reduce the exemption from 3/6 to 3/- per square yard.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister in a position to assure us that the readymade manufacturers are now able to get a sufficiency of these cloths to keep their operatives at work, because my latest information&mdash;and I am bound to tell the House that it is not very recent information&mdash;is that very grave difficulties presented themselves in the ready-made clothing industry and in the making-up industry generally, because they could not get from the Irish mills the cloths necessary to work upon?  They attributed the scarcity of supply in their trade, partially to this order, partially to the absorption of the Irish mills in the manufacture of Army clothing and partially to the destruction of the Athlone woollen mills.  If that is true, I think the Minister ought to reconsider this situation because, God knows, there are enough people out of jobs at present without putting more out by an imprudently drawn quota order.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment 1:</P>
      <P>Before Section 9 to insert the following new section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>9.  The State mining licence granted by the Minister to the Company under the immediately preceding section of this Act shall contain such provisions as the Minister thinks necessary to ensure that the wages paid and the conditions of employment observed by the Company shall not be less favourable to the workers employed by the Company than the wages which would be paid and the conditions of employment which would be observed if the work were carried out under a contract between the Minister and the Company containing a fair wages clause similar to that for the time being contained in contracts made by Ministers and Government Departments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In our legislation so far, we have inserted a provision of this kind in the Railway Act, 1924 and the Railways Act, 1923.  We have inserted a protective clause in the Road Traffic Act, 1933, in the Housing Act, 1932 and the Housing (Labourers) Act, 1937.  We have provided for the observance of fair wages and fair conditions of employment under the Control of Manufactures Act, 1934, a provision exactly similar to that which I now seek to have inserted being embodied in that Act.  Similarly, in respect of the Cereals (Produce) Act, 1933, the Pigs <Col N="947" /> and Bacon Act, 1935, and the Tobacco Act, 1934, provision safeguarding workers in respect of wages and conditions of employment was made.  Again in the Cement Act, 1933, there was inserted a provision similar to that which I now seek to have inserted.</P>
    <P>In the Combined Purchasing Act, 1939, provisions safeguarding the workers in employments affected by that Act were inserted.  At present, sixteen industries are subject to the Trade Board Acts, 1909 and 1918.  The function of the Trade Board is to fix minimum rates of wages and maximum working hours in respect of the workers engaged in these industries.  If we are to approach the whole problem of protecting workers engaged in industries of the kind contemplated by this Bill, we can really follow a well-beaten track, because the State has made similar provision in legislation covering other industries.  Here the State is to embark on expenditure of, approximately, £100,000 in financing Slievardagh coal developments and it is not an unreasonable request that, in such circumstances, the State should insist, in the relations between those who will operate the company on behalf of the Minister and the workers whom they will employ, on a condition requiring the employers to conform to the fair wages clause already inserted in other legislation.  I hope the Minister will accept this amendment.  Its only purpose is to ensure that fair wages will be paid and that fair conditions of labour will be observed in the coalfield.  A State can hardly resist a claim of that kind.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>In this instance, there is no question of the State resisting a claim that fair wages be paid and that fair conditions of employment obtain. The instances which the Deputy has cited, where, by specific legislation, the State sought to impose upon other bodies, over which it had no immediate control, the obligation to pay fair wages and to grant fair conditions of employment, are proof of that. But we are asked in this case to go very much further than we ever went <Col N="948" /> before.  We are asked to enact legislation which would suggest that there was some possibility, or some danger, that, if it were not for this particular provision, the State would not pay fair wages and would not grant fair conditions of employment.  I think that a case has not been made for the amendment. I think that the amendment is unnecessary, particularly in view of the fact that the accounts of this company will be tabled from year to year and that, if it requires funds for the further development of the mines, it will have to come to the House.  The necessary moneys will have to be obtained by an Estimate for that specific purpose or by a sub-head in the Vote for the office of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, on which occasion, if there was any question that fair wages were not being paid or that fair conditions of employment did not obtain, the whole matter could be raised in the House. In these circumstances, the Minister responsible would be put in the unenviable position of having to justify unfair wages and unfair conditions of employment.  I suggest to the Deputy that, in all the circumstances, it is not necessary to write the sort of provision which he now proposes into the Bill, that the position is already sufficiently safeguarded.  This company, according to the terms of the Bill, will be entirely under the control of the Minister for Finance.  It will be part of the ordinary organisation of government and its activities will be subject to review in this House in a way which does not apply to the case of the activities of the other companies to which he referred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has made an excellent case for the amendment, but he made it unconsciously.  He said that, where we put a provision of this kind into legislation, we did so to impose an obligation on other people. Evidently, he thinks that it is correct to insist on everybody else being tied down by a fair wages clause while the State should not be so tied down.  I do not believe that the State is a good employer in this country.  It is a wretched, sweating employer and I do not think that anything happening in State employment can justify the belief <Col N="949" /> that the State is a kind of an American uncle in respect of its employees.  One might better trust some private employers to have a proper conception of their responsibilities to workers than one might trust the State.  We had examples in the past few months. We had private employers recognising that, owing to the increase in the cost of living, it was necessary to grant increases of wages to their employees. We had the State, which had a definite agreement with its employees, repudiating the agreement and refusing to grant increases of wages.  We had another example in the case of road workers.  Some local authorities proposed to increase the wages of road workers from 30/- to 33/- per week. The State came along and would not allow the increase, which represented only 10 per cent., while the cost of living had gone by 24 per cent.  Those sitting at the citadel of power in Merrion Street told the local authorities that, whether they spoke for the ratepayers or not, they would not allow them to grant an increase of wages to the road workers.  That is the institution we are asked to trust.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister's statements were not correct.  He knows perfectly well that the State is at present obliged to comply with the provisions of the Conditions of Employment Act.  The Minister knows perfectly well that, in respect of the industrial staff employed by the Board of Works, the Army Corps of Engineers at the Curragh camp and military centres throughout the country and the Post Office factory employees, the State puts itself in the position of a private employer in respect of conditions of employment. The Conditions of Employment Act passed this House and the State <Col N="950" /> inserted these provisions in it.  They were not inserted by way of amendment. The State voluntarily conformed to the same standard of wage-fixing and condition-fixing as was imposed on the private employer.  Here the Minister wants, for some reason, to ride out of that uniform practice.  He says: &ldquo;Do not ask me to put this into the Bill.  You will always find the State a good employer and, in any case, if I do pay low wages at the collieries you will have the privilege of kicking up a row annually when you see the balance sheet of the company.&rdquo; That is not what I want.  I want to ensure that the State will be obliged to conform to the same conditions as it imposes on private employers.</P>
    <P>It has already accepted that position in the Conditions of Employment Act, and there is no reason why the Minister at this stage should seek to break away from a pretty long-established practice. I think the Minister, even if he feels himself it is not necessary, as a gesture ought to put this section into the Bill, so as to make it clear that, so far as the State is concerned, if it prescribes a certain code of conduct for others, at least it is not above conforming to that code of conduct itself. Even from his own point of view and from the point of view of the State, I urge on the Minister that he really ought to accept the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not possibly accept the amendment which carries with it, as the Deputy's last speech has shown the implication that the State, having regard to all the interests involved treats its employees unfairly.</P>

    <P>Amendment declared lost.</P>
    <P>Sections 9 to 15 agreed to.</P>
    <P Just="Center">SECTION 16.</P>
    <P>(1) The company shall within ninety days after the end of every accounting year furnish to the Minister a balance sheet for such accounting year duly audited by the auditor of the company and also a profit and loss account for the same accounting year similarly audited.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:&mdash;</P>
      <P>At the end of sub-section (1) to insert the words &ldquo;and a report on the work carried out by the company, the condition of the undertaking and a report prepared by the auditor on the financial position of the company.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Section 16 provides that there shall be an obligation on the company to furnish a balance sheet and a profit and loss account within 90 days of the end of every accounting year.  My amendment seeks to put on the company an obligation to provide, in addition, a report on the work carried out by the company, the condition of the undertaking and a report prepared by the auditor on the financial position of the company.  I think it is essential, where we are putting up £100,000 of State money, that we should have from this undertaking something more than an ordinary balance sheet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The balance sheet of the ordinary company, as those who have read them know, is not a very informative document.  It may, of course, suit the directors of a certain kind of public company, with its limited number of shareholders, to give just the minimum amount of information required by the law as to the financial affairs of the company and its activities generally. But, here we are dealing with a public company financed by State money, a company concerned with the development of coal deposits.  I think that, in the circumstances, it is not unreasonable to ask that the Company should give us a report on the work <Col N="953" /> carried out by it, and on the condition of the undertaking.  In respect to the Electricity Supply Board provision is made for a report of the kind which is sought in this amendment.  There is an informative report from the Electricity Supply Board with regard to its activities, its projected programme of work, and, generally, one can get from the report a comprehensive picture of the undertaking: as to the nature of its work, and as to what it intends to do in the future. But, after this Bill is passed, a Bill under which we are giving the Minister power to advance £100,000 to the company we will get nothing from the company except an annual statement of accounts and a profit and loss account.  We will get no picture from it as to the policy it is pursuing, as to the condition of the undertaking, and as to what objective the company is working towards.  The amendment, I submit, is not seeking to put any unreasonable requirement on the company, and I hope the Minister will be able to indicate that he is prepared to accept it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me that this amendment is unnecessary.  The terms of the section provide for the presentation, after every accounting year, of the balance sheet of the company, duly audited by the auditor of the company, together with the profit and loss account, similarly audited.  It is prescribed, in sub-section (2), that the balance sheet shall contain a summary of the capital assets and liabilities of the company, together with such particulars as will disclose the nature of such assets and liabilities and the manner in which the value of the assets was arrived at.  I cannot see that an auditor could furnish a report that would be likely to be of any greater value to this House than that which will contain the particulars to be furnished by him under sub-section (2) of this section.  I should not attach very much importance or value to a report on coal mining which was prepared by an auditor, who would not be a technical expert, and who, naturally, would have to confine himself to the accountancy aspect of the undertaking. <Col N="954" /> That position is very fully covered by the terms of the present section, and I do not think there is any necessity to go beyond it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyLinehan" hpid="Mr. Linehan Mr. Linehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Linehan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister seems to think that under this amendment the auditor will prepare the report asked for.  The amendment does not ask any such thing.  I should like to point out that under sub-section (2) the balance sheet and the profit and loss account shall be drawn up in such a manner as the Minister shall direct, and shall contain a summary of the capital assets, and so on.  That does not give any of the information which is being asked for in the amendment.  It asks for a report on the work carried out by the company, the condition of the undertaking, and so on.  I agree with Deputy Norton that, unless one is an expert, one will be able to obtain very little information from the balance sheet issued by the ordinary company.  This undertaking is to be financed by money provided by the State, and, therefore, the information asked for in the amendment should be given.  I do not see why the Minister should object to an expert giving a report to this House on the nature of the work carried out by the company.</P>

      <P>That no useful purpose would be served.  It seems to me that it would be doubly inadvisable to accept the amendment because it is clear now that there could be a difference of opinion as to the interpretation of it.  I do not think it is necessary to carry that elsewhere.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">

      <P>It would be much better, I think, if the Minister would spend a little time trying to understand the amendment instead of concentrating all his time in trying to find a flippant reason for rejecting it.  The object of the amendment is perfectly <Col N="955" /> clear&mdash;to put upon the company the obligation to tell this House, to tell the Minister, and the taxpayers who are putting up this £100,000, what, in fact, they are doing in the exploitation of these coal deposits.  Surely what is a reasonable requirement to impose on the Electricity Supply Board is not an unreasonable requirement to impose in connection with a development scheme of this kind.  The obligation in respect of the Electricity Supply Board is a very burdensome one, but it is one for which they charge enough.  If we can ask a national undertaking of that kind to subject themselves to this undertaking, with all that it involves from the point of view of toil in complying with it, what is the difficulty in asking an undertaking of this kind to give us a reasonably brief report as to what it did during the previous 12 months, what in fact is the position of the company at the moment, and what it proposes to do during the ensuing 12 months?  The Minister says it is not necessary to ask the company to do that, and he proceeds to quote subsections 1 and 2, which have nothing whatever to do with the preparation of a report.  Sub-section 2 gives the Minister power to ask the company to compile a balance sheet in a certain way.  The preparation of a balance sheet in a certain way will not enable them to put a report into that balance sheet.  If the report comes, it will have to be a separate report.  If it is desirable to get a report, why not put an obligation on the company as provided for in this amendment?  It looks to me as if the Minister wants to get State money for the purpose of investing in this development, but he will not now ensure that the workers will get fair wages, and he apparently wants to screen the activities of the company from the public gaze.  We are not going to get any information whatever except a balance sheet which would fit on a sheet of foolscap paper.  That is all we are going to get in return for £100,000 of State money.  I think it is a most unfair attitude for the Minister to adopt in this matter.  There is no reason whatever why the Minister should refuse to accept an amendment <Col N="956" /> of this kind, unless he wants to keep the activities of the company as dark as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the first company of this kind which has been formed with the taxpayers' money for the purposes of developing our mineral resources, and I am pretty certain that the people of the country as a whole will follow the activities of this company very closely, not alone for the purpose of finding out whether their money is being properly spent but for the purpose of finding out whether the company is so successfully conducted as to justify experiments of the same kind being carried out in other places and in other cases.  The Minister, while acting on behalf of the taxpayers, will have at his disposal, through his nominees on the Board and through his authority as Minister, many ways and means of getting information and getting explanations of what is contained in the balance sheet, which will not be available to members of this House who receive the balance sheet nor to members of the public at large.  I am pretty sure that the Minister for Industry and Commerce will be in constant consultation with his nominees on this Board, and through that channel will be able to check the activities of the Board, and to hold them up in any case where he thinks they are travelling in a wrong direction.  The representatives of the people in this House are entitled to just the same information as the Minister is entitled to in matters of this kind.  The Minister knows better than anybody else that balance sheets can be framed in such a way as to mislead the most intelligent-minded financier in the country.  I wonder whether Deputy Dockrell, for instance, if he were encouraging the members of the Chamber of Commerce or the commercially-minded people of the country to invest their money in a concern of this kind, would say that they should be satisfied with the production of a balance sheet submitted in accordance with the wishes of the Minister, without having the right, as they have not in this case, to go to an annual meeting for the purpose of asking questions and getting explanations <Col N="957" /> of what might not be clearly set out in a dictated balance sheet?  If the Minister wants to induce the taxpayers of the country to take an intelligent interest in the conduct of a concern which is being set up with their own money, I think he should, if he is, as I believe he is, interested in the development of the mineral resources of the country, comply with the reasonable request contained in Deputy Norton's amendment and agree to accept that amendment.  He will be serving the public interest if he agrees to do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>If it be correct that I have misinterpreted this amendment, the necessity for it becomes less clear than ever, because I gather that the company is to make a report upon its activities.  But it is not necessary that we should have an Act of Parliament to secure such a report from the company. The company, under Section 9, is to be financed out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas.  Before the Minister comes to the Oireachtas and asks for money for this company he will certainly obtain a very full report as to its activities, and if there is any information wanted by the House on that occasion I have no doubt that it will be readily forthcoming.  I cannot see what useful purpose is going to be served by asking the company to make a report to the Minister.  Mind you, if this had been the report of an independent person, then perhaps Deputy Norton and Deputy Davin might have been able to make a case for it.  I do not say that it would be an unanswerable case but, at any rate, it would be a specious case; it would bear the appearance of reality upon it.  It was because I thought the only thing Deputies had in mind must have been the report of such an independent person that I read the amendment in what appeared to be a reasonable way, in what is still in my view the only way in which it can be read, that is that the auditor would have to make the report.  If this report is going to be made by the company, then it seems to me that the amendment is unnecessary, because the relations between the company, the Minister for Industry <Col N="958" /> and Commerce, the Minister for Finance and this House, are such that the fullest information must always be made available to the Minister and through the Minister to this House whenever it is required.  The company cannot carry on unless the moneys are voted by the House, and, when the House is asked for the money, no doubt it will ensure that everything there is to be known about the activities of this company will be duly put before it.</P>

      <P>I think the Minister has just given the case away.  He said it is only reasonable that before the House would vote the moneys it should be aware of the activities of the company.  We are now voting this sum of money without being aware of any such activities, except simply that a coal mine is to be opened up.  I think that the Minister, considering his decided views as to the activities of other companies, should insist upon this company just doing exactly what he wants other companies to do.  He has been very vocal upon the railway company recently in correspondence.  Surely to goodness he should ask that a company which is being voted moneys by this House should do what a private company in the State is already doing.</P>

      <P>The Minister seems to me to be floundering about in an endeavour to find some reason for rejecting this amendment.  One would imagine that the relationship between the Minister and the company is going to be such that the Minister has only to whisper that he wants full information, whereupon it will be provided for him.  In Section 16 (5) he takes power to fine the directors £5 for every day during which they delay in sending him the balance sheet.  The Minister asks: &ldquo;Why do you wish to put an obligation on the company to produce a report of this kind?&rdquo; One could well ask him: &ldquo;Why are you taking powers to treat the directors as such miscreants that you feel obliged to take power to fine them £5 for every day during which they fail to send the balance sheet?&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="959" /> What this amendment seeks to obtain is definite information as to what work the company is doing during the period when it is spending this money.  If we put up £100,000 we will not have an opportunity, under the present arrangement, of ascertaining what is happening in respect to the company until we see the balance sheet perhaps a year and a half afterwards, or until the Minister comes here to look for more money.  I should like to follow the activities of this company annually, and it is for that reason that I suggest that there should be an obligation on the company to furnish a report.  The Minister tells us that we will be able to get information from the company.  We have put questions to the Minister for Industry and Commerce with regard to the sugar company, and the Minister has declined to give us information as to the activities of that company in certain respects. We tried to get information also about the Peat Development Board and it was not given to us.</P>

I want the Minister to put into the Bill a provision which will place on the company an <Col N="960" /> obligation to tell us what is being done each year.  The Minister says that he thought we required a report from some independent person.  The only one who has suspicions about the slothfulness of the directors is the Minister.  The only one who has doubts about their <i>bona fides</i> is the Minister.  He expresses that in Section 16.  What we want is the type of report which would be presented by any company to its shareholders.  The Minister is the shareholder in this instance, acting for the taxpayers, who have put up £100,000.  The taxpayers are entitled to know what the directors are doing with the money.  That is the issue.  These directors will get £100,000 of the taxpayers' money and, as representing the taxpayers, we ask that they should be told annually what is happening to their money and what the directors are doing.  We want to know something of their position, just the same as with any other commercial undertaking.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Linehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like the Minister to explain what is meant by sub-section 3 in somewhat briefer manner than is set out in the sub-section. Where a county council initiates a scheme, they will estimate the cost of carrying out that scheme and will be entitled to apportion it amongst the people to whom the money was lent in such proportions as they think fit.  That apportionment will be added to the <Col N="964" /> original debt and will be legally recoverable by the county council. Assuming that a county council decides to initiate a large scheme, the administrative and clerical side of which entails considerable expenditure, and that only three or four persons avail of the scheme, will the county council be entitled to impose upon these people the entire cost of administration?  The sub-section seems to give the county council what I may call an illegal power.  If the cost of administration ran into a large amount and the number of people who availed of the scheme was very small, the county council would be entitled to apportion the cost amongst that small number. Could the county council apportion the cost and expenses unequally?  Once they have ascertained their costs and expenses, there would seem to be no restriction on them as regards apportionment. Assuming that the cost was £100, could the county council charge £90 to one person and the remainder to the others who had borrowed the same amount?  They are entitled under the Bill to create a debt which was not in existence when the borrower originally obtained the money and which he did not contemplate paying. If the Minister can assure us that the expenses will be a small matter and that the county council will have to observe a certain degree of proportion as regards the apportionments, there will be less objection to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>The section gives the county council a discretion as regards the apportionment.  The Deputy need not be worried about the expense.  The expense is very small, as members of county councils with experience of these schemes know.  The work is carried out by the officials of the county councils, under the supervision of the secretary, and I do not think much extra remuneration is paid. The cost has been almost infinitesimal having regard to the number of people involved.  The apportionment of expenses may be based on what the person receives.  It is much better to have the provision worded in this loose way because it gives the county council discretion in the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TimothyLinehan" hpid="Mr. Linehan Mr. Linehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Linehan</NameTxt>
      <P>The discretion may be useful to the county council because they could apportion the cost amongst the people likely to pay.  Assuming the issue of £10 each to 100 people, they might discover that 50 of them would pay readily and that 50 others were doubtful.  It would be good business for a county council to impose the cost on the 50 who were good payers.  It is, I think, a bad principle to impose upon a person a liability which he is not aware of when borrowing.  Even if only a penny were added in that way to the loan, I think it is a bad principle both in law and equity.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Broderick Mr. Broderick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broderick</NameTxt>
      <P>Formerly, we had a clause in our legislation which made the State liable for 50 per cent. of any loss incurred in the administration of the scheme.  That was withdrawn last year.  There may be sufficient reasons for that course.  Up to last year, this scheme could be regarded as a local advantage.  The local council was facilitating its ratepayers in paying their rates and bringing their land into adoption.  In the circumstances of to-day, that line of reasoning does not hold.  To-day, we are asked for an intensive campaign of food production in the interests of the State.  The county councils have co-operated in that campaign to an intensive degree.  What was denied when this scheme was merely of local application, cannot be justified when the State is demanding co-operation to an extraordinarily intensive degree.  To show how intensive that co-operation is, take the case of Cork which, last year, produced one-fifth of the wheat of the entire State.  We gave out £1,400 to, approximately, 189 persons to buy seeds.  This year, the number will be over 1,100, so that the liability of the county council will be very heavy.  That liability is not incurred on behalf of that local area but in the interests of the entire State, and the State ought to bear responsibility for portion of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We held the view that, in the circumstances of to-day, the greatest liability we could have would be land suitable for the production of food supplies lying idle.  Holding that view, we took risks on behalf of the State, and so did every other council, that in normal times would not be justified. Even our labourers, so far as they <Col N="967" /> could, have co-operated and we have provided a great number of them with seeds.  In rural areas the difficulties of those on Unemployment Assistance will be increased owing to the operation of the Employment Period Order, and any liability they may incur for these seeds can be recovered by an increase of their rates.  There are, therefore, three points to be taken into consideration: (1) the danger of liabilities which we have incurred, not on behalf of the local areas, but on behalf of the State; (2) that the greatest liability to this State is land capable of producing food supplies being left idle for want of seed and that we have taken the risk of supplying that seed; (3) in the particular position in which the labourers find themselves, it is hard to expect them to face the liability of repaying that money which can be collected from them by an increase in their rates. Taking these three points into consideration, I hope I have convinced the Minister that the risks taken are risks on behalf of the State and that the State ought to accept at least 50 per cent. of the liability.</P>

      <P>Deputy Broderick has stated that in the case of two councils the number of applications has been out of all proportion to those received last year.  That is due to the scarcity of seeds this year.  When the Bill was last before the House, I inquired if the Minister would ask the Minister for Agriculture to look into the question of the availability of seeds.  As there may not be a further opportunity of doing so, I now ask the Minister, in the interest of having the Bill properly operated, if he will tell the Minister for Agriculture that seed firms in England have notified their customers here that they have certain types of seed available, that the British Government have withdrawn the licences to export, and that neither the British Government nor the Éire Government appear to be doing anything about the matter. The only people who are attempting to do anything about it are the English seed merchants, who are very anxious to send seeds here.</P>

      <P>That the Dáil is of opinion that the development of orderly local administration in the City and County of Dublin requires that the Government should not lose further time in announcing its decisions as to the recommendations of the Local Government (Dublin) Tribunal, whose report was presented and published more than two years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not propose to take up much of the time of the House in the consideration of this motion, because to my mind the terms of the motion are axiomatic.  But, here is a report which was presented as long ago as November, 1938, and it deals with matters vitally affecting some 500,000 people.  Yet, it has been allowed to lie there without any decision of the Government on its various proposals. The position is actually even worse than that, because not only has it been allowed to lie there without a decision, but, in the meantime, four Bills, three of which are now Acts, have been introduced affecting the system of local government in the area covered by the report of the tribunal.  Yet no hint has been given by the Government of their decision on this report.  It may be argued that these Bills themselves constitute the decision of the Government on this report.  But surely nobody would suggest that the ridiculous position which will shortly arise of the city manager sitting in one building as such, and shortly sitting in another building as County Manager, with two different sets of officials possibly tendering him differing advice, and two councils to deal with, is one which can be regarded as a proper answer to the recommendation of the tribunal <Col N="970" /> that a single metropolitan council should be established for the area in place of the four existing authorities? A decision on this matter would surely lead to the orderly local administration envisaged in the motion.</P>
    <P>From a town planning point of view, a decision on the various matters in the report would also be of very great help.  It may be well to know what the consultants, in making their report on this matter say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In making our proposals we have, since the publication of the Greater Dublin Tribunal's Report, constantly borne that report in mind....</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Briefly, our green belt and the area of County Dublin to the north of that correspond to the North and South Dublin rural areas of the tribunal, while our central urban area (with free entry and deferred development land) corresponds with the tribunal's metropolitan area as distinct from the rural areas...</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We are satisfied that the present boundary is utterly inadequate, and consider, therefore, that the future boundary and, in fact, the whole question of administration, is one which should be considered in the light of the findings of the tribunal and of our report jointly.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>One of the tribunal's recommendations is that there should be appointed a metropolitan planning director who would be responsible for the planning of the entire area, in place of a system of each authority dealing with its own area, sometimes in agreement with adjoining ones and sometimes in conflict with them.  The Minister may say that under the Town and Regional Planning Acts, the Dublin Corporation has power to constitute itself a planning authority for the whole area. While that is perfectly correct, the corporation has considered the matter on occasion, but so far it has been reluctant to impose itself on other authorities pending some decision by the Government on this report.</P>
    <P>This motion is not either in favour of, or against, the findings of the tribunal, but is merely an expression of <Col N="971" /> opinion that the Government should, by now, have been able to make up their minds on the various recommendations in that report, as to whether they are to be implemented or not, and that the orderly administration of local government calls for a decision on that report, one way or the other.  The tribunal, in paragraph 481 of their report, say:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We consider it essential to the new departure in municipal outlook that the reorganised administration should be initiated by the adoption of definite plans to which the heads of services should work and the progress of which should be closely supervised by the metropolitan manager.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Possibly some of the present authorities would prepare the plans envisaged in that recommendation if they were given an inkling of what the Government's decision on this report is going to be.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>In rising to second this motion, I wish to call attention to the dual proposals that have been presented to the Government.  So far as one can ascertain, no decision on them has been arrived at.  If the Government can be accused of having shelved coming to a decision on this problem it is not, I think, the first time that such an accusation could be made against them when faced with other problems.  I desire to refer to some of the difficulties that will arise in the present situation.  If the Local Government (Amendment) Bill be included, I think it can be said that five legislative measures have been presented to this House dealing with the question.  While some of those measures were fiercely controversial, it can hardly be denied that the Government were right in envisaging the position that, as regards Greater Dublin, there was a problem there which had to be solved.  I should like to refer to these five legislative measures.  There is the Local Government Bill at present held up.  It contains, I think, 84 sections.  It enables the Minister for Local Government, <Col N="972" /> with the approval of other Ministers, to alter the constitution of local bodies. There is the Local Government (Amendment) Act which brought in Howth.  There was the Public Assistance Act, excluding the Dublin metropolitan area, and bringing in the Dublin, Rathdown and Balrothery Board of Guardians.  Next we had the County Management Act.  There was to be a city and a county manager with authority for Dublin, Rathdown and Balrothery&mdash;the city borough, Dun Laoghaire, county council, and the urban district of Howth.  Then we had another Bill dealing with unemployment relief works.  It compelled the public bodies in Dublin, Dun Laoghaire, Howth and the county council to execute relief works.</P>
      <P>As opposed to all these, you have the report of the Greater Dublin Tribunal.  Under this Dublin was to have a metropolitan council, a financial and planning authority to work out its own salvation instead of being controlled by the Local Government Department.  There was to be a metropolitan manager, with assistants, to work with the council, centralising the professional staffs working under different bodies and different areas under one head.  With all these recommendations, something will have to be done.  I suggest to the Government that it would be almost better to make some mistakes and get ahead with the job than to leave all this for some future date when it will have to be done badly and in a hurry.  Some of us envisage a post-war period which will be just as difficult to control as the times we are passing through, if indeed they are not worse.  As far as one can see, what is going to happen when we pass into that post-war period is that all these administrative proposals and plans will have to be gone into.  They will have to be passed first, and then schemes under them will have to be worked out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said earlier, the five legislative measures dealing with this problem, which the Government have put before the House, are controversial.  Nobody will deny that something ought to be done, and ought to be done quickly. The question is &ldquo;what ought to be <Col N="973" /> done?&rdquo; Something ought to be done quickly, because there is no doubt that the corporation and the other bodies are at present working, if one might so describe it, under sentence of death. The officials there do not know whether they will be transferred to some other branch or left to manage the affairs of their own section.  There is at present a lull in a whole lot of operations, and I would like to urge on the Minister and the Government that this is a very desirable time to go into this whole thorny and difficult question and arrive at a decision, in order that we may be prepared to face measures which will have to come in the near future.  A series of anomalies and difficulties has grown up, and I think in a lot of cases the bodies concerned are acting on the assumption that some change is coming.  Let us take the corporation by-laws as only one instance.  Some wag I think has said that you could never get a plan passed by the corporation only the corporation themselves realise that they have to break their own bye-laws. There are other anomalies which arise with regard to home assistance and poor law administration.  I do not want to make a long speech, and I will not go into any merits or demerits except in the most casual and passing way. I want to keep to the big, broad main issue, that the Bills which the Government have brought before the House are running on parallel lines with the Greater Dublin Tribunal Report, that some day those Acts and reports will have to be tuned down, and the Government have to make up their minds what they ought to do.  As a last word, I would suggest to the Minister and the Government that the sooner they do that the better.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasKelly" hpid="Mr. T. Kelly Mr. T. Kelly">

      <P>This motion reads:</P>
      <P>That the Dáil is of opinion that the development of orderly local administration in the City and County of Dublin requires that the Government should not lose further time in announcing its decisions as to the recommendations of the Local Government (Dublin) Tribunal, whose report was presented and published more than two years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="974" /> They did make a decision here some time ago.  I wonder whether Deputy Dockrell and Deputy Benson want other decisions of the same sort, because certainly I, as a member of the corporation, do not.  The recent decision I speak about is the incorporation of the Township of Howth in the City of Dublin.  That was done here by Act of Parliament, and, before the corporation had even considered it, it was an accomplished fact.  I asked the city manager to let us have a report as to this new township, because, from my long experience of the incorporation of other townships in the old city, I knew what it meant. Here is what he says about Howth: &ldquo;The following information concerning the Howth Urban District Council affairs has come from details furnished by the acting town clerk.&rdquo;  He goes on to tell us the area in acres, and he tells us that the gross valuation is £27,000 odd.  I am not going to go into all the details; I will speak as generally as I can.  He then tells us that the amount of the outstanding loans in this township is £57,396.  The bank overdraft, he tells us, is £1,706. The council receives from 25 borrowers under the small dwellings Act a yearly amount of £1,200, and the arrears for the year amount to £590, that is about 50 per cent.  The housing rental is £1,810, and the arrears at 31st March were £515, or nearly 50 per cent.  We are told that the whole water supply system requires expert investigation. We know what that means.  It meant in regard to Rathmines, that wealthy township, an expenditure of over £30,000 to put the waterworks into a proper condition, because the filtering had been out of order for years, and the people in Rathmines had been drinking black stone as well as water so far as one could ascertain.  We are told further that the sewerage and drainage need a general overhauling, and that the scavenging, which costs £650, needs improvement.</P>
    <P>There are 22 miles of roadway in the charge of the council, costing £1,800, and except for Government grants the provision for roads in the past five years was inadequate.  The graveyards of Kilbarrack and St. Fintan's cost <Col N="975" /> £272 yearly, and the revenue is £217. The latter is in very bad repair.  There are 196 street lamps, and those are maintained by the Electricity Supply Board at a yearly cost of £615.  The fire brigade is a volunteer service, and the equipment is a Merryweather trailer pump.  A sum of 10/- per week is paid to a man for caring the pump, and £18 per annum is paid for its storage.  The council has no local hospital, and pays for cases sent to city hospitals.  A town planning scheme, envisaged in 1935 was not proceeded with.  We are then told what the staff of the council consists of, and we are told that the council has no law agent, and is compelled to employ different solicitors as the occasion warrants.</P>
    <P>That is our experience of the first instalment of the town planning arrangement. This is a very serious thing for us.  I am looking at this matter from the point of view of my experience in the Dublin Corporation for 40 years, and I think it requires very serious consideration by the Government.  Not merely yesterday or a week or a year ago, but years ago, I came to the conclusion that Dublin is over populated.</P>
    <P>We cannot keep poverty out of the city to the extent we would like, and at the same time contain the immense population that is now in the city.  I entered the corporation in 1899.  The population of the city&mdash;I will give official figures&mdash;was 290,638 in 1901.  In 1911 it had gone up to 304,802.  In 1936 the figure was 468,103; in 1939, the last official figure we have here, it was 482,300 people.  The estimated figure now is over 500,000.  That means that since 1916 the population has gone up by 130,000.  Just imagine an immense population like that!</P>

      <P>There were several extensions.  The first extension occurred many years ago.  It was an effort to bring in most of the townships&mdash; Drumcondra, Clontarf, Kilmainham, Pembroke and Rathmines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasKelly" hpid="Mr. T. Kelly Mr. T. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>It was, but it was supposed to be necessary at the time. There was just completed a very extensive contract for main drainage, because the drainage of the city was very bad.  Very large sums of money were spent within the four or five preceding years.  I remember that when I mentioned the Dublin housing position I was told how necessary it was to get further land, and one of the reasons for the proposed extension into five or six townships was in order to get suitable land on which to build. At the time the congestion within the old city was becoming acute.  They went in for the extensions I have mentioned, but they failed in connection with Rathmines and Pembroke. They got the extension over the three other townships.  It required an enormous outlay.  In some cases there was no water supply; in other cases there was no sewerage, and the cost was so much that the rates went up then and they never came down since.  That is the history in connection with the extension to Kilmainham, Drumcondra and Clontarf.  Clontarf was a slobland.  For generations there was a big slob of 60 acres at Fairview, where there is now a park.  They had to put down new sewerage and a water supply, and instead of building houses that is what the money went towards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Later on, when our own Government was established here, Rathmines and Pembroke were brought in.  Pembroke had a big overdraft and in Rathmines we had to spend between £30,000 and £40,000 in fixing up the waterworks. Now we are saddled with Howth, and goodness knows how much more land has to be brought in under the town planning scheme.  So far as Dun Laoghaire is concerned, I do not know much about the hinterland there; I do not know whether there is a proper sewerage or a proper water supply. <Col N="977" /> With the population that we now have, I think the Government will have to consider&mdash;it may be a rather novel idea &mdash;the question of managing Dublin in the same way as the great capital of America, Washington, is managed. That is, that the Government should take it over.</P>
    <P>Where are we going to find accommodation for the people who are coming in here every week?  Just imagine the enormous increase in the inhabitants of the city within such a short time.  I do not object to people coming here.  I like to see the country people coming in.  Always on a Sunday when there are big matches I like to go through the streets; I travel the whole of them down to Jones's Road and I love to be looking at the splendid young men and women.  I am not one of those who would erect gates to keep them out; but the fact is that those people come in and, if they wish to live here, proper arrangements must be made for their accommodation.  They must not be allowed to get into the slums or to idle around the streets. That is the enormous difficulty that exists here and nobody seems to mind it.  The population is too big and we are not able to support it.  This is Dublin's flag day.  It is very seldom that Dublin is discussed here, although it is the capital of Ireland.  Possibly the reason for that is that there are very few Dublin men here.</P>

So far as the rates are concerned, we find that the rates in 1915 were 10/8 and last year they reached 20/8.  In 1901 the debt was £1,876,887 and the debt now is £9,775,194 16s. Od.</P>

      <P>It was issued in 1939. Time after time I have heard reference here to the flight from the land.  How often has it been alluded to here? <Col N="978" /> Where do they fly to?  Have not a lot of them come up to Dublin and got good employment here and can you blame them?  They are offered a few shillings a week in the country, whereas they get fairly good jobs here and good wages.  We hear a lot about poverty, but I picked some advertisements out of the <i>Evening Herald</i> within the last month and they show quite a different picture.  The advertisements mention the Westmeath Men's Association, Ceilidhe and Old-Time Waltzes; the Cavan Men's Social Association, Ceilidhe and Old-Time Waltzes; the Kildare Men's Ceilidhe and Old-Time Waltzes; the Meath Men's Association, Ceilidhe and Old-Time Waltzes; the Royal Meath Association&mdash;evidently there are two organisations from that county&mdash; Ceilidhe and Old-Time Waltzes, and then we have the Boys of Kilkenny, with their Old-Time Waltzes and Ceilidhe.  All these associations have their &ldquo;Waltz me around again, Willie&rdquo; every Saturday night.  Here is where they are flying to and there is no sign of poverty in these announcements.</P>

      <P>I listen to the broadcast messages very often, and in that connection one must make allowance for the fact that these are specially made by people who are in the habit of making speeches for charitable objects. The words come quite naturally to them, but as to grinding horrible poverty which some people seek to suggest exists, it does not exist.  There is, however, too much poverty here, and especially in a capital city, but can it be otherwise when we have such an enormous population, which has doubled within the last 30 years?  We were not able to provide housing accommodation for these people.  We have done our best and we have made great progress, but the progress would require to be twice as great.  Even if people get work when they come up here, it does not help them to have to live in slum conditions.  There is something about slum life which, in a sense, degrades people.  When they have decent dwellings, they are a different people altogether and they remain a different people.  I am speaking now of something that is well known, but in these announcements to which I have referred there is not evidence of the great poverty which is supposed to exist in Dublin, but quite the opposite.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We hear a lot about the flight from the land and about the emigrant ship. The &ldquo;emigrant ship&rdquo; is the bus or the train, or a lift on a canal boat.  We have all this sighing and sobbing about the terrible flight from the land, but when you examine the whole thing carefully you find that there is too much hypocrisy about it.  I am acquainted with the people of Dublin all my life and I would not, especially here in the Parliament, attempt to put forward any position but that which I believe to be the correct position, and, as I have said, the Government will have to do something in connection with this matter because if young men <Col N="980" /> and women are to come up here&mdash;and they are welcome&mdash;this must be made a capital in the same sense as the great city I alluded to before.</P>
    <P>I thought that I would take advantage of this motion about town planning and the bringing into operation of the recommendations of this tribunal to make these remarks.  The recommendations already brought into effect are enough for me.  I do not want any more, but when this war is over&mdash;and, please God, it will be soon, although it does not look as if it will&mdash; I think the Government, and especially the Minister in charge of local government, ought to consider putting Dublin on a different footing altogether from a local government point of view.  Provision must be made for these people who will continue to come up from the country to enable them to get proper accommodation, the slums must be abolished for ever, and the money to do it must be supplied from funds other than those contributed by ratepayers and citizens. I have already taken up too much time and we have to face four hours' speeches from another side of the House.  I hope I have not exhausted the patience of the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to say much on this motion, but I want to say that the local bodies in the county have not been in favour of the Greater Dublin Tribunal's recommendations.  I am a member of the three bodies administering local government in the City and County of Dublin, and all three are not in favour of its recommendations. <Col N="981" /> For that reason, I could not support the motion, because when you have a commission making recommendations cutting across what experience has taught administrators in the three local bodies, you have a situation which has to be considered and which should not be rushed.  Experience has taught the Dublin Corporation that to administer outstretching arms is very expensive, and we are very much against the inclusion of Howth.  We are very much against the inclusion of any further portions of the county area and that was the evidence first tendered by the Dublin Corporation representatives to this tribunal.  A hint was passed around that the Government wished that some of the county area should be brought into the city, that it was necessary that some part should be brought in, and that we should select the areas.  A selection was made of portion of the county area which was completely built on and urbanised.  We had 1,800 acres in the present city undeveloped and the ex-city manager, from his experience as an official of 30 or 40 years, and he was a very keen man, was dead against the inclusion of any more undeveloped land within the city area.  There was an Act, of which I cannot remember the title, passed here under which I give either the present Minister or his predecessor full marks for very definitely getting in a blow which has more or less put into operation the machinery recommended by the tribunal, and, as a member of the local bodies, with some long experience, I do not agree with the proposer and seconder of the motion that there is going to be chaos. That cannot be so because, fundamentally, the administration in Dublin City and in the Borough of Dun Laoghaire will not be changed even if the recommendations of the tribunal are accepted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>You have there a borough manager and a city manager who have at present full administrative powers.  It is a rather anomalous position to have these two working side by side with Dublin County Council, which still has substantial administrative powers.  I suppose their turn will have to await <Col N="982" /> the general application of the new Act to the whole country.  That is really another matter and does not touch upon the point of this motion.  The point of the motion is the hurrying up of the new administration on the lines of the recommendations of the tribunal. I do not think it should be hurried, because you have strong opinion against the recommendations. You have opinion against the recommendations that favour the managerial system.  It is not a question of the principle of the system you are going to apply so much as the mentality of the rural and urban peoples with whom you will be dealing.  I do not think that should be hurried and, in the present emergency, I do not think it should be taken in hands at all.  We are surrounded by war, and this is not a time when we should sit back complacently and start adopting new principles in local administration. It will be terribly expensive.  Howth is a classical example.  Only a few yards of neck connect Howth with Dublin, and it will be hard to manage Howth and very expensive to maintain the services there.  Deputy Kelly's figures were very interesting.  It would seem from the way he presented the figures that a certain area called the City of Dublin increased in population from 290,000 in 1901, to 582,000 in 1939. That is not what happened.  I doubt if the city that had 290,000 in 1901, has any more to-day.  What has happened is: the area has been increased and rural districts have been built upon. The added population of Dublin in the past 30 or 40 years consists of the additional population on the added areas.</P>

      <P>I submit that pretty well the whole increase is accounted for by the added areas.  To see that, all you have to do is to look at Glasnevin, Drumcondra, and other districts around the city.  A lot of the advance in the way of town planning brings these bodies closely together in matters such as water, sewerage and drainage.  I know that harmonious co-operation has proceeded between the Borough of Dun Laoghaire, Dublin Corporation, and the Board of Health, whose social services bring them into close contact with the city and borough.  The proposer of this motion has done a service by calling attention to the matter, but I think it should be left there, because it brings up a terrible problem.  I am sure the Local Government Department realise the difficulties.  I have close knowledge of the administration of Dublin County Council, Dublin Board of Health, the Borough Council of Dun Laoghaire, and Dublin Corporation, and my strong opinion is that we should move very slowly.  I do not think that anything more should be done in the matter until after the war.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. Ruttledge)</NameTxt>
      <P>The discussion we had on this motion indicates the difficulties of the problem, and shows that it is one with which we must proceed very slowly.  The recommendations of the Greater Dublin Tribunal were not only comprehensive but far-reaching. In their report, they stated that these recommendations should not be put into operation except under the most auspicious conditions.  When one considers how far-reaching and comprehensive the recommendations are, one realises the wisdom of the advice that they should be given effect only under the most auspicious conditions.  Let us see what the recommendations were, so that we may glean the size of the problem from them.  Briefly, the recommendations were:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(1) The constitution of a new authority to take the places of the five authorities, Dublin City Council, <Col N="984" /> Dublin County Council, Dun Laoghaire Borough Council, Howth Urban Council, and Balbriggan Town Commissioners.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(2) Division of the whole area of city and county into two portions: (a) urban and (b) rural.  About one-third of the existing rural areas would be added to the existing city and urban areas.  This would involve the transfer of about 50,000 of the population, leaving only 24,031 in the remaining rural areas.  The valuation transferred from the existing rural areas would be £238,000, leaving £141,000 in the remaining rural areas.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(3) Certain services would become common services and the remaining services would be either special urban services in the new urban area or local services in the rural areas. Roads would be the most important of the common services.  Special urban services would include housing, water, sewerage, scavenging, lighting and home assistance.  The special urban services would be conducted on the full standards applicable to county boroughs.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(4)  There would be a common rate and, in addition, urban and rural rates in the respective areas.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(5) The whole area, urban and rural, would be administered by one body to be called the Dublin Metropolitan Council.  This council would have associated with them in the administration a manager, a deputy manager and four <i>ex-office</i> assistant managers, and would appoint a finance committee and four special committees, namely, health, planning, works and housing.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>During the period that that tribunal was sitting a considerable body of evidence was put before them and the tribunal reported in 1938.  Certain consideration was given to that report and a certain examination was being carried out in the Department of Local Government.  Then we had the outbreak of the war.  While that examination can go on and consideration be given to the problems that this Greater <Col N="985" /> Dublin would create if you were to adopt the recommendations of the tribunal in part or in whole, one must bear in mind that a war period is not the best time for that, and certainly I do not think it would fit in with the recommendation of the tribunal itself that this report should be put into operation under the most auspicious conditions. In addition, neither the county council nor the corporation have asked that the recommendations should be implemented; in fact, none of the local bodies affected except Howth asked that the recommendations should be implemented.</P>
    <P>It is true that the County Management Act, so far as Dublin county and city are concerned, goes perhaps on parallel lines with what was visualised in the recommendations of the tribunal. It certainly does not run counter to them, and might be described as being in consonance with those recommendations. Under the County Management Act, the city manager of Dublin will become manager also for the county so that there can be, at any rate, the fullest co-operation between the two bodies.  If, at some time, it were decided by the Oireachtas to carry out the recommendations of that tribunal, the machinery of that Act will be there in any case.</P>
    <P>The Local Government (Amendment) Bill of 1940, which brought the urban district of Howth into Dublin, was also, perhaps, somewhat in line with what was contemplated, but in a much bigger way of course, with regard to the extension of the city in the recommendations of the tribunal.  Again, the Howth Bill, as it might be called, is in consonance with the recommendations of the Greater Dublin Tribunal. I am not prepared at the moment to deal with the question of the taking over by the Dublin Corporation of the debt of the Howth Urban Council.  I think a sum of £57,000 was mentioned. I think it will be found that that debt is not what one would call a deadweight debt; that it was in respect of housing and other services.  I think I mentioned when that Bill was going through the House, that I did not think the Dublin Corporation were <Col N="986" /> taking over a great liability in taking over the Howth Urban District.</P>
    <P>There was a bigger reason than that why it should be taken over.  As everybody living in the city knows, Howth provides amenities for the City of Dublin.  If Howth is to be developed to the full, and these amenities are to be made available to the full, you cannot have that development with the limited valuation of that area; you cannot have Howth developed in the way it should be in order to enable the people of this city to avail to the full of the amenities in that area. Whatever way we have to get over the liability for the time being, I do not think anybody should object to taking Howth into the City of Dublin.  Howth has been described by some people as the garden of the city, and we are all acquainted with its amenities and with the advantage it is to the people of the city.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a limitation on that.  The Deputy will find that the taking of Howth into the city disposes of that aspect of it.  There will be the same time allowed for the thirsty people of Howth as for the thirsty people of Dublin; the same hours of opening will apply.  Reference was also made to town planning.  When the Town Planning Act was passed, the Greater Dublin Tribunal was not even sitting.  Provision was made that a planning body could join with an adjoining town planning body and arrange for a joint town planning area.  Even in the Town Planning Act, you had set out a definite Dublin region of Dublin, Kildare, Meath and Wicklow, which would enable the Corporation so far as town planning was concerned, to do whatever planning was necessary. As a matter of fact, the town planning experts who reported within the last few weeks, paid tribute to the assistance they received from the county council officials and the county council and urban councils concerned.  I do not think any difficulty arises in regard to town planning from the fact that the report of the Greater Dublin Tribunal has not been put into operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="987" /> Even when we brought in a Bill recently to deal with unemployment relief, provision was made by which the Dublin Corporation could go outside their area as the executing authority and arrange to carry out road schemes where there is unemployment. They can, of course, go out of their own area, for planning purposes, after consulting with the county council, if it be considered that they should have this power conferred upon them by the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is only reasonable that they should go out, especially to places which are so circumscribed that the Dublin Corporation would consider it difficult to get into them.  I think it is both to the advantage of the county council and of the Dublin Corporation that these powers are there.  If it be decided by the Oireachtas that the recommendations of the Greater Dublin Tribunal, either in part or in whole, are desirable, and that reasonable consideration should be given to them when more auspicious conditions prevail, then any Acts that have been passed in the meantime will, I think, be found to be a help rather than a hindrance.  They will be found to be more in consonance with, than running counter to, the recommendations of that tribunal.  The problem that was considered by the Greater Dublin Tribunal was a very big one.  The members of the tribunal, as we know, put a considerable amount of labour into the task they undertook. I think it is only due to the members of the tribunal, as well as to everybody interested and concerned, that their recommendations should, as they say themselves, only be operated under the most auspicious conditions, and that we should wait for those auspicious conditions so that we can give them the consideration and the thought that is really necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestEdmondsonBenso" hpid="Mr. Benson Mr. Benson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Benson</NameTxt>
      <P>Both Deputy Kelly and Deputy Belton and, to a certain extent, the Minister, took this motion, I think, as being one which aimed at getting all the recommendations in the <Col N="988" /> report of the tribunal implemented. The motion says nothing of the sort. What it does say is that the Government should make up their minds and tell the people what they propose to do.  Innumerable cases have arisen&mdash; frequently in sundry matters that came before the corporation&mdash;in which absence of knowledge of the Government's intentions with regard to this report did act as a hindrance.  There can be no question about that.</P>
      <P>The Minister seems very anxious that auspicious conditions should obtain before the Government make up their mind.  I do not know whether he is sufficiently optimistic to think that there ever will be auspicious conditions before it is necessary to appoint another tribunal to report.  I feel sure that, by the time such auspicious conditions have arrived, the general conditions would be so different from what they are to-day that the report would be out of date.  Anyway, apart from that, the Minister demands auspicious conditions to enable the Government to implement the report. He is, however, implementing, or nearly so, certain portions of the report which, to my mind, make things in some ways much more difficult than they were.  For instance, there is the position of one man having different advisers, different officials and different councils to deal with.  What is going to happen if he gets opposite advice tendered by two bodies?  It will, presumably, be for him to solve that problem, and to decide which is which. If the recommendation of a single advisory body, and of a single man, had been adopted, then there would have been at least a certain amount of consistency about his actions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister dealt with the question of town planning on the lines on which I thought he would.  The attitude of the Dublin Corporation, very largely, has been that they do not wish to use the powers which they have to take over duties from the other bodies.  I do not know whether the Minister could conceive what Deputy Belton, as a county councillor, would say to Deputy Belton, as a city councillor, if a motion were before the city council to take over the county council's town <Col N="989" /> planning powers.  I do not know that the Minister has advanced any sound reason as to why the decisions of the Government on these recommendations should not be made known.  I think it is quite possible for them to make known their decisions without proceeding to implement them.  I think the very fact that local authorities knew what it was intended to do eventually would assist them in planning their schemes now towards that end.</P>

      <P>I agree.  I move the following motions, which appear on the Order Paper in the names of Deputy Cogan and myself:&mdash;</P>
      <P>13.&mdash;That the Emergency Powers (No. 53) Order, 1940 (Amendment) Order, 1941, be and is hereby annulled.</P>
      <P>14.&mdash;That, in view of the alarming situation with regard to food, Dáil Eireann is of opinion that all difficulties and obstacles in the way of maximum food production in the present year should be at once removed and that adequate credit facilities should be made available to farmers to ensure full production; and, where farmers are incumbered with old bank debts and arrears of rates and land annuities, that these should be sealed during the emergency to enable such farms to be put into full production, and that the Tillage Order, 1941, should be amended accordingly.  Further, that steps should be taken to prevent any increase in rates on agricultural land during the emergency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="990" /> The object of the seconder of these motions and myself is more to draw attention to this whole matter than to reverse the Order that has been made.  When it became necessary to make a Tillage Order in 1939, and when that Order came up for review under circumstances similar to those under which the present amended Order is before the House, I put it to the Minister for Agriculture that his plan was wrong.  He wanted one-eighth of the arable land of the country tilled.  I put it to him that the Order could be complied with, but that still it would in no way help the food situation.  I suggested to him that the proper way to approach the problem, a very important national one, was to have a survey made of the food position for both man and beast, especially of the items of which he feared a shortage, and that he should concentrate on the production of these. That principle I advocated in regard to the Order that was made for operation in the current year.  If that had been done, I think a lot of the panic that has been created in the present cereal year would not have been created.  We had, I suppose, about 30 per cent. of our wheat requirements in 1939, and about 40 per cent. in 1940, although the Minister for Supplies said on the last day he spoke here that all the wheat we had over last year from the 1940 crop was about 35 per cent. of our requirements.</P>
    <P>Taking the present year, for which an amended order has been made, and continuing the same line of approach to this problem, I would strongly urge the annulment of that order were I speaking in September, 1940, instead of in March, 1941.  We want a supply of wheat to give us bread.  There are other things just as important as wheat, in their own place, if we are to maintain our agricultural economy and our national purchasing power.  As I analyse this problem, I consider that the kernel of it is the white loaf.  I am not now advocating a white loaf as against a brown loaf or a black loaf. I am advocating the food position, both for man and beast, that a white loaf would give us.  Whatever it costs to produce it, I would endeavour to have <Col N="991" /> it, and I would have started in September, 1940, for the current year.  The Minister for Agriculture should then have planned so that we could maintain our people and our livestock out of the produce of our own country, because we were then driven back on our own resources.  The ordinary man could see it; the Government should have been in a position to see it better.  I take the Minister's own figures for wheat.  I do not think the Minister will quarrel with me when I quote him as saying that it would take 5 per cent. of our arable land to produce an adequate wheat supply giving us a 70 per cent. extraction.  I think the Minister will accept that as common ground.  But why did not the Minister seek a 5 per cent. wheat crop? I cannot understand it.  First he said we wanted one-eighth of the arable land tilled, and then he said we wanted one-sixth of the arable land tilled.  But tilled with what?  Supposing we sowed all potatoes, or supposing we sowed all cats, where would we get a balanced ration for the nation?  The staff of life required 5 per cent. of the arable land to produce it.  Why was it not asked to produce it?  Why did not the Minister say: &ldquo;It must produce it&rdquo;? I consider that he failed; I consider that he did not grasp the life and death importance of the situation with which he was confronted.</P>
    <P>The Minister said&mdash;I read it in a speech of his and it is substantially true&mdash;that about half of our feeding stuffs were imported.  If he were planning last September, and taking a long view of the future, he should budget for home production of all our livestock feeding stuffs.  But he did not.  We know now&mdash;everybody knows; even the birds in the air know now&mdash;that we are thrown back on our own resources for feeding stuffs.  We have got to produce them out of our own land or do without them.</P>
    <P>The Minister should have made a calculation: after 5 per cent. of the arable land under wheat, we want a percentage of it under barley and oats. Then he would have made full provision, if the farmer, the fertilizer, and nature, did their share.  If they did <Col N="992" /> not, nobody could blame the Minister for not having made full provision. That was not done.  Instead, what was done?  We increased our extraction of flour; I think it is about 100 per cent. now.  Notwithstanding the fact that we have lost 50 per cent. of our feeding stuffs through not being able to import them, we are also taking away from our feeding stuffs about 180,000 tons of bran and pollard.  I would like the Minister, when he is replying, to tell the House how we are going to make up the deficit in our animal feeding stuffs.  Butter is short this winter; we are told it is because of the dry summer. How will milk and butter be produced next winter if we are short of feeding stuffs?</P>
    <P>I do not know how much oats and barley have been sown.  I do not know how much wheat has been sown.  I would like if the Minister would give us the figure of the area under wheat and the production he expects from that area, and stand over it.  There was no trouble in having that ascertained week by week.  He has the committees of agriculture under the direct control of his Department, and they could give the Minister returns even without any resort to the Guards. They could give him weekly returns of the amount of wheat sown, and the amount of land in the course of preparation. He could put his finger on statistics that would give him a substantially accurate picture of the food situation at any time.  I am sure he is not ignorant of that and that he has made full use of it.  I will ask him to tell us, as regards the essential feeding stuffs in the cereal world anyway, what acreage he expects this year&mdash;what acreage has been sown.  That refers principally to wheat.</P>
    <P>We have had a debate on the price of wheat.  I do not think the price offered by the Minister, either his original price for this year or his amended price, was a sufficient inducement to bring about the results he desired. I think the Minister knows that now.  Its repercussion on the market for feeding stuffs has been seen by the Minister for Supplies.  The Minister for Supplies stated here on another occasion that he was about to issue an <Col N="993" /> order making it an offence for anybody to use wheat for any purpose except for the milling of flour.  We have not to go far in agricultural economics until we learn that the most profit out of any crop is obtained when that crop is directly available for human food, and the quicker it is available for human food, the better profit is attached to it.</P>
    <P>Wheat is one of those agricultural products.  It has only to be milled, and it can be turned into human food in a day.  Yet the price fixed by the Minister&mdash;it was considered an adequate and a well-balanced price&mdash;was such that the Government realised the people would not cash their wheat crops directly for human food, that there was another way in which it was more profitable to use it&mdash;by feeding it&mdash;and they could thereby use it indirectly for human food.  I wonder will the Minister contradict me when I say that the cheapest food for live stock at the present time would be wheat at 50/- a barrel, while he is allowing only 40/-.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>There was no special attraction to any man to grow one acre <Col N="994" /> of wheat, except the inducement offered by the Minister.  The Taoiseach appealed to our patriotism, but we can deal with that later on.  The Minister is well aware that barley went to 42/- a barrel of 16 stones for feeding.  There was already some feeding stuff in the country, and there is some available at the moment, but this time next year, short of a miracle, we will have no foreign feeding stuffs.  I think that when the Minister fixed the price of wheat he very badly missed the mark and, if the price is too high&mdash;which I do not admit&mdash;and is reflected in the price of the loaf, then it might be good business for the Government to pay some little thing off the fixed price of wheat by way of subsidy.  If you wanted to get your supply of wheat by inducement, you should have offered an inducement that would be attractive.  If the responsibility were mine and I wanted 5 per cent. of the arable land under wheat, I would not tinker about it&mdash;I would have it.  People might say that a certain price is too high or too low, and they would not bother any further, but I would put it to them that the nation wants it, and for that reason people should grow it.  The question would be asked: &ldquo;What is the price?&rdquo; and then they would start to think furiously.</P>
      <P>The same applies to other cereal crops.  The cereal crops and beet are the important things.  Potatoes are important in their way, and other vegetables down the line are also of importance, but to feed our cattle so as to sell them in good condition, we must have suitable feeding stuffs.  If we have not got them we can sell only poor, half-starved cattle, and that is sure to react on our outside trade. The Taoiseach appealed to the farmers to do a little more.  One would think from what he said that the farmer's job in producing certain commodities was like cutting cloth&mdash;if they wanted a little more he could cut another half-yard. He did not seem to grasp that from the resources at the farmer's command, he would very soon reach the point of a diminishing return.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some Deputy made a very important contribution when he said that you can grow five acres of a crop, but you can grow three acres of the same crop and <Col N="995" /> yet produce more food.  It is not the breaking up of land that will produce the food; it is the manure you have available for the land when you break it up.  The Taoiseach should not be so liberal in his appeals to the farmers to do a little more and to do with less profit.  Very little profit they have seen for a long time.  If the farmer does with less profit, will the Taoiseach appeal to those to whom the farmer owes money, and with whom he must reckon as the seasons go on, and ask them not to be so punctual or so severe in collecting their bills?  If this appeal to patriotism is to be made, it should be made all round.  It should not be made to a section, but to the entire community, and if one class of people are to be asked to make sacrifices, sacrifices should be made all round.</P>
    <P>This point was brought home to me very strongly within the last 24 hours. A certain body was set up by Act of this House which controls a good deal of money which they want to invest. The Dublin Corporation asked them for a loan and, after long negotiation, were offered a loan for housing purposes at 4¾ per cent.  Are those people doing their bit in this emergency?  Where can 4¾ per cent. be got in a good security now?  Yet this is a Government-built institution.  We interviewed them, but appeals fell on deaf ears. It did not count that we in the Dublin Corporation looked upon the building of houses as a very good social service, and, more important, that we felt that the best service we could do the community in the present emergency was to keep people working.  We can only keep them working by making sacrifices and this Government-built institution will not make sacrifices.  They want more than can be got in the open market for money to-day&mdash;a half per cent. more than the quotation in respect of similar Dublin Corporation stock on the Dublin Stock Exchange to-day.  I again remind the Taoiseach that in this emergency one section should not be asked to make all the sacrifices.</P>

      <P>So much for the order. I am surprised that the Government have not devised machinery which, regardless of any local entanglements, will put all the arable land of the country producing food.  If I had a claim on land, if the Minister had a claim on land in the possession of somebody else, in a national emergency, that claim should not be allowed to prejudice the national necessity for production.  We know that it is in respect of some of the best land that frozen debts exist.  These frozen debts are bank debts which were advanced on big farms.  The Minister knows that it was only the big farmer who was in a position&mdash;perhaps unfortunately for himself&mdash;to contract bank debts and these people are in a position in which they always fear that the bank will pounce on them when they have a crop or when working their land.  The same applies to rates and to arrears of land annuities.</P>

    <P>I am not going to argue&mdash;it has nothing to do with the question at issue&mdash;whether or not such a person should pay bank debts or withhold them for the present, should pay annuities or withhold them, or should pay rates or withhold them.  The problem exists in respect of good land, thousands of acres, on big farms.  It is to them that the Government must look for increased food production, and nothing should be allowed to stand in the way of these farms being made to do their bit in the emergency.  The best way to do that is the way suggested in the motion, that is, by a sterilisation of these debts during the present emergency, and by letting the apparent owners of the land work their land with that guarantee of sterilisation under which they may feel assured that the sheriff will not pounce on them and that they will be allowed to produce crops.  I cannot see why the Minister did not take this matter up, or did not take any steps suggested to him in order to achieve the same objective, that is, of putting land under cultivation. If he did as is suggested here, it would perhaps in these times of emergency, when prices must harden, when people might be assured of remunerative prices for the crops they grow, <Col N="997" /> give these people a chance of paying some of their debts and thereby becoming reinstated in ownership of their lands.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in fixing the prices of agricultural produce, should, as is suggested in motion No. 14, take steps to ensure that these prices would have a real meaning, and that the prices obtained would not be reduced by increased rates or other increased charges to the producers.  Instead of dealing with the matter in a scientific way, the Minister merely looked up some statistics, saw that the arable land of the country was 10,000,000 or 12,000,000 acres, and made his order; but he should tell the House what he sought to achieve by giving that as his final consideration this year, after his S.O.S. on 31st December on the radio, followed by the S.O.S. of the Minister for Supplies of 7th January, telling us, after we had been assured that we were all right, that there was a danger of a shortage of wheat, to economise, and to sow more, and informing us that there was still time to sow winter wheat.  Will the Minister tell us why he delayed so long?</P>
    <P>It will not deter anybody from sowing wheat now to speak the truth.  He was only a fool who, in normal times, would sow winter wheat at the end of January.  Anybody who wants a crop of winter wheat must have it overground on Christmas Day.  Why were not steps taken to have it over-ground on Christms Day?  From the end of January up to now, there was hardly a day on which you could sow wheat properly.  If we were faced with famine, why were steps not taken to have wheat in the ground?  Why were not proper steps taken to have an adequate crop?  What would be adequate? On the Minister's own figure 5 per cent. of the arable land.  Even yet there is no legal obligation on any man to sow an acre of wheat.  That is trifling with a terrible situation.</P>
    <P>We were called to meetings to establish a Security Force.  The first and last line of any security is the bread basket.  Yet there is not a single Order which makes it obligatory on any owner of the 13,000,000 or <Col N="998" /> 14,000,000 acres to sow one grain of wheat.  I repeat that if the responsibility were mine, and I was satisfied that 5 per cent. of our arable land was required to give sufficient wheat, I would make it obligatory on farmers to put down 5 per cent. of their arable land in wheat, and I would compensate them for so doing.  Everybody else is compensated, and why should not they be compensated?  No appeal is made to anybody to work for nothing now.  The farmer was asked to do an impossible task.  He had not the wherewithal to do it, and the Government did not give him the necessary help.  I know that the Minister knows that barley is selling to-day for feeding at over 40/- per barrel; 40/- a barrel for barley, if its feeding value were equal to that of wheat, would be equivalent to 50/- a barrel for wheat, and the Minister fixed, as an inducement to farmers, 40/- for wheat, which is the mainstay and support of the people.  Barley, which is 16 stone against 20 for wheat, is fetching in the open market 42/-.  No wonder the Government have to make an Order that wheat is not to be used for any purpose except the production of flour.  Take the case of a farmer facing next winter with 50 or 60 milch cows.  What will he pay for feeding stuffs for these cows?  There will be no bran.  The last bran we saw was costing £15 or £16 a ton.  Wheaten meal at £30 a ton was cheaper feeding. I challenge the Minister to contradict that £30 a ton for wheaten meal is equivalent to £3 15s. 0d. a barrel for wheat.  The farmer producing wheat will be forced next winter to part with it for £2 a barrel.  What will he get at £2 which will be half as good feeding for his live stock?</P>
    <P>Take the case of the farmer who will not grow wheat but who grows oats and barley.  He will get more money for these crops than the man who will grow wheat and his land will not be robbed. The whole thing has been dealt with in a haphazard way and has not received scientific treatment.  It has not been approached in a way that would guarantee continued security for the nation. Take the case of the wife of the ordinary worker.  She wants a dozen <Col N="999" /> or 1½ dozen loaves for her household every week.  Will she not make provision to get them?  If we want the makings of <i>x</i> loaves for the people for a year, should we not sow enough wheat to produce those loaves?  We have not done so.  The Government have not made an order binding any man to grow a grain of wheat.  The same applies to every other crop.  I think that the situation has been badly and dangerously handled.  No obstacle was put in the Government's way and the country requires an explanation as to why the food position has not been handled according to the nation's requirements, the ascertainment of which was only a matter of arithmetic.</P>
    <P>No credits are available to help food production.  I should like to know from the Minister how he approached the food situation, and what guarantees he can give the country for the period that will be covered by the 1941 harvest. How does he intend treating some of the best land in the country on which there are frozen debts and the owners of which are short of credit?  The country is entitled to know, approximately, how much wheat we have sown.  I have endeavoured to find out but I cannot get a reliable figure.  I have heard people say that we have no more wheat sown this year than we had last year. I know very few who are growing as much wheat as they grew last year, and I know many who are growing less. Perhaps, in other places, they are growing more than in the places I know, but we should have an assurance from the Minister now so that the danger of famine may even yet be averted.  The Minister should have a proper survey of the food situation made.  He knows that a certain margin must be allowed for loss in the harvest and loss produced by various causes. We cannot sail too close to the wind. When the Minister has made a survey, he should commence a drive immediately, if necessary, for more cereals. That is, if he considers they are necessary for the human and live-stock population. The country will hold him responsible for any shortage of food for man or beast, and I hope he will take the necessary steps to provide against any shortage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Linehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel as regards the first motion, No. 13, that either the carrying or the rejection of it would not affect me very much, because the area I represent has always done as much tillage as is being done now under the compulsory tillage order.  It is a mixed farming area which could compete with the much-vaunted tillage counties like Carlow and Wexford in the amount of tillage done there.  As far as the general situation is concerned, up to a fortnight ago, I had some respect for the Minister for Agriculture in regard to the way he carried out his job, even though he might not agree with you when you made a point or offered a suggestion. It is only in the last month or so that he has got to the stage that if anybody offers an objection or criticism, he is supposed to be doing it insincerely and for its publicity value.  On a recent occasion the Minister accused everybody who spoke against his Supplementary Estimate of acting insincerely, and talking with his tongue in his cheek. It was the first time in my experience that the Minister lost his head completely. He went so far on that occasion as to justify his attitude by accusing people of having a motive in their minds that was only in the mind of the Minister himself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as the general situation is concerned, one of the most vital factors in the production of crops is seeds, and I say bluntly that the Minister has not done his duty as far as seeds are concerned. We imported practically all the seeds we needed from England. Since November last, when the British Government withdrew the export licences for seeds, the Minister has been questioned time and again as to what he was doing about it.  From his attitude, one would think that there was a scarcity of seeds in England. On one occasion he suggested that that was so, and Deputy Belton agreed with him.  I want to know from the Minister, if, within the last three months, he has taken any steps to examine the situation as regards the import of seeds from England.  Has he any idea whether there are seeds available in <Col N="1001" /> England that could be sent here?  Has he made any attempt to find out whether the seed merchants in England are willing to send seeds here, or whether seeds are being held there because the British Government have stopped the export licences?  I know two seed firms in England that state they have seeds which they are prepared to send to this country if somebody will negotiate with the British Government for export licences.  Their attitude is that the only people who seem to have any interest in the seed situation are the seed merchants themselves. They have been using all the influence they have to get the British Government to give them licences, and they have got no support from this side.</P>

      <P>What class of seeds is the Deputy referring to&mdash;is it grain seeds?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyLinehan" hpid="Mr. Linehan Mr. Linehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Linehan</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I am referring to turnip, mangold, and every other class of agricultural seed.  So far as grain seeds are concerned, winter wheat is finished with, and so far as spring wheat is concerned I shall leave that to the experts.  I say that there are firms in England who have vegetable seeds and who are willing to sell them to us, but they cannot get an export licence from the British Government. They would not have the seeds for sale unless there was a surplus there.  I do not think it is correct to suggest that there is no surplus of these seeds in England.  The increased tillage in England would not use up the normal surplus of seeds exported from that country, and England was a large seed-exporting country.  Surely the Minister will agree that it is unlikely that any reputable firm would state that they had seeds available for sale to this country and that they would send them across if somebody would negotiate with the British Ministry of Agriculture to get them a licence if that was not so.  If that is correct, the Minister or somebody on his behalf ought to get in touch with the British Ministry and find out if seeds are available for export to this country and if licences will be granted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wonder did the Minister do anything about that, or is it the position <Col N="1002" /> that the Minister says that nothing could be done, or that the seeds are not there?  These seed merchants, who have been doing business with people here for 30 or 35 years, have written to their customers stating the types of seeds and the quantity available, and stated that they will be only too glad to send the seeds as usual if they can get a licence to export them.  If there is a surplus of seed in England and the British Government have refused export licences, it is the duty of the Minister to do something about that. It is an extraordinary state of affairs, if there is such a surplus of seeds there, that the Minister cannot negotiate with the British Government for the release of those seeds.  If they are not going to utilise them themselves, I cannot see what use it is to the British Government to keep them there.  They might as well be producing crops over here as be hoarded in England, because they will not be any good in 12 months' time.  I do not want to mention any names, but if the Minister is interested I will tell him who the firms are.  They feel that they have been let down by the British Government. They are prepared to sell the seeds to the representatives of their customers here, but these people have made no effort to get the British Government to issue export licences.</P>
    <P>Another matter in regard to which the Minister did not do his job was manures.  I should like to know if the Minister is aware that some of the officials of his Department are telling people in the country that there will be 75 per cent. of last year's supply of artificial manures available this year. In view of what somebody knows, if an official of the Department made that statement on the instructions of the Minister it was a terrible thing to do. If some hare-brained official made it on his own account it was still worse.  The Minister did not do his job so far as manures were concerned because he allowed the manure monopolists of this country to fix their own terms this year when they got the chance.  He allowed them to alter the entire system of credit for manures, a thing that was not changed for two generations. He put the small retailers down the country in the position that they <Col N="1003" /> could not afford to give their customers the same credit facilities that they had been giving.  The Minister knows as well as I do that it was a crying scandal and a shocking blow to the agricultural community that manure merchants were allowed to say to the retailers: &ldquo;You will have to pay by the 10th of next month, and it you want another supply next month you will have to pay cash for it.&rdquo;  For generations the system was that credit was given practically up to the end of the harvest season and that if you paid cash you got a very good discount. You could pay cash or you could pay a proportion on the 1st June, a proportion on the 1st August, and pay the balance on the 1st November. That was the usual system of credit between the manure merchants and the retailers.  The retailers were able to pass that on to the small farmers. This year, however, retailers were put in the position of having to tell the farmers that they could not afford to give the manures on credit, because the manure merchants were squeezing them and they had to pay cash for it.</P>
    <P>If the Minister had any idea in his head as to the position of the small farmers who have not money in their pockets and are living from day to day and from week to week, of men who have always been regarded as credit worthy by the retailers, he would not have allowed the present position with regard to manures to develop as it did. The retailers always stood by the small farmers.  They stood by them in the times of the Land League, in good and in bad times.  They were never afraid to give them credit, but this year they had to say to those men, whom they had always regarded as credit worthy, &ldquo;We cannot afford to give you the same facilities this year because the manure merchants are not giving credit to ourselves.&rdquo;  Of all the years that we have gone through, this was the very worst year in which the Minister should have allowed a change in the credit system for manures.  It was a damnable thing to allow it.</P>
    <P>I am quite satisfied that, no matter what amount of artificial manures we may have in the country, the people <Col N="1004" /> who enjoy a monopoly of that supply are going to make enough money out of them, and if they had to wait for their money, as had been the custom in other years, it would not have been a bit of harm.  They should not have been allowed to jump on the retailers in the way they did, and to demand immediate payment in cash.  The manure merchants had been dealing with these retailers for the last 20 or 30 years. Their custom was to have one agent in every town.  They must have known well that the retailers were credit worthy.  Surely if they were credit worthy in other years, they were credit worthy this year when we have an emergency.  They ought to have been accepted as such by the manure merchants, so that they could pass on the benefit of the credit system to their customers, the same as they had always done.</P>
    <P>The Minister knows that each of our retailers will only get a certain supply of manures this year.  Assume that he gets five tons instead of his customary ten tons, the Minister for Agriculture is doing what all the other Ministers of this Government are doing&mdash;he is turning the retailer into a rationing agent. How is the retailer going to do that? If he has a supply of five tons of manures: if he has cash and credit customers, and some doubtful credit customers, what is he to do if a good customer comes in with ready money and offers to buy half a ton of artificial manures from him?  Is he to say that he will only give him two cwts., and keep the balance for some others who may ramble in in a day or two, men who may not be able to pay him for what they may require.  If the Minister wanted to have an equitable distribution of manure, he should have rationed it the same as everything else. I am certain the retailers will do the best they can.  The farmers have acted in an honourable way.  I have not heard of one who attempted to get more manures than he should get.</P>
    <P>The real crux of the position arises in this way.  In the month of March the retailer gets his quota of manures. Two lorries arrive at his door, and soon after his customers for 20 years will arrive and want to get their share of <Col N="1005" /> them.  What is the unfortunate retailer to do?  Is he to act on the principle of &ldquo;first come first served&rdquo;?  As regards flour, manure and seeds, the retail merchants of the country have acted so honourably in the present situation that they have offended 50 per cent. of their customers, because they would not sell them what they had in their shops for cash.  Instead of doing that, they tried to make an equitable distribution. That, of course, was the Government's job, but they left it to the retailers of the country.  I think it is most unfair that those men should have been put in that position by the Government&mdash;of offending their customers and running the risk of ruining their business.</P>
    <P>There is no use now in crying over spilt milk.  We all know that these artificial manures are essential for increased food production.  The manures are not available in the quantities they were in previous years. It was the Minister's job to see that the amount available was distributed equitably, and on the same credit system that obtained formerly.  The manure manufacturers should not have been allowed to insist on the payment of ready money for whatever manures they had to distribute.  At any rate, as regards seeds and manures, and the maintenance of the old credit system, all of which are vital items in the present situation, the Minister failed and let the country down.  At the moment all he is doing is issuing advertisements asking people to do this, that and the other.</P>
    <P>I was interested to hear Deputy Belton suggest to the Minister that he should have made an order directing that 5 per cent. of our arable land be put under wheat.  That might work and it might not.  A better solution, I think, would have been, if the Minister had made an area order&mdash;that is to say, that the people with good wheat growing land should grow wheat, and that those with rocky and mountain land should grow oats and barley.  In places like West Cork, Kerry, portion of my own constituency in North Cork, and along the west coast, the only crops there is a chance of growing there are oats and potatoes.  I do not <Col N="1006" /> see why the Minister should not compel people with land capable of growing wheat to grow it.  There is very little good in attempting to grow it in the areas I have referred to.  A certain amount of it can be grown.  The people there are probably growing more wheat this year than ever before, so that they will have more for the use of their own families.  I am sorry that the Minister did not appeal, earlier in this campaign, to the people with poor land to do everything possible to grow more oats and potatoes because, to my mind, these crops are as vital for the needs of the country as wheat is.  They are not as much affected by a bad summer as other crops are.</P>
    <P>Any time that we have a discussion in this House on agriculture, we seem to get into the rut of assuming that, as long as the tillage situation is all right, everything else is all right.  That is not so, because there are other items in the agricultural industry that, in this emergency, are just as important as tillage.  The dairying industry, for instance&mdash;it is in a way the forgotten man of agriculture&mdash;is as important as tillage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Linehan</NameTxt>
      <P>Why not?  I submit, Sir, with all respect that the development of any branch of agriculture in this country would be a reason for either annulling or keeping on the Tillage Order.  If the Minister does not want to discuss dairying I do not mind, but it has been the accepted principle, I think, on two motions put forward by Deputy Belton, to discuss practically every aspect of agriculture on those motions.  I submit, in any case, that as far as motion No. 14 is concerned it is perfectly in order to refer to dairying because the motion asks that all difficulties and obstacles in the way of maximum food production in the present year should be removed. If the production of butter, milk, beef, mutton or anything like that, is not as much food production as the production of wheat, potatoes, oats or barley, I do not know what to say.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1007" /> I want to put this to the Minister. Is the Minister aware that, in addition to the fact that an exceptionally dry summer last year reduced the milk supply to the creameries of this country, the situation has been so much aggravated by the fact that the price of springing cattle went so high in November of last year that a number of people in the country thought it better to cash in on their good heifers than to retain them for milk supplies, and that as far as that was concerned they were either going to the people who had milk rounds in the cities or else were going out of the country altogether? No matter what money might be made out of any branch of agriculture, does the Minister think, unless he attempts to do something about the price of milk supplied to the ordinary creameries of this country, a very valuable item of food, that he is going to keep people in milk production for the coming 12 months?</P>
    <P>The dairying industry is at least as important as any other branch of agricultural industry.  Does the Minister seriously think that the dairy farmers of this country can afford to produce milk this year and sell it to the creameries at the same price as they got last year, or that they will be in a position to keep good dairy herds and feed those cattle in an adequate manner if they get only the same price for milk?  The Minister will not be able to get it out of the heads of the farmers down the country who supply milk to the creameries that there is not some terrible discrepancy when they are getting 5d. a gallon for milk and somebody else is getting 2/- or 2/6 in the cities.  One would think it would almost pay any farmer to buy a new car and drive 100 miles into the city to supply milk.</P>
    <P>The position is that there is no inducement to the people of this country who engage in the dairying industry to keep better class cattle in their dairy herds.  The Minister knows as well as I do that it was not the drought of last year which accounted for the reduction in milk supplies all round.  It accounted for only a portion of it, and this year he will be very lucky if he <Col N="1008" /> gets anything like the same production as last year, because the people thought it better to get £24 or £25 for an in-calf heifer than to retain it on their land and chance getting 5½d. a gallon for milk afterwards.  The same thing applies to every branch of production in this country.  There is a danger that people will drift out of the dairying industry, because it will not pay them, and they will drift out of it because they will be keeping old cattle.  That is a situation which the Minister never faced up to.  If he is a dairying farmer himself, and finds that the price of milk is not profitable to him, if he has good young cattle coming along there is a great temptation to sell them and retain his older cows.</P>
    <P>Even the Minister hoped to-day that such a thing would not arise. He hoped the production of young pigs would be kept going this year, so that we would have an adequate bacon supply next year.  The Minister himself knows that the greatest drawback about the pig situation, or one of the things that is rapidly chasing people out of pig production, is the terrific uncertainty about price.  The price one day is 118/-, the next day it is down to 112/-; then it jumps to 116/-, and then it goes down with a bang to 108/-.  The farmer whose pigs are almost ready is engaged in a sort of perpetual round-the-mulberry-bush chase, hoping he will get in on the right day and not be 24 hours late when he would get 7/- or 8/- less.</P>

      <P>Is there not a fixed price?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyLinehan" hpid="Mr. Linehan Mr. Linehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Linehan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a fixed price which changes as fast as anything can change in this country.  Deputy O Briain knows that in the past fortnight the fixed price was 118/-, and inside two days, bang it came down to 112/-.  In an emergency situation, when you are asking people to produce more food, whether it is bacon, eggs, wheat or anything else, is it not the obvious thing to see that there would be no loss to anyone by fixing the price for a month?  If the Minister decides that he would be able to fix the price at 112/- for the month of <Col N="1009" /> May, say, the hardship&mdash;if there were hardship on anybody&mdash;would be on the people who have to buy the pigs at that price.  To my mind, it would be no great loss if the people who have to buy those pigs were made to bear a little of the brunt of pig production, for a while at least, because they have been getting away with it for a number of years past, and it would be no harm if they were stuck for a change.</P>
      <P>The unfortunate farmer who has his pigs ready for a particular day, discovers that the price has gone down with a bang by about 8/-.  What are his feelings when he has 30 or 40 pigs ready?  I am quite sure the Minister would not be doing any wrong if he announced to the bacon curers: &ldquo;I am going to fix the price at so much for April and so much for May, in view of the number of pigs estimated to be available for those two months.  You will have to take them at that.&rdquo; After all, at the worst, it would merely take something back out of that odd £300,000 which they got a few years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is just one other point to which I would like to refer.  I remember some time last year there was a suggestion that the Government intended to do something to relieve unemployment in the country by creating a scheme whereby the unemployed labourers would be available for farm work.  That was mentioned early last year, but it seems to have been completely forgotten ever since.  We are in an emergency situation, and we may have to take short cuts to many things, and may have to do drastic things to get over it.  Would the Minister visualise a small country area where practically all the farmers are small farmers who employ one man and a boy, and who, on account of increased tillage, would be anxious to employ more, and willing to employ more, but are not in a position to do so because they cannot afford to pay them?  In the same area, around the small towns and villages, there may be 100 or 120 men unemployed and anxious to get work, men who are willing to work for the farmers provided the jobs are available.  The farmer cannot give them that work because he cannot pay them.  A lot of those men may be on <Col N="1010" /> unemployment assistance or unemployment benefit.  In his anxiety, as I am sure he has anxiety, for the relief of unemployment, and in his anxiety to get increased production, I am surprised that the Minister has not attempted to envisage a scheme something of this nature: if a man is getting, say, 15/- a week unemployment assistance, and the standard rate of agricultural wage in that area is 35/-, he would go to work for the farmer who cannot afford to pay him 35/-, but he would still get his 15/- unemployment assistance and the farmer would pay him £1.  I know dozens of farmers who would be delighted to employ extra men but are not in a position to pay them the full wages.  The State would lose nothing by continuing to give those men their unemployment assistance.  They would be gaining a great deal.  Somebody else would be paying them the balance of their wages, those men would be working and producing food, and would merely be getting from the State what they are already getting.</P>
    <P>There might be dozens of objections to that.  It might be that workers could be badly treated or double-crossed under that scheme, but as against that, in an emergency situation I do not see, if there are men in a country area willing and anxious to work, and farmers anxious to employ them, why some scheme could not be adopted whereby the men anxious to work could be sent out to the farmers anxious to employ them and be immediately put into the work of production.</P>
    <P>I am very much afraid that for the last nine years the Minister for Agriculture has been too well treated.  Of all the Ministers in the Fianna Fáil Government, he is being let down the lightest, and, because of his engaging way, the way he smiles at one, waves his hands and promises to look into this, that and the other, he gets away with quite a lot.  The Minister seldom gets cross.  The only time, to my knowledge, that he did get cross, was when he turned to the honest men behind him and talked about Clonmel.  He has been getting away with so much for the last nine years that since this emergency started he seems to have been <Col N="1011" /> more soundly asleep than ever.  He tells us that there is no use in crying over spilt milk.  So far as the agricultural community is concerned, it is the Minister who will be crying over the spilt milk.  He has been asleep in his job for so long that, if he ever wakes up, the country will get a bigger surprise than the Dáil.</P>
    <P>It is no use for the Minister to suggest that the representatives of the people here, whether Independent, Labour, or Fine Gael, are talking insincerely. It was the Minister's last line of defence in the debate a fortnight ago that we were talking insincerely. If he has any doubt as to the position in the country as regards seeds and manures, he should walk around with the local Fianna Fáil Deputies, or go into the shops or the farmers' houses, and then he will find out whether or not our arguments are insincere. The Minister for Agriculture has built up the reputation of being a soft, decent type of man, and that is what will eventually wreck him.  The other Ministers, perhaps, are not so well liked by the decent people on this side of the House, and occasionally they get what they deserve.  But this decent, soft sort of man, the Minister for Agriculture, has been let down lightly&mdash;the decent fellow who is always doing his best to muddle through.  That is what will ruin him.</P>
    <P>I think it is a case of spare the rod and spoil the Minister.  The only thing he can do now, even in reply to a suggestion by Deputy Corry, is to say that the Deputy who makes such statements is either insincere or is out for political propaganda.  The Minister can cry propaganda as long as he likes, but, so far as seeds and manures are concerned, I invite him to go before a body of farmers, shopkeepers and labourers, and he will find that the task of explaining the position to them will not be so very easy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that Deputy Belton is taking his two motions together.  So far as the first motion is concerned, I do not know that any Deputy would ask seriously for the annulment of the Order.  A lot <Col N="1012" /> of us might have argued that the Minister would have got all the tillage he needed voluntarily from the farmers if the necessity for it had been explained properly to them, and particularly if there had been a decent inducement offered.  I may say that if the vital needs of the country were properly explained to the farmers they would have been quite willing to produce the utmost amount of cereals&mdash; all that would be necessary for the country's requirements.  Unfortunately, from Christmas until early in March, the weather was so unpropitious that it was difficult for farmers in many parts of the country to get in seeds, and I fear the harvest will fall very short of what might have been expected if the weather conditions were better.</P>
      <P>Numerous farmers in my county had special difficulties to contend with.  The nature of the land makes it perhaps more difficult to put down wheat than is the case in other counties.  The soil is heavy, and the continuous rainfall affects it very much.  Then there is the position that many farmers there have been tilling the land for the first time.  I am aware of certain farmers who were ready to put in wheat early in January.  Then there was a snowstorm followed by excessive rains. Many of them were unable to put in winter wheat, and they found it difficult to get seeds for spring wheat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to refer to the inducement that has been offered to farmers to produce cereals.  I think a reasonable inducement might have been offered without any great hardship on the rest of the community.  So far as guaranteed prices are concerned, we had a debate here in relation to the price of wheat some two weeks ago, and it is not desirable that we should go into that matter again.  The Taoiseach considered that 40/- a barrel was a very good price for wheat in all the circumstances.  He said he had taken all the care he could to get the best advice on the matter.  I do not agree that 40/- a barrel for wheat in a war situation is the very great price that some people might argue.  It would not be any great inducement to the type of farmer one would like to <Col N="1013" /> get into this tillage scheme, the farmer who has very good land.  Such a farmer would not be altogether concerned with the guaranteed price.  What would be of more importance to him would be the amount he would have to expend, when the tillage season had finished, and when he had taken two or three crops off without the land being properly manured, to get that land into good shape again.  There should be some allowance made for that.</P>
    <P>I am primarily concerned with the position of oats and barley.  I have always held there should be a guaranteed price for oats and barley as well as wheat.  The main argument against that will be that if you start guaranteeing prices you will raise the price on the community generally.  If I thought that giving a fair price to the farmer was going to mean an increase on various articles purchased by the consumer, I should hesitate to make the same arguments.  But I do not believe that and, as a farmer, I advocate the provision of a fair price for the farmers' products.  So far as a guaranteed price for oats and barley is concerned, I do not believe it would have such an effect.  For some years I have pleaded for a fixed price for oats. I have addressed myself to the Minister on many occasions, pointing out the desirability of it.  Let me take the happenings of the last two years.  In the autumn of 1938, oats was sold by the farmers for anything from 8d. to 10d. a stone.  It was bought by the merchants, that is, any of it that was for sale, and the Minister always argues that the great bulk of the oats is not for sale, but the fact is that a large portion of it is sold, if not for human consumption for sending to other parts of the country where it is used for other purposes.  The same applies to barley.  That oats, sold by the farmer at 8d. or 10d. a stone, was resold for somewhere round about three times the price before the winter was over.</P>
    <P>That fact was pointed out to the Minister early last year and the Minister was asked to take precautions to ensure that in the following autumn <Col N="1014" /> the same thing would not occur. Last autumn, we found that we got 1d. or 2d. a stone more for oats.  It was sold at 12/- or 13/- a barrel, but, later, the buyers became a little more liberal and offered 14/- a barrel; but it was sold shortly after the harvest for 12/- or 14/- a barrel, or 10d. to 1/- a stone.  The great bulk of it was bought by millers, some of whom manufactured it into food for the people, such as flaked meal and other products. That flaked meal was shortly afterwards retailed at about 4/- a stone, and I notice that, within the last six or seven weeks, the Minister allowed the manufacturers of flaked meal to charge an extra 1/- per stone because they made a case for the increase on the ground of the increased price of oats.  Who increased the price?  I believe, and I am prepared to argue, that it was the merchants who purchased the oats from the farmers and held it up.</P>
    <P>If there had been a guaranteed price for oats of a very much higher figure than that which they got from the buyers at that period, it would not have resulted in a higher price for the commodity, as oats or barley, afterwards. In fact, I think it can be argued that it would result in the opposite.  If, for instance, the Minister had, last year, persuaded the Government to guarantee a price of 20/- per barrel for oats, a price about one and a half times as great as the farmers got&mdash;1/5 or 1/6 a stone instead of 10d. or 1/- a stone&mdash;what would have happened would have been that the seller, the buyer and the country at large would have known that the price fixed for oats was 1/6, and no merchant would have ventured to charge 2/6 or 3/- for oats in a month or two.  If he had done so, I am certain the Minister for Supplies would have stepped in and stopped him.  The machinery was there to prevent his making more than an ordinary profit, and the same applies to barley.</P>
    <P>One can offer instances of the value to the public generally of guaranteed prices for certain vital articles.  Practically the only two items of food in respect of which there is not profiteering&mdash;they may be dear, but there is no <Col N="1015" /> element of excessive profiteering in the prices of them&mdash;are butter and flour or bread.  Any Deputy may argue that flour, bread and butter are too dear, but no Deputy can argue that there are excessive profits in respect of them, because the prices are controlled.  The Government have controlled the price of butter.  They have been liberal, and I pay them the tribute of saying that they have given a fairly decent price to the farmer.  It is a subsidised article for which there is a fixed price.  The public know what the price of butter is and there is no profiteering in it. Neither is there profiteering in flour or bread because everybody knows what the fixed price of wheat last year was, and knows also what the price of flour and bread is, so that there is no room for profiteering in either of these commodities, which upsets the argument of those who hold that if you guarantee prices, you must, of necessity, raise prices all round.</P>
    <P>If you set a fair price for any article the farmer produces&mdash;and I am not arguing that the price offered as an inducement to grow wheat, oats or barley must be an exorbitant price, but it must be a price that will give the farmer a fair profit and enable him to give a fair wage to his labourer&mdash; you are then offering a decent inducement to the farmer to go into production, and you are also affording, to my mind, a protection to the public against profiteering.  If anybody attempts to profiteer, there is machinery, everybody being aware of the price, in the hands of the Government to prevent it, and the ultimate effect of it will be that even if the farmer gets more, the public will have to pay less.  I hope the Minister will look into this matter before the coming harvest and prevent such things happening as happened in the last two years, like merchants or others being allowed to buy the farmers' products, whether oats or barley, at a very low price, hoard it for a few months and then sell it at three or four times the price they paid for it.</P>
    <P>With regard to manures, I do not intend to debate that question very thoroughly as Deputy Linehan and <Col N="1016" /> others have spoken on it, but I do say that whatever supplies of manures were available this year did not seem to me to be equitably distributed.  I do not know whether we are peculiar in my county, or whether we have not been as large users of artificial manures as other counties, but I have been inundated with letters from constituents asking if there is any possibility of their getting artificial manures. From inquiries I made and from statements by the Minister in the House, I was assured that farmers would get 50 per cent. of their usual supplies, but it now turns out that most of these people were not farmers who usually got supplies because they had rich land which did not require artificial manures, but after a year or two of tillage they find now that they need them, and cannot get them.  That position will be greatly aggravated after this year's harvest, and I suggest that whatever distribution is made later on, it should be such as to give every farmer a fair chance of getting a share of whatever there is to distribute.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to debate the matter of credit facilities at the moment.</P>

They have been debated many a time here and probably will be debated again.  It was mainly to the question of the production of cereals and the matter of a fair and guaranteed price that I rose to address myself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all hope that, in the coming year, there will be a greatly increased acreage of cereals.  One might hope that there would be a greater percentage of wheat but it looks as if, owing to the unfortunate weather we had in the first two months of the year, the efforts of <Col N="1017" /> all concerned will result in something short of expectations.  I hope, therefore, that there will be a great increase in the acreage of other cereals, which may be necessary for human consumption. We ought to take care that, when these crops come to be harvested, the farmers will not be exploited again by merchants and others who have the power to do so.</P>

      <P>Deputy Belton did not make clear whether he intended to pursue these motions to a division or not.  He mentioned, I think, that he only proposed his first motion for the sake of discussion and that he would not attempt to have the compulsory tillage order rescinded just now.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Belton may think it a simple matter to give figures regarding the acreage under tillage. Dublin County Committee of Agriculture may have a very good organisation. Deputy Belton says that his county committee of agriculture would be able to give figures from week to week showing the land under preparation, the amount sown with wheat and the amount under tillage in general. That could not be done in other counties. I have tried to get returns from time to time.  It takes a considerable time to get even an estimate of what has been done or is intended to be done, and I could not give a figure. All I can say is that, from reports we have received, more winter wheat would appear to be sown this year than last year, taking the country as a whole.  We have, probably, more spring wheat seed available than we had last year, so that we shall end with a bigger acreage than we had last year.  That is hardly satisfactory enough for Deputy Belton or anybody else.  What would be really satisfactory would be to be able to say with conviction that we would have about 600,000 acres of wheat for the coming year.  I am sure we are not going to have that acreage.  Consequently, there is no hope, I am afraid, that from the 1st September, 1941, for 12 months, we are going to have the white wheaten <Col N="1018" /> loaf.  I think there is a danger that we shall not have a whole wheaten loaf.  We may not have enough wheat to meet our bread requirements for the coming year, and we may have to mix some other cereal with it.  Even so, we shall have something to be thankful for if we have enough bread for the coming year by mixing another cereal. I think we shall have enough bread from the time next harvest comes in.</P>
      <P>I was very anxious when I went to the county committees of agriculture, starting with Deputy Belton's committee in County Dublin, that the farmer should do everything possible to grow more winter wheat, so that we would have a whole wheaten loaf.  Nobody can blame the farmers for what happened between the 1st January and the end of February.  It was absolutely impossible on certain types of land, and almost impossible on other types of land, to sow winter wheat.  A fair amount of winter wheat may have been got in at the end of February or during the first few days of March, but we did not sow as much as we had hoped for, and, I suppose, we must make arrangements to get in what spring wheat we can, with other cereals. Deputy Belton thinks that a higher price would have got us more wheat. I am not so sure of that.  Farmers made a great effort to grow more wheat, and failed.  They failed because of the weather, and I do not think that a higher price would have got us more wheat.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that we would have got more wheat at that time by offering a higher price.  It is quite likely that whatever spring wheat seed we have will be sown.  It is not an unlimited quantity, but, in that way, I think we will get as much wheat in on the price announced as we would have got on the price Deputy Belton had in mind.  Deputy Belton spoke a good deal about the danger that, if we paid only 40/- a barrel for wheat next harvest, wheat might be used for animal feeding stuffs.  That is on the assumption that animal feeding <Col N="1019" /> stuffs will be as dear after the harvest as they are now, or, at least, that they will be more than 2/- a stone.  I do not think that Deputy Belton has any right to assume that, because if there is a substantial increase in the amount of land under tillage this year&mdash;if there is a good deal more barley, oats and potatoes than last year&mdash;there is not much likelihood of the price of oats and barley being 2/- per stone or more immediately after the harvest.  The farmer who has a mixed crop&mdash;wheat, barley, oats and potatoes&mdash;will, if he is selling any of these as a cash crop, get more for his wheat than anything else when the harvest is over.  Deputy Belton thinks that we should have compelled farmers to grow wheat on a certain percentage of their land.</P>

      <P>He said that we were anxious to get enough wheat, and he asked why we did not go so far as to say to the farmer that he must put 5 per cent. of his arable land under wheat.  Five per cent. would probably be sufficient.  The reason is that we wanted to make the compulsory factor as small as possible.  Deputy Linehan would go so far as to say that we should take each individual farm and say to the farmer: &ldquo;Your farm is wheat-growing land; you must grow a certain percentage of wheat.&rdquo;  Then we would come to the next farmer and tell him that as his land was not wheat-growing we would not ask him to grow any wheat.  That would be a colossal job.  I do not know if Deputy Linehan thought over it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TimothyLinehan" hpid="Mr. Linehan Mr. Linehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Linehan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Even if you took counties, you would have in a wheat-growing county particular townlands or farms that would not be wheat growing, and in other counties you would have farms <Col N="1020" /> that were wheat growing.  It would be rather unfair to proceed county by county without coming down to smaller units.  I do not think it would be advisable to go so far as to compel a farmer to grow so much wheat.  Deputies know that we have relied on appeal to a great extent.  We have used the radio and Press advertising to a great extent. We have gone around to meetings and appealed to farmers to do more.</P>
      <P>We have relied to a great extent on appeals in this whole food campaign. The Compulsory Tillage Order was only brought in to make the few who might not be disposed to listen to an appeal till whether they liked it or not, as far as the law can do it.  There are reasons why the few should be made to till, because not only do we lose the amount of tillage that these people should do, but we lose a good lot also owing to the dissatisfaction amongst their neighbours, and that is nearly more important than the other.  I have heard farmers say that they were doing their duty, and more than their duty, so far as the 20 per cent. was concerned, but that So-and-so was not tilling at all and we did not seem to be getting after him.  It was rather a disturbing factor in the whole situation that certain farmers were evading tillage altogether, and it was considered necessary to make these men till in order to keep their neighbours up to the 20 per cent., or more than 20 per cent., which many of them are doing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Belton more or less criticised the Taoiseach for appealing to farmers to grow a little more.  He said the Taoiseach did not realise that farmers were doing all they could do.  That may be so, but, after all, we appealed to them in 1938 and 1939 and last year to do a little more.  I am sure the farmers worked very hard in 1938, but still they did a little more in 1939.  They also worked very hard last year, and we appealed to them to do a little more this year, and they did a little more. Practically every farmer did a little more last year than the year before; practically every farmer did a little more in 1939 than in 1938.  I do not see why the Taoiseach should not appeal to farmers to do a little more still, because <Col N="1021" /> a little more is necessary in order to be assured of essential food stuffs for the coming year.  I do not see why we should not appeal to them even on patriotic grounds.  I do not see why any objection should be made if we appeal to the farmers' patriotism to do something, because we feel that the farmers have some patriotism and Deputy Belton, I suppose, has too.</P>
    <P>The appeal, after all, is not made to the farmers alone.  Deputy Belton knows that a number of classes of people have been appealed to on patriotic grounds to join the auxiliary defence forces, the fire fighting forces, the Red Cross, and all these organisations which various people are joining to help in this emergency.  All these things I take it are being done on patriotic grounds.  We also appealed to the farmers on patriotic grounds, but we were not asking them to do the thing for nothing.  We say to the farmer that he will get a good price for his wheat and beet, and that if he wants to maintain his livestock for the coming year he must grow his own oats and barley.  In addition to that, we say to him: &ldquo;We appeal to your patriotism to see that the people are not allowed to starve, other things being equal.&rdquo; Surely we have a right to appeal to a farmer's patriotism.  Possibly every farmer will say that he has done his best.  If I went to any individual farmer and said we were very anxious to get more wheat, barley, and potatoes grown, practically every farmer would say: &ldquo;I have done all I can.&rdquo;  Deputy Belton said on the last occasion when a motion like this was being debated, that farmers in County Dublin, including himself, could do more if we gave a better price.  I do not think Deputy Belton meant that.  I am sure he would not like to admit now that he has not done his best even at the present price, or to admit that he could do more, as he did say when we debated this question before.</P>

      <P>That is very good.  With regard to frozen debts, Deputy Belton said that they were a terrible handicap on farmers.  He said that a farmer cannot till his land or stock his land, as he is afraid that his stock will be seized on him for rent or rates or something else.  These debts were contracted during the last war from 1914 to 1918, and that. was due to a too liberal handing out of credit.  That is a thing I am trying to avoid, if I can, during this war.  I do not want to see at the end of this war farmers all over the country having a millstone of debt around their necks which they are never going to pay up in peace times.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think so.  People will make that sort of statement, but when you come down to hard facts it is not so.  I admit, of course, that amongst the 250,000 farmers there will be 1,000 or 2,000 that could be cited as men who find it impossible to get <Col N="1023" /> credit.  But that does not prove any case.  I am sure that if you take, say, all the drapers in this country, you will find that some of them cannot get credit.  If you take any other class you like, you will find that some of them cannot get credit.  That does not say that there is a scarcity of credit. Taking the thing generally, there is not the very serious shortage of credit that some Deputies allege.</P>
      <P>The great source of credit for farmers always has been and, I suppose, always will be, the seed merchants. It is true that the Department has a credit scheme for implements and that the county councils have a credit scheme for seeds and manures. You might say that these are only applicable to the small men, because there is a limit to the amount that will be given, and in most cases that limit is from £12 to £16.  That means that it is only the man who is tilling five or six acres who can get very much out of that scheme, but it is very useful for the small men.  The large farmer, however, has always dealt with the seed merchant and got his credit there, and the amount given by these merchants in the aggregate is a huge sum.  I tried to get an estimate of it, but I could not succeed.  I know it runs into millions of pounds.  There is just as much given out this year, if not more, as was given out before.</P>
      <P>There is no doubt about that, because I did get at least six or seven representative men to ask a question whether they were giving more credit this year than they gave last year. They said they were, and that they were enabled to do that because the banks had arranged with them to give them more credit than last year.  I do not think this question of credit is at all as serious as some Deputies would appear to believe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Belton said that I was too late in coming along with this appeal for increased food production on the 31st December: that it would be much better if I had done so on the 1st October.  There was a serious change in the situation between the 1st October and the last day of December.  Early <Col N="1024" /> in December it became clear that there would be no more imports of grain, wheat, maize, or anything else, and that we were going to be dependent entirely on our own resources for human and animal foods from that time forward. Immediately I got to know that, I made the announcement in the Seanad that I intended to ask the Government to increase the percentage under the Tillage Order.  That was duly done.  I made the appeal that Deputy Belton referred to on the 31st December. I do not agree with him that only a fool would sow winter wheat after that date.  That is a rather parochial outlook.</P>

      <P>Not at all.  The big majority of the farmers in Munster sow their winter wheat after Christmas, and, taking them on the whole, they are as good farmers as the Leinster farmers.  I do not think they are any better, but they are as good.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is.  Therefore, I can say that I know the position fairly well.  I know that in some of the counties surrounding Dublin&mdash;Leix, Offaly and Louth, and I think in Wicklow also&mdash; practically all the wheat is sown before Christmas; but, as I have said, in Munster most of the wheat is sown after Christmas.  In Wexford it is practically all spring wheat they sow.  All those areas have their own way of doing it, but it is not foolish to sow winter wheat after Christmas.</P>
      <P>Deputy Belton devoted the greater part of his speech to the fixed price for wheat.  That question was disposed of some time ago in the Dáil, so there is no need to go into it again.  Some confusion has arisen in the course of the debate, and, therefore, I want Deputies to be clear on this point: that in this particular Tillage Order we are, of course, preparing for the year commencing on the 1st September next. We are not dealing in it with the period between now and the 1st September.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the moment there is a serious <Col N="1025" /> shortage both of bread and feeding stuffs, and the Minister for Supplies is going to have a very difficult time in trying to spread that out until the next harvest comes in.  What we are really providing for now is the position that is going to obtain here from the 1st September next for the 12 months following.</P>
    <P>Deputy Linehan talked about the seeds on the hands of British merchants. He said those merchants are writing over here to their former customers saying that they are prepared to sell them the seeds that they have, and that they assume evidently that the Irish Government and English Government are quite callous about the whole thing.  That is not the case. The Irish Government have done everything possible to get the seeds in. The English Government, on the other hand, have put an embargo on the export of certain seeds from England. We are not strong enough to compel the British Government to withdraw that.  All we can do is to reason with them, and if that fails, well and good. The decision rests with them as to whether they will let them out or not.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyLinehan" hpid="Mr. Linehan Mr. Linehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Linehan</NameTxt>
      <P>Was it ever suggested, beyond the information that I have put before the House, that those people had a surplus of seeds on hands: a surplus that would not be needed in Great Britain?  It was only this week I was told that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The British Government have refused to allow these seeds out. They say there is no surplus there.  In fact, they say there is a shortage.  I do not know whether that is true or not. They say that they have not enough seeds for themselves, and therefore cannot permit the export of seeds.  If it be proved to the British Government that they are wrong about this, and if they find when it is coming very close to the sowing season that all their own retailers are well stocked, they may then permit the export of seed, but that would be at the last minute.</P>

      <P>Some have been refused. I do not think it can be taken that what Deputy Linehan says is true. I do not want it to be taken that I am saying there is a shortage of seed in England.  On the other hand, I do not want it to be taken that there is a surplus of seed there simply because some people want to export seeds here. As we know, some people will sometimes try to do business with a foreign customer even though it may mean leaving their own country short.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  Deputy Linehan also said that some official of my Department said something to the effect that 75 per cent. of artificial manures would be available for farmers this year.  I think I said myself, at one time, that I had hopes we would get 75 per cent. of them, and that 50 per cent. had already gone out.  These officials may have been quoting me, or may have taken the cue from me, but I am not so hopeful now.  Any time that I have been asked the question in the last three or four weeks I have said that 50 per cent. had gone out, and that I am afraid there will not be another 25 per cent.  It may be in the region of 5 or 10 per cent., but that will be the outside, I am afraid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Complaint has been made here before that the manure manufacturers and distributors&mdash;they are really the same people&mdash;have altered their system of accounts, or altered their terms this year.  I do not think that is true.  They <Col N="1027" /> have always distributed manures here on the basis of cash in, I think, 14 days.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyLinehan" hpid="Mr. Linehan Mr. Linehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Linehan</NameTxt>
      <P>May I say that what I said earlier about the variation in the credit system this year as compared with last year, so far as these manure manufacturers are concerned, was based on a personal experience of my own?  I think there are other members of the House who can bear me out in this: that two of the biggest manufacturers we have had a sliding credit system running up to November which they altered this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to get more particulars about that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyLinehan" hpid="Mr. Linehan Mr. Linehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Linehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will give them to the Minister.  You got a great discount for cash in 14 days.  If you did not choose to pay cash you could pay in instalments practically up to the end of the harvesting season on the very same terms as you were giving to your own retail customers.  That is my personal experience; it is not hearsay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to dispute that with the Deputy, but I understood that the distributors, in sending out manure to the retailers, invoiced it in the very same way as they have always invoiced it&mdash;cash in 14 days.  They may be compelled&mdash;I am using that word &ldquo;compelled&rdquo;&mdash;to collect their accounts a bit more quickly than they did previously. Every importer of raw materials is in the same position.</P>
      <P>As Deputies know, for some time back&mdash;for the last 12 months or so&mdash; it was not a case of cash on delivery; the importers had to send cash with the order, and I suppose they were hard put to it to keep things going when they were compelled to trade in that way.  However, I take it that the Deputy is right when he quotes from his own experience; he knows what he is talking about.  I suppose then that things are more stringent than they were in previous years, and as the Deputy says that makes it harder for the retailer to give good terms to his farmer customers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyLinehan" hpid="Mr. Linehan Mr. Linehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Linehan</NameTxt>
      <P>The real point is that there is a number of retailers in the <Col N="1028" /> country who may be able to get credit from the bank to meet that situation, but there is also a number who are not able to get it.  That is where the real difficulty comes in.  There is nothing to close the gap between the manure manufacturer and the farmer who cannot pay cash.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The same thing applies with regard to the gap between the retailer and the farmer.  We are trying to get, and we thought we had succeeded in getting, the distributors to give the same terms to the retailers, and the retailers to give the same terms to the farmers.  We thought that was working fairly smoothly, but Deputy Davin, for instance, gave me a case where that did not operate.  That was a case where cash was asked for, I think, in 14 days. In previous years that was allowed to run on; bills were sent out, but it was allowed to run on, and the last part of it was not paid until after the harvest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>The case I quoted for the Minister was a case where cash was demanded on the day of delivery.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There again, looking at the invoices for both years, they were exactly the same.  The only difference was they did not press so hard for payment last year but did press this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyLinehan" hpid="Mr. Linehan Mr. Linehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Linehan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister would want to understand the business dealings there to see the difference.  Any firm sending out goods will send an invoice showing the cash price in so many days.  What the credit arrangement with the farmer will be will be an entirely different matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is true.  Deputy Linehan, referring to the distribution of manure, said, I think, that I was unfair to the retailers; he thought the Department of Agriculture should have done this rationing of manure themselves, instead of asking the retailers to do it.  On the other hand, he said that the retailers had acted most honourably in the distribution of manures. <Col N="1029" /> After all, if the retailers have acted really honourably in this distribution, we did well to ask them to do it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyLinehan" hpid="Mr. Linehan Mr. Linehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Linehan</NameTxt>
      <P>But at great hardship to themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It may have created a bit of hardship for them, but, after all, a lot of people have to put up with a bit of hardship at a time like this, and if they are able to keep all their customers, that is all right.  I do not at all agree with Deputy Linehan when he talks about asking people in the poorer areas, the mountain areas and so on, to grow more oats and potatoes and leave the good areas to grow wheat. I am not disagreeing with that part of it, because what I have done as far as I could was to say to the farmer: &ldquo;Grow whatever you think best.&rdquo;  I appealed to the farmers to grow as much wheat as they could for sale, because we want it in the towns, but after that to grow whatever they thought best.  But I do not agree with Deputy Linehan that a bad summer will not affect oats and potatoes as much as other crops.  As a matter of fact, I think the farmer who has experience of saving cereal crops during a very wet harvest will say he had more difficulty with oats than with wheat.  Barley may be more difficult still.  Wheat is the easiest crop of the season to save in such a bad year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think there was any statement made last year that the unemployed would be absorbed into productive agriculture.  I did make a statement last year on two or three occasions that I hoped to bring in some sort of improvements scheme.  That was brought in&mdash;the farm improvements scheme.  It has not operated to any great extent this year, but I hope it will be operated on a much bigger scale next year.  I do not think it is necessary to deal with the charge that I was asleep, because I think that everything that could have been done was done.  For instance, let us take the manure situation.  In the ordinary way manufacturers of phosphatic manures did not go to any great trouble to import the raw materials until towards the end of summer.  Last <Col N="1030" /> year, on the other hand, we had consultations, and they commenced to import immediately the sowing season was finished.  Were it not for that we would have very little manures in the country; the greater part of the manure now being used was brought in before the time at which it was ordinarily imported in other years. Those things have all been attended to as well as they possibly could be.</P>
    <P>Take the question which is agitating the minds of farmers all over the country, and which was raised by Deputy Bennett, that is, the price of oats and barley.  That is the question raised most often by the farmers when I meet them in the country.  They do not find any difficulty with the wheat or beet prices.  They do talk about the scarcity of manures, but when the matter is explained to them they say: &ldquo;Well, we must do the best we can.&rdquo; The matter which they do raise is this: that they want to see a price fixed for oats, barley and potatoes, so that, as they say, they will not be let down this year as they were last year and the year before.  It is true, as Deputy Bennett said, that in the autumn of 1939 oats was sold for 8d. or 10d. a stone, and afterwards realised, I think he said, two or three times that amount.  I am not sure about the figures.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that oats was sold at a low price in the autumn of 1939, and that in the spring of 1940 it realised a very much higher price.  But is Deputy Bennett sure of his ground when he says that the merchants made a big profit?  Deputy Bennett must remember that Deputy Hughes, for instance, last summer, I think, was of opinion that those merchants had lost a lot of money.  Deputy Hughes urged that those merchants should be allowed to export oats, or that they should get some sort of guarantee to get rid of that oats at a decent price.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>What I suggested was that, as they were denied the right to export, they were entitled to a guaranteed price; in other words, that individuals should not be asked to finance a scheme to supply food for the nation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was going to deal with last year.  After last harvest oats was sold for about 14/-a barrel, or even as low as 12/- a barrel.  As Deputy Bennett said, quite truly, that oats went on to the maize miller.  There were individual buyers of oats, there is no doubt, who bought oats as low as 12/- or 14/- a barrel, kept it over, and got twice or more than twice that amount last month, or are getting it now.</P>
      <P>But the great bulk of the oats bought at the low price last September went to the maize miller, and it was sold by him to pig feeders in the mixture at the ruling margin, whatever it was. What made the big difference in the price was this: that when it became plain that no more maize was coming in, the maize millers got to know that quickly and they sent very urgent messages to the oats and barley buyers to purchase as much oats and barley as possible.  The buyers went out precipitately to the farmers, and then the farmers put up the prices or held on to their supplies.  The great bulk of the oats and barley bought at low prices from the farmers was passed on before the high prices came into operation. No doubt some was held over by the merchants with the object of making a profit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said he did not hear any adverse criticism of the price of wheat, though he did about <Col N="1032" /> oats.  I quite agree.  He did not hear adverse criticism about wheat prices for this reason, that the farmer does not mention anything to you or to me; he knows what he will get for his wheat, but he does not know what he should get for oats.  It is only when he finds out afterwards that he has been mulcted, that he grumbles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The price of oats is now very much higher.  It is an extremely difficult matter to adjust.  Deputy Bennett talked about the Minister for Supplies permitting another 1/- a stone on oat meal.  The Minister may have been in the position that he had to allow it.  If an individual oat miller came along and proved he was buying oats at the present price, he might have been entitled to the 1/-. There are others who bought oats at a lower price and held it in store.  It is difficult to fix a price for oat meal or seed oats.  If the position remains as it is, and if there is no more maize coming in, we will be better able to fix prices after the next harvest.  I would not like to announce any prices now, because it would be very hard to fix them.  It will be easier to fix prices when the next harvest comes along and we will see that the farmer gets a fair part of what eventually the consumer will pay.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as motion No. 13 is concerned, it is not the intention of the proposer or myself to press it. Our object in putting it on the Order Paper was simply to ensure that there would be a discussion of the difficulties under which farmers labour in carrying out the compulsory tillage order. The farmers are a patriotic body of citizens and they are prepared to submit to an order which obliges them to put a certain percentage of their land under cultivation, but they have a right to insist upon a reasonable return for their labour and their expenditure of capital, and they are entitled to see that the obstacles in the way of carrying out this order are, as far as possible, removed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The obstacles are numerous.  We <Col N="1034" /> have a position in regard to artificial manures in which only half the amount available last year will be available this year.  The difficulties created for farmers are very great.  Numerous complaints have been made to me that farmers cannot get one-third of their normal supply of manures.  Complaints have been made by beet growers who cannot get more than 4 cwts. of artificial manures per acre, whereas the normal quantity is 9 cwts.  That shows some of the difficulties under which farmers labour and the need for taking whatever steps may be necessary to ensure that the farmers will get a reasonable return.</P>
    <P>With regard to wheat, very little can now be done to increase the acreage.  Farmers who can obtain spring wheat at a reasonable or, if you like, an unreasonable price, will attempt to get it into the land as soon as possible.  I am not quite satisfied with the explanations of the Minister in regard to oats and barley last year. He said that certain quantities of oats were bought at 11/- and 12/- and sold subsequently at three times that amount.  He said that practically the entire oat crop was bought at that price.  As a matter of fact, 90 per cent. of the farmers who grew oats as a cash crop disposed of the crop in September and October, immediately after threshing, and, therefore, that crop passed into the hands of merchants and millers, and whatever price has been obtained for it since represents a profit at the expense of the farmers.</P>
    <P>The fact that some farmers may have held their oats until a month or so ago, or until the present time, does not alter the fact that the merchants have made excessive profits and it does not enable the Minister to get away with the explanation that there has been no real profiteering in regard to oats.  I think it is very desirable in the coming year that if the Minister does not consider it wise to fix a price for oats and barley he will, at least, take such steps as may be necessary to ensure that the price will not fall below an economic level, as it did last year, and he should be prepared to go so far as to purchase surplus oats and barley in the event of such a state of <Col N="1035" /> affairs occurring.  I agree with the Minister that, from all the indications at present, it is not likely to occur, but nobody can forecast the future, and because nobody can forecast the future, it is the duty of the Minister to ensure that the farmer will not be compelled to sell his oats and barley at an uneconomic price next year.  He can do that if the Department are prepared to compete with merchants in the purchase of the surplus crop.  Justice demands that that should be done, having regard to the fact that farmers are compelled to comply with the Compulsory Tillage Order.</P>
    <P>The second motion requests that obstacles which are preventing farmers from extending their acreage under tillage should, so far as possible, be removed.  These obstacles are debts which have accumulated on many farmers for a number of years, and particularly debts which were incurred during the last war.  The Minister has said, rightly, that he does not desire that there should be any excessive borrowing during the present war, as was the case during the last war.  Everybody would advocate that, and, therefore, if credit facilities are to be provided by the Government, or under Government auspices, they should not be such as would increase debts upon farms.  They should be of two kinds&mdash; short term credits which would enable farmers to increase their tillage production, and long term credits for the liquidation of old debts and the settling of frozen debts with the banks.  These two forms of credit are urgently needed, and they require the immediate attention of the Government.</P>
    <P>The credit facilities at present provided by the Agricultural Credit Corporation and by the local authorities under the Seeds and Fertilisers Acts are not sufficient.  The credits for seeds and fertilisers provided by local authorities have this great disadvantage, that the finances of local authorities are so limited that local councils are forced to place the utmost restrictions upon any credit they give.  They generally require two solvent securities in nearly all cases in which loans are made to farmers, and everybody knows how difficult it is to secure two solvent <Col N="1036" /> securities for such loans.  We must remember that we are facing a very big crisis and in the midst of a very serious emergency, and that there is need for a bigger credit scheme than anything visualised by the Agricultural Credit Corporation at present, or by the Seeds and Fertilisers Acts.</P>
    <P>Years ago, when it was decided to introduce legislation for the purchase of the landlords' interest in the country credit facilities were made available to farmers.  At that time, there was no question of each farmer being compelled to bring in two solvent securities to guarantee repayment of the money advanced.  The money advanced for land purchase was advanced on the security of the farmer's land.  It ran into an enormous amount of money for the whole country, and yet, until political agitation arose, or was started by the Fianna Fáil Party ten or 15 years ago, there was never any question as to the payment of land annuities. As a matter of fact, land annuities were paid regularly and punctually, and we can always rest assured that if the farmer is given a fair chance he will, in his own interest, and in the national interest, repay money advanced. Therefore, the need at present is for far-reaching credit facilities, which must be provided by the State, because no banking institution, out to make profits, is prepared to finance agriculture to the extent required at present.  The State must come to the rescue of the farmer and provide the necessary capital.  The farmer, then, in the national interest, will provide the food the nation requires.</P>
    <P>The House is asked in this motion also to consider the question of funding arrears of land annuities and rates.  I know that the Government's objection to the funding of arrears is that arrears of land annuities were funded in 1923, and again in 1933, and that if it is understood that arrears are to be funded every nine or ten years, people will give up paying annuities altogether. I know that that is a very strong objection, but at least under the credit facilities which I have suggested, the State, through the Credit Corporation or some other financial corporation which they might set up, should be <Col N="1037" /> prepared to advance money at a low rate of interest to wipe out these arrears and to let those farmers at present in arrears start with a clean sheet, so that this millstone around the farmers' necks, which is creating great difficulties for local authorities and for the Land Commission, would for all time be removed.</P>
    <P>I think the farmers are making a reasonable effort to meet all the demands which are being made upon them by the Government, and having regard to the difficulties which farmers are experiencing in meeting those demands, a reasonable offer, a reasonable gesture, should be made to them, both in regard to arrears of land annuities and rates and to credit facilities generally.  The Taoiseach will realise that whatever difficulties farmers have been labouring under up to a month ago, those difficulties have all been greatly intensified by the fact that the sale of livestock is at a standstill, and, for that reason, he should be specially generous in regard to credit facilities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, in connection with the wheat position, we have the period from now until next harvest, which is surely sufficient for the Department of Agriculture to make up its mind definitely that there will not be the same gambling with the bread of the poor as has gone on during the past four or five months.  If the farmers are to produce wheat at 40/- per barrel, that wheat should go direct to the miller at 40/-, and there should not be any middlemen profiteers allowed. The Minister has said that he intends to take care that the farmers will not have much chance to borrow.  Steps should be taken to secure that others will not be permitted to profiteer at the expense of the farmer.  I say, definitely, that if we had had a credit scheme for seed-wheat last September, we would have at least 100,000 acres more wheat growing in the country today. I say that without fear of contradiction because I know the circumstances. That credit scheme for seed-wheat would have gone through were it not for the anxiety to protect a section of the community who deserve <Col N="1038" /> no protection from this House or anybody else&mdash;men who are able to turn over 8/3 a barrel profit on what they purchase from the farmers.  When we discussed wheat here some time ago, Deputy Morrissey interrupted me to tell me that the price per barrel of seed-wheat in Tipperary was 45/-.  The same wheat jumped to 65/- and, a fortnight later, to 70/- I wonder if, when the farmers' price of 40/- was being fixed, those who fixed the price knew that the farmer would have to pay up to 70/- for the seed which was being sold freely at from 40/- to 45/-.  That makes a difference.</P>
      <P>I can see no obstacle in the way of the farmer getting his seed wheat on credit direct from the miller on a guarantee that, when he hands in his crop to the miller, the price of his seed will be deducted from his cheque. That would do away with the gambling that has been going on in seed wheat this year.  It would be an incentive to the agricultural community to grow wheat before any other crop. They would say that they could have the seed on credit at any rate.  Instead of that we have a position in which everybody can make money out of the farmer's crop except the farmer. I do not know how much wheat will be sown this year, but I would say that the farmer who does not provide, in the first place, for his own seed for the coming year, and in the second place for his own family, is an idiot.</P>

      <P>Would it?  If wheat is to be taken from the threshing mill, winnowed, and sold for 37/6, and if, two months afterwards, it is re-sold at 65/- or 70/-, the position is very unsatisfactory for the farmer.  The gentleman who got it at 37/6 made a lot more out of it than the farmer who had the trouble of growing and harvesting it.  I should like to get that point established&mdash;that the middlemen will get the road this year and that profiteering will stop.  As regards the proposals in the tail-end of this motion, I do not think they count.  The <Col N="1039" /> down-and-out farmers, as we may call them, would, if they had any credit facilities for seed wheat, go out and sow it.  I know a lot of them.  I do not know what sort of county council Deputy Cogan has.  In Cork we grow one-fifth of the whole wheat crop, and only little bits are grown here and there elsewhere.  The facilities Cork County Council are giving would enable a man to grow about 18 acres of grain.</P>

As I say, 95 per cent. of the oats last year was bought at from £7 to £8 per ton, and is now being sold back to the farmers by the merchants from £1 per cwt. up. That kind of thing must stop.  I do not know what means will be adopted to stop it, but we are long enough talking about it.  My advice to the farmer is (1) to keep sufficient of every class of seed for himself, and (2) to keep enough to feed himself and his family.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>It would appear an extraordinary statement, and to many a misrepresentation of the facts if one suggested that this country, which normally exports over 50 per cent. of its agricultural production, was threatened with hunger.  But this is the first time in recent history, and under a national Government, that this country has become the focal point of an intensive blockade, that it has been threatened not only from a defence point of view, but from an economic and food supply point of view as well. Listening to this debate, I asked myself how many of us really appreciate the critical position this country is facing at the present time, when we have to make up a deficit of approximately 300,000 tons of wheat, 450,000 tons of maize, and 60,000 tons of concentrated food if we are to feed our own people, and carry the number of live stock that we normally carry.  How are we to do that, or what is the best method of approach?  That is a matter that this House should concern itself about more than anything else.  To my mind, there has been no proper attempt made by the Government to provide an effective food plan for the coming year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I come from an area that has produced beet for a number of years, and I ask&mdash;is it good policy in the national interest to go in for 100 per cent. of our sugar requirements by the production of sugar beet, facing existing circumstances, and the shortage of an almost essential raw material, namely, artificial manure?  I would remind Deputies that beet is a crop that requires an intensive dressing of artificial manure.  In fact, if we are not in a position to give it that intensive dressing, there will be a 75 per cent. failure or more, no matter what sort of land it is grown on.  We have the Sugar Company appealing for a very extended acreage under sugar beet, and ignoring the very pertinent situation which is <Col N="1042" /> present to the mind of any man conversant with the position&mdash;that there is a serious shortage of artificial manure. The Sugar Company entered into contracts with people all over the country to produce an acreage that would give us 100 per cent. of our requirements in sugar.</P>
    <P>To-day the position is that contracts are being slung back wholesale in the four factory areas for want of artificial manure.  I do not know that I regret that, because at the present time there could be more essential food produced for our people than the food we will get through the medium of sugar beet. I say that at the risk of offending many of my own constituents.  But I think it is my duty to say that, because we cannot think for individuals or for sectional interests at present; we must think for the nation and for our people as a whole.</P>
    <P>Any man who has surveyed the wheat position will agree that we will fall considerably short of our expectations, and that we will not produce anything like what we anticipated.  Last year we grew 305,000 acres.  If you add 100,000 acres to that, that would be approximately what you will get in wheat this year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is more than you will have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is an outside figure.  That would be 400,000 acres. That means that we will fall short of our requirements by approximately 200,000 tons or more, because with the shortage of artificial manure and the land you will bring under wheat that is unsuitable for wheat production because it has not been turned up or properly aerated or because the fitness of the soil is not as it ought to be, there is bound to be a steep fall in yield and it is inevitable that the yield from wheat will fall very short of one ton per acre next year.  Suppose we take an outside figure of 400,000 acres of wheat.  That will not give us a yield of anything like 400,000 tons.  What is the best substitute for wheat?  We are now getting to the end of the sowing season.  It is too late for sowing winter wheat.  There is only a limited stock <Col N="1043" /> of spring seed wheat available, with the result that there is going to be a shortage there.</P>
      <P>I suggested before, and I do so again, that the potato crop ought to be cultivated more extensively in the coming year.  It is not, I think, sufficient for the Minister or the Government to appeal to the farmers, in advertisements, to increase the acreage under potatoes.  There is no use in talking about the farmers' patriotism.  They are as patriotic a section of the community as any other section&mdash;I think no one can deny that&mdash;but they have to meet their ordinary daily and weekly obligations.  They have to plan their crops, from the financial aspect, so as to try to balance their budget at the end of the year.  The bulk of them find it hard to do that, while many of them are unable to do it.  I am satisfied that an appeal of that sort is not sufficient, and that it would be good national policy for the Government to fix, not only a guaranteed price, but an attractive price for potatoes.  That has been done by the British Government and by the Northern Ireland Government.  The latter fixed a very high price for potatoes last year, and that ensured for the people in that area a plentiful supply of very fine food.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another point with regard to the growing of potatoes is this: that at the present time the British Government are carrying out research work with the object of making potatoes into flour.  I believe there is every hope and prospect of their being able to make a success of that.  If we take steps to provide ourselves with an adequate supply of the raw materials, then we can make use of the results of their experiments.  It is almost certain that they will discover some method of making potatoes into flour or into some flour substitute.  Therefore, I suggest that the present is the opportune time to fix a guaranteed and attractive price for potatoes.  If that had been done earlier it might have had the result of inducing people to grow potatoes where they ought to grow wheat.  Should we fall short in our wheat requirements a potato crop <Col N="1044" /> is the best substitute we can have for wheat.  It will produce more food than any other crop.  In regard to this, the Government have not gone far enough at all.  It is not enough simply to make an appeal for the growing of more potatoes.  We should go the full distance and say to the farmer: &ldquo;Here is a guaranteed price of £8 a ton&rdquo;, or whatever the price may be that is fixed. That will get the crop grown.  It has to be remembered that there is an enormous deficiency to be made good, and it is not going to be made good unless something, such as I suggest, is done.  The Government must ensure that, at all costs, the food will be there when required.  If people can get a good meal of potatoes and milk they will not die of hunger.</P>
    <P>If the present position with regard to the pig industry continues, then in six months' time we will be scarcely able to supply our own requirements in bacon.  Sows are being fattened off all over the country, because there is no food for them.  I know big pig breeders who had been accustomed to keep 20, 30 or 40 sows, and at the present time all those sows are in the feeding yards and are being fattened off.  A man who normally kept 20 or 25 sows told me a short time ago that he was fattening off all his sows with the exception of one or two.  I said to him that was a very serious thing to do.  His reply was that he had no alternative, as he could not get food for them.  He is a man who has been in pigs in a big way for years.  On that question, if we had a surplus of potatoes over and above what we require for human consumption, we would then be in a position to breed pigs.  Normally, we take a census of production about the 1st June. I want to suggest to the Minister that this year it should be taken in mid-April. The farmer will then be able to tell what acreage he has put in under certain crops, or if he has not the crops in, what acreage he proposes to put under certain crops.  I suggest that this census should be taken immediately by the statistics branch of the Department of Industry and Commerce. That branch of the Department would then be in a position to say what percentage of our production could be <Col N="1045" /> set aside for human consumption and what percentage of it for the feeding of livestock.</P>
    <P>That is very important, I think, in view of the announcement which appears in this evening's newspapers from the British Minister of Agriculture. His statement was to the effect that an appreciable reduction in Britain's present numbers of livestock was essential because of reduced supplies of feeding material.  He went on to say: &ldquo;Even when Eire becomes free again from the foot-and-mouth disease, we shall have to restrict severely the imports of stores from that country.&rdquo;  We have, therefore, to bear in mind that we are going to be left with an excessive number of stores, as the people on the other side will only take the finished article from us.  It has, of course, to be remembered that we have a restricted number of acres available for the grazing of cattle to-day, due to the increased area of land under cultivation.  I suggest to the Minister that he should get the census of production taken next month for the reasons I have already indicated.  If the Minister sees that there is no prospect of our getting consignments of raw materials for the feeding of animals from overseas, and that the calculated production of food will not be sufficient to carry our present stocks, he should say to pig breeders that it would be good national policy to reduce their stock of sows to the calculated number that we will be able to feed.</P>
    <P>In other words, it would be bad policy to encourage men to go on blindly breeding and producing animals, and find later that we had not sufficient food to feed them.  Let us come to a determination now as to the number of animals which we can carry.  We can only do that by making an estimate of what our production is likely to be from the area of land under cultivation. The sooner that information is made available the sooner we can make our plans to carry through next year. I think this work should be undertaken at once by the Statistics Branch of the Department of Industry and Commerce.  It is a branch of the Department which does its work in an <Col N="1046" /> excellent manner.  There is a vast amount of information available there to Deputies who are anxious to get that information.  They know their job well, and do their job most efficiently to my mind.  It is one of the most efficient branches of the whole Government. They ought to be set working on this job immediately to determine where we are, and what percentage of our production can be reasonably set aside to feed our livestock for the coming year.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made by many Deputies to this question of credit for farmers.  There appears to be a wide difference in the operation of the Seeds and Fertilisers Act in various counties. Some Deputies claim that it is doing a lot of useful work, while Deputies from other counties think that it does not by any means cover the ground that should be covered at the present time to provide credit for farmers.  I do not think it should be the work of the local authority to provide credit for people who require it.  The Minister said that the Government did not want to encourage the excessive borrowing which occurred during the last war.  I want to say to the Minister that when Deputies in this House talk about credit they are not referring to the type of credit which operated during the last war.  That could not be called credit at all; it was really an investment.  Those frozen loans were advances made by the banking institutions in this country to purchase more land at an inflated value.  Those frozen loans are a problem handed down from that time, and the problem has not yet been solved.  The sooner those frozen loans are cleared the better not only from the point of view of the farmers but from the point of view of the banking institutions.  The best way to solve the problem is to set up a commission to go into the merits of each individual loan advanced.  Remember, those loans were advanced at the peak point of inflation, and the farmer was expected to face his liability in that matter during an abnormally low period, when deflation had occurred, and when, in fact, the world was passing through a post-war period of depression.  Of course, many of <Col N="1047" /> them collapsed under the burden and were not able to meet it at all.</P>
    <P>A commission should be set up to deal with each case on its merits; to ascertain what would be a fair amount for the farmer to pay in the circumstances; to assess what would be a fair and reasonable amount between both parties, and to fix an amount, spread over a period of years, that the farmer would be able to meet.  I think the banking institutions would be very glad to have that done, because at the present time on almost all those frozen loans they are collecting nothing. They look on them as a bad debt which they will never recover, and anything they would be able to collect by such an arrangement as I suggest would be more or less a windfall from their point of view.  When we talk about credit then, we do not talk about that kind of loan at all, because that was an investment for the banks, and if the banks lost money it is their own responsibility.  They should not have made advances in cases where there was no possible hope of collecting the money.  When we talk about credit, we talk about credit for restocking holdings; we talk about credit facilities for farmers to carry on their normal occupations, to buy seeds and manures and that sort of thing.  There should be some sort of chattel mortgage arrangement made by the Government, and it should be a first charge.  Where a man is prepared to grant those credit facilities his charge should rank as a first charge on the crop or on the lands as the case may be.</P>
    <P>Deputies have referred to the question of seed wheat, and to the seed wheat ramp.  There has been a seed wheat ramp here, and the Minister is not free from blame in that regard.  It has been suggested to the Minister that he licensed a number of men to assemble seed wheat last autumn, and he was very careful to fix the price that the farmer got.  He left the farmer no gamble at all; he fixed the price at 37/-.</P>

      <P>When the Minister said that, why did he not go further and say, &ldquo;I will fix the price at which that can be sold back to the farmer at 45/-&rdquo;?</P>

      <P>That is another point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a point discussed by several Deputies-that the Minister had a basis there for fixing a price and he did not use it.  He was advised from his own benches time and time again; he was advised by Deputy Corry to-night, and on several occasions previously I listened to Deputy Corry saying to the Minister that he was standing over this ramp and permitting it to happen.  The Minister cannot get away from it by saying that it was a minimum price; there is no one in this House going to swallow that.</P>
      <P>On the question of manure, a motion was put down here by Deputy Belton asking the Minister to fix the price of wheat at 50/-.  I suggested a compromise because in present circumstances, facing a dangerous situation for the country, I was of opinion that we should think of the poor man who has to buy the loaf. What happened?  A month ago, a price of £8 per ton ex-factory for superphosphates was approved.  Is there any justification whatever for a price of £8 ex-factory for superphosphates?  The price in England is £5 per ton, and the raw material has to be bought in North Africa.  It is manufactured in England.  We do the same.  I concede the point to the Minister that the British have their own boats, and the freight and transport charges on the raw material coming from Africa are much less for them, because we have to charter neutral bottoms, but it is inconceivable that that would run up the price by anything like £3 a ton.  For that reason I hold that there is no justification whatever for an ex-factory price of £8 per ton for superphosphate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In order to satisfy my mind that there was no justification for that, I put down a question to the Minister for Supplies, asking him to give us the approximate dates of the arrivals of raw rock cargo here for manufacture into superphosphates.  He would not <Col N="1050" /> give it because it was not in the national interest.  That is the simple way out Ministers have when you ask them an awkward question.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not the simple way out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked the Minister when the last cargo arrived.  I believe we did not get a cargo of rock since October.  If superphosphate could be sold at £6 5s. a ton in November, December and January, there is no reason why it should not be sold at that now if we did not get in any raw materials in the meantime, and I believe we did not get any in since last October.  I must continue to assert that until the responsible Minister gives me information that we had an arrival of rock at a later period.  I went to some trouble to satisfy myself that the ex-factory price in England is £5, or £3 a ton lower than here.  The farmer is expected to be so patriotic as to shut his eyes to that situation and do the donkey for the nation.  If the farmers are to do their work loyally and well, and I have no doubt they are fully prepared to do so, they are entitled to protection. That sort of fleecing ought not to be permitted; that sort of exploitation and robbery ought not to be permitted, and it is the duty of the Government to see that it is not.  We are trying to lead them into a realisation of the position.  Evidently they are not prepared to face it.</P>
      <P>Deputy Bennett referred to the desirability of a guaranteed price for oats and barley.  There should be some guaranteed price for those crops.  It is unfortunate that that did not operate last year.  I agree with Deputy Belton that there is not the same necessity in the coming year, because the chances are that oats and barley will exceed the price of wheat.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>It is, definitely.  If that precaution were taken last year the ramp Deputies have complained about would not have occurred.  As regards asking the farmers to step into the gap and produce the food essential for the <Col N="1051" /> nation, one thing I take exception to is that the farmers have never been consulted.  They have been treated in a vastly different fashion as compared with the industrialists, who were invited into the office of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, where an arrangement was entered into, a tariff wall built up around them, an attractive price fixed, and a monopoly given to them.  In their case there is full consultation, and all arrangements are made before they go into production. Is the unfortunate farmer ever consulted? He is not.  He is compelled to do it.  He is kicked into the job, and given a price he was never consulted about.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I want to be helpful, but apparently the Minister does not give me credit for that.  It is the duty and the responsibility of every Deputy to be helpful.  I made some suggestions that ought to be helpful. A guaranteed price ought to be fixed for potatoes in order to ensure that we will get an extended acreage, and an early census of production should be taken so that we may calculate our position from the point of view of the amount of food necessary for human consumption and available for animal use.  We can then determine our pig population for the coming year and the Minister will be in a position to tell farmers by what percentage there shall be a reduction&mdash;that is, if it is necessary to have a reduction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it can be said that every farmer here has been a canvasser and has set a good example by increasing the acreage under wheat. If it was not for the inclement weather in January and February, more winter wheat would have been sown.  It is now too late to grow winter wheat, and, as Deputy Hughes has suggested, the only alternative is to grow more potatoes.  Potatoes are the best substitute for wheat.  It is our duty to feed the people.  I think the Ministers who are responsible for supplies were asleep for a long time.  This war did not come overnight.  We found when it was too late that we had a shortage of petrol and other things that we require. I went to a merchant recently and he told me he had no artificial manure.  What is the position of the farmers engaged in the cultivation of beet?  What are they to do?  We all know that they cannot grow beet successfully without artificial manure and that in many districts they will have a poor crop of beet because they cannot get sufficient artificial manure. <Col N="1053" /> With the 50 per cent. reduction in connection with artificial manure, some farmers are being treated very badly. There are people in possession of poor, worn land, and when they approached the local merchant for a supply of artificial manure they found they could not get it.  That was a big mistake on the part of the Government.  They should have asked the merchants what quantity of artificial manure they had in stock and then they should have made arrangements to distribute it fairly amongst ordinary customers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A serious position has arisen in the county that the Minister and I have the honour to represent.  Great difficulty is being experienced in getting turnip and mangold seeds.  These seeds are the last to be sown and, if the farmers cannot get all the seeds they require, what will they put into the land?  In many cases where a farmer has good soil, well manured for a green crop, he cannot grow barley or oats on that land because it will lodge, but he could grow potatoes.  The Minister should be in a position to know how we stand in regard to seed potatoes.  There is very little use in asking farmers to plough more land if they cannot get the seed to sow in it. Perhaps the Minister will inform us how much turnip and mangold seeds he will be able to get?  I know merchants in my own county who have not one pound of mangold or turnip seed. I was talking to a local shopkeeper yesterday, and he informed me there was no hope of getting turnip or mangold seed.  In normal times that man would sell five or six cwts. of mangold seed and four or five cwts. of turnip seed every year, but he has not one pound of that type of seed in his premises to-day.  He tried everywhere and the answer he got was &ldquo;nothing doing&rdquo;, so I suggest that the Minister should get in touch with the British Minister of Agriculture, or with whomever is concerned, and see whether they have any spare turnip or mangold seeds, because now is the time to get them over.  I believe there was an expectation of getting mangold seeds from America, but are they likely to grow and mature in our soil?  If they <Col N="1054" /> are, and if they come in time, it will be all right, but we must remember that turnip and mangold seed are the last to be sown, and if the farmers cannot get seeds to sow their turnips and mangolds, there will be nothing but weeds on the land, and that will be very poor compensation for farmers who tried to increase their tillage.</P>
    <P>The pig feeder is hit very hard at the moment and I think the Minister for Supplies, or whatever other Minister is concerned, should get a sample of the stuff they are selling now for pig mixture.  I don't know what it is composed of but I think there is sawdust, yellow clay and everything else in it.  I know from experience that pigs are not thriving on it.  The only thing good about it is the price. There is another industry which is going to be hit very much, that is, the poultry industry.  I have been talking to a big number of poultry keepers and they tell me that they have to sell off their hens for want of feeding for them.  I personally feel that the Government were very slow in looking after supplies in 1939.  This war did not come overnight.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I am told that the merchants of this country could have bought all the Canadian wheat their stores could hold in 1939 at 12/- a barrel.  If my information from these merchants is correct, the Government would not give them a licence to import this wheat.  It would be very good for the people to-day if they had plenty of Canadian wheat to keep the wolf from the door and give the poor man a cheap loaf.  We were told that the Government were going to make this country self-supporting.  They build a wall round it, but that wall was built when we had peace, and the wall is still there.  My experience in going through life&mdash;and I am older than many here&mdash;is that the more you import and export, the more employment you give.  You can always produce stuff which will realise a better price across the water than at home and can always buy feeding stuffs which will come much cheaper than the price <Col N="1055" /> at which you can produce them.  If we want to give employment and to make this country prosperous, there is only one way to do it, that is, by mixed farming.  Some people may speak of ranchers, but you can ranch much more easily by growing corn than you can by rearing cattle.  The man who goes in for mixed farming gives employment all the year round, but the man who goes in for corn ranching, if he has not plenty of manure to put back on his land, gives no employment because he holds only for a year or two.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We are in a crisis, and it is not the time to tell any group that they are donkeys for any other section.  If we do not get food enough from within this country, we are not likely to get it at all.  We have to get food for our people here from the soil of this country and those who have the soil are only trustees, finally, for the community as a whole.  Those who have the land have the greatest stake in this country, and I say to them that they should pay no attention to the people who tell them they are donkeys.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The important thing for the farmers, as for every section of the country, is to get food grown for our people this year.  If they do not, we may not, as I have said, get it from anywhere.  It is said that we have cattle, and that we will not starve, but it is going to mean a serious danger to this country if the food which our people have been accustomed to, bread, cannot be got. The speaker to whom I referred, who began so well and ended so badly, pointed out that we require some 200,000 or 300,000 acres of extra cereals &mdash;wheat if we can get it&mdash;for human food.  The Minister and his officials inform us that they think we will be far short of what we expected in wheat.  If so, we must make up for it in other cereals and in potatoes, if our people are to be fed.  Not merely have our people to be fed, but, as the same speaker pointed out, we have to make up for the food for animals formerly imported here.  His estimate was some 300,000 acres for human food, to make up for the shortage of the wheat we <Col N="1057" /> cannot get from outside, and 400,000 acres to make up for the animal foods which formerly came from outside. Perhaps that is slightly above what is absolutely necessary, but we shall want something from 500,000 to 700,000 acres of extra cultivation to give us the food which we would otherwise lack for human beings and for stock.</P>
    <P>If you do not have the food for the human beings&mdash;they will have to get it in the first instance&mdash;then the farmers will be short for their cattle and will have to kill them off, as they have had to kill them off in other countries. Consequently, these few weeks are precious to the country, and, instead of talking in a way which would discourage farmers from using the time to plant their land, everyone of us, if we appreciated our duty to the nation, should be both in public and in private urging the farmer to grow more food. Is there any doubt that he will get a reasonable price for his products in present circumstances?  Some of those who spoke suggested that we should not fix prices for certain crops.  That is a new doctrine.  The reason they do not want fixed prices is that they think the position will be such that famine prices will be paid.  We do not want that.  Remember, if we get into a situation like that, there will be a whole crop of difficulties, and the farmers, with other sections, will suffer as a result. Let every one of us, then, instead of trying by speeches here to discourage farmers, try to induce them to go farther than they would go, without inducement and encouragement, to provide the nation's food.  I spoke of the food position before, several times, and I do not want to deal with it again. I was hoping that what I had to say would be said by the Deputy who began so well.</P>
    <P>The next thing we want&mdash;again it is the rural community, in the main, who must provide it for us&mdash;is fuel.  We shall, probably, be short of coal.  We have a substitute to our hands if we go out and get the work done&mdash;if we get sufficient turf cut.  Here, again, the hours are precious, and let nobody discourage the people who are inclined <Col N="1058" /> to do that work.  We saw mention of a &ldquo;dream&rdquo; in the paper recently. Fundamentally, what is required for the realisation of that dream is co-operation amongst our people.  We do not want any new organisation in order to get that.  There are existing organisations which, if they give their will to it, can do it.  Some time ago, we asked to have parish councils set up.  They were set up largely for the purpose of doing the sort of work which this new organisation might do.  They know their own localities better than anybody here in the city knows them and better than any central group know them.  If these parish councils set about their work, as some of them have done, then we shall have the best possible type of organisation, from the rural point of view, to meet our needs&mdash;an organisation that can stand firmly on its local knowledge. I do not want to deprive the mover of the motion of the time to which he is entitled in concluding.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Then, I might mention some of the things which have been done by these parish councils.  The Tipperary branch of Muintir na Tire did very useful work in getting land and arranging for the tilling of it on the basis that those who wanted a supply of potatoes, for instance, would make available a sum of £5, in return for which they were guaranteed one-eighth of an acre of potatoes&mdash;that is to say, a ton.  Other places have carried out more or less similar schemes in regard to turf.  If we get that local initiative, we shall have our allotment schemes developed much more than they are at the present time&mdash;that is to say, if we can have local groups of that sort making land available in the neighbourhood.  Local bodies, keeping local conditions in mind, can get this work done.  Departments of State will do everything possible to assist, but we should not, at the present time, discourage local initiative or induce any group of people to believe that the Government can act all the time as a sort of fairy godmother.  They cannot <Col N="1059" /> do that.  The funds which the Government have at their disposal belong to the people.  If grants are given by the Government, the charge will come back, at some stage, on some section of the community or on the community as a whole.</P>
      <P>At present, what is most needed is local initiative, the realisation locally that there is a crisis upon us such as this nation has never had to face before and of a type which it has never had to face before.  The whole security of the nation depends upon local groups taking the advantage of any local circumstances and using them for the benefit of their own community.  In this crisis, the parish councils can play a very important part.  For instance, they can initiate a turf scheme, or some similar scheme.  Once it is known that that is done in one area, other parish councils will be inclined to adopt the scheme.  Take the Tipperary scheme. I am perfectly certain that that could be adopted in a number of other areas and that land could be put into cultivation, as a result, which would not otherwise be put into cultivation.  As regards State lands, we have seen that these lands will, as far as possible, be used for the production of food.  Everybody here should regard it as a patriotic duty in these weeks, which are of so great import to the country, to go out and encourage, in the first instance, the production of food&mdash;if you cannot have wheat, then other cereals and potatoes&mdash;and, in the second place, turf.  We require a very large increase on the amount of turf cut in past years &mdash;three or four times that amount&mdash; and there is no doubt that a reasonable price will be available for it.</P>

      <P>As the mover of the <Col N="1060" /> motion, I wish to endorse pretty well everything the Taoiseach has said.  I wonder the Government did not look for more co-operation amongst the people to whom they are appealing to produce food.  What is the position to-day, 19th March?  We are told by the Minister for Agriculture that with the rosiest expectations of a good crop and a good harvest, not only will we not have sufficient wheat to give us a white loaf, but that we shall not have sufficient wheat, without taking any offals from it, to give us a wheaten loaf. The position is terribly serious, and I agree that this is not the time to be criticising because of what has not been done.  The question is: What can we do about it now?  The position is that, when the present harvest matures, we will not only not have enough wheat to give us a white loaf, but we will not have sufficient to give us a wheaten loaf.  Is not that a correct interpretation of what the Minister said?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>We will have nothing if we lose that half.  Are we not losing close on 200,000 tons of wheat offals in the shape of bran and pollard?  Look at what was disclosed by the British Minister for Agriculture to-day as to what is confronting this country:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Mr. R.S. Hudson, British Minister for Agriculture, announced at Leicester to-day that an appreciable reduction in Britain's live stock numbers was essential because of reduced supplies of feeding material. Foot-and-mouth disease in Eire is already causing the first steps in reduction of intake, the scourge there having reached a stage that makes the import of Irish stores impossible for some time to come.  Even when Eire becomes free again, we shall have to restrict severely imports of stores from that country.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1061" /> Store cattle form the largest volume of our live stock trade and the import of them to Great Britain will be curtailed for want of feeding stuffs.  We here will have less feeding stuffs than ever we had.  What are we to do with these stores?  What will we have to sell abroad in order to buy petrol? Our external assets are frozen.  What margin have we to buy anything abroad, even if we can get it?  In bringing this motion forward, our object was not to find fault.  As practical farmers, we had a fair idea of the position, and I must say that the position is worse than I had anticipated. There is no use in saying that the brown loaf we have at present, or a loaf with a mixture of other cereals, is as good as a white loaf.  But that is not my point.  A wheaten loaf made from our own flour is a guarantee that we have grown sufficient wheat for our own use and to enable us to take 70 per cent. extraction and leave available 180,000 or 200,000 tons of bran and pollard for live stock.  That is why I think the white loaf should be our goal, if we can attain it.</P>
    <P>There is a very slender margin between us and famine for live stock, first, and perhaps for human beings. Can anything be done now?  Even if the consultative council was found to be useful, the results of its labours have not been very fruitful.  If we set any value on a consultative council, it should not meet every two months but should be in constant session, and if it is of no use it should be dispensed with.  The Taoiseach gave a wrong impression in his speech.  I hope I misinterpreted him, but it struck me that this speech was rather hostile to the farming community.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that.  He should not interpret the putting down of this motion or anything said on this side of the House as meaning that the farmers should not produce food.  The farmers are not fools; they know what is in the national interest as well as we do.  There are things a man can do in business and things he cannot do.  If he cannot afford to do a certain thing, well he cannot afford it, and the</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1062" /> Government should help him out.  The Minister said that the frozen debts of the farmers were there since the last war and he hoped that there would not be extended credit during this war to build up more frozen debts.  The frozen debts are there because of the British policy of deflating their currency which made it impossible for farmers to pay their debts.  The Irish Government should have intervened then and protected the farmers from being fleeced by that deflation policy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder will there be anything to put in the central bank as you have delayed so long about it. Why was it not established 10 or 15 years ago?  We are threatened with a shortage of human food in the shape of bread and we are looking for substitutes. We have had to raid the bran and pollard; we are taking all that away, and the Minister told us that we would probably have to raid other cereals.  Does not that prove that the plan I suggested in December, 1939, December, 1940, and to-day is the correct one?  We should make a survey of what we want and get the farmers to produce that.  No survey was made. The explanation given by the Minister as to why he would not insist on 5 per cent. of the arable land being put under wheat was that he did not want to go too far with regard to compulsion. I do not think that is a reasonable excuse.  If we wanted 5 per cent. or more of the land in wheat, 5 per cent. or more in barley, and 5 per cent. or more in oats, why not specify that and get the land of the country to produce it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister was in a position to know exactly what was wanted.  He has his statistical department to give him the figures, but I am not in a position to know, and other farmers are not in a position to know.  It was <Col N="1063" /> the Minister's responsibility, and when he took up the question of the compulsory production of food he should see that what we wanted was produced.  If a man wanted a suit of clothes he would not be satisfied with a pair of boots instead of the suit.  If he ordered a suit of clothes, a pair of boots and a hat, so that he would be fully dressed, it would not do for him just to get a coat and be left without the rest.  I suggest that the matter has not been tackled in the right way.  Is the Minister now at the 11th hour satisfied that all the spring seed wheat which is available will be sown?</P>

      <P>In order to make up the deficiency that the shortage of wheat creates in animal feeding stuffs, will the Minister even at this late hour take steps to ensure that sufficient cereals will be grown so as to provide a full supply of animal feeding stuffs?  Can he guarantee that?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister cannot guarantee that, I suggest that he should take the House into his confidence and establish an advisory council from the House.  I would compel men or conscript men to engage <Col N="1064" /> in the production of food while there is time to grow it.  We must act, and if we do not act now so as to get the food, we will be short of six months' to one and a half year's food.  Now is the time to act, so as to save the country from famine.  There should be co-operation in regard to the producing of food.  The Minister should not hesitate to say what he wants.</P>
      <P>I for one will hold the Minister responsible if there is a shortage of food either for man or beast.  He has the resources of the whole country at his disposal, and he has a willing population to co-operate with him, and he will have no excuse if there is a shortage either for the human or livestock population.  I am glad the Taoiseach is here.  I appeal to the Taoiseach to leave no stone unturned in this matter. I agree with the Taoiseach when he said that the farmers in a crisis like this only hold their land in trust under the limited ownership that an individual has.  I recognise the larger ownership that the State must have in times of emergency.  In this emergency the Taoiseach should put that larger ownership into operation, take the people into his confidence, and produce the food necessary for the human and livestock population.</P>
